"&#xa0;\nCommunities and Local Government Committee\nOral evidence:\n \nFurther review of the work of the Local Government Ombudsman\n, HC \n866\nMonday 2 December \n2013\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on \n2 December\n 2013.\nWritten evidence from witnesses:\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Government Ombudsman\nWatch the meeting\nMembers present: \nMr Clive Betts\n (Chair); \nSimon Danczuk; Mrs Mary Glindon; David Heyes; James Morris; Mark Pawsey; Chris Williamson\nQuestions \n11–68\nWitnesses:\n \nDr Jane Martin, \nChairman of the Commission for Local Administration in \nEngland\n (L\nocal Government Ombudsman\n)\n, and \nMichael King, Executive Director, Commission for Local Administration in \nEngland\n, gave evidence.\n \nQ11 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWe now move into the public session of our inquiry into the work of the Local Government Ombudsman\n.  \nOnce again, for the public record I must go through the formalities and ask members to declare their interests\n.  \nI am \na\n vice-president of the Local Government Association.\nDavid Heyes: I have two members of staff who are local councillors.\nSimon Danczuk: My wife is a local councillor, and I have three members of staff who are local councillors.\nMrs Glindon: My husband is a councillor i\nn \nNorth Tyneside\n, and I have one member of staff who serves on the council.\nChris Williamson: \nI have a couple of members of staff who are elected members.\nMark Pawsey: I have a member of staff who is a councillor.\nChair: \nThat has put us\n on the record.  \nI thank our witnesses very much for coming\n.  \nIf you could give your names and \ntell us \nwho you are for the record, that would be helpful as a start.\nDr Martin: \nI am Dr Jane Martin, the Local Government Ombudsman.\nMichael King: I am Michael King, executive director of the Local Government Ombudsman. \nQ12 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: \nThe LGO arranged for a staff survey to be conducted in November 2012, but I u\nnderstand that \nwas not made available to the public i\nn its entirety.  Can you \nexpl\nain why?\nDr Martin: O\nur staff are our absolutely greatest asset, and it is important to me that we make sure \nthat \nthe Local Government Ombudsman is a good place to work\n.  \nWe brought forward the timing of that staff survey, which was one of your recommendations, in order to get on with the work earlier than we had originally planned\n.  \nThe publication strategy for the survey was advised by independent facilitators who were running the whole exercise for us, and it was based on accepted practice\n.  \nWe shared all the\n findings with the key audience\n, namely our staff\n.  \nWe had face-to-face meetings with all staff across the organisation and shared the findings in full with them\n.  \nIndeed, we shared the finding\ns\n in full with this Committee\n,\n because you were interested in it and it was one of your recommendations\n.  \nWe were also\n, of course,\n mindful of a duty of care to all staff given the confidential nature of the exercise, and w\nanted to ensure anonymity.  W\ne did not shy away from the \nchallenges put to us and we \npublish\ned\n a p\nublic statement containing\n \nfour key messages.  \nOne was \nto reiterate the point about our dedicated staff\n.  \nThe \nsecond was that \nit be\ncame clear from the survey that \nthere was some anxiety and a lot of uncertainty about the changes\n—i\nndeed, this was as we were about to launch into probably\n one of the biggest changes made \nin the organisation\n.  \nWe also knew there was a need for greater engagement between management and staff, and much more effective leadership and management, which included reflecting on the working style and approach of the ombudsman\n.  \nI was very satisfied that the public statement we put out covered the key issues we found in the survey\n.  \nClearly, the most important thing now is to focus on what we did as a result of that.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: You mentioned \nit was accepted practice to publish only part of it\n, but\n we live in an era when data are shared around very easily electronically\n.  \nI understand that a copy was sent to LGO Watch\n.  \nWhat steps had you put in place to prevent more wide distribution of the survey, and why were they not successful?\nDr Martin: \nWe were very mindful of \nour \nduty of care to all staff to ensure that full confidentiality was assured, but we wan\nted to be open with our staff. T\nhat was the mos\nt important thing to us—\nand we were\n.  \nWe recognised that, having done that, it\n was probably quite likely that—\nQ14 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: You anticipated that \nmight happen.\nDr Martin: \nWe understood it might have been a possibility\n.  \nAll I can tell you is that we were trying to make sure we published effectively, and that was what we did.\nQ15 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: \nHave you carried out a similar survey in November 2013?\nDr Martin: W\ne are now in the process of conducting another staff survey.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: \nHow do you intend to handle that? Do you intend to learn from the lessons of last time and accept that it will be in the public domain and publish in full\n, or do you intend to keep to \nyour original strategy?\nDr Martin: \nWe have not had that discussion yet, but I would anticipate that, in the light of this, it would be stupid of us not to learn from lessons, so we will definitely consider how we might publish more widely.\nQ17 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: \nAre there any preliminary findings that \nperhaps \nyou can share with us at the moment?\nDr Martin: \nNo, absolutely not\n.  \nIt is being held again by\n an independent facilitator, and\n I am waiting to hear the results.\nMichael King: \nTh\ne survey closed on Friday.  W\ne know that at the start of the final week\n,\n 67% of our staff had already participated, so we expect a similar level of engagement this time.\nQ18 &#xa0; \nChair: \nTo make it clear for our records as well, on Friday Dr Martin and I had a conversation\n,\n and I felt it appropriate that we put the whole of the survey, with one small redaction, on the parliamentary website\n.  \nT\no make it clear, t\nhat is now available for anyone w\nho wants to see it, and \nwe all feel comfortable with that position.\nDr Martin: \nThat was an agreed position, and I completely understand.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Only two members have been\n present at mee\ntings since October last year.  I\ns the commission quorate and operating within the provisions of the Local Government Act 1974?\nDr Martin: \nIt is quorate\n.  \nYou are absolutely right to p\noint that out\n, and as chair I thought it was important to ch\neck that.  We are quorate and \nare operating effectively\n.  In terms of the 1974 Act\n, the legislation sets out that the Secretary of State should appoint one of the local commissioners, i.e. one of the local ombuds\nmen, as chair \nand one as vice-ch\nair of the commission.  Anne Seex\n is currently in post as vice-chair of the commission and has not been able to attend for 12 months, so we are de fact\no\n operating without a vice-chair.\nQ20 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nBut the meetings are still quorate.\nDr Martin: \nYes, indeed.\nQ21 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nThe external evaluator recommended that “ways should be urgently explored for the Ombudsman to be more visibly engaged as the leader of the organisation”\n.  \nSurely, if there is lack of leadership at the head of the organisation those are grounds for concern, are they not?\nDr Martin: \nYou are absolutely right that we should take that seriously\n.  \nThe external evaluation came after the staff survey which has already been refer\nred to.  It was quite clear\n that we were being challenged on the visibility of the ombudsman at that point, so it was something we already wanted to respond to.\nSince then, I have done a number of things\n.  \nFirst, particularly in response to the external evaluation, under the new leadership arrangements I now meet monthly with the executive team\n.  \nWe have delegated more responsibility down to the executive team to become a more open organisation\n.  \nI suppose that the best way to describe my role is as executive chair of the organisation, so we have monthly meetings to discuss strategy, performance and risk.\nQ22 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nBut anybody observing this will be astonished that you did not previously have monthly meetings with the executive team, will they not?\nDr Martin: \nPerhaps I can explain that we have been going through a period of change, so until the new arrangements came into place in\n about April of this year I had\n been chairing the corporate management team for probably 18 months on a regular monthly basis\n.  \nIt was a revision that was required, and we were very happy to make sure that happened\n.  \nI stress that we were very much responding to the staff survey, wanting to make sure that the role of the ombudsman was right and that \nwe gave\n our senior team and our leadership group, which consists of\n our middle managers, \ndelegated responsibility to work and help to shape the business.\nPerhap\ns I may briefly describe one further arrangement.  \nI now also chair a monthly casework policy forum with my executive directors and legal people\n.  \nI am very confident that the organisation is ge\ntting very strong, \nclear and consistent leadership from one ombudsma\nn heading up this organisation—\nnot only for the strategy in the commission but also for casework\n,\n which i\ns very important.  That \nwas on\ne of the concerns raised\n in the staff survey.\nQ23 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nWith regard to your excellent leadership, from 2011-12 to 2012-13 your salary increased from £125,000 to £130,000 to £135,000 to £140,000, so you have had a significant pay increase\n.  \nIs that not right?\nDr Martin: \nI had a pay increase of £10,000 on taking on the chairmanship.\nQ24 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nIt was an 8% pay increase.\nDr Martin: \nI have not worked it out, but I will rely on your figures.\nQ25 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nHow can you justify that?\nDr Martin: \nMy salary is substantially less than that of the previous chair\n.  \nI hope that £10,000 for the significantly increased \nresponsibility of chairing the Commission for Local A\ndministration, as well as fulfilling my duties as\n Local Government Ombudsman, will be \nseen as proportionate.\nMichael King: Beneath\n the ombudsman’s post\n,\n salaries are pegged to equivalent posts in the judiciary\n.  \nThat is how they are determined.\nQ26 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nI am curious to know why it has increased\n.  \nAccording to my notes, it has increased by\n 8%.  D\nuring these\n exceptionally difficult times\n it is unusual for any\nbody’s salary to increase.  T\nhe background is that cases during that time h\nave taken longer to complete; \nmore are going over 12 months th\nan ever before.  Staff surveys are \na dog’s dinner and\n show absolutely appalling results; and t\nhe Select Committee’s report stands before us in terms of how the organisation has been run\n.  \nWhy would a \nsalary increase be taking place?\n I do not understand it.\nDr Martin: \nI am not sure your information is quite right\n.  \nI was appointed in 2010 as the Local Governmen\nt Ombudsman.  Mick is right that\n the salaries were pegged to judicial rates\n.  \nI have had no increase since then other than the increase to which I have just referred on bein\ng confirmed as chair.  \nI hope that\n \nwhat you have seen from \nour submissions to this inquiry and also what you hear today\n demonstrates that over\n the past 12 months we have taken huge \nsteps in the right \ndirection\n.  Our productivity is better,\n w\ne are exceeding all our targets and\n we have implemented one of the\n biggest change programmes \nthe organisation has had \nin over 40\n&#xa0;\nyears\n.  \nWhile I accept that when I appeared before you last time we were cha\nllenged quite substantially, \nquite rightly, I hope I can now demonstrate that we have really made some\n changes and \nare developing and moving in the right direction.\nQ27 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nI want to ask about the independence of\n the external evaluators who were appointed.  In written evidence to us, it was suggested that, “in terms of public perception would the claim of being a fully independent external review hold more credence if all ‘auditors’ were drawn from a background of not having had any direct association with an LGO service?”  Is it not the case that all people appointed to the external evaluation team had had experience of ombudsmen schemes?  In that sense, how do you respond to the point that it really was not independent and you were appointing friends to evaluate yourself?\nDr Martin: I simply do not accept that.  The external evaluation team was appointed by the commission, and we also consulted with the chairman of the Ombudsman Association, because your recommendation was to make sure that the external evaluation took due recognition of the Ombudsman Association and its criteria.\nWe took the view that the external evaluation needed to be led by a team of people, particularly the chair, with considerable experience \nof \nand expertise in ombudsm\nanry, if I may use that word.  \nRichard Thomas, \nwho chaired it for us, was \nat the time\n also chair of the Administrative \nJustice and Tribunals Co\nuncil.  He is \nexperienced and understands \nvery well how the administrative justice landscape works.  \nWe also felt it would be help\nful to have an academic who \nknew the territory well, and we are pleased that Dr Richard Kirkham was able to participate.\nQ28 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nDr Martin, do you think they might have been too close to the territory in order to take an independent view?\nDr Martin: \nThat was not the view we took\n.  \nWe understood that it was for the commission to appoint the external evaluation team, and that was what we did\n.  \nWe felt it was important to have a peer review from another colleague ombudsman, hence the Scottish ombudsman joined the team\n.  \nWe had a clear principle as to the kind of team we felt would be most appropriate.\nQ29 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nDid you know these individuals personally?\n \n Had you had extensive contact with these individuals before they were appointed as independent?\nDr Martin: I do not think I had\n.\nQ30 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: If an \nombudsman is to be independent of local government, what do you think their career background needs to be?\nDr Martin: \nThat is a very good question, and the external evaluators themselves made \nthat point.  They suggested that in future \nit wou\nld not be appropriate \nfor an ombudsman also to have \nworked formerly\n in local government\n.  \nAs it happens, I am the first ombudsman for some time who has not been a chief officer in a local authority, although I have worked with local government, so you will have to judge me on my own performance\n.  \nMy view, which I know is shared by the Department—because we have put the point to them on behalf of the external evaluation—is that you need the best can\ndidate for the job.  In my view, t\nhe best candidate for the job is somebody who can bring experience of and expertise in local serv\nice delivery, in whatever form it might be, and \nhave an un\nderstanding of the administrative j\nustice landscape.\nQ31 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nCan I ask about the new framework document signed between you and DCLG? \n \nDo you think that has enhanced your independence or autonomy?\nDr Martin: \nI would not say it \nhas \nenhanced our independence or autonomy\n.  \nThe background to the framework document is that we were operating under a grant memorandum which was some years out of date and needed to be refreshed\n.  \nWe were advised by the Permanent Secretary of DCLG that the appropriate way to regularise the situation as a \nsponsor or organisation for DCLG\n was to agree\n a framework document \nbased on the standard format for arm’s length bodies\n.  \nAs you yourselves have remarked, it took some time to agree that framework document\n.  \nPart of the reason for that was that we were having a number of discussions and drafts looking at the standard framework document to try to make sure it was fit for purpose \nfor an ombudsman, so \nsome changes\n were\n made.\nQ32 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nDo you think it has compromised your autonomy?\nDr Martin: I do not.  \nI \naccept and \nagree with the view of the external evaluators that it is something that potentially could limit our autonomy, but thus far I cannot say it has.\nQ33 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nHow might it?\nDr Martin: \nInevitably, the framework document includes arrangements which are consistent with the Government’s spending and recruitment controls\n.  \nYou would\n expect that to be the case as they are accountable for public money.  \nWe have found that to be an administrative burden, and in some cases it has delayed the way in which we have been able to get on w\nith the transformation plan.  \nI am not sure that is something I should lay at the door of the framework document itself\n.  \nWe are working within a particular context, and I understand that.\nQ34 &#xa0; \nJames Morris: \nDo you think that having your offices co-located with DCLG will help with the perception of your independence and autonomy?\nDr Martin: \nIt may not \nhelp, but the negotiations \nwe went into with DCLG were in the context of the current climate where we need to loo\nk at government-owned property.  I cannot recall the details—I \nam sure we could get them for you\n, if you wanted them—but \nit was \none of a number of options \nwe considered.\nMichael King: \nIt is also important to recognise that our corporate headquarters are in \nCoventry\n.  \nThat building is not shared with any Government Departments; it is an entirely stand\n&#x2011;\nal\none building in which our \ncorporate headquarters staff and senior management \nare based.  \nThe only building we shar\ne with central Government is \nthe\n one we share with the \nHome\n Office, Audit Commission\n and a variety of other organisations\n.  \nThat is our satellite office in \nLondon\n.  T\nhere is absolutely no question that our corporate headquarters are shared with \nD\nCLG\n.\nQ35 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: I note that the second criterion of the O\nmbu\ndsman A\nssociation is fairness, so how do you respond to the concern that the LGO might be more willing to risk judicial review with small \norganisations rather than large\n ones with large budget\ns—\nfor example\n,\n local authorities?\nDr Martin: \nI might ask Mick to comment in a moment because he looks after our legal team\n.  \nClearly, if there is any public concern about fairness that is \nalso \na concern to us, but judicial reviews form a very small part of our work\n.  \nI think there were 19 last year, which is about 1.1% of our cases\n.  \nThe important point is that we run a process whereby all parties, whether it is an individual complainant or a lo\ncal authority, can be clear \nabout\n the evidence we are presenting and\n can challenge\n it.  \nWe have a process which allows for that.\nMichael King: \nI think\n this arose from a submission from a member of the public.  There\n was \na concern\n that perhaps the potential cost of judicial review might lead u\ns to pull our punches.  \nI can give you an absolute assurance that that is \nnot the case.  To stick with judicial review,\n to challenge one of our decisions i\ns very much the final step \nanybody would take\n.  \nWe recognise that that is not a realistic proposition, not least because the courts have made clear that the scope for challenging an ombudsman’s decision is very small\n.  \nOur focus is on making sure that people have the\n opportunity to engage with, \nare consulted on and have the opportunity to challenge our decision al\nl the way through the process.  \nDuring an investigation\n,\n we will share any key documents with both parties to make sure they have sight of the evid\nence on which we are relying.  B\nefore we make a decision, both parties will be consulted on what we call a provisional view\n.  \nThat sets out the decision we are minded to make, and both parties at the same time will have the opportunity to comment on that view\n. We \nwill take those comments on board \nbefore making a final decision.\nOnce we \nhave made a final decision, if the complainant or \ncouncil comes back to raise new issu\nes, or to challenge a\n fault in the decis\nion, we have an internal \nprocess where a different team manager who has not been involved in that case will re\nview it and, if necessary, reopen that decision.  Therefore, l\nong before anybody gets anywhere near judicial review there are multiple steps by which they can be involved in shaping the decision an\nd challenging it, if necessary.\nWhere somebody does issue proceedings for judicial review, there is a process called the pre-action protocol\n.  \nThat enables them to set out in advance the issues \nin our decision \nwhich they \nthink are flawed.  \nWe take that very seriously\n.  \nEvery pre\n&#x2011;\naction protocol letter goes across my desk\n.  \nWe have a case conference about it; we consider whether or not it raises serious doubts about the decision we have made\n.  \nIf it does, we will reopen that case\n.  \nSo far this year, we have had 13 pre-action protocol letters\n.  \nWe have considered every one of those in detail, and in two of those cases we have made the decision to reopen the \ncase\n and look at it again, and that is exactly what has happened\n.  \nJudicial review is by no means the only way in which people can make sure they are involved in our decision making.\nQ36 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: \nThank you for explaining\n the \nprocess\n.  \nOne of \nt\nhe issu\nes is about the wide-ranging discretion a\nnd powers that \nombudsmen have.  \nWhat impact do you think codification of the ombudsman’s discretion would have on the work?\nDr Martin: I\nt is the case that the courts support the wide discretion of the ombudsman, and that is the frame\nwork within which we work.  I\nt is important that we do not fetter our discretion\n, although\n we do consider each case on its merits\n.  \nWe would always make sure we \ndo th\nat.  \nYou will be aware that, as part of our new business model, we now have a new assessment process and code which gives greater clarity about how we exercise our discretion.\nMichael King: \nOne of the things we have introduced as part of the new assessment process is a very clear code\n,\n which sets out the way in which we will make decisions \nand \nabout which investigations we will and will not undertake\n.  \nI hasten to add that that is not a new barrier we have put in place for the public\n.  \nThese are decisions we have \nalways made.\nWe are trying\n to be much clearer and \nmore \nconsistent about how we make those decisions, and much more transparent with the public about t\nhe criteria on which we base those\n decisions\n.  \nThat code has been sent to every MP in the country\n.  \nIt has also been published on our website, so there is absolute transparency around how we will go about that process\n.  \nThe code sets out two different types of te\nst we use.  \nThe first is that there are legal restrictions on what we can and cannot look at\n.  \nFor example, if somebody has already been to court\n,\n we are prohibited from looking at that case, so they are all set out in the codes.\nThere i\ns also a series of choices \nwe have to make about the p\nroper use of public money and about which\n matters should be looked at by the ombudsman\n.  \nThey are more \nto do with the discretionary matters \nyou are talking about\n.  \nWe have tried to set out in much clearer terms than we have ever done before how we will make those decisions and consider things\n—for example, \nwhat amounts to significant injustic\ne in a case.  The upshot \nis that I believe we are making more \ndecisions more clearly and \nconsistently than we have ever done in the past.\nQ37 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon:  \nDo you think there is any risk that by publishing deci\nsions based on what some claim i\ns a m\nisunderstanding of their case—if they think it has been interpreted or decided incorrectly—it could be seen\n that the LGO is misinforming the public?\nMichael King: \nIs this in relation to the publication of all our decision outcomes?\nQ38 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: If someone\n believe\ns that the decision in their case is not correct and you publicise those findings, where do you get the \nconfide\nnce to counteract the perception that it is the wrong decision, and \nwrong\n information is\n being put forward \nto uphold that decision\n?\nDr Martin: \nPerhaps it would help if I \nfirst explained that\n we publish decisions only after we have given time for our internal review process\n.  \nWe will continue, as we always have, to give all bodies the opportunity\n.  \nThe provisional view stage is the most important \nstage\n when all parties can challenge the evidence and findings\n.  T\nhat is the key point in the process\n.  \nHaving done that, when we issue our final statement, which I think is what you are referring to, we will always allow a three-\nmonth time span for a complainant\n to come back and have an internal review before we publish it, so we are not ruling out people coming\n to challenge any decision \nwe have made\n.  \nThat continues to be the case\n.  \nHaving gone through any review process, we will publish.\nMichael King: W\ne are the first ombudsman in the \nUK\n to publish every single decision outcome on the website\n.  People can search that by\n local authority so they can see what decisions are made in their area\n.  \nThey can also search it by complaint category\n.  \nWe had a long discussion about whether we should publish every single outcome or just \nthe ones that have been upheld.  We felt it \nvery important, in order to give local councillors and the public a rounded vi\new of what we do, to\n publish every decision\n.  \nThat is fair to local authorities as well, in that it shows the ones that we do not up\nhold as well as the ones we do.\nOf fundamental importance wa\ns that we wante\nd to try to give the public\n information about what was likely to happen to their com\nplaint if they came to us.  T\nhey would be able to look at our website in advance, look up a complaint that might be like the one they were going to bring to us and have a reasonable expectation of how the ombudsman might deal with that\n.  \nThat was a decision to publish absolutely everything\n.  \nAt the moment, there are 1,800 decisions on our website\n.  \nWe will probably\n be\n publis\nhing\n about 12,000 decisions a year\n.  \nThat is the first ombudsman’s scheme in the \nUK\n to do that.\nQ39 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: I will try and establish a bit more understanding of what you have just been talking about.  \nDr Martin, I think you referred earlier to a casework policy forum\n.  \nIs that where I would find the criteria being established for this new assessment code?\nDr Martin: \nIt would be, yes; that is the locus for our decision making around any ch\nanges to our casework\n.\nQ40 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nIf a very clear code has been published and it is much m\nore transparent and\n locked in, what is the need for a monthly casework policy forum?\nDr Martin: \nWe have to make sure that the framework within which all of our investigators are working under delegated authority is constantly updated, relevant and taking account of changes that may have happened, both legally and in terms of policy\n.  \nWe also want to make sure that we are monitoring casework itself\n.  \nWe look at\n progress on judicial reviews, so w\ne are looking at casework in the round.\nQ41 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nThat seems to me to be contrary to the idea of a very clear code\n that is more transparent, \nis locked in and people can identify with\n.  \nWhat you describe sounds to me more like a movable feast.\nMichael King: \nPer\nhaps I can give the example of\n the assessment code\n that we have published.  I\nf there are any amendments to that, clearly we\n will\n publish those\n.  \nThe casework policy forum tends to pick up more\n of\n the day-to-day process and practice issues which might be giving our investigators difficulty\n.  \nTo give a recent example, one of our investigators asked whether they could bring an issue to the casework policy fo\nrum about\n changes in welfare benefits, and what sort of view the ombudsman would take on those cases\n.  \nShe was aware that a number of our investigators had the same type of case\n.  \nIt was a new issue for us to confront, so she wanted to get clarity on the view th\nat the ombudsman would take.\nAs to what\n we use the c\nasework policy forum for—\nthi\ns is a significant improvement in the way we \nwork\ned in the past—r\nather than investigators having to work their way through these new issues, perhaps coming to slightly different conclusions in different places, they can bring that issue to one place and get a clear view from the two executive directors and the\n ombudsman.  We then put out\n \nthe \nclear guidance\n to our staff: “When you \nencounter a case like this, this is th\ne view we will generally take.”\nWe hope that over the years to come we will codify our practice in that way so we are much clearer\n and more consistent.  W\ne have just appointed a new legal team\n.  \nOne of the things I will be lo\noking to them to do is to consider\n our guidance on jurisdiction, which is where this information would be held, and review it\n.  \nOnce we have got a revised guidance on jurisdiction, I see absolutely no reason why we would not be publishing that for public scrutiny as well.\nQ42 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: Do you plan to have\n an external review of the investigation process? \n \nIf you have already agreed to \ncommission an external review of the quality framework and the timeliness of your\n decisions\n,\n would that encompass the new investigation process?\nDr Martin: \nAbsolutely\n.  \nWe will commission our i\nnternal auditors next year,\n as part of their programme\n, t\no look at our performance a\nnd the quality of our work.  That will look at our new quality framework in which w\ne\n have seven new \nstandards\n,\n because we recognise t\nhat we have made great progress\n and our productivity is much better\n.  \nWhat is equally important—I am sure you would agree—is that the quality of our work is also to a very high standard and is consistent in the way Mick has just explained.\nQ43 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nDid I hear you just say that you expect the review to happen next year?\nDr Martin: \nYes.\nQ44 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nCan you be more precise about when it might happen?\nDr Martin: \nI hope the internal auditors will finish it by May 2014.\nQ45 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nYour internal auditors are going to do this review.\nDr Martin: \nYes.\nQ46 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nIs that the exte\nrnal review which i\ns part of the recommendations you were addressing earlier this year?\nDr Martin: \nIt is\n.  \nOur auditors are external to the organisation, if I can put it that way.\nQ47 &#xa0; \nDavid Heyes: \nMaybe I have misunderstood my notes, but I thought that one of the recommendations was that another body with expertise in the world of ombudsmen would conduct the review.\nDr Martin: \nThere are two things here\n.  \nOne is an external review of our time tar\ngets and the timelines we use.  We would have those\n looked at by a peer ombudsman\n.  \nThat is what we are \nconsidering\n at the moment, and I think that will be in place by the end of this yea\nr.  A\ns to the external evaluation of our performance, our current p\nlan is for it to be conducted b\ny our internal auditors\n.  \nIt is quite consistent with the kind of work they have done for us in the past, and that is what we plan at the moment.\nQ48 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: \nLast year\n,\n the LGO was accused of being \n“\ndistinctly un\n-\nforensic\n”\n in \nvalidating evidence \nprovided by local authorities, so what have you done to change that?\nDr Martin: W\nhile recognising it is critical that the public have confidence in our processes and our impartiality, and want to ensure that the evidence we use is f\nair and properly validated, an ombudsman scheme is by definition not run\n in exactly the same way as the courts\n.  \nOur burden of proof is different, and the way we work is a more informal investigative process.\nThat said, I recognise that public confidence is absolutely critical\n.  \nIn introducing our new business model this year, we have made sure that we give clear guidance to staff who are inves\ntigating so\n they are clear about the evidence on which they are relying\n.  \nWe also make sure\n that the statements of reasons in \nthe decisio\nns you were referring to before \nset out the \nevi\ndence we have relied on\n to arrive at our judgment\n.  \nOur default process is that we make sure the complainant can see any evidence we have relied on in coming to our decision.\nMichael King: We have taken a \nfew other steps\n.  All of our process manuals, \ndescrib\ning\n how we will do every step of the process from intake as\nsessment, to \ninvestigation and our statements of reasons\n,\n are published online, so our staff follow a \nconsistent process, but \nthe public can \nalso \nsee exactly what is expected and they can hold us to account.\nWe have appointed one of our experienced investigators to be a profes\nsional practice co\n&#x2011;\nordinator.  That is\n somebody who does the job, leading lots of initiatives to try to improve the way in which we do our day-to-d\nay practice.  She leads \na series of good practice seminars we have held for all staff\n.  \nOne of the recent ones looked at how we handle evidence and customer service\n.  \nA whole series of steps has been\n put in place to make sure \nthe quality of the work we are doing is as good as it can be.\nTo go back to your original point as to whether we are robust in challenging evidence from local authorities, in October this year we published a report against Northumberland County Council\n.  \nDuring the course of t\nhe investigation, the council\n provided evidence to us to say that that they had acted on a particular aspect of the complaint\n.  \nNot only did our investigato\nr not accept that at face value, \nwhich was the \naccusation, but \nhe carried out a thorough and robust investigation into the facts\n.  \nHe found out that the information provided to us by the council was inaccurate, a\nnd that led to a\n report \nagainst the county council that \nwas critical not only of the admi\nnistrative failures in the case\n but also highlighted the fact that they had effectively supplied misleading information to the ombudsman\n.  \nNo doubt that will featur\ne in the annual letter for that \nauthority at the end of the year\n.  \nThat is just one case, but I think that is typical of our practice\n.  \nWe do not take things at face value from loc\nal authorities; we \ninvestigate thoroughly and forensically where that is required.\nQ49 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: \nYou have just gone into depth \nabout \nhow you would probe a local authority for accurate information\n.  \nYou did it in that one instance, and obviously you knew that the information you had was incorrect\n.  \nDid you, or w\nould you in future, require\n written tr\nanscripts of the interviews from\n council officers?\n \n How would you use those?\n \n How can you always ensure that the information provided by the authority is acc\nurate\n?\nDr Martin: \nYou are quite right\n.  \nWe always have a note of any interview we take\n.  \nSometimes it will be a c\nomplete transcript while at other times\n it will be a note, but we will always have a note of any interviews\n.  \nThe job of our investigator is to conduct an investiga\ntion and \ngather \nthe evidence they need in order to\n come to a view\n.  \nSometimes they would inte\nrview a number of officials; at \nother times\n,\n they would not because they have got sufficient information from elsewhere\n.  \nIt is done on a case-by-case basis.\nThe point Mick has made is very important\n.  \nWe now have a professional practice co\n&#x2011;\nordinator\n.  \nThis is a new post in the organisation\n.  \nWe now have a clear and consistent programme of good practice seminars\n.  \nOur executive director for investigations is working closely with ou\nr assistant ombudsman.  So am I.  I now meet with assistant ombudsmen on a monthly basis\n, as well as having a casework surgery with staff\n.  \nI hope you can see that we have accepted the challenges you put to us last time, and are working hard to make sure that our process has public confidence and is absolutely robust.\nQ50 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: \nYou said you \nare\n publishing evidence\n.  \nIs that full disclosure of all evidence and invest\nigations\n?\nMichael King: \nIt is\n.  \nIn terms of publishing the outcome of a case, we have a template which sets ou\nt exactly what the decision is i\nn every case\n.  \nIn that there is a section which shows exactly what the investigators consid\nered, what the legal context is\n and how they have gone about doing their investigation\n.  \nThat is the same in every case outcome.\nIn terms of sharing with the complainant t\nhe information we have relied \non,\n it is fair to say that\n in the past we were sometimes reluctant to disclose the content of an investigation file\n.  \nThat came from the particular legal framework within which we were working\n.  \nWe have completely turned that on its head\n.  \nOur advice to staff now is that, where somebody requests information from their case file, our starting pos\nition is that we will disclose \nevery single piece of information\n we have on that case file\n, unless it is subject to a Data Protection Act restriction, maybe because it has got confidential third-party information\n.  \nOur practice has moved from one which tended to be selective ab\nout disclosure of evidence in \nour case files—traditionally, the ombudsman’s investigations were conducted in private\n—to a practice where we have \nabsolute\nly\n open disclosure of the evidence we have relied on, and that now underpins our whole approach to investigations.\nQ51 &#xa0; \nMrs Glindon: \nAre you now satisfied that what you a\nre doing will \nshow the validity of the evidence\n you have gathered\n from local authorities\n?\nDr Martin: \nI certainly hope so, but we never stand still; we \nhave to continue to ensure \nwe are\n doing a good job, and we will \ndo that.\nQ52 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: I\n want to ask about the complaints you receive about\n yourselves.  \nIn the 2012-13 annual report, of \nthe 63 complaints you received that year it was agreed that in 13 cases you had not provided\n an appropriate level of service\n.  \nThat is quite a high proportion, is it not?\nDr Martin: \nWhen you consider that we deal with over 10,000 complaints a year, it is not a huge amount.\nQ53 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nBut not everybo\ndy is complaining about you, so if more did \nit would be an even higher proportion.\nDr Martin: \nI was just making the point that we do deal with a lot of complaints, but I accept the challenge.\nQ54 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nWhat are you doing to encourage people to complain about you?\nDr Martin: \nWe are making our process absolutely clear\n.  \nThe most important thing is openness and transparency\n.  \nThat has to be ou\nr\n watchword, and we make it clear to people how they can challenge what we have done.\nQ55 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: In that process of challenge\n, does the complaint go first to the officer who carried out the inquiry?\n \n Is that right? \n \nWe have had comp\nlaints.  If I come to you because\n I am not satisfied with the way it h\nas been handled,\n my com\nplaint goes to the officer who handled my complaint.  \nIs that right?\nDr Martin: \nAll the inte\nrnal reviews are peer review\n, so they are conducted by a manager from another team; they are not conducted by the team where a complaint has been raised\n.\nQ56 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: T\nhe external evaluation \nsaid \nthat that was not really appropriate and you should have an independent reviewer\n.  \nIs that right?\nDr Martin: \nThey did\n.  \nWe have not completed that yet, but we are looking at how we can introduce an external evaluator in the way you have described\n.  \nWe are going to make a decision at the\n next meeting of the commission\n.\nQ57 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: \nSo you are not satisfied with the way you handle complaints about your organisation.\nDr Martin: \nWe recognise that we can always do better, as all public bodies can, and we take on board what the external evaluation suggest\ned.  \nIt is one of the recommendations we are now looking at, and we will make a decision at the next commission meeting\n.  \nI expect that we will decide to strengthen our processes by having an external person\n.  Many ombudsmen do have external reviews of their service complaints, and so it is right \nwe should look at that.\nQ58 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: When will the public expect to have an external body to look at complaints that they want to make about you?\nDr Martin: I would have thought by the end of this business year.  I do not make any promise, but it is a reasonable expectation.\nQ59 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: By the end of March.\nDr Martin: By the end of March we should know.\nQ60 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: Let me ask about the stakeholder advisory forum that has been established.  How were participants selected to sit on your stakeholder advisory forum?  By the way, it sounds great.\nDr Martin: Thank you.  We invited all recent complainants to apply for membership.  We wanted one MP and invited all MPs to respond.  No one has responded yet, so if anybody is really interested in joining our advisory group, we would be delighted.  \nCoventry\n is not too far to go, so that invitation is still open.  We also invited a councillor and members from advocacy groups to join us.\nQ61 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: All these people wrote in and you decided who should be on your forum.\nDr Martin: Yes, that is right but we had 150 complainants who were interested.  Obviously, we could not put all of them on the advisory group, but we retained them on an email network.\nQ62 &#xa0; \nSimon Danczuk: I am trying to establish how you selected them.  Did you choose the most difficult ones?\nDr Martin: Mick will tell you about the detail better than I can.\nMichael King: We wrote to the last 4,000 people who had complained to us.  Of those, 150 came back and expressed an interest.  We asked them to tell us, on one side of a piece of paper, why they thought they could contribute something to the forum.  Because we were so overwhelmed with interest, we tried to pick people who had some other form of community involvement.  For example, one of the people is a street pastor.  \nWe tried to pick people who not only had been complainants but had some other wider civic role so that they could bring something extra.  In deciding who should be on the group, I can assure you that we did not look at their complaint outcome.  I chaired the first meeting of the group.  I can assure you that there is a majority of complainants on it, and there are certainly some very mixed views about their experience of our service.  Some people were incredibly positive about the service they had received from us at a difficult time in their lives, which was great to hear.  Other people were saying we made them work too hard and we did not explain clearly enough what the process was.  Some really valuable material came from that.  We are committed to doing it, and it felt like a really valuable experience.\nQ63 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: Perhaps I may look forward rather than back as we have done.  What are your views about the future landscape of the Local Government Ombudsman service more generally?  Last week, on Wednesday 27 November, the Legal Ombudsman said that “our complaints system is a mess”, and “t\nhe cost of maintaining all the myriad complaints schemes is startlingly high and efficiency levels low\n.”  Only two days later, on Friday, there was a ministerial statement saying we should aim to create an integrated public services ombudsman, such as exists currently in \nScotland\n and \nWales\n.  Do we have something to learn here from the devolved Administrations?\nDr Martin: We certainly have something to learn from the devolved Administrations.  I hope that what you have heard from us in the course of this inquiry has given you some confidence that at least this ombudsman service is offering good value for money, has made considerable cost savings, increased its productivity and taken a much closer look at the quality of what it does.  In my view, LGO is certainly fit for purpose to be efficient and effective in future.\nWe are aware that the Cabinet Office Minister, Oliver Letwin, has announced a review of ombudsmen.  We have written to him to say that we want to engage in that review.  We believe we have a lot to share with those who want to look at ombudsmen.  I am aware of the comments of the Legal Ombudsman and others.  We want to share our learning from transformation, because we are proud of what we have achieved over the past 12 months or so and will continue to achieve.  We also have 40 years’ experience of ombudsmanry—not myself you understand, but\n \nthe organisation —and supporting local complaints handling.\nFor us, the important thing to remember is that the ombudsman is always at the apex of a system for local complaints handling, so it is important that any ombudsman in the future continues to amplify those messages.  I do not think that any reform is about the exponential growth of ombudsmen; it is not that we should be touting for business, but we should be looking at how we can support local complaints handling better in the future. Any reforms should focus on what is best for the public and how they can access a service.  We ourselves have a great slide to show how difficult it is for people to navigate the complaints maze, as we have called it.  It is difficult at the moment, so we absolutely want to engage in any process which looks at simplifying that.\nQ64 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: To look backwards for a moment, what do you think these calls for reform tell us about the current structure of the ombudsman service generally?\nDr Martin: In one sense, you have to ask them, but I would summarise it as the system being too complex.  We know best about the local landscape.  You will be aware as we are that the local landscape is changing dramatically.  With a multi-agency environment, I imagine that for complainants it is increasingly complicated for them to understand how they can make a complaint, at a time when it is increasingly important for people to be able to make a complaint.  I would use the term “consumer democracy” to describe what we have at the moment, which is more and more reliance on local people to hold local services to account in a post-Audit Commission world.\nQ65 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: Do you think there are some benefits for a single point of contact for a member of the public wishing to complain?\nDr Martin: Yes, I do—anything that is better, simpler and clearer for the public.  We can learn from the Welsh ombudsman in that regard.  You talked about our \nUK\n colleagues.\nQ66 &#xa0; \nMark Pawsey: How do you think your organisation and the people currently working it would fit into such an organisation?  How would they respond to that kind of change, given the change you told us you have already gone through?\nDr Martin: You are quite right.  Change has to be managed very carefully and with absolute consideration.  I, for one, will not be rushing into anything, but, if a debate is about to happen, I want LGO to be part of it.  We have led the way with our intake service, for which Mick has responsibility.  Although we have mirrored a lot of good practice with our new model, we are leading the way with the codification of assessments.  We have a lot to offer.\nYou asked about staff.  The experience and expertise of our staff is a valuable commodity, and it is essential for LGO business continuity and anything that comes in the future.\nQ67 &#xa0; \nChair: You have started producing thematic reports, which members of the Committee have received, covering a number of different areas where you have been looking at particular complaints.  Could you say briefly why you think they are beneficial to complainants, members of the public and local authorities, and what you hope to achieve by them?\nDr Martin: There are two kinds.  We now regularly produce what we call \nAdult Social Care Matters\n, which is a themed report looking at those issues.  We also now produce one on children and young people’s complaints.\nQ68 &#xa0; \nChair: You did one on homelessness.\nDr Martin: Yes, we produced one recently on homelessness, and in particular the inappropriate use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families and young people.  Only last week, we were looking at family foster carers and the way they were being unfairly treated by some local authorities.  This is an important part of our work.  Our founding legislation sets out that the ombudsman should not only deal with complaints but provide advice back to the sector, and not only about complaints handling but the improvement of local public administration and service delivery.\nIf I take the focus report that we published last week, we felt it really important to highlight the issues about family foster carers to increase public information and awareness, particularly at a time when increasingly we will be relying on the users of services to challenge the service \nproviders and service deliverers.  Public information is increasingly important, and we hope to be able, through these focus reports, to add to that.\nWe also want to share good practice and remind local authorities of the statutory framework within which they work.  What we are adding to those focus reports now are key questions that councillors might wish to ask in scrutiny sessions, so that councillors and local authorities are holding all providers to account for the quality of the services being offered.  Last week we were in a meeting with the Care Quality Commission about the way we feed back our learning from complaints so we can also help to enrich their process and the quality of their intelligence.  We are very keen to continue doing this.  We feel we have a lot to offer so we can amplify and learn lessons from the complaints that come to us.\nMichael King: The report on family values that we launched on Friday was about the lack of support that is sometimes given to friends and family who step in at short notice to look after children.  One of the things we are trying to achieve is to tell the human stories that lie behind the headlines, as we did with our report on bed and breakfast.  In that most recent report, we highlighted the case of a grandmother who had stepped in to look after her six-year-old grandson and ended up bankrupt because of the lack of financial support she got over a nine-year period.  Another case involved a man who stepped in to look after an unrelated child of his partner after she had committed suicide.  He lost his home, job and car while looking after that child.\nWe are trying to make sure that when people are holding local authorities to account, whether it be local authority members or the public, and people are making policy and legislation, they are informed by real experience people have of public services, and of when things go wrong.  We are not a regulator; we cannot see the whole picture, but we know we have some really valuable lessons from people’s human experience of service failure.  We just want to make sure we are sharing them, and that those voices are heard and inform public policy debates.\nChair: On that very positive point—that there are lessons to be learned—it is probably an appropriate moment to conclude this evidence session.  Dr\n&#xa0;\nMartin and Mr\n&#xa0;\nKing, thank you very much for coming to give evidence to us.\n              \nOral evidence: \nFurther review of the work of the Local Government Ombudsman\n, HC \n866\n              \n              \n14\n"
