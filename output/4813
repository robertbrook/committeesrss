[normal]Witnesses:

[normal],

[normal]Permanent Secretary
[normal], 
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold], Director General
[normal], 
[normal]Finance and NHS, and 
[normal]Jon [bold]R[bold]ouse[bold], Director General Social Care, Local Government and Care Partnerships, Department of Health; and 
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold], Chief Executive, NHS England, 
[normal]gave evidence.  
[normal]Q239 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Secretary
[normal] of State, you come with a big team. You are extremely welcome. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not 
[normal]think Mr Rouse has been before—you are very welcome—
[normal]but others have
[normal],
[normal] so they probably do not need an introduction. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would like, if 
[normal]I 
[normal]may, to open 
[normal]the 
[normal]questioning by referring to some evidence John Appleby from 
[normal]the 
[normal]King
[normal]’
[normal]s Fund gave us when he came to talk about public ex
[normal]penditure in health. He said: “…
[normal]the 
[normal]real 
[normal]issue is not about saving money…
[normal]but what you spend that money on.
[normal]”
[normal] That is where 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to open 
[normal]the 
[normal]discussion
[normal],
[normal] because
[normal],
[normal] whenever we talk about rising trend
[normal]s of demand for health and care and 
[normal]the 
[normal]r
[normal]esource constraints that exist, 
[normal]there is a sort of orthodoxy these days that demand grows by 4% per annum
[normal]—t
[normal]hat is a total
[normal]—and 
[normal]that somehow we have 
[normal]to meet that growth of demand.
[normal]The 
[normal]proposition 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to open with is t
[normal]hat it is not just about totals; it
[normal] is al
[normal]so about who is in that demand and 
[normal]what 
[normal]is 
[normal]the 
[normal]changing nature of 
[normal]the 
[normal]demand that is going to be placed upon 
[normal]the 
[normal]system in 
[normal]the 
[normal]projected period to 2020 that NHS England 
[normal]are
[normal] now 
[normal]talking about.
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]would be grateful if you could tell 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee what work is being done either within 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health or within NHS England to understand 
[normal]the 
[normal]changing shape of demand and
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] by implication of course
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]changing nature of 
[normal]the 
[normal]services that 
[normal]the 
[normal]system is going to have to provide.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]This is 
[normal]the 
[normal]central debate and 
[normal]the 
[normal]discussion that we need to have if we are going to secure a long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term sustainable future for 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS
[normal],
[normal] which is 
[normal]what everyone wants. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have been doing 
[normal]the 
[normal]job for just over a year
[normal], and my own view 
[normal]is that
[normal],
[normal] because of Mid Staffordshire and Francis, inevitably 
[normal]the 
[normal]national spotlight has been on hospital care and how we deliver hospital services, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]a much more fundamental issue that we have to wrestle with is out
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]hospital
[normal] care. That 4% figure is not fixed. If we spend our money more wisely, 
[normal]and 
[normal]in particular move to prevention rather than simply thinking about cure, we have a chance to reduce that demand growth, but of course that is not a novel thing to say. People have been s
[normal]aying that for a very long time
[normal] and so we have been doing a lot of thinking about what needs to happen
[normal].
[normal] NHS England are developing a primary care strategy and 
[normal]I 
[normal]work very closely with them on 
[normal]the 
[normal]new GP contract
[normal],
[normal] which is 
[normal]the 
[normal]first step
[normal]—
[normal]but only 
[normal]the 
[normal]first step
[normal]—
[normal]in that process. 
[normal]There are still significant efficiency savings that can be found throughout 
[normal]the 
[normal]system
[normal]—and we can talk about those—
[normal]but in 
[normal]the 
[normal]end we need to think about 
[normal]the 
[normal]nature of services we provide
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]very big and challenging question, which we have not really had a public debate on in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that we should, is how we maintain and improve 
[normal]the 
[normal]levels of service offered by hospitals at 
[normal]the 
[normal]same time as transferring more resources into out
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]hospital
[normal] care.
[normal]Q240 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]But is there not a 
[normal]trap
[normal] always in thinking about what this means for hospitals
[normal],
[normal] GPs or pharmacists
[normal],
[normal] rather than, as we were saying in 
[normal]the 
[normal]debate yesterday on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Care Bill, starting with 
[normal]the 
[normal]patient and identifying what morbidities 
[normal]the 
[normal]patients of 
[normal]the 
[normal]future will suffer from
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]how 
[normal]the 
[normal]system meets the
[normal]ir
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]need
[normal]s
[normal] and reflects 
[normal]the 
[normal]changing nature of demand, so that it is not national, global numbers, 
[normal]but within a locality? H
[normal]ow many people in this area are going to suffer from diabetes
[normal] or from dementia? 
[normal]What are w
[normal]e going to do to risk-
[normal]stratify in this community
[normal],
[normal] to meet 
[normal]the 
[normal]demands placed on 
[normal]the 
[normal]services in this community? Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]push you on 
[normal]the 
[normal]extent to which there is real research being done
[normal],
[normal] rather than assumptions being made
[normal],
[normal] to inform 
[normal]the 
[normal]policy
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]making
[normal] process, otherwise we shall be here in two or three years
[normal]’
[normal] time saying, 
[normal]“
[normal]We ran out of money
[normal]”
[normal]? 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Yes, it is 
[normal]the 
[normal]right thing to push me on. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure we can do more, but we are doing a lot already, and particularly through Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]wh
[normal]ich 
[normal]I 
[normal]had a meeting 
[normal]this morning. 
[normal]We need to address one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]central challenges 
[normal]with out
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]hospital care
[normal],
[normal] which is where 
[normal]the 
[normal]accountability line lies. When you have frail elderly people or disabled children with complex long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term conditions, it is not always clear where 
[normal]the 
[normal]buck stops in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is something that we need to address if we are going to make sure that they get 
[normal]the 
[normal]wrap
[normal]-
[normal]around care they need
[normal],
[normal] which
[normal],
[normal] in turn
[normal],
[normal] will minimise their hospital bills and mean that they get 
[normal]the 
[normal]best care they possibly can. 
[normal]But there is another responsibility as well
[normal],
[normal] which is 
[normal]the 
[normal]responsibility for people who are healthy
[normal],
[normal] who
[normal]m
[normal] we want to stay healthy
[normal],
[normal] who
[normal]m
[normal] we do not want to get di
[normal]abetes or 
[normal]develop other long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term conditions until 
[normal]the 
[normal]last possible moment. 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things 
[normal]we are looking at is population-
[normal]level health statistics 
[normal]held by GP practices—
[normal]for example, whether it is possible to track by GP practice 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of cancers that are diagnosed at a late stage rather than an early stage and what
[normal] more can be done. You, Chair
[normal], talk a lot about integration. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not sure that we are integrated enough between 
[normal]the 
[normal]activities of Public Health 
[normal]England
[normal], who are responsible, for example, for health checks
[normal],
[normal] and GP surgeries, who have a responsibility for early diagnosis as well.
[normal]Q241 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]will 
[normal]have
[normal] one final shot and then 
[normal]I 
[normal]shall go to Sarah. If people are going to understand in their local community 
[normal]the 
[normal]need for services to change, surely step one of that process is to show that
[normal],
[normal] in a loc
[normal]ality, not just 
[normal]the 
[normal]GP services
[normal] but 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole
[normal] health and wellbeing structure
[normal] are asking themselves questions about what demand is going to look like two, three or five years out and create a narrative around what these individuals living in that community are going to need to enjoy a fuller life in five or 10 years
[normal]’ time, and 
[normal]e
[normal]xplain it at a personal level. 
[normal]Until that exists, they will not accept 
[normal]the 
[normal]need to change 
[normal]the 
[normal]services that they have inherited and trust.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Yes
[normal], and
[normal] perhaps 
[normal]I 
[normal]will ask Sir David to come in on that point as well because he has done a lot o
[normal]f thinking about service change;
[normal] but 
[normal]I 
[normal]agree with that. There is one encouraging example where that did happen
[normal],
[normal] and that is 
[normal]the 
[normal]reconfiguration for north
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]west London, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]think, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]end, turned out to be a lot less controversial than people thought it would 
[normal]be 
[normal]precisely because it was locally led
[normal],
[normal] and local commissioners
[normal]—
[normal]local GPs
[normal],
[normal] in particular
[normal]—
[normal]were able to make that very case to their local populations and were able to pres
[normal]ent 
[normal]the 
[normal]up
[normal]side of 
[normal]the 
[normal]changes very clearly to go alongside any of 
[normal]the 
[normal]changes that people 
[normal]might have been concerned about,
[normal] 
[normal]but i
[normal]n particular 
[normal]the 
[normal]fact that part of that package is seven
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]day
[normal] GP surgery opening, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]think people could immediately relate to as something they would benefit from.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: Underpinning this—and 
[normal]without boring you to death with pr
[normal]ocess, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]know can happen—
[normal]is that it is at 
[normal]the 
[normal]heart of that planning process that we kicked off today, as far as NHS England is concerned, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]sense that, for 
[normal]the 
[normal]first time, we are saying to every CCG that they need to come up with what their services 
[normal]will
[normal] look like in five years
[normal]’
[normal] time. That sounds relatively trivial at one level, but it is quite a significant issue when you think about how you have to build that understanding on both what 
[normal]the 
[normal]population 
[normal]is
[normal] saying but also on a joint strategic needs assessment over a significant period. Out of that will come a whole set of issues around local demand that we do not really understand at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment
[normal] but we will get out of that
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]we have 
[normal]the 
[normal]beginnings of a process to enable us to do that in 
[normal]the 
[normal]planning that we did today.
[normal]Q242 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]state for 
[normal]the 
[normal]record that 
[normal]I 
[normal]am married to 
[normal]a 
[normal]forensic psychiatrist
[normal],
[normal] who works full time in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS. 
[normal]My question is about 
[normal]the 
[normal]shift that everyone recognises needs to go into community services
[normal],
[normal] and particularly into areas like parity of esteem for mental health. Could 
[normal]the 
[normal]panel comment on how we are going to establish parity of esteem for mental health
[normal],
[normal] when in fact 
[normal]the 
[normal]funding is going in 
[normal]the 
[normal]other direction in that 
[normal]the 
[normal]hospital acute sector is still 
[normal]hoovering
[normal] up 
[normal]the 
[normal]vast majority and increasing its share of total spend in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]will make a brief comment and then hand over to Jon Rouse to add to it, if 
[normal]I 
[normal]may. This is a problem that, at its heart, is caused by 
[normal]the 
[normal]fact that we have an 18
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]week waiting time target for physical health but no equivalent target for access to mental health. Unintentionally
[normal], because 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure this was never intended
[normal], 
[normal]that has tended to suck money into 
[normal]the 
[normal]area where people are being measured and highly accountable in a public way and away from mental health
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e have seen 
[normal]the 
[normal]consequences of that in additional winter pressures over 
[normal]the 
[normal]absence of easily accessible psychiatric liaison services, for example. 
[normal]I
[normal]n 
[normal]the 
[normal]new mandate we 
[normal]have 
[normal]committed ourselves to working towards fully costing out a mental health waiting times target in 
[normal]the 
[normal]next few months. Jon, do you want to add to that?
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: 
[normal]Yes
[normal]. You have to tackle this in a multi
[normal]faceted
[normal] way
[normal]. Some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things we ha
[normal]ve to focus on are as follows. The first is
[normal] information. We have a lot of information on mental health that is not properly analysed, understood and disseminated to commissioners in a usable form so that they can drive service improvement. Secondly, it is about commissioning itself
[normal],
[normal] and NHS England and Sir David may want to say more about this as they are do
[normal]ing a lot of work through 
[normal]the 
[normal]Commissioning A
[normal]ssembly and 
[normal]the 
[normal]academic networks to be able to improve 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality of local commissioning for mental health services. Thirdly, it is about standards themselves
[normal],
[normal] and we now have a proper outcomes framework for challenging localities for progress on mental health. Finally
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose it is a bit more philosophical
[normal], 
[normal]probably 
[normal]the 
[normal]model of provision for mental health over ma
[normal]ny years has become over
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]clinici
[normal]sed
[normal] and we have to get a better balanc
[normal]e between social and clinical. 
[normal]There is a big role for social work within that.
[normal]Q243 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]come back on one very serious issue
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which is 
[normal]section 136 and detentions
[normal]?
[normal] In 
[normal]the 
[normal]Devon and 
[normal]Cornwall
[normal] police area
[normal],
[normal] 25 children so far this year have been detained in cells instead of in an appropriate place of safety. Some of those children were as young as 12 and 13. That is an example of a gross situation where there is no parity of esteem. It would be unthinkable for a child with a broken leg to be waiting in a police cell for an assessment
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Can
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]panel reassure us that that will not be happening next year?
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: It is certainly unacceptable; t
[normal]hat is 
[normal]the 
[normal]first thing to say. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]good news is that there has been a reduction overall in 
[normal]the 
[normal]numbers of people who are having to be detai
[normal]ned in police cells, and clearly
[normal] we want to have as many people as possible in clinical settings when they are being assessed. One of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things we have been working on over 
[normal]the 
[normal]a
[normal]utumn is 
[normal]the 
[normal]development of a 
[normal]crisis care concordat
[normal],
[normal] which has brought together a whole range of organisations, including NHS England, 
[normal]the 
[normal]police, 
[normal]the 
[normal]ambulance service and 
[normal]the 
[normal]courts service
[normal],
[normal] to review from first principles how crisis care should work from pre
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]crisis
[normal]—
[normal]because often with people who have long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]standing mental health conditions you can plan for crisis
[normal]—
[normal]right through to recovery from crisis. We are probably about a month away from being in a position to publish that document
[normal],
[normal] and that will hold 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole system mutu
[normal]ally to account for progress. 
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]and again Sir David m
[normal]ay want to say more about this, 
[normal]Bruce Keogh
[normal]’
[normal]s review of urgent care is crucial here to make sure that 
[normal]the 
[normal]pathways that are defined work for people with mental health condit
[normal]ions as well as physical health conditions—
[normal]and, of course, where they have both physical and mental health issues.
[normal]Q244 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]ask how you 
[normal]think
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]“
[normal]any qualified provider
[normal]” 
[normal]system is going to help you achieve efficiency gains? CCGs have inherited 
[normal]the 
[normal]decisions of their predecessor PCTs
[normal],
[normal] who were forced, or required, to commit themselves to a number of contracts under AQP
[normal]. A
[normal]cross 
[normal]the 
[normal]country, not just in my own area, t
[normal]his has resulted in, for example, a high
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]street
[normal] optician—
[normal]a well
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]known name
[normal]—
[normal]providing hearing aids, 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure you know of that particular system. 
[normal]I
[normal]t has left 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCG with 
[normal]an impossible-to-
[normal]manage budget
[normal],
[normal] which has 
[normal]no upper limit, so long as p
[normal]atients can be driven in through 
[normal]the 
[normal]front door of this particula
[normal]r high
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]street
[normal] provider and 
[normal]the 
[normal]provider
[normal] will follow human nature or 
[normal]the 
[normal]commercial rationale of doing everything they can to attract them in, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]proper manner and within 
[normal]the 
[normal]rules, of course. 
[normal]How does that system help 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government achieve their efficiency gain
[normal], 
[normal]what monitoring are you undertaking
[normal],
[normal] and, if you are monitoring it, what decisions are you making with regard to h
[normal]ow 
[normal]you are going to roll it out
[normal] or
[normal],
[normal] indeed
[normal],
[normal] not roll it out any further because it is not providing you with a means by which you can achieve 
[normal]the 
[normal]efficiency gains you need?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Shall 
[normal]I 
[normal]start on that? It is clear that 
[normal]the 
[normal]intention of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Health and Social Care Act is that CCGs should be able to commission 
[normal]the 
[normal]services that they believe are in 
[normal]the 
[normal]interests of patients locally, so 
[normal]I 
[normal]would be concerned if any CCG felt that they were not able, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]case that you mentioned, 
[normal]to 
[normal]commission services that were in 
[normal]the 
[normal]interests of patients. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]interests of patients
[normal]” also includes
[normal] having a budget that they are abl
[normal]e to control at sensible levels, because, i
[normal]f they cannot do that
[normal],
[normal] that impacts on services available to them.
[normal]Q245 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] They cannot under AQP. They tell me—t
[normal]hey confirmed wit
[normal]h me—that they have no control; they inherit this. I
[normal]t is not just in NHS 
[normal]Kernow
[normal] but
[normal] across 
[normal]the 
[normal]country. Where they have inherited 
[normal]the 
[normal]AQP arrangement, my understanding is that they cannot control 
[normal]the 
[normal]upper limit of what patients demand from those services.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]They may have inherited a contract from 
[normal]the 
[normal]previous PCT and 
[normal]the 
[normal]contract will not be 
[normal]for ever
[normal], but in many NHS contracts there are measures in place to control demand. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know 
[normal]the 
[normal]individual details of that case.
[normal]Q246 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]No, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure that Sir David must be aware of these arrangements.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]most obvious place where we use 
[normal]“
[normal]any qualified provider
[normal]”
[normal] is in elective care in 
[normal]the 
[normal]sense that people can choose to go to any provider that they wish to
[normal], to have elective care,
[normal] and we do not put a ceiling on all that. We think that is a p
[normal]erfectly reasonable thing to do,
[normal] driven by patients and their choices. But as to 
[normal]the 
[normal]particular example that you give on hearing aids, if 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCG feel that it is inappropriate
[normal],
[normal] given 
[normal]the 
[normal]contractual framework that they operate in, they can withdraw from it.
[normal]Q247 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] They can at any time?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Yes, they can.
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you.
[normal]Q248 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Secretary 
[normal]of
[normal] State, 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to ask about available money and pay. Your Department has argued in a submission to 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS pay review bodies that there should be no general 1% salary increase in 2014, contrary to what had been previously indicated, and that progr
[normal]ession pay should also be ended
[normal] as part of a move to pay 
[normal]“
[normal]with stronger links to 
[normal]performance, quality and productivity.”
[normal] Do you believe that there needs to be continued pay restraint in order to make 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS funding settlement viable?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Yes, 
[normal]I 
[normal]do. 
[normal]I 
[normal]hope 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee will forgive me if 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not elaborate too much on this answer because we are in 
[normal]the 
[normal]middle of negotiations now over this. 
[normal]I 
[normal]will 
[normal]make two points. First, 
[normal]I 
[normal]dearly want to give NHS employees 
[normal]the 
[normal]1% rise that we want to give across 
[normal]the 
[normal]public sector. If money was no object, 
[normal]I 
[normal]would like to give them more because 
[normal]I 
[normal]think they are working extremely hard under very challenging circumstances, but budgetary constraints exist. 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]commitment that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government made was not 1% regardless of any other increments that you may be getting in your pay package; it was that everyone in 
[normal]the 
[normal]public sector should get at least a 1% rise
[normal],
[normal] and we want to honour that, but we do need to negotiate on 
[normal]the 
[normal]increments that are a part of many NHS contracts, which mean
[normal]s
[normal] that pay in certain contracts can go up by as much as 6% or 7% automatically. My concern is 
[normal]that, 
[normal]if we do not do that and we agreed to 
[normal]the 
[normal]1%, essentially an unaffordable 1% increase in 
[normal]the 
[normal]pay bill equates to about 10,000 front
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]line posts
[normal]. T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]thing that makes 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS different from other parts of 
[normal]the 
[normal]public sector is that we are expanding in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of people we employ at 
[normal]the 
[normal]front line
[normal],
[normal] and we want to employ more people, particularly in 
[normal]the 
[normal]wake of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Francis report. Hospitals want to employ another 4,000 nurses compared 
[normal]with
[normal] a year ago
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]want them to employ those extra nurses. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is something we need to do to meet our commitments under Francis. 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to make sure that trusts end up with a financial position that enables them to do that.
[normal]Q249 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Do you think it is a fair accusation to say that there is 
[normal]an 
[normal]over
[normal]-
[normal]reliance on pay restraint to enable 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS to meet its efficiency target
[normal]s
[normal]?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]We recognise that 
[normal]the 
[normal]pay freeze that we started this Parliament with is not sustainable and that is why we have moved to 1%. We also recognise
[normal]—
[normal]and Sir David, 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure, would want to comment on this
[normal]—
[normal]that that means we have to be even more imaginative in finding other ways to make efficiency savings because we cannot constantly rely on 
[normal]the 
[normal]kind of pay restraint that we have had to date.
[normal]Q250 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So you are not
[normal] 
[normal]considering
[normal] maintaining p
[normal]ay restra
[normal]int beyond 2014?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]No, we are; that is precisely what we are negotiating at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment. We do believe there needs to be pay restraint and it is very important that we are successful in that ambition.
[normal]Q251 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So there will be pay 
[normal]restraint
[normal] over 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole of 
[normal]the 
[normal]next spe
[normal]nding review period. We can take that as read?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]spending review period we have agreed is until 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of March 2016, so 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot comment on anything beyond that, but certainly until that period, yes, indeed
[normal],
[normal] there needs to be pay restraint.
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you.
[normal]Q252 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]This follows up, Sir 
[normal]David
[normal], 
[normal]the 
[normal]points 
[normal]that 
[normal]we put to you at our last meeting. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]broad question
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to ask—
[normal]I 
[normal]have some other points to make as well
[normal]—
[normal]is 
[normal]whether
[normal] you think you have enough information available about 
[normal]the 
[normal]way 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS operates, including on issues such as staffing and redundancy
[normal],
[normal] so that you can identify and address issues of concern
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]You may remember at our last meeting that my colleague Valerie 
[normal]Vaz
[normal] asked you about 
[normal]the 
[normal]figure for people being made redundant and then rehired
[normal],
[normal] and we went through a question and answer where in fact you said you did not have that information. But we have been sent 
[normal]the 
[normal]information in a table since and we have that here. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]figures are quite interesting in 
[normal]the 
[normal]table that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department sent us
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]They state 
[normal]that 19,126 
[normal]members of 
[normal]staff wer
[normal]e made redundant, 3,261 of whom 
[normal]have been rehired to 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS after redundancy, including 2,534 within one year
[normal],
[normal] and, fascinatingly, 403 within 28 days of being made redundant. 
[normal]At 
[normal]the 
[normal]same meeting you were asked a question about Ruth 
[normal]Carnall
[normal],
[normal] and you 
[normal]initially 
[normal]told us that she was not doing paid work for 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS after she had taken what turns out to be retirement
[normal],
[normal] but not redundancy
[normal],
[normal] and a pension, but we learned duri
[normal]ng 
[normal]the 
[normal]meeting via social media—and in 
[normal]fact you told us too—
[normal]that that was not 
[normal]the 
[normal]case and she was being paid for 
[normal]the 
[normal]work she is doing at 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS in Manchester. 
[normal]Now, 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand 
[normal]the 
[normal]policy. You told us that there was a policy that people who were made redundant would not then move into paid employment
[normal]—you said—
[normal]for a period of six months, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand there is also a policy around re
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employment
[normal] of people who have taken early r
[normal]etirement and pensions that “O
[normal]ffers of re
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]employment
[normal],
[normal] or payments for consultancy work
[normal],
[normal] are not expected to 
[normal]be made
[normal] 
[normal]to former S
[normal]cheme members who have taken early retirement
[normal] from 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS at public expense…” 
[normal]So here we have a policy around r
[normal]ehiring people after redundancy and
[normal] rehiring people 
[normal]who have taken early retirement
[normal] that just does not seem to work. We seem to have a practice of getting rid of posts for people via redundancy or early retirement, with sometimes very costly pay
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]offs
[normal], and then rehiring them. In some cases you are straightforwardly rehiring them as staff again, and that is shown in 
[normal]the 
[normal]table you have sent us, or they have been taken on in other parts of 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS as consultants and you are effectively paying them twice. 
[normal]T
[normal]his is really of concern. We thought it was a concern at 
[normal]the 
[normal]last meeting but we did not have much information from you. Can you explain how you have a policy 
[normal]that
[normal] you are just not upholding?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure Una will want to talk about 
[normal]the 
[normal]broader issue, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]can deal with it from 
[normal]the 
[normal]perspective of NHS England and what we have done. 
[normal]Yes, it is an absolutely legitimate thing to raise this whole issue about rehiring. We went through 
[normal]the 
[normal]process of 
[normal]the 
[normal]transition
[normal],
[normal] and we tried to reduce 
[normal]the 
[normal]amount of redundancy to 
[normal]the 
[normal]absolute limits of what we could do
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]s you know, we originally 
[normal]thought we would spend about
[normal] £1.5 billion on redundancy
[normal],
[normal] and in fact 
[normal]we 
[normal]only spent £600 million or £700 million on
[normal] it. So we managed to do that, a
[normal]lthough 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to say 
[normal]I 
[normal]have also been criticised for transferring too many people from 
[normal]the 
[normal]old system into 
[normal]the 
[normal]new one as well. But, nevertheless, we have reduced 
[normal]the 
[normal]redundancy bill significantly based on what we thought beforehand. Of course, we have delivered
[normal]—
[normal]we will have done by 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Parliament
[normal]—
[normal]£5.5 billion
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]worth
[normal] of savings
[normal] that we can reinvest in front-
[normal]line services, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]think is not to be ignored at all
[normal]; it is very important. 
[normal]In terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]people, you are absolutely right that we have a position where, legally, if someone is made redundant they can be re
[normal]-
[normal]employed within 
[normal]2
[normal]8 days. 
[normal]I 
[normal]wrote to all 
[normal]the 
[normal]senior people in 
[normal]the 
[normal]SHAs as part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]transition arrangement saying that 
[normal]I 
[normal]understood that was 
[normal]the 
[normal]case
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]I 
[normal]wanted them voluntarily to agree 
[normal]either 
[normal]not to be rehired or work as a consultant for at least six months.
[normal]Q253 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]That is 
[normal]not
[normal] happening.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]have no legal basis on which to do that. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have no power to make it happen. 
[normal]I 
[normal]just asked them not to do that. 
[normal]I 
[normal]can confirm, in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]very senior managers, that NHS England has not either funded or employed any of those people over 
[normal]the 
[normal]period. That is NHS England.
[normal]Q254 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Over which 
[normal]period
[normal], sorry?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Over 
[normal]the 
[normal]six months since 
[normal]the 
[normal]beginning of NHS England
[normal]’
[normal]s existence.
[normal]Q255 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Do you mean as employees or consultants?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Either.
[normal]Q256 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So 
[normal]what
[normal] about Ruth 
[normal]Carnall
[normal]?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]NHS 
[normal]England 
[normal]have not employed Ruth 
[normal]Carnall
[normal] in any capacity. 
[normal]Q257 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]She 
[normal]worked
[normal] in 
[normal]Manchester
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]The point 
[normal]I 
[normal]am trying to make i
[normal]s for NHS England. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]issue, of course, as you know, is
[normal] that 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS is not a single organisation. It is made up of almost 500 different employers, all of which have their own arrangements and it is
[normal]—
[normal]Q258 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Let me stop 
[normal]you
[normal] at that point. You have a policy that is impossible for you to enforce because now it is so fragmented that you do not have control over those parts of it. You can write and ask them not to do this
[normal],
[normal] and they can just ignore it. That is what has happened, is it not? Ruth 
[normal]Carnall
[normal] i
[normal]s one example
[normal], 
[normal]and heaven knows how many others there are
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not in any way doubting that s
[normal]he is a talented staff member, 
[normal]that she has skills and something to offer, but this is 
[normal]the 
[normal]use of public money. This is 
[normal]the 
[normal]use of public money
[normal]—
[normal]pay
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]offs
[normal] and redundancies and people taking pensions from 
[normal]the 
[normal]public purse and then being re
[normal]-
[normal]employed in another capacity and being paid 
[normal]for 
[normal]consultancy. Effectively, what we are seeing is people being paid twice from 
[normal]the 
[normal]same purse.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]completely understand that and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think you are absolutely right. That was why 
[normal]I 
[normal]wrote 
[normal]the 
[normal]letter out saying that 
[normal]I 
[normal]wanted people voluntarily to do it. Bu
[normal]t you are absolutely right—
[normal]I 
[normal]do not have 
[normal]the 
[normal]power at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment to enforce that
[normal]—
[normal]Q259 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] And 
[normal]no
[normal] one does.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]:
[normal] 
[normal]—
[normal]in CCGs
[normal],
[normal] foundation trusts or NHS trusts overall, so that power does not exist in 
[normal]the 
[normal]system as we operate at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment.
[normal]Q260 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] T
[normal]hat policy that 
[normal]I 
[normal]quoted parts of is effectively meaningless
[normal],
[normal] because you cannot stop people being rehired and you certainly cannot stop people coming back and being paid as consultants at all.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot, no, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]job that 
[normal]I 
[normal]do.
[normal]Q261 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So 
[normal]the 
[normal]policy that
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]quoted
[normal] from is meaningless. 
[normal]They are being paid twice. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know if 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary 
[normal]of S
[normal]tate wants to say how we come to have a policy that we cannot enforce. 
[normal]Mr Sharma:[bold] 
[normal]Is there anyone who can control that?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]first point 
[normal]I 
[normal]would make is that 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS is 1.7 million people strong
[normal],
[normal] and successive Governments, not just this Government, have concluded that it does not work to try and run it as a single structure with everyone reporting up directly to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State at 
[normal]the 
[normal]top of 
[normal]the 
[normal]pyramid
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]So 
[normal]successive Governments
[normal]—
[normal]for example, 
[normal]the 
[normal]last Government
[normal]—
[normal]introduced 
[normal]the 
[normal]policy on foundation trusts
[normal] that
[normal] operate as independent bodies. 
[normal]W
[normal]e do not have 
[normal]the 
[normal]power
[normal]—
[normal]Sir David is absolutely right
[normal]—
[normal]to stop 
[normal]some
[normal]one leaving one foundation trust and rejoining another, even though you are absolutely right to say that, ultimately, both salaries or consultancy figures are paid for by 
[normal]the 
[normal]taxpayer. 
[normal]W
[normal]e took that decision because we recognised that we needed to have a system that is
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Q262 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not think it is a 
[normal]question
[normal] of people moving, Secretary of State. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think it is a question of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reorganisation 
[normal]that
[normal] your Bill forced through and people being made redundant
[normal]—
[normal]in some cases, their structures going
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that 
[normal]is 
[normal]the 
[normal]case with Ruth 
[normal]Carnall
[normal]. H
[normal]er s
[normal]tructure disappeared, so there wa
[normal]s a redundan
[normal]cy pay
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]off
[normal]; there is 
[normal]an early retirement
[normal]. T
[normal]hese are very substantially highly paid people
[normal],
[normal] who are getting that amount of money and then just coming back
[normal] in through 
[normal]the 
[normal]revolving door as
[normal] consultants
[normal],
[normal] just popping up somewhere else in 
[normal]the 
[normal]country. It is not people moving. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]real issue is people being paid twice.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Okay. So if we come to reorganisations, which happened a number of times under 
[normal]the 
[normal]last Government as well as under this Government
[normal]— 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Not as expensively as this one, 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to say.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]This one is also saving a lot more money. 
[normal]Q263 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Point 
[normal]to
[normal] one that has cost £3 billion.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It is saving £5.5 billion, but that is a different discussion. As a result of what we have learned from this reorganisation
[normal]—
[normal]and indeed practised under previous reorganisations
[normal]—
[normal]we have now changed 
[normal]the 
[normal]rules
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]When n
[normal]ational arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length bodies are re
[normal]-
[normal]employing someone who has been working for another arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length b
[normal]ody or in a previous structure, if they are re-employed within a year, that person pays b
[normal]ack their redundancy on a pro
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]rata
[normal] basis. That is a change in 
[normal]the 
[normal]rules to deal with that issue.
[normal]Q264 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Does that apply to any of these people 
[normal]who have been re
[normal]hired?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]We cannot apply it retrospectively because people are entitled to their own contractual entitlements, but it is a rule that we have introduced. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know whether 
[normal]the 
[normal]Permanent Secretary wants to answer that.
[normal]Q265 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]You have 
[normal]rehired
[normal] 17% of 
[normal]the 
[normal]people 
[normal]who
[normal] were made redundant in 
[normal]the 
[normal]last three years, according to 
[normal]the 
[normal]figures 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department sent us, and that is a very substantial proportion; 17% have been taken back on again, a number of them within 28 days, ridiculously enough, and most
[normal] of them within one year. That smacks of appallingly bad planning—
[normal]that they were not able to be redeployed from 
[normal]the 
[normal]role you were moving them out of
[normal] into another one
[normal]. It smacks of carelessness with public money. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure that people outside 
[normal]here will not be impressed that you have policies that you cannot enforce
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal],
[normal] now that you have thought of a way of enforcing them
[normal],
[normal] you cannot do anything about 
[normal]the 
[normal]costs that have already been incurred. 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Let me ask 
[normal]the 
[normal]Permanent Secretary to come in 
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]will come back 
[normal]on that.
[normal]Una O’Brien[bold]: 
[normal]The first thing to say is that very significant
[normal] efforts were made to restrain 
[normal]the 
[normal]total amount of money spent on redundancy. That was a significant effort
[normal],
[normal] and it meant that a significant number of people who were entitled to redundancy payments under 
[normal]the 
[normal]rules set in 2006 did not get those payments but got jobs in 
[normal]the 
[normal]new system. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]facts bear out what David 
[normal]has said—
[normal]that a significant proportion of people employed in 
[normal]the 
[normal]new system are in different jobs
[normal], many of them,
[normal] and some of them have much bigger jobs
[normal]. B
[normal]ut 
[normal]the 
[normal]truth is that we did not spend a lot of money on redundancy that we would otherwise have spent. That was our focus and we were very
[normal], very
[normal] determined to keep that redundancy bill as low as possible. 
[normal]If 
[normal]I 
[normal]could come on to 
[normal]the 
[normal]next point
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Q266 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 19,000 staff have been made redundant
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]ith a good proportion of those coming back
[normal],
[normal] it does not follow through with what you are saying.
[normal]Una O’Brien[bold]: 
[normal]Currently
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]2006 rule is that
[normal],
[normal] if someone is re
[normal]-
[normal]employed within 28 days, they have to pay back their redundancy. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that rule is too lax and we now need to change 
[normal]it
[normal]. We need to change it so that, as 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary
[normal] 
[normal]State
[normal] has said, if you are re
[normal]-
[normal]employed within a year in another NHS organisation and you are in receipt of redundancy payment
[normal],
[normal] you pay it back pro rata. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would point out that it is absolutely true that you have identified for people who have very long service and who are on high salaries that their redundancy payments are significant, but it is most usually 
[normal]the 
[normal]case that people
[normal]’
[normal]s redundancy payments are relatively modest
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]o there can be a junior administrator made redundant on £15,000 or £20,000
[normal],
[normal] who, six months later, finds a job in another organisation, a job that was not available or vacant at 
[normal]the 
[normal]point at which they were made redundant. This is an industry and 
[normal]I 
[normal]do think that 
[normal]point 
[normal]needs to be
[normal] made.
[normal]Q267 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have given 
[normal]an 
[normal]example
[normal] of one of your most
[normal] high
[normal]ly
[normal] paid staff
[normal],
[normal] who has now been effectively paid twice.
[normal]Una O’Brien[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]wa
[normal]nt to come on to that, if may. 
[normal]The th
[normal]ird point is that 
[normal]it is well known, fo
[normal]r example, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]civil service that we have 
[normal]the 
[normal]Advisory Committee on Business Appointments
[normal] where there are arrangements
[normal],
[normal] if you are made redundant or you leave
[normal] for other reasons
[normal], particularly 
[normal]in 
[normal]a senior position, that you are restrained in 
[normal]the 
[normal]work that you do, particularly that you should obtain no commercial advantage from your experience. 
[normal]I 
[normal]now want all 
[normal]the 
[normal]arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length bodies of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department to follow 
[normal]the 
[normal]example 
[normal]that
[normal] David has 
[normal]set
[normal] in NHS England by beginning as he means to go on
[normal],
[normal] which is to set business rules equivalent 
[normal]to 
[normal]the 
[normal]civil s
[normal]ervice rules for NHS England. 
[normal]I 
[normal]now expect all 
[normal]the 
[normal]arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length bod
[normal]ies
[normal] for 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health to do that so that 
[normal]people’s 
[normal]expectations 
[normal]are 
[normal]the 
[normal]same as those
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] civil servants when they leave office, particularly people who have been in a job where they gain knowledge or contacts
[normal]. Before they move on to their next role or a
[normal]t 
[normal]the 
[normal]point at whi
[normal]ch they take up their next role,
[normal] they 
[normal]will 
[normal]have to get an agreement 
[normal]about 
[normal]whether they have to have a waiting period or step back for an appropriate amount of time so that we do not get 
[normal]the 
[normal]sort of situation that you have described. 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]It sounds as if you needed to have done that before
[normal],
[normal] because
[normal],
[normal] clearly
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]the 
[normal]reorganisation
[normal],
[normal] a very large number of 
[normal]managers—
[normal]you have n
[normal]ot supplied us with 
[normal]the 
[normal]figures, 
[normal]but we have had other 
[normal]figures in 
[normal]the 
[normal]House of Commons—who 
[normal]have been made redundant and rehired as well
[normal],
[normal] and there are examples of people 
[normal]who
[normal] are very highly paid
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]who
[normal] have taken packages and are n
[normal]ow coming back as consultants. 
[normal]You have given us 
[normal]the 
[normal]response, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that there will be a view outside her
[normal]e that this is not satisfactory;
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]his should have been dealt with earlier
[normal];
[normal] if you have policies now that you cannot make retrospective, you have used money from 
[normal]the 
[normal]public purse that you should not have done
[normal]; and 
[normal]this is not a satisfactory situation. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]There are several members of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee who want to come in
[normal] on this
[normal], but if we are going to spend all afternoon on 
[normal]it
[normal] we are not going to get
[normal]—
[normal]Q268 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]While 
[normal]we
[normal] are on pay, 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to ask a question about whe
[normal]re 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government currently lie
[normal] in respect of 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk, as 
[normal]I 
[normal]see it
[normal]—
[normal]and perhaps
[normal],
[normal] Secretary State
[normal], you
[normal] 
[normal]may
[normal] take a different view
[normal]—
[normal]about 
[normal]the 
[normal]possibility that foundation trusts, NHS trust
[normal]s, may 
[normal]introduce regional pay. 
[normal]You are aware that your predecessor took 
[normal]the 
[normal]view that
[normal],
[normal] while he was not going to direct 
[normal]the 
[normal]south
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]west consortium of 20 or so trusts to discontinue their activity of exploring 
[normal]the 
[normal]poss
[normal]ibility, at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Agenda for Change national negotiations concluded
[normal],
[normal] each of 
[normal]the 
[normal]trusts wrote to me and confirmed that they would abide by 
[normal]the 
[normal]national pay, terms and conditions
[normal],
[normal] providing they remained, as they put it, fit for purpose, which of course gave them 
[normal]the 
[normal]let
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]out of reintroducing this concept at a later stage. 
[normal]I 
[normal]want 
[normal]to be clear about whether, if NHS organisations suggested they might introduce 
[normal]the 
[normal]concept of lower
[normal] pay—
[normal]that is critical
[normal]—
[normal]in certain areas, 
[normal]that 
[normal]is something which, as a Department, you would take action against, 
[normal]that you would discourage.
[normal] What is 
[normal]the 
[normal]view of your Department on that issue?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]As a Department
[normal],
[normal] we subscribe to 
[normal]the 
[normal]principles behind autonomy and independence for foundation trusts. That is 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government policy and we want all hospitals over time to become foundation trusts. 
[normal]W
[normal]e really think it is a matter for them, but, as 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand it, most FTs, if not all, prefer to have national pay scales
[normal]. They fi
[normal]nd it easier to negotiate with their staff on 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis of them
[normal], 
[normal]providing those national pay scales are competitive and fair, both in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]employees and what 
[normal]the 
[normal]FTs want to deliver to their patients. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]example you cite was an example where 
[normal]the 
[normal]south
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]west consortium 
[normal]felt
[normal] that 
[normal]the 
[normal]national terms and conditions were not fair. Negotiations then proceeded. There was some flexibility on 
[normal]the 
[normal]union side and they were able to live with 
[normal]the 
[normal]result. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think everyone has ended up happy and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government 
[normal]are
[normal] happy as well.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie wants to talk about 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration fund
[normal],
[normal] but before that she wants 
[normal]to ask 
[normal]a very quick question on this subject and then we 
[normal]will move
[normal] on.
[normal]Q269 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Very quickly to round 
[normal]off
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]discussion that Barbara led, it seems that a very large and expensive loophole was left in 
[normal]the 
[normal]implementation of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reforms whereby people were able to get redundancy payment
[normal]s
[normal] and pensions from 
[normal]the 
[normal]health service and then go off into consultancy. It is commendable to write advice asking that these people do not take up any positions within 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS for six months after they have left
[normal],
[normal] but it is kind of after 
[normal]the 
[normal]horse has bolted. Secretary of State, are you happy with 
[normal]the 
[normal]way 
[normal]the 
[normal]reforms were implemented in leaving that large loophole open?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: Always, w
[normal]hen you do something on that scale, 
[normal]of course you 
[normal]learn lessons afterwards. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not think it is possible in a huge system like 
[normal]the 
[normal]health service to prevent people 
[normal]from 
[normal]leaving 
[normal]the 
[normal]health service 
[normal]and the
[normal]n becoming consultants
[normal]. I
[normal]ndeed
[normal],
[normal] it may be in 
[normal]the 
[normal]interests of 
[normal]the 
[normal]health service and patients that we are able to tap into 
[normal]the 
[normal]expertise of people on a time
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]limited
[normal] basis through a consultancy contract. But what we do not want is abuse of that system and we do not want 
[normal]the 
[normal]public to be paying twice. We have tried to learn 
[normal]the 
[normal]lessons from this reorganisation and other reorganisations by making some changes, as 
[normal]the 
[normal]Permanent Secretary outlined. 
[normal]B
[normal]ut 
[normal]the 
[normal]overall point 
[normal]I 
[normal]would make about these changes
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]do think it is important to take 
[normal]the 
[normal]overall context
[normal]—
[normal]is that
[normal],
[normal] by removing 23,000 administrative posts, including 8,000 managers, we are able to employ 6,500 more doctors. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NHS is able to do 800,000 more operations every year on broadly 
[normal]the 
[normal]same budget
[normal],
[normal] and that is because we have moved a lot of money from back
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]office
[normal] functions to 
[normal]the 
[normal]front line. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that 
[normal]that, 
[normal]overall
[normal],
[normal] represents a massive increase in value for money for every taxpayer
[normal]’
[normal]s pound that goes into 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS.
[normal]Q270 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] I
[normal]n terms of 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]performance being good overall, this is an expensive loophole that, with hindsight, it would have been very good to close before we had this problem arise rather than have to write letters after 
[normal]the 
[normal]event asking people not to take up lucrative posts.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]don’t think it would have been right not to do—
[normal]Some of these things are quite complex and it is not as easy as just wishing 
[normal]the 
[normal]problem would go away or making a simple change
[normal],
[normal] because people have rights under employment law. 
[normal]W
[normal]here there are loopholes that are easy 
[normal]to deal with, we have done that.
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]ne of those is 
[normal]the 
[normal]new 12
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]month rule that we are implementing acr
[normal]oss 
[normal]the 
[normal]system. I
[normal]t is not possible to implement those kinds of rules on a 
[normal]very 
[normal]localised level, but
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]obviously 
[normal]where we can, we do everything 
[normal]possible 
[normal]to make sure we get best value for money.
[normal]Chair:[bold] Let us turn to i
[normal]ntegration transformation. 
[normal]Q271 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] Absolutely; t
[normal]hat is what 
[normal]I 
[normal]am 
[normal]burning
[normal] to ask about. What will 
[normal]the 
[normal]impact of 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration transformation fund of £3.8 billion 
[normal]be 
[normal]and can you clarify whether this is new money or not?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It is not new money in that it comes from 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS budget
[normal],
[normal] and it is now called, inc
[normal]identally, a much improved name—
[normal]the 
[normal]“better care fund”—
[normal]which 
[normal]I 
[normal]hope will make it much less of a mouthful for 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee and indeed all of us. It represents an additional £2 billion going from 
[normal]the 
[normal]annual NHS budget into integrated support through 
[normal]the 
[normal]health and social care system. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]intention is to improve out
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]of
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]hospital
[normal] services for some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]most frail and vulnerable older people who use 
[normal]the 
[normal]social care system by giving them a joined
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]up
[normal] service and by being a catalyst. 
[normal]I
[normal]n order to access that money
[normal],
[normal] CCGs and local authorities will have to jointly commission services. There is a list of things 
[normal]that have been on 
[normal]the 
[normal]c
[normal]hairman
[normal]’
[normal]s list of requirements for any integrated care package for many years now 
[normal]that
[normal] will have to be done in order to access this money. It is deliberately designed to be a sufficiently large sum of money 
[normal]so 
[normal]that no one will feel that they cannot be bothered with accessing it. They will feel they have to access it
[normal]. T
[normal]hings like recor
[normal]d sharing will be part of it,
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]having a named accountable clinician responsible for each and every one of those vulnerable older people will also be a part of it. But it comes from 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS budget. 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]other point about it is that we expect there will be significant savings both to 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS and 
[normal]the 
[normal]social care sector in terms of, particularly, omission avoidance by proactively looking after people better in 
[normal]the 
[normal]community.
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you.
[normal]Q272 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]There are real 
[normal]concerns
[normal] about whether 
[normal]the 
[normal]planning for 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration fund is going well. In fact, we have had concerns that it is not going well at all. 
[normal]A
[normal] witness 
[normal]from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Nuffield Trust said: “M
[normal]y anxiety is that planning is happening too late for this and it is happening too late to co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordinate with 
[normal]the 
[normal]acute sector.”
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n 
[normal]the 
[normal]next panel 
[normal]that 
[normal]day we had witnesses from 
[normal]the 
[normal]LGA
[normal],
[normal] who did not talk about planning for 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration fund but talked about talking and developing relationships. So it seemed that 
[normal]the 
[normal]LGA representative evidence bore out what we had heard from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Nuffield Trust. 
[normal]I
[normal]t seems that planning for integration is not robust enough
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think there are two things related to that. 
[normal]First, there
[normal] is a fear that 
[normal]the 
[normal]money will not be spent as effectively
[normal], and, s
[normal]econdly, 
[normal]that 
[normal]you will not make 
[normal]the 
[normal]savings that you just talked about. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]real fear is that there could be problems in 2015
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16 and that we will not see effective integrated working established. What we 
[normal]will see is just money going in
[normal] 
[normal]to soak up press
[normal]ures, of which there are plenty—obviously pressures in A and E and
[normal] very substantial pressures around social care. That is what we have heard and we are concerned. Are you concerned and what can be done?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It is absolutely right to express that concern because it is very important that this is a real transformation
[normal],
[normal] not just either a cosmetic transformation or a continuation of what we had before, which was much more limited in its ambition. But we have tried to mitigate 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk of that happening through a very aggressive timetable. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]fund is for 
[normal]the 
[normal]financial year 2015
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16, so it starts in April 2015, and we have said that we require all CCGs and local authorities to have put together their plans by April 
[normal]2014, a
[normal] whole year in advance. That gives us time to go through those plans in detail to check they are robust
[normal],
[normal] but also, importantly, for 
[normal]the 
[normal]plans that are good
[normal],
[normal] we believe that many local authorities and CCGs will not want to wait. Even though they are not going to get access to 
[normal]the 
[normal]fund till 2015, they will probably want to start a lot of 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration well before April 2015 and indeed make it part of their 2014
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]15 cycle because of 
[normal]the 
[normal]prospect of significant savings being made. But 
[normal]I 
[normal]think you are absolutely right to say that
[normal],
[normal] with a plan of this scale, it is all about 
[normal]the 
[normal]implementation and we need to monitor that very carefully.
[normal]Q273 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]We did not 
[normal]hear
[normal] anything that gave us a lot of confidence that it was happening
[normal] 
[normal]because 
[normal]the 
[normal]LGA representative talked about relationship building and that is 
[normal]the 
[normal]stage they were at. 
[normal]I
[normal]f you are expecting to see plans in four or five months, 
[normal]the 
[normal]people we have heard from do not suggest that is happening. One of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not want to rehearse everything that happened in 
[normal]the 
[normal]debate yesterday
[normal]—
[normal]is that my own local authority, which is suffering from cuts, has had very substantial management resource 
[normal]cuts. It has lost a chief executive—that post has been cut—and 
[normal]the 
[normal]previous chief executive
[normal]’s
[normal] job is now shared between three former deputies. There j
[normal]ust is not 
[normal]the 
[normal]resource there. 
[normal]You cannot take 20%, for instance, out of social care and not lose managers and people 
[normal]who
[normal] will do that planning. From what 
[normal]I 
[normal]see locally in my area, there are not 
[normal]the 
[normal]people on 
[normal]the 
[normal]ground in local government to do that planning. They have just spent all their time and had 
[normal]the 
[normal]auditor in
[normal],
[normal] and been talking about how they are going to make £75 million more cuts. They have to get that budget right because, if not, your colleague in DCLG will come in and do it for them. Where is 
[normal]the 
[normal]resource that is going to 
[normal]do
[normal] this planning
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]hat we have heard over 
[normal]the 
[normal]last number of weeks is that it is not happening yet
[normal].
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]We have said that we require those plans by April, so that is a pretty important deadline for all local authorities and CCGs because those are 
[normal]the 
[normal]rules of 
[normal]the 
[normal]fund. 
[normal]W
[normal]e will be following up very closely. But we recognise 
[normal]the 
[normal]kind of challenges that you are talking about. It is very tough, particularly for local authorities
[normal],
[normal] but actually tough for CCGs as well because they have huge pressures on their budgets. 
[normal]T
[normal]his is something that is overwhelmingly in everybody
[normal]’s interests. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]north-
[normal]west has made some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]best progress towards integrated care of anywhere in 
[normal]the 
[normal]country actually.
[normal]Q274 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]You 
[normal]have
[normal] not mentioned 
[normal]Torbay
[normal].
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]And indeed Torbay
[normal]—
[normal]Torbay
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]north-
[normal]west.
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]Stand by. 
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: 
[normal]Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]add 
[normal]one point?
[normal] 
[normal]It is 
[normal]a counter
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]balance
[normal] in terms o
[normal]f what could give us confidence.
[normal] In 
[normal]the 
[normal]summer
[normal],
[normal] we asked for applications to be pioneers for integration
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]remember at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time 
[normal]that 
[normal]we had a bit of a sweepstake in 
[normal]the 
[normal]office in terms of how many bids we would get
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]chose 
[normal]the 
[normal]highest number
[normal] 
[normal]and said 35. We actually got 99 and some of those had more than one local authority in them, so we had well over 100 of 
[normal]the 
[normal]152 upper tier authorities bidding to be integration pioneers and putting all 
[normal]the 
[normal]work with their CCGs and their providers into those applications. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think there is a real momentum out there. 
[normal]I 
[normal]travel pretty extensively around 
[normal]the 
[normal]country visiting localities. Most places are planning pretty transformational integration models 
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]have high hopes that that will be reflected in 
[normal]the 
[normal]plans.
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]It might be that people were more optimistic in 
[normal]the 
[normal]summer than they are when they are facing winter pressures, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]have reflected to you what we have heard over 
[normal]the 
[normal]last few weeks from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Nuffield Trust and from 
[normal]the 
[normal]LGA
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e can only tell you what we hear.
[normal]Q275 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] Now o
[normal]n to 
[normal]Torbay
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]am very glad that they are an integration pioneer. Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]touch on 
[normal]the 
[normal]impact of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Care Bill
[normal],
[normal] because 
[normal]the 
[normal]Care Bill is going to impose many new statutory responsibilities on councils? If 
[normal]I 
[normal]look, say, at an area like Torbay, they are going to have a crunch year in 2015 when their projected funding will fall to below 90% of their projected expenditure
[normal], 
[normal]and that is not including all 
[normal]the 
[normal]new commitments they will have
[normal]. U
[normal]nfortunately
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]impact of that
[normal], it
[normal] seems to me
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]that there is a risk that
[normal],
[normal] because everything will have to go on t
[normal]heir statutory responsibilities,
[normal] there will be nothing left to fund 
[normal]the 
[normal]kind of projects around 
[normal]the 
[normal]voluntary sector that provide all 
[normal]the 
[normal]wellbeing that was 
[normal]the 
[normal]stated aim of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Bill. 
[normal]H
[normal]ow concerned 
[normal]are 
[normal]you, Secretary of State, that we may not be able to put in place a lot of 
[normal]the 
[normal]good intention around wellbeing in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Care Bill because of that funding pressure
[normal]?
[normal] In 
[normal]Torbay
[normal]’
[normal]s case, just in 
[normal]the 
[normal]next two years
[normal],
[normal] they 
[normal]will
[normal] hav
[normal]e 
[normal]to take out between £22 million and £27 million
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]elastic can only stretch so far
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]s you will know, there is no fat on 
[normal]the 
[normal]bone left. They have already done 
[normal]the 
[normal]bul
[normal]k of 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration that other
[normal] areas have not even started.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]would not want to underestimate 
[normal]the 
[normal]financial challenges facing local authorities. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think it is very tough and it is very tough in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS, as you know
[normal],
[normal] as well
[normal], b
[normal]ut that is why we are seeing such imagination and energy going into thinking about new ways of working
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]ometimes it is at those times of financial pressure that people are at their most imaginative
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that is one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reasons why Jon Rouse found such enthusiasm for 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration pioneers and one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reasons why people will really take seriously 
[normal]the 
[normal]plans 
[normal]that we put forward for 
[normal]the 
[normal]better care fund. 
[normal]I 
[normal]know Torbay has also been one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]pioneers when it comes to integration, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]think there are a lot of things 
[normal]where,
[normal] even in 
[normal]Torbay
[normal], we can do a lot better than we are currently doing
[normal]. F
[normal]or example, 
[normal]as to 
[normal]the 
[normal]use of technology, 
[normal]the 
[normal]new GP contract includes agreement from GPs that has not existed before surrounding 
[normal]the 
[normal]use of 
[normal]the 
[normal]GP record
[normal],
[normal] which, with patients
[normal]’
[normal] consent, will now be able to be used throughout 
[normal]the 
[normal]system electronically. So some very exciting things can happen, but 
[normal]the 
[normal]truth is
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think this relates to 
[normal]the 
[normal]very earliest discussion
[normal]—
[normal]we absolutely need them to happen at pace because we need to make 
[normal]the 
[normal]productivity improvements deliver within 
[normal]the 
[normal]budgets.
[normal]Q276 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]come 
[normal]back
[normal] to that
[normal],
[normal] because within 
[normal]Torbay
[normal], as you know, they have already done a huge amount of 
[normal]the 
[normal]work that ot
[normal]her areas have not even started?
[normal] They have 
[normal]already 
[normal]cut their acute beds
[normal] and
[normal] have 
[normal]the 
[normal]lowest, if you like, h
[normal]ospital admissions in 
[normal]the 
[normal]south-
[normal]west; they are doing incredibly well nationally on scales for early discharge; they already have in 
[normal]p
[normal]lace all those mechanisms for 
[normal]rapid equipment 
[normal]and a single care co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]ordinator—
[normal]all these kinds of things. 
[normal]I 
[normal]wonder whether they are going to be able, even with 
[normal]the 
[normal]measures you have outlined, to make sufficient savings and where it is all going to come from. Do you feel 
[normal]that 
[normal]we are going to have to see an increase in overall fund
[normal]ing for 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS in social care—
[normal]new money coming into 
[normal]the 
[normal]syst
[normal]em—
[normal]for it to work?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]think everyone is going to hav
[normal]e to live within their budgets—
[normal]budgets that were agreed in 
[normal]the 
[normal]2015
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16 spending settlement. 
[normal]Indeed, 
[normal]I 
[normal]know that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Labour
[normal] party have said if they win 
[normal]the 
[normal]next election they will stick to those spending limits in 
[normal]the 
[normal]first year of a new Parliament as well. 
[normal]W
[normal]e are in a very invidious position nationally of having to deal with 
[normal]the 
[normal]deficit and that means we are going to have to live within those spending limits. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would say that 
[normal]the 
[normal]kind of vision that you have had in Torbay bodes extremely well because you have shown imagination
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]ability of different parts of Government to work together has been tried and tested there
[normal],
[normal] which should mean that you are more than up to meeting that challenge
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]ut 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not want to pretend it is going to be easy. 
[normal]Q277 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think
[normal] part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]scepticism of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee about 
[normal]the 
[normal]pace and scale of necessary change going on in 
[normal]the 
[normal]system might derive from 
[normal]the 
[normal]relative absence of major proposals for service change affecting disinvestment from traditional models of care. Given 
[normal]the 
[normal]point you were just making about 
[normal]the 
[normal]resource constraints being here for 
[normal]the 
[normal]medium term, 
[normal]the 
[normal]proposition that there is somethi
[normal]ng beyond imaginative thinking—i.e.
[normal] imaginative action
[normal]—would be more credible, would it not, 
[normal]if we were seeing significant resource transfers out of 
[normal]the 
[normal]acute sector into 
[normal]the 
[normal]community service, whereas what we are 
[normal]actually 
[normal]seeing is resources increasingly drifting into 
[normal]the 
[normal]acute sector and out of community and primary care?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: T
[normal]hat is a fair point to make
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]I 
[normal]would say that 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]better care fund is a very good example of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reverse happening because that is money that, by and large, is not going to be spent in 
[normal]the 
[normal]acute sector at all. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that is 
[normal]the 
[normal]first 
[normal]really 
[normal]significant step
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]s a result of 
[normal]the 
[normal]better care fund
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]QIPP 
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Q278 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Do we not have to establish in 
[normal]the 
[normal]policy community
[normal]’
[normal]s mind 
[normal]the 
[normal]principle that 
[normal]the 
[normal]better care fund, if it is to be real, means more community
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]based
[normal] 
[normal]services, which means, in a cash-
[normal]limited budget, disinvestment from acute services
[normal],
[normal] which, 
[normal]the 
[normal]NAO says, are meeting need that never ought to have arisen?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]would say 
[normal]“
[normal]less money
[normal]”
[normal] rather than 
[normal]“
[normal]disinvestment
[normal]”.
[normal] 
[normal]L
[normal]ess money means more efficient use of resources, but 
[normal]it 
[normal]does mean 
[normal]less money in 
[normal]the 
[normal]acute sector. A
[normal]s a result 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]better care fund, which is going to be real, we have to increase 
[normal]the 
[normal]QIPP savings that we will be requiring from around £4.5 billion a year currently to around £5.5 billion in 2015
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16
[normal], and w
[normal]e will have to find that extra money
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am very happy to talk to you about how we can do that
[normal],
[normal] but, yes, we will have to make savings because it will mean less cash spent in 
[normal]the 
[normal]acute sector.
[normal]Q279 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not want to hog it, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]guess
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]would be more comfortable that it was more than 
[normal]“
[normal]early stage discussions
[normal]”
[normal] if we were seeing some dust being thrown up by these proposals for 
[normal]“less money”,
[normal] to use your phrase
[normal],
[normal] rather than disinvestment. I, like you, prefer that formulation; it is easier to understand.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: Perhaps 
[normal]I 
[normal]can re
[normal]assure you by saying that we do intend, before 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of March, to publish how we will get to 
[normal]the 
[normal]necessary QIPP savings for 2015
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]that will show 
[normal]how we think we can deliver that for that period of time. But there is a lot of work happening right 
[normal]now in order to firm up 
[normal]the 
[normal]realistic possibilities for saving money. We can go into those now if you like, but that is
[normal]—
[normal]  
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]We do not have time to do that because 
[normal]I 
[normal]know Andrew wants to go into 
[normal]the 
[normal]implications of this competition
[normal] policy—
[normal]some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]points that Sir David was making when he was last here.
[normal]Q280 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] In fact 
[normal]I 
[normal]will start with a quote from 
[normal]you, 
[normal]Sir David
[normal],
[normal] on 5 November when you were before 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee where you described that we have a problem 
[normal]that
[normal] may need legisla
[normal]tive change. If 
[normal]I 
[normal]may quote: “...c
[normal]ompetition was a tool to improve quality
[normal],
[normal] to be used when commissioners felt it was 
[normal]the 
[normal]right thing to do, not something that
[normal] would be brought in externally…
[normal]For whatever reason, legislatively and in practice, that is not what is happening. 
[normal]What is happening at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment…we are in my view
[normal] getting bogged down in a morass of competition law
[normal],
[normal] which is causing significant cost 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]system.
[normal]” 
[normal]My question to you, Secretary of State, is
[normal],
[normal] do you agree with Sir David? Do you think that competition law is resulting in this morass and indeed is costing more than it is saving?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]believe that what is happening on 
[normal]the 
[normal]ground is not what 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act intended as much as we want. 
[normal]W
[normal]e intended with 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act that local commissioners—GPs—
[normal]would have 
[normal]the 
[normal]power to commission services in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that they believed was right for patients. They are operating under 
[normal]the 
[normal]same procurement rules as 
[normal]the 
[normal]PCTs did
[normal],
[normal] but they are new teams of people and they are finding that quite onerous. My own view is that we need to look at why that is and
[normal],
[normal] in particular
[normal],
[normal] whether there is advice and support we can give them so that they do not feel they are getting bogged down in that competition law. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not think that it is a case of 
[normal]the 
[normal]competition law that, as 
[normal]I 
[normal]say, 
[normal]the 
[normal]PCTs themselves were operating under necessarily being wrong, but we need to make sure that CCGs feel they have 
[normal]the 
[normal]autonomy and 
[normal]the 
[normal]ability to commission in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that is in 
[normal]the 
[normal]interests of patients.
[normal]Q281 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] I
[normal]t 
[normal]is 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]CCGs that need tutoring and support, as it were, through this process
[normal]?
[normal] You would not agree with Sir David that there is a prospect for legislative change to achieve 
[normal]the 
[normal]clarity that is needed in order to get 
[normal]the 
[normal]efficiencies 
[normal]that 
[normal]are clearly not being delivered
[normal].
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]efficiencies are being delivered by a lot of CCGs
[normal]—
[normal]by 
[normal]the 
[normal]way
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not think 
[normal]this
[normal] is a problem that affects all CCGs
[normal]—
[normal]and, you know, all 
[normal]the 
[normal]legislation that we pass as a Government we keep under review to make sure that 
[normal]the 
[normal]practical way it is being implemented on 
[normal]the 
[normal]ground is in accordance with our intentions when we passed 
[normal]the 
[normal]legislation
[normal];
[normal] and that is what we
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]will continue to do.
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]Unless anyone else wants to come in on that, 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to ask a question
[normal]—
[normal]  
[normal]Q282 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]ask a brie
[normal]f question? If NHS England comes
[normal] to you with a proposal to change 
[normal]the 
[normal]legislation to ensure that 
[normal]the 
[normal]competition law is not an inhibition to necessary change, that is something that in principle you are pre
[normal]pared to promote?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Of course 
[normal]I 
[normal]would listen to them very carefully because 
[normal]I 
[normal]want 
[normal]the 
[normal]commissioning process to work and it is really important that it should work
[normal]. S
[normal]o 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to make sure that 
[normal]the 
[normal]intentions of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act are reflected in what happens on 
[normal]the 
[normal]ground. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not think we are at that stage yet. 
[normal]A
[normal]s 
[normal]I 
[normal]say, CCGs are new organisations
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]they 
[normal]are operating under 
[normal]the 
[normal]same procurement framework as their
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PCT predecessors, but, of course, PCTs were long 
[normal]established
[normal] and
[normal] had lots of people who were used to dealing with procurement. EU procurement rules are a nightmare at 
[normal]the 
[normal]best of times. Having run my own private company, 
[normal]I 
[normal]experienced them on a number of occasions
[normal],
[normal] so 
[normal]I 
[normal]can well understand 
[normal]the 
[normal]frustrations, but it is very much my job to listen to what NHS England say
[normal],
[normal] to make sure that CCGs are able to do what 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act intended.
[normal]Q283 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]will then move
[normal] on to a 
[normal]related
[normal] issue, 
[normal]which is 
[normal]the 
[normal]relationship between tariff funding and 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk or 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential perverse consequences of cherry
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]picking
[normal] that might happen in 
[normal]the 
[normal]system, whic
[normal]h 
[normal]I 
[normal]have raised before with you and we have corresponded on it, 
[normal]and indeed with Sir David and Richard Douglas a year ago wh
[normal]en we first raised this issue. 
[normal]We were told 
[normal]at that stage—a year ago, that is—
[normal]that there was a concern about 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential risk of perverse consequences
[normal];
[normal] that certain providers would, in effect, cream off 
[normal]the 
[normal]easier work and therefore profit from 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff arrangements and not undertake 
[normal]the 
[normal]more complex work because 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff system enabled them to do that
[normal];
[normal] and that you
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]or at least
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS commissioning b
[normal]oard
[normal],
[normal] were undertaking a review. 
[normal]Y
[normal]o
[normal]u were very specific last year—
[normal]and inde
[normal]ed, Mr Douglas, you were clear—
[normal]that it was 
[normal]the 
[normal]commissioning b
[normal]oard
[normal]’
[normal]s responsibility to 
[normal]undertake
[normal] a review and to redesign 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff system to ensure that such unintended consequences did not occur. We sought clarity on that particular point and wanted to be absolutely clear that it was not Monitor
[normal]’
[normal]s role
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou were clear that it was not Monitor
[normal]’s role;
[normal] they were there purely to inject 
[normal]the 
[normal]prices into 
[normal]the 
[normal]system, but 
[normal]the 
[normal]design itself was 
[normal]for 
[normal]the 
[normal]commissioning b
[normal]oard. Is that right
[normal],
[normal] and what progress have you made in 
[normal]the 
[normal]last year 
[normal]towards
[normal] achieving this outcome?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]In terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]basic approach, you are absolutely right. In broad terms, 
[normal]the 
[normal]commissioning board sets 
[normal]the 
[normal]structure of what 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff should deliver and Monitor attaches a price to that
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here are some elements around 
[normal]the 
[normal]edges, but that is 
[normal]the 
[normal]broad structure. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]position for next year for 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff is, broadly speaking, that it is steady state. There has not been and will not be a fundamental change to 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff for next year. It is now a matter again for NHS England and Monitor to work through what 
[normal]the 
[normal]next stage is
[normal],
[normal] but there has been a deliberate decision for next year that we will keep 
[normal]it
[normal] broadly as it is. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know whether Davi
[normal]d wants to add anything on that.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]No, only to say that 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff is being published 
[normal]I 
[normal]think today or tomorrow by Monitor. We have had our input into all that. We think that
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff
[normal],
[normal] we have taken 
[normal]the 
[normal]right balance between changes and continuity to enable trusts to have as much certainty as they can about 
[normal]the 
[normal]future. But in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]particular point that you make, if an individual commissioner or trust believes that a provider is acting in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that you describe
[normal]—i.e. for other reasons, 
[normal]selecting their
[normal] patients on 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis of that—that is a matter for Monitor. 
[normal]That would be a complaint that could be made to Monitor and Monitor would investigate and take 
[normal]the 
[normal]action that was required.
[normal]Q284 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]On 
[normal]what
[normal] basis? 
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: Monitor has a responsibility—
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff has a responsibility—
[normal]both to improve services to patients and also to enhance integration
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f in those circumstances they find a provider 
[normal]is acting against that interest—i.e.
[normal] against 
[normal]the 
[normal]interests of p
[normal]atients in those circumstances—
[normal]it can take action
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Q285 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]But you 
[normal]know
[normal] that this is going on all 
[normal]the 
[normal]time. You know this is going on all 
[normal]the 
[normal]time because you know that a lot of providers are not taking 
[normal]the 
[normal]more complex 
[normal]patients
[normal],
[normal] and they have been set up to provide a system, particularly in 
[normal]the 
[normal]area of elective care, where they cannot. So that is going on anyway.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sorry—
[normal]you were suggesting 
[normal]that 
[normal]people were doing it
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou are absolutely right that there are hip and knee providers
[normal] and
[normal] people who provide heart surgery, but that is part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]segmentation of 
[normal]the 
[normal]way in which 
[normal]the 
[normal]service is delivered, is it not?
[normal]Q286 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]It is
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]any
[normal] patient 
[normal]who
[normal] comes to them with a set of co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]morbidities
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]who 
[normal]represents an anaesthetic risk 
[normal]that
[normal] they are not prepared to take on, clearly they have designed a service that is cherry
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]picking
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]easier patients
[normal],
[normal] for which they are then being paid a decent tariff to provide a service only to those patients and not to others.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: T
[normal]here are two separate issues here. You are absolutely right that in some circumstances, 
[normal]in some stand
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]alone elective units, it is not safe for them to treat people with a lot of co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]morbidities
[normal],
[normal] but that seems to me 
[normal]the 
[normal]right thing. You would expect them not 
[normal]to 
[normal]do it.
[normal]Q287 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]No, you are twisting 
[normal]the 
[normal]tables on me—
[normal] 
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: Sorry.
[normal]Andrew George: —[bold]which is a fair point.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]issue is that
[normal],
[normal] in those circumstances
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]providers that are providing those elective services in limited circumstances are being paid at a rate that does not properly reflect 
[normal]the 
[normal]relatively low risk of patients that they take on
[normal]. T
[normal]hat is not reflected in other settings where they take on significantly more complex patients
[normal], and
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]tariff does not properly reflect that for them.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: If you could give me examples
[normal] that would be great, and 
[normal]I 
[normal]will investigate the
[normal]m
[normal]. 
[normal]Q288 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] Y
[normal]ou do not accept that this is a theme 
[normal]that has been raised with you?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]No, it has absolutely be
[normal]en
[normal] raised with me
[normal],
[normal] but on almost every occasion 
[normal]where 
[normal]we have dealt with it in detail
[normal],
[normal] we have found it either to be not 
[normal]the 
[normal]case or people 
[normal]have put in 
[normal]action to change it straight away.
[normal]Q289 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]Last time 
[normal]we
[normal] discussed this,
[normal] 
[normal]you said that you would be road-
[normal]testing your proposed redesigned tarif
[normal]f system.  Where did you road-
[normal]test
[normal] it and what were 
[normal]the 
[normal]outcomes? 
[normal]Can we read 
[normal]the 
[normal]report on your road-
[normal]testing, please? 
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]can do you a note
[normal] on all that.
[normal]Q290 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to go back 
[normal]to
[normal] some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]answers you gave my two colleagues, Barbara 
[normal]Keeley
[normal] and Charlotte Leslie. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]point they were trying to make
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]which we did not quite get an answer
[normal],
[normal] is that it is as a result of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reorganisation that took place that this issue arose about 
[normal]the 
[normal]rehiring
[normal]. God bless Norman St
[normal] John
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]Stevas
[normal] for having a Select Committee structure, otherwise you would not have come back to us with information and perhaps you would not have discovered this loophole. Is that correct?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: “
[normal]G
[normal]od bless Norman St John
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]Stevas
[normal]”
[normal] was not a phrase 
[normal]I 
[normal]was expecting 
[normal]to 
[normal]hear this afternoon. 
[normal]Listen, 
[normal]I 
[normal]recognise that when you do any reorganisation you learn lessons
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS has probably had more than its fair share of reorganisations over recent decades
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is 
[normal]why we have decided to make this very profound and significant change after this one, which was to say that
[normal],
[normal] if people rejoined 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS within 12 months of leaving 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS as part of 
[normal]a 
[normal]reorganisation
[normal],
[normal] they should repay any redundancy
[normal] money they were given on a pro-
[normal]rata
[normal] basis. So we have learned that. 
[normal]A
[normal]ll 
[normal]I 
[normal]would say is that in terms of value for money
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sorry to repeat myself
[normal]—
[normal]the 
[normal]only reason that we are able now to be doing 600,000 more el
[normal]ective operations, and
[normal] seeing 1.2 million more people every year in A and E
[normal],
[normal] is because we have more people at 
[normal]the 
[normal]front line
[normal],
[normal] and that was made possible by this
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]reorganisation. 
[normal]O
[normal]verall
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think it was a very big improvement in value for money because it did allow more resources to be 
[normal]invested 
[normal]in 
[normal]the 
[normal]front line, which is what we needed to do.
[normal]Q291 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]congratulate
[normal] you on your selective memory, but there was a transition and then a pause
[normal],
[normal] and a number of people raised issues
[normal]—
[normal]professionals and we as a Select Committee
[normal] did—
[normal]about 
[normal]the 
[normal]Health and Social Care Act and what was going to happen. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is clear from 
[normal]the
[normal] letter that you sent 
[normal]me—
[normal]and
[normal],
[normal] obviously
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am a bit upset
[normal] really—that
[normal] in 
[normal]one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]sentences you say, “T
[normal]he Department holds information 
[normal]relating to
[normal] NHS managers who have been made redundant
[normal],
[normal] but does not hold information on numbers re
[normal]-
[normal]hired as management consultants.
[normal]” 
[normal]Are you saying that money is being paid out of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health and you have no idea who it is being paid to?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]We make very significant multi
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]million
[normal] and multi
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]billion
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]pound
[normal] grants to other organisations. We have 
[normal]the 
[normal]second biggest bu
[normal]dget in Government. Then we as
[normal]sure how 
[normal]the 
[normal]money is spent with all those organisations, which is a very important part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]role.
[normal]Q292 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] Do you know that answer? D
[normal]oes someone know 
[normal]the 
[normal]answer?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]We do not know exactly how much money is spent by consultants in every single NHS organisation
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]question we have to ask when we are asked questio
[normal]ns like that by m
[normal]embers of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Select Committee is about 
[normal]the 
[normal]value for money
[normal],
[normal] because there are a lot of organisations throughout 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS and it is an expensive business to do that. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know if you want to add anything, Richard.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]We do not collect 
[normal]the 
[normal]data from every NHS organisation on precise
[normal]ly who they trade with day on
[normal] day. 
[normal]Q293 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]But setting 
[normal]that
[normal] aside
[normal], we are just talking about 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health because you do not seem to know
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]For 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health itself
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]You do know 
[normal]the 
[normal]answer?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: —
[normal]as opposed to NHS organisations, we will have 
[normal]the 
[normal]information on every single individual organisation that we have paid out of our budget. 
[normal]I
[normal]f 
[normal]the 
[normal]question is
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“C
[normal]ould we say for 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health 
[normal]if there 
[normal]is any?
[normal]”, y
[normal]es, we could. 
[normal]I 
[normal]could go back and do that.
[normal]Q294 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Good. So let us go back to where 
[normal]this
[normal] letter arose from. 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose we are a public exp
[normal]enditure hearing or inquiry at 
[normal]the 
[normal]minute, are we not? B
[normal]ut there is no
[normal] mention of any money anywhere—
[normal]no figures
[normal].
[normal] Could we have another letter with some figures in?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not quite sure which of 
[normal]the 
[normal]figures you are saying are missing.
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]On 
[normal]the 
[normal]answers t
[normal]hat you have given me; y
[normal]ou very carefully set it out.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: Okay; 
[normal]I 
[normal]will look over that letter
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f you could let me know 
[normal]the 
[normal]exact bits where you would like
[normal]—
[normal]  
[normal]Q295 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]For all 
[normal]the 
[normal]answers
[normal] to my questions here, you have numbers of people, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]think it is quite helpful
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]It is 
[normal]the 
[normal]letter you wrote to me.
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]It is dated 9 Dece
[normal]mber
[normal] or stamped 9 December.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]We will take that letter and have a look, and where we have numbers available
[normal]—
[normal]Q296 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] Great; w
[normal]e need figures. Obviously
[normal],
[normal] you have 84,838 temporary staff
[normal],
[normal] and so we would like to know, roughly, what sort of money is going out of 
[normal]the 
[normal]accounts. You say it is in 
[normal]the 
[normal]accounts, but 
[normal]I think 
[normal]it would have been helpful to have 
[normal]the 
[normal]fig
[normal]ures here for us. 
[normal]Just on 
[normal]the 
[normal]other point, to clarify, because obviously Sir David was there and there were lots of 
[normal]“
[normal]I 
[normal]don’
[normal]t know
[normal]”
[normal] answers, this letter has been written by you
[normal]. S
[normal]o
[normal],
[normal] ultimately
[normal],
[normal] are you 
[normal]the 
[normal]person responsible for all this information? 
[normal]I
[normal]f we want information, do we ask you? You are not going 
[normal]to 
[normal]say, 
[normal]“
[normal]Please ask Sir David.
[normal]”
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]will either provide you 
[normal]with 
[normal]the 
[normal]information myself or direct you to somewhere where you can get 
[normal]the 
[normal]information. 
[normal]Q297 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So you do not feel that 
[normal]you
[normal] have a responsibility to 
[normal]the 
[normal]public that you should be answering for NHS England or anyone else. Is that as a result of what has happened under 
[normal]the 
[normal]Health and Social Care Act?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am absolutely responsible for every penny of taxpayers
[normal]’
[normal] money that goes into 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]believe
[normal]—
[normal]and
[normal],
[normal] in fact
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think this is a cross
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]party
[normal] view
[normal]—
[normal]that giving NHS organisations some autonomy in a huge ecosystem like 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS is a better way to get value for money than managing it as a sort of centralised monolith. 
[normal]T
[normal]here are occasions when you ask me for information where 
[normal]I 
[normal]would go to an arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length body and ask them to provide that information or direct you to 
[normal]the 
[normal]arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length body.
[normal]Q298 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am glad 
[normal]you
[normal] gave me that answer because it comes on to 
[normal]the 
[normal]next part
[normal],
[normal] which is 
[normal]the 
[normal]role of 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCGs
[normal], and they are statutory bodies
[normal], but now 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand they are going to be asked for a quarterly assessment of their effectiveness. Is that right?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]will ask Sir David to respond to that.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Yes. We have set up an assurance system, so quarterly
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Q299 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Why 
[normal]is
[normal] that? 
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]We think it is 
[normal]the 
[normal]best way of assuring ourselves that they are delivering what they said they would deliver.
[normal]Q300 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Why are you 
[normal]doing
[normal] that now?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Because we think it is part of our responsibilities to do that.
[normal]Q301 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]You did not think about it 
[normal]before
[normal]?
[normal] You did not think it was part of your responsibilities to find out what 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCGs were doing before?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]This is on a relatively limited set of numbers around outcomes that we are agreeing with them as part of their planning.
[normal]Q302 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] Tell us what they are. 
[normal]Tell us what you are 
[normal]going
[normal] to ask for.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]There are 
[normal]the 
[normal]five elements of 
[normal]the 
[normal]outcomes framework, so stuff around mortality, 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality of services for people with long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term conditions, their delivery against a
[normal] whole series of safety issues and 
[normal]their patient experience issues. Let me get 
[normal]the 
[normal]three. There is 
[normal]the 
[normal]stuff around 
[normal]the 
[normal]way they govern themselves and organise themselves
[normal],
[normal] because, as you know, they all went through an authorisation process and we have been working through with them. Some CCGs have had conditions attached to them, and we have been working with them to take them on. 
[normal]Then there is 
[normal]the 
[normal]quality of 
[normal]the 
[normal]leadership of their organisation. 
[normal]T
[normal]hey are 
[normal]the 
[normal]sorts of things you would expect us to do.
[normal]Q303 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So they are not 
[normal]independent
[normal]. You would be a kind of “
[normal]Monitor
[normal]”
[normal] of CCGs?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]would not describe us as a “
[normal]Monitor
[normal]”
[normal] of CCG
[normal]s
[normal], but we are assuring ourselves that they are delivering on what they said they would deliver.
[normal]Q304 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Do you feel you have enough tools for that or do you think you might need some more?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]tools are those that are set out in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act
[normal],
[normal] and, like other organisations now, 
[normal]we 
[normal]have 
[normal]to have 
[normal]a very clear protocol as to 
[normal]the 
[normal]way we deal with organisations that do not deliver. 
[normal]W
[normal]e think we have 
[normal]the 
[normal]tools available to us to ensure that CCGs are either delivering great outcomes 
[normal]for
[normal] their patients or are taking 
[normal]the 
[normal]action that they need to put themselves in place to do so.
[normal]Q305 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]What is 
[normal]the 
[normal]sanction if they do not?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]We have a whole variety of sanctions, if you like, 
[normal]such as 
[normal]literally withholding resource from them. We can withhold their quality premium. As you know, there is 
[normal]£0.25 billion available to CCGs—an incentive fund—
[normal]to deliver against those sorts of things
[normal];
[normal] so we can either give them that or 
[normal]withhold it
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have 
[normal]the 
[normal]power
[normal]—
[normal]how can 
[normal]I 
[normal]put it in 
[normal]the 
[normal]right way
[normal]?—or 
[normal]one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things that 
[normal]I 
[normal]do is
[normal] 
[normal]approve 
[normal]the 
[normal]accountable officer of 
[normal]the 
[normal]organisation, so 
[normal]I 
[normal]can withdraw 
[normal]the 
[normal]powers of 
[normal]the 
[normal]accountable officer. We can put people into 
[normal]the 
[normal]organisation, so we can insist that they have people to intervene to make things happen. 
[normal]W
[normal]e have a variety of things that we can do if we can sustain and justify 
[normal]the 
[normal]point that we are not just taking action as a matter of our will but it is based on some real measurable alterations to 
[normal]the 
[normal]services that they 
[normal]are 
[normal]commission
[normal]ing
[normal]. 
[normal]Q306 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So they are set up as local 
[normal]organisations
[normal] making local decisions
[normal],
[normal] but NHS England is going to be 
[normal]the 
[normal]spider in 
[normal]the 
[normal]middle
[normal],
[normal] presumably
[normal],
[normal] with 
[normal]the 
[normal]ten
[normal]tacles that control all of them?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Monitor as a spider with tentacles. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] Well, y
[normal]ou think of something else then.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot think of a better one than you have. We are certainly there on behalf of patients and 
[normal]the 
[normal]taxpayer to ensure that they are doing 
[normal]the 
[normal]best that they can for their local populations.
[normal]Q307 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] W
[normal]ill 
[normal]you be 
[normal]taking
[normal] a strategic view? A
[normal] local CCG 
[normal]may make
[normal] a decision, say, about reconfiguration and they take a strat
[normal]egic view that both of you like, but w
[normal]hat happens in 
[normal]the 
[normal]situation where you do not like it? Do you take a strategic view? Who is going to take 
[normal]the 
[normal]strategic view?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]We have said in 
[normal]the 
[normal]planning guidance that we published today that CCGs have to come up with their own plans for their own localities for 
[normal]the 
[normal]next five years
[normal]—
[normal]two years operational, five years strategic. But for some services they have to come together in larger groups
[normal],
[normal] because, obviously, 
[normal]the 
[normal]population size on which some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]services are planned 
[normal]is
[normal] greater than an individual CCG. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]process we would take is a process of assurance. They would set out their plans
[normal],
[normal] organise their locality to make them happen
[normal],
[normal] and we would assure ourselves that they were using 
[normal]the 
[normal]fou
[normal]r tests, for example, and make
[normal] sure that they are properly consulting their public around them to enable us to make a judgment about whether they should go ahead.
[normal]Q308 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]I 
[normal]get what you are saying
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]I 
[normal]am trying to work out why, then, if they are local and you have 
[normal]the 
[normal]strategic view, you need
[normal] clause 118, Secretary of State.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: C
[normal]lause 118 is for 
[normal]the 
[normal]very particular situation where you have a trust that is in extreme difficulty and we need to find a solution because, for example, patient safety may be at risk
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is incredibly important in 
[normal]the 
[normal]wake of Francis that we have a structure in place that is able to sort out those problems quickly and decisively
[normal]. A
[normal]s part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]trust special administrator
[normal]’
[normal]s remit, when a trust goes into administration, they are required to consult CCGs and 
[normal]the 
[normal]four tests do apply, but 
[normal]the 
[normal]four tests were never meant to give any individual CCG in a situation 
[normal]that
[normal] involved multiple CCGs an absolute veto on change. 
[normal]W
[normal]e did not believe we needed clause 118 until 
[normal]the 
[normal]High Court ruled that 
[normal]I 
[normal]was not able to do what 
[normal]I 
[normal]did over Lewisham hospital
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e realised that
[normal],
[normal] in fact
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]intention of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act was not reflected in how 
[normal]the 
[normal]courts interpreted it;
[normal] so that is why we need to make 
[normal]the 
[normal]change in clause 118.
[normal]Q309 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Rig
[normal]ht. S
[normal]o it goes 
[normal]wider
[normal] than just failing trusts, does it not? You have a very wide power there. Have you taken advice on that?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It applies to situations where trusts are in administration
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is why it is really important.
[normal]Q310 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Is 
[normal]that 
[normal]right
[normal], Secretary of State—
[normal]just trusts in administration?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]believe so.
[normal]Q311 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]All right, okay. Does 
[normal]anybody
[normal] else want to comment? 
[normal]I 
[normal]understood it was much wider than that. Is it not?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]As 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand it, it is to deal with 
[normal]the 
[normal]situation that 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Q312 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]So if you lose in 
[normal]the 
[normal]courts, you have a power?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]No, it is not if 
[normal]I 
[normal]lose in 
[normal]the 
[normal]courts. It is because we believed that 
[normal]I 
[normal]was entitled to do that in 
[normal]the 
[normal]case of Lewisham
[normal]; 
[normal]the 
[normal]High Court disagreed
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]so
[normal] we have to respect 
[normal]the 
[normal]court
[normal] judgment.
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]: [bold]Yes, you do.
[normal] 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: B
[normal]ut we want to change 
[normal]the 
[normal]law now to make it clear that
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Not to respect 
[normal]the 
[normal]court judgment.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]No. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]court was interpreting 
[normal]the 
[normal]law as it 
[normal]stands
[normal] before, but Parliament is always entitled to change 
[normal]the 
[normal]law, as you well know.
[normal]Q313 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]But you changed 
[normal]the 
[normal]law afterwards because you did not like 
[normal]the 
[normal]judgment. You wanted to give yourself wider powers.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]No, we changed 
[normal]the 
[normal]law afterwards because we believed that we were entitled to do something under 
[normal]the 
[normal]previous law that 
[normal]the 
[normal]court disagreed with and we think it is incredibly important for patient safety reasons. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am happy to write to you with chapter and verse as to how we intend clause 118 to be applied. 
[normal]Q314 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]That would be great
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]because
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]understanding is that it is not just failing trusts
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]that 
[normal]you can take over anything
[normal] t
[normal]hat you want to
[normal]. Clarification would be really helpful. 
[normal]Can 
[normal]I 
[normal]go 
[normal]back
[normal] to a question 
[normal]that 
[normal]I 
[normal]asked you in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chamber—
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chair has been very kind and i
[normal]s allowing me to ask this again?
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]did not quite get an answer from 
[normal]you, apart from a political one.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am kind—
[normal]or just recognising reality.
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Kind, 
[normal]I 
[normal]hope
[normal], Chair. 
[normal]The question is on 
[normal]the 
[normal]underspend
[normal]. There is some 
[normal]underspend
[normal] from 
[normal]the 
[normal]previous year, £2 billion
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]year before that
[normal],
[normal] and £600 million this year. You know that 
[normal]the 
[normal]College
[normal] of 
[normal]Emergency Medicine
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: £600 million this year?
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Yes. If you dispute 
[normal]the 
[normal]figures, please write to us; that would be great.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: We do not h
[normal]ave 
[normal]the 
[normal]under
[normal]spend
[normal] for this year until we reach 
[normal]the 
[normal]end
[normal] of the
[normal] year.
[normal]Q315 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] Up until 
[normal]the 
[normal]end, but 
[normal]it is 
[normal]£600 million so far. If you dispute any of these figures, please write to us and let us know what 
[normal]the 
[normal]underspend
[normal] is
[normal]. Why did it go back to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury? Why 
[normal]did it 
[normal]not 
[normal]go 
[normal]to front
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]line 
[normal]services
[normal]? T
[normal]he 
[normal]College
[normal] of 
[normal]Emergency Medicine
[normal] are desperate for doctors
[normal]. 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]There are two reasons. It is 
[normal]the 
[normal]practice of all Governmen
[normal]ts, including 
[normal]the 
[normal]last Labour G
[normal]overnment, that they return 
[normal]underspends
[normal] to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]underspend
[normal] that we have been returning to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS is broadly similar to 
[normal]the 
[normal]levels of 
[normal]underspend
[normal] that were returned to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Treasury under 
[normal]the 
[normal]previous Government. So this is Government accounting practice. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]point 
[normal]I 
[normal]would make
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think it is really important to understand
[normal]—
[normal]is that under Government accounting rules 
[normal]the 
[normal]underspend
[normal], if it is going to be used for something else, has to be spent within 
[normal]the 
[normal]same financial year
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]o it is not always 
[normal]the 
[normal]panacea that it seems
[normal],
[normal] because if you have a multi
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]billion
[normal] pound 
[normal]underspend
[normal] you would only be able to give it to somewhere that could actually use that money in that very year, 
[normal]in
[normal] a matter of a couple of months. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is why, in practice, it is much more difficult to use 
[normal]the 
[normal]underspend
[normal] in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that you are suggesting.
[normal]Q316 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]However, you have had Francis saying we need 
[normal]more nurses, and 
[normal]the 
[normal]College
[normal] of 
[normal]Emergency Medicine
[normal] saying for 
[normal]the 
[normal]last 
[normal]three
[normal] years there was a 50% non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fill
[normal] of emergency doctors and consultants
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou said to me in a previous session that it was Stalinist to plan
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]am saying to you 
[normal]that 
[normal]you had this information t
[normal]wo years ago, you had 
[normal]the 
[normal]money and
[normal] you could even use it for a pay rise, which you are desperate to give to 
[normal]the 
[normal]staff of 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS. Why do you not use that money for that purpose?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]For 
[normal]the 
[normal]reason that 
[normal]the 
[normal]finance director just explained. This is money that has been committed to NHS budgets in many 
[normal]different 
[normal]parts of 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS 
[normal]and
[normal] we did not know 
[normal]that 
[normal]we were going to 
[normal]underspend
[normal] until it came to 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of 
[normal]the 
[normal]year. S
[normal]o it is not possible to plan in advance to spend an 
[normal]underspend
[normal],
[normal] except with very small margins.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e have done that, for example, this year with 
[normal]£
[normal]150 million of 
[normal]the 
[normal]£400 million that is going to help support hospitals deal with winter A and E pressures and we used some 
[normal]underspend
[normal] money for that last year. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is possible to do that where you are very certain that you are going to 
[normal]underspend
[normal] by a certain amount, but it is not possible to plan at 
[normal]the 
[normal]start of 
[normal]the 
[normal]year to fund things like pay rises from 
[normal]underspend
[normal] because you do not know. This money does not sit in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health. It gets distributed out to CCGs and they distribute it out to trusts
[normal],
[normal] and so it is sitting in many different parts of 
[normal]the 
[normal]system.
[normal]Q317 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Now you will know because you are going to be monitoring what 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCGs do. Secretary of State, you went to 
[normal]China
[normal]. Did you go on a personal basis or on behalf of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department of Health? 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]went as a Government representative. 
[normal]Q318 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have a quick question rel
[normal]ated to what we were discussing and it is
[normal] about patient choice. It has often been said that patient choice is at 
[normal]the 
[normal]heart of 
[normal]the 
[normal]health service now—
[normal]a complete change in thinking. Going back to clinical commissioning groups and what Sir David was saying just now, do you have a mechanism for how clinical commissioning groups are taking note of 
[normal]the 
[normal]changes in patient requests—
[normal]how patient choice is actually working on 
[normal]the 
[normal]g
[normal]round? We had your
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Minister of S
[normal]tate recently in front of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee and 
[normal]I 
[normal]asked him whether patient choice had priority over doctor choice
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]answer was that patient choice came first. 
[normal]I
[normal]f this 
[normal]is actually happening, are we 
[normal]recording them
[normal] now? I
[normal]n this new paradigm
[normal] 
[normal]are we trying to draw any information, i
[normal]f there is any new information—and maybe there is not—
[normal]from 
[normal]the 
[normal]clinical 
[normal]commissioning 
[normal]groups on how patients are exercising patient choice? If they have patient choice, presumably they are doing something with it.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Patient choice is a right under 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS constitution, so nothing should change with respect to 
[normal]the 
[normal]new powers being given to clinical commissioning groups
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n terms of choice of provider
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]choices that patients had before still exist
[normal],
[normal] and indeed we want to extend them where we can. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]challenge is to make a reality of that ability to choose. 
[normal]S
[normal]ometimes people want to change their GP, for example, but they find 
[normal]the 
[normal]GP they want to get to is not accepting new patients and so their effective choice is not as great as it might be. 
[normal]S
[normal]ometimes
[normal],
[normal] people do not know about their ability to choose
[normal] as well
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is much work to do
[normal],
[normal] but it is one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]mechanisms we have for promoting a patient
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]centred
[normal] NHS.
[normal]Q319 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Tredinnick[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have one follow
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]up on this. With personal budgets, 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand that there has been a great success in that patients and carers are finding it easier to manage their lives and their budgets
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]treatments 
[normal]the 
[normal]patients choose are 
[normal]very successful.
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]see Mr Rouse nodding his head, which is a very encouraging start. Surely
[normal],
[normal] if this is 
[normal]the 
[normal]paradigm with 
[normal]the 
[normal]small budget for personal budgets, then this is something we need to roll out a little further. Perhaps we can let Mr Rouse, through you, Chair, respond and then 
[normal]I 
[normal]will say no more.
[normal] 
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: 
[normal]We have made some good progress on personal budgets
[normal],
[normal] and of course this is something that cuts across both social care and health, and social care were 
[normal]the 
[normal]forerunners
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As of this year,
[normal] we are now up at 55% of people with social care packages with personal budgets. We have a target of 70%
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Care Bill will take that to 100% because it will become an entitlement for those who want it
[normal]. Then, of course, with 
[normal]extens
[normal]ion into continuing health care, 
[normal]you begin to be able to put personal care and personal health budgets together if you have a long
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]term condition so 
[normal]that 
[normal]you have a lot more control of your life and can make your own choices. 
[normal]O
[normal]bviously
[normal],
[normal] we 
[normal]must 
[normal]not do it in a way that undermines 
[normal]the 
[normal]proper operating of 
[normal]the 
[normal]health system, but
[normal],
[normal] where there is 
[normal]the 
[normal]ability to do so, personal health budgets are definitely an expression of control and choice.
[normal]Q320 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have a quick question for Mr 
[normal]Douglas about 
[normal]the 
[normal]underspend
[normal]—
[normal]whether there is any mechanism at all towards 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of 
[normal]the 
[normal]year
[normal],
[normal] or once it becomes clear what level of 
[normal]underspend
[normal] there is, 
[normal]whereby
[normal] some of that could be used to repay PF
[normal]I 
[normal]debt
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]ask because it
[normal] seems 
[normal]that PF
[normal]I 
[normal]payments are just an ongoing drag on 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole system
[normal].
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]There are two things there. One is
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State said
[normal]—that 
[normal]the 
[normal]underspend
[normal] is 
[normal]the 
[normal]sum of 473 organisations, so trying to pick 
[normal]that 
[normal]up organisation by organi
[normal]sation and then potentially moving
[normal] it around 
[normal]would be difficult. Then, f
[normal]or any trust or foundation trust we allow them to keep 
[normal]the 
[normal]cash, so 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot just go back and take 
[normal]the 
[normal]cash from them. They can keep 
[normal]the 
[normal]cash and spend it in future years. It is not
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Q321 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]So th
[normal]ey can spend it in future years?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]They can spend 
[normal]the 
[normal]cash. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is clear with foundation trus
[normal]ts that 
[normal]the 
[normal]cash goes into their bank accounts as part of their surplus
[normal]. It is there and 
[normal]it does not get taken back from them. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]issue 
[normal]I 
[normal]think we discussed last year is that
[normal],
[normal] at 
[normal]the 
[normal]point at which they spend it
[normal], it
[normal] scores against 
[normal]the 
[normal]spending limit of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department, but it is there for them to spend. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have looked at what we could do around PF
[normal]I 
[normal]debt and whether there would be opportunities to use some capital 
[normal]underspends
[normal] for that purpose. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]difficulty is that every time we have looked at this
[normal]—
[normal]the 
[normal]value for money of tryin
[normal]g to re
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]open
[normal] one of those deals—
[normal]it does not stack up financially. So 
[normal]it
[normal] is not a simple thing
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]such 
[normal]as we pay down a bit of debt. 
[normal]They are
[normal] quite complicated financial arrangements 
[normal]that 
[normal]we ha
[normal]ve in most of th
[normal]e
[normal] deals
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have not yet found a way t
[normal]hat we can use money in a value-for-
[normal]money sense that could buy out some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]PFIs. It is something that we will keep looking at because
[normal],
[normal] if there is an 
[normal]underspend
[normal] on 
[normal]the 
[normal]capital side
[normal],
[normal] it is something potentially we could do.
[normal]Chair:[bold] Mr
[normal] Douglas has given us enough evidence to offer an opinion again about 
[normal]the 
[normal]absurdity of end
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]year
[normal] inflexibility 
[normal]as it exists for NHS trusts. 
[normal]Q322 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]Secretary of State, you are aware that we have invited you here as part of our inquiry into public expenditure in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS. In 
[normal]the 
[normal]s
[normal]econd of our terms of reference
[normal] that we are looking at is 
[normal]the 
[normal]effectiveness of 
[normal]the 
[normal]mechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure you 
[normal]can
[normal] recall from our debate yesterday that some concerns were expressed about NHS England
[normal]’
[normal]s current remit to review 
[normal]the 
[normal]formula by which resources are allocated to clinical commissioning groups. To begin with, Secretary of State, how satisfied are you that 
[normal]the 
[normal]mechanisms for deciding on geographical allocations of funding
[normal]—
[normal]to CCGs for primary care and specialised services
[normal]—
[normal]are both effective and fair in providing sufficient resources on 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis of need?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]first point to make is that this is such an important issue
[normal]—
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]It is very important.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]:
[normal] 
[normal]—
[normal]that 
[normal]it is really important that it is
[normal] put beyond party politics. That is why my predecessor decided that that should be a decision that was made at arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length from serving Secretaries of State
[normal],
[normal] and that is what we have done. 
[normal]In terms of how good 
[normal]the 
[normal]mechanisms are
[normal]—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]will ask Sir David to comment because it is 
[normal]the 
[normal]responsibility of NHS England
[normal]—
[normal]as they have been explained to me, 
[normal]I 
[normal]am very happy with 
[normal]the 
[normal]principles that are used. 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]challenge that we have is that
[normal],
[normal] where overall 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS budget is not increasing by any significant margin, where you have people who are a long way off what their target allocation would be under any funding formula, it is incredibly difficult to move more closely to that target funding without other people having to lose out
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is 
[normal]the 
[normal]real challenge that we have. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know if Sir David wants to add anything about 
[normal]the 
[normal]principles.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Yes. This morning NHS England have considered an extensive paper on allocation. It is all in 
[normal]the 
[normal]public domain. We did it openly and transparently for everyone to see and that document is available for everybody. You can, if you want, go home tonight and watch 
[normal]the 
[normal]live stream
[normal]—
[normal]not live obviously
[normal] but 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole of 
[normal]the 
[normal]debate we had at NHS England.
[normal] 
[normal]This is 
[normal]the 
[normal]first time in my experience that allocations have been done in such a transparent and open way 
[normal]with
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]workings of how you got there also being set out to 
[normal]the 
[normal]public in a way they have never been done before. Inevitably, in 
[normal]the 
[normal]circumstances, there is a kind of technocratic argument, a technical argument, around it all
[normal],
[normal] but there is one of principle as well. 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know whether you want me to go on to 
[normal]the 
[normal]principle bit yet or
[normal]—
[normal]Q323 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have a number of questions. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have stayed very quiet because 
[normal]I 
[normal]think this is really very important
[normal],
[normal] bo
[normal]th to me and a number of other Committee m
[normal]embers
[normal],
[normal] and it has been a focus of a number of debates, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]wonder if 
[normal]I 
[normal]can pick up a couple of points that both you and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State have made
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e are aware on 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee that there has been a written statement produced today
[normal],
[normal] which is very brief. 
[normal]I 
[normal]must say 
[normal]that 
[normal]I 
[normal]am rather disappointed that it does 
[normal]say—
[normal]although you hav
[normal]e said it is already available—
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]final documents will be published by NHS England on 
[normal]the 
[normal]website by Friday 20 December
[normal],
[normal] which is 
[normal]the 
[normal]day we go into recess
[normal];
[normal] so we will not have any opportunity to hold 
[normal]the 
[normal]Ministers to account. Is that not right?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: It says that. You have probably picked up that 
[normal]the 
[normal]meeting 
[normal]itself took place this morning. T
[normal]here were a number of options available to NHS England about which one it chose
[normal],
[normal] and my guess is 
[normal]that
[normal] turning that document into something p
[normal]ristine will take a bit of time. B
[normal]ut to short
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]circuit that
[normal],
[normal] we can circulate that document and it was option 4 that we agreed.
[normal]Q324 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Could
[normal] we have that before Friday?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: Yes;
[normal] you can have it straight away.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]It is on 
[normal]the 
[normal]website, as 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand it.
[normal]Q325 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]Not in 
[normal]its
[normal] final form. 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]kind of online consultation
[normal]—
[normal]I 
[normal]have forgotten what it is called
[normal]—
[normal]is there, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not think 
[normal]the 
[normal]final version is there
[normal],
[normal] and, according to 
[normal]the 
[normal]written statement, it is not available 
[normal]until
[normal] Friday. But 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to ask you a couple of questions just on this subject. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have been lobbied heavily, as have other Members of Parliament, by our clinical commissioning groups, 
[normal]the 
[normal]BMA, local government and 
[normal]the 
[normal]directors of public health
[normal],
[normal] who are all very concerned about 
[normal]the 
[normal]possible consequences for particularly more deprived and poorer areas of any change in 
[normal]the 
[normal]funding formula where there is a greater emphasis placed on areas that have more ag
[normal]e
[normal]ing populations
[normal],
[normal] which presumably, by definition, must have better health outcomes because people live longer. 
[normal]I 
[normal]want 
[normal]to seek 
[normal]some clarification on where we go and on what evidence NHS England have come to their conclusions
[normal],
[normal] because 
[normal]I 
[normal]am rather concerned, having had discussions with people who know about these things, in terms of populations, 
[normal]as to 
[normal]whether there has been any assessment of 
[normal]the 
[normal]numbers of disabled people in populations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is relevant
[normal], for example, in my area because 
[normal]it was a coal
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]mining
[normal] area
[normal],
[normal] with shipbuilding and steel on 
[normal]the 
[normal]doorstep
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]physical manifestation of that in later life is that many people su
[normal]ffer from pneumoconiosis, COPD and 
[normal]forms of 
[normal]mesothelioma
[normal], and that must have an impact 
[normal]on 
[normal]the 
[normal]call on health resources, although,
[normal] 
[normal]p
[normal]erversely
[normal],
[normal] if it is going to be on age
[normal],
[normal] those people die prematurely so that would not be reflected in 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation. 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is a huge concern and 
[normal]I 
[normal]hope, when NHS England are considering 
[normal]the 
[normal]formula, there is a proper equalities impact study, or whatever it is called, to weight that
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]hat 
[normal]are 
[normal]the 
[normal]implications 
[normal]of using 
[normal]the 
[normal]ONS population 
[normal]data rather than GP list sizes? 
[normal]I 
[normal]want
[normal] to ask 
[normal]the 
[normal]Se
[normal]cretary of State
[normal] because you very niftily said, 
[normal]“
[normal]Sir David Nicholson, this is one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]areas of responsibility that is devolved to you.
[normal]”
[normal] Whatever it says in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Acts, 
[normal]I 
[normal]can 
[normal]as
[normal]sure you that people in my area hold me to account for resource allocations and 
[normal]I 
[normal]intend to hold you to account for them as well. 
[normal]D
[normal]o you share my concern that it is your responsibility to ensure that CCGs have 
[normal]the 
[normal]necessary resources to be able to provide funding to provide 
[normal]the 
[normal]treatment that people require?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]completely agree with that and 
[normal]I 
[normal]want to stress that 
[normal]I 
[normal]am completely accountable for 
[normal]the 
[normal]decisions that NHS England ma
[normal]ke. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have subcontracted that decision, 
[normal]or 
[normal]the 
[normal]Act
[normal]—
[normal]I 
[normal]should say more accurately—subcontracts that 
[normal]decision to them because we think it is better if it is decided at arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length from Ministers
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]I 
[normal]am completely accountable for 
[normal]the 
[normal]decision to 
[normal]make
[normal] that decision at arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length and
[normal],
[normal] indeed
[normal],
[normal] for whatever it is that they actually decide. As 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand it
[normal]—
[normal]Sir David will correct me if 
[normal]I 
[normal]am wrong
[normal]—
[normal]the 
[normal]decision that NHS England took this morning, option 4, does include a weighting for social deprivation so that it does take account of some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]factors that you have talked about. 
[normal]Q326 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]There was already weighting there for social deprivation. Is there any change in it?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]As 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand it, no, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]will allow Sir David to come in
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]could just add that 
[normal]I 
[normal]think it is also a matter of social justice
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]agree with you 
[normal]that in 
[normal]the 
[normal]end 
[normal]it is 
[normal]about need
[normal],
[normal] and that means that we do need to respect 
[normal]the 
[normal]needs of older people because they have greater health needs than younger people and it is important that we have a formula that adequately reflects their needs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is also important that it is a formula that reflects 
[normal]the 
[normal]needs of people who live in pockets of deprivation and not just people who live in areas where deprivation is more widespread
[normal],
[normal] because people who live in pockets of deprivation also have 
[normal]the 
[normal]kind of needs that you talked about.
[normal]Q327 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have 
[normal]one more supplementary. Just before 
[normal]the 
[normal]meeting started, my colleague Andrew George and 
[normal]I 
[normal]were having an argument about CCGs
[normal]—
[normal]or a discussion
[normal]—
[normal]about allocations about 
[normal]the 
[normal]areas 
[normal]that
[normal] were furthest away from target
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]can remember being part of 
[normal]the 
[normal]lobbying effort. This is when we had relatively small PCTs and we h
[normal]ad one for Easington lobbying 
[normal]John Reid
[normal],
[normal] who was 
[normal]the 
[normal]Health Minister at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time
[normal],
[normal] because Easington was 
[normal]the 
[normal]furthest away in 
[normal]the 
[normal]country. 
[normal]I 
[normal]d
[normal]o not know whether that is lost or has
[normal] b
[normal]een subsumed into a larger PCT and
[normal] then 
[normal]a 
[normal]CCG, but
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as to 
[normal]the 
[normal]ability to target pockets of deprivation, 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know whether you have thought about how that might be achieved. 
[normal]I 
[normal]know in local government we use super output areas to tackle particular pockets, but it might be something that needs some further work.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]think we have put that in.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not quite sure at what level to deal with this
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]as to 
[normal]the 
[normal]issues that we are faced with
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]let us
[normal] think about 12 months ago, when we originally looked at this as NHS England for 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocations for this financial year and we were faced with 
[normal]the 
[normal]work that ACRA had been asked to do by 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government, which essentially said that older people w
[normal]ere 
[normal]the 
[normal]big driver in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that you should allocate resources
[normal]. T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]issue for us, when we looked at that as an issue to change 
[normal]the 
[normal]formula, was that we did not think it necessarily dealt with 
[normal]the 
[normal]issue that you describe, which is unmet need, because very often most of 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation form in 
[normal]the 
[normal]past was dr
[normal]iven by utilisation of resource.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]f you use a lot of resource you tend to get 
[normal]it, 
[normal]but how do you deal with unmet need? 
[normal]T
[normal]his whole issue about deprivation and unmet need was an important thing
[normal],
[normal] and we have
[normal] been working with 
[normal]ACRA over 
[normal]the 
[normal]last 12 months to get that in 
[normal]the 
[normal]right kind of place. 
[normal]A
[normal]s far as 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation to CCGs is concerned
[normal],
[normal] we have put a 10% weighting on deprivation for CCGs and a 15% weighting for primary care
[normal],
[normal] because we think that primary care is a much more targeted way of delivering more equal services for patients. 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]second area was how you measure that deprivation
[normal],
[normal] and we are using 
[normal]the 
[normal]standard
[normal]ised mortality ratio for under-
[normal]75s
[normal].
[normal] The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]experts tell us that that is 
[normal]the 
[normal]best way because it captures 
[normal]the 
[normal]“early die-
[normal]ers
[normal]”
[normal], if you like, that you have described there and does give you a better case for it. It also has 
[normal]the 
[normal]benefit of being able to pinpoint relatively small populations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The example in 
[normal]the 
[normal]paper for o
[normal]ne of 
[normal]the 
[normal]issues we were tackling is 
[normal]Ipswich
[normal]. Ipswich in 
[normal]Suffolk
[normal], if 
[normal]you look at 
[normal]the 
[normal]totality of 
[normal]the 
[normal]population, does relatively well in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]health of its population and 
[normal]has 
[normal]a relatively low growth rate in terms of its allocation. But there are particular points in 
[normal]Ipswich
[normal], particular localities
[normal],
[normal] which are among 
[normal]the 
[normal]most deprived in 
[normal]the 
[normal]country. By using 
[normal]the 
[normal]SMR &lt;
[normal]75
[normal],
[normal] you can pinpoint very small localities in your allocation process and so identify them and give 
[normal]the 
[normal]benefit to 
[normal]the 
[normal]C
[normal]CGs for that. So that is one thing. 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]second thing was population
[normal]. T
[normal]here has been significant population shift over 
[normal]the 
[normal]last few years that we thought had to be taken account of in what we did
[normal],
[normal] and that is what we have done in 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation process.
[normal]Q328 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]They are very full answers, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]think they generate 
[normal]some more thoughts and questions. C
[normal]an you 
[normal]tell
[normal] us where we are going in terms of option 4? What does that mean for 
[normal]the 
[normal]next few years?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: With 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation arrangements that we have put into place, first
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]most deprived populations get 
[normal]the 
[normal]most money. That is 
[normal]the 
[normal]first and most obvious thing. 
[normal]I
[normal]f you are 
[normal]thinking about somewhere like 
[normal]Know
[normal]s
[normal]ley
[normal] at 
[normal]the 
[normal]one end
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it 
[normal]will get, 
[normal]I 
[normal]think, £1,500 per head
[normal],
[normal] and Oxford CCG at 
[normal]the 
[normal]other end 
[normal]will get
[normal] £850. 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]money goes, on a per-
[normal]head basis, to 
[normal]the 
[normal]most deprived population. That is 
[normal]the 
[normal]first thing. 
[normal]S
[normal]econd
[normal]ly, 
[normal]there is 
[normal]a 
[normal]shift around 
[normal]the 
[normal]country in terms of population
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou can see that in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way 
[normal]the 
[normal]population has moved
[normal],
[normal] and that is recognised in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way we have allocated 
[normal]the 
[normal]resource. 
[normal]T
[normal]hird
[normal]ly,
[normal] 
[normal]we wanted to ensure—
[normal]it was one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things that was put in 
[normal]the 
[normal]mandate from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department—that we kept
[normal] as much stability as we could in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS
[normal],
[normal] so 
[normal]that 
[normal]everyone is getting flat real terms no matter where they are in 
[normal]the 
[normal]system. 
[normal]E
[normal]verybody gets that basic thing. But we have been able to invest about £250 million
[normal] in bringing some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]people
[normal] furthest away from target closer to target
[normal],
[normal] and what we are saying to people in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]five
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]year strategy is that they should assume that over 
[normal]the 
[normal]next five years we are going to work to bring people closer to target.
[normal]Q329 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]Andrew
[normal] says 
[normal]Cornwall
[normal] is 
[normal]the 
[normal]furthe
[normal]s
[normal]t
[normal] away. What is 
[normal]the 
[normal]biggest percentage increase from areas that are furthest away from target?
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]Below target
[normal] I did say
[normal].
[normal]Grahame M. Morris:[bold] 
[normal]Is he right?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]would not want to comment. 
[normal]I think y
[normal]ou should look at 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole thing. One of 
[normal]the 
[normal]things we tried to do all along is not to go through this process 
[normal]and identify
[normal] where everyone is, 
[normal]but 
[normal]to focus really hard on 
[normal]the 
[normal]arrangements so 
[normal]that 
[normal]we are absolutely fair and transparent in what we do.
[normal]Q330 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]It 
[normal]would
[normal] be very easy for 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole Select Committee to get into special pleading to manipulate 
[normal]the 
[normal]formula to suit our own areas
[normal],
[normal] and certainly 
[normal]with 
[normal]my area
[normal]—
[normal]it would not be easy because 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chair would stop us
[normal]—
[normal]I 
[normal]would endorse 
[normal]the 
[normal]view 
[normal]that
[normal] deprivation, age, and
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think Sarah and 
[normal]I 
[normal]would add
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]rurality
[normal] and 
[normal]so on
[normal] need to be there. 
[normal]One element is 
[normal]the 
[normal]market forces factor. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would be interested to hear where that sits
[normal],
[normal] because that is cause for significant concern in
[normal] those areas where wage levels, 
[normal]indeed
[normal], outside 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS 
[normal]are rather lower and
[normal],
[normal] therefore
[normal],
[normal] those areas get lower investment in spite of 
[normal]the 
[normal]fact that employees are on national pay scales. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would be interested in that and you may wish
[normal] to comment on it, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]want 
[normal]really to come back to 
[normal]the 
[normal]point where you arrived at, Sir David, that this 
[normal]is 
[normal]not actually resource allocation
[normal] but
[normal] target allocation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]There is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]frustration 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]pace of change, as 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand it, over 
[normal]the 
[normal]last d
[normal]ecade, has been incredibly slow. Y
[normal]ou can set 
[normal]the 
[normal]targets, but it is almost a pointless exercise
[normal],
[normal] because those areas that are significantly below target
[normal] remain
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]particula
[normal]rly those that are below target
[normal] seem not to move very rapidly towards their target over a period of a decade, let us say
[normal]. O
[normal]ne of 
[normal]the 
[normal]reasons for that is because 
[normal]the 
[normal]previous and 
[normal]the 
[normal]present 
[normal]Government
[normal] take 
[normal]the 
[normal]view that those who are above their target should not experience 
[normal]the 
[normal]shock wave of being moved closer to t
[normal]arget by reducing their budget. 
[normal]P
[normal]roviding you
[normal] continue to take that approach—
[normal]while you say you think that people will be closer to target within a five
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]year period, 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not sure on 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis of 
[normal]the 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]I 
[normal]have seen that
[normal] you are going to achieve that—
[normal]how realistic 
[normal]is 
[normal]it that you believe that you are going to achieve these target allocations within a five
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]year period
[normal]?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]absolutely understand what you are saying and 
[normal]I 
[normal]have seen all those things in operation myself
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n a sense
[normal],
[normal] this was 
[normal]the 
[normal]dilemma for us because it is said, of course, that 
[normal]at 
[normal]a time when you have very little growth 
[normal]it 
[normal]is 
[normal]the 
[normal]last time you should actually start thinking about moving this around. But
[normal],
[normal] in a sense
[normal],
[normal] that is why we have taken 12 months over getting this, we think, into 
[normal]the 
[normal]right kind of place
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]art of our statutory responsibilities as an organisation is to tackle inequalities. 
[normal]I
[normal]t is not a statutory respons
[normal]ibility that we can put aside. 
[normal]We have to do something about it
[normal],
[normal] and over 
[normal]the 
[normal]next two years
[normal],
[normal] because of 
[normal]the 
[normal]spending review
[normal],
[normal] we can
[normal] give everyone flat real terms—
[normal]we 
[normal]can 
[normal]give everyone 
[normal]the 
[normal]uplift
[normal]—b
[normal]ut we can invest on making people close
[normal]r
[normal] to 
[normal]the 
[normal]target. How quickly we can do that for 
[normal]the 
[normal]three years 
[normal]after
[normal] that will clearly depend on 
[normal]the 
[normal]spending review afterwards. One of 
[normal]the 
[normal]options we looked at was, in a sense, not giving organisations 
[normal]that
[normal] were above target any increase at all, but we judge that that would be too destabilising for 
[normal]the 
[normal]service as a whole, particularly in those areas. 
[normal]I 
[normal]should say, on 
[normal]the 
[normal]other side, which is quite interesting, 
[normal]that, 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]37 CCGs that we are worried about who are showing 
[normal]the 
[normal]most pressure financially at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment, 31 are gainers from these arrangements. 
[normal]Q331 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]In those areas that have been 
[normal]consistently well above target—
[normal]and most of them 
[normal]have been in 
[normal]the 
[normal]south-
[normal]east, 
[normal]the 
[normal]leafy suburbs and 
[normal]the 
[normal]metropolitan boroughs of London
[normal]—
[normal]it seems to me that some of them have b
[normal]e
[normal]en 10%, 12% or 
[normal]an 
[normal]even larger 
[normal]per cent 
[normal]above target. Are you saying that they will be brought closer to 
[normal]target over 
[normal]the 
[normal]next five years? I
[normal]n reality, unless 
[normal]the 
[normal]target changes, that 
[normal]clearly 
[normal]is not going to happen because you are not going to be reducing 
[normal]their
[normal] budgets.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]targets have changed because we have changed 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation formula. 
[normal]Y
[normal]ou have to look at 
[normal]the 
[normal]totality of all of that.
[normal]Q332 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] W
[normal]e 
[normal]have
[normal] to 
[normal]look
[normal] at it afresh. But
[normal],
[normal] even so, let us say it is a new set of CCGs and health economies that are getting a target that is significantly below where their actual settlement is and no doubt
[normal] will continue to be therefore. A
[normal]re they going to be brought closer to target over a period of time?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Yes, they are. It is part of our statutory responsibility to make that happen. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]fact that we can make it happen at 
[normal]the 
[normal]moment by giving flat real terms to everybody is a benefit, but
[normal],
[normal] if in 
[normal]the 
[normal]future we are unable to do that
[normal],
[normal] we will still have to look at 
[normal]the 
[normal]way in which we are going to deal with those as health inequalities.
[normal]Q333 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Andrew George:[bold] 
[normal]But you said that you would not be giving flat real terms settlements to
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: No.
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]said we would give it so that everyone has flat real terms, yes.
[normal]Q334 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to say 
[normal]I 
[normal]am 
[normal]rather
[normal] appalled that there are going to be flat real terms and 
[normal]I 
[normal]was not clear whether there was going to be any extra weighting for age, but that matters in an area like mine where they 
[normal]are 
[normal]31 years ahead of 
[normal]the 
[normal]curve in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]changes in age structure
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]B
[normal]y 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of 2021 they are going to have 4.9% of their population over 85 as opposed to 2.9% nationally. In addition to that, they have pockets of very serious deprivation
[normal],
[normal] and in other parts of 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCG they have 
[normal]real 
[normal]issues about 
[normal]rurality
[normal] and 
[normal]sparsity
[normal] and 
[normal]the 
[normal]extra costs that go with that. 
[normal]W
[normal]hat comfort is there for CCGs like that
[normal],
[normal] which, if you like, have all of those very challenging issues?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]formula takes account of all of that and you will see that
[normal],
[normal] in 
[normal]the 
[normal]target allocations
[normal],
[normal] that is taken 
[normal]into 
[normal]account
[normal]. But c
[normal]an 
[normal]I 
[normal]say that 
[normal]I 
[normal]did not mean that everybody got flat rea
[normal]l terms and nobody got any more? We have about £250 million now, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation paper sets out
[normal] how—
[normal]I 
[normal]will get it absolutely right—
[normal]either 70 or 71 CCGs can make more rapid progress and get more than fl
[normal]at real terms for 
[normal]the 
[normal]two years 2014
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]15 and 2015
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]16. W
[normal]hen you look at 
[normal]the 
[normal]allocation you will see that in it.
[normal]Q335 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] C
[normal]an 
[normal]I 
[normal]ask about 
[normal]the 
[normal]age issue
[normal]? B
[normal]ecause 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]link between being over 85 and real challenges in terms of extra need
[normal], i
[normal]s there going to be a change in 
[normal]the 
[normal]weighting for age or 
[normal]sparsity
[normal]?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: Certainly age
[normal] 
[normal]but 
[normal]not for 
[normal]sparsity
[normal].
[normal]Q336 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Dr Wollaston:[bold] 
[normal]Is 
[normal]that
[normal] something you would consider for 
[normal]the 
[normal]future?
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]Yes. When 
[normal]I 
[normal]last came to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee 
[normal]you raised 
[normal]the 
[normal]issue with 
[normal]Paul 
[normal]Baumann,
[normal] and we said we would t
[normal]ake it back to 
[normal]ACRA for them to have another look. They have looked at it before and concluded about three years ago that there was not sufficient evidence to support a weighting for that
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]G
[normal]iven that things have moved on
[normal],
[normal] there is more information about what happens and we can 
[normal]now 
[normal]do this very much more identified small population work, we are going to ask them to look again at 
[normal]sparsity
[normal]. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Barbara 
[normal]is 
[normal]next and then we are going to move on
[normal].
[normal] Leicestershire is going to take a self
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]denying ord
[normal]i
[normal]nance from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chair and Mr 
[normal]Tredinnick
[normal], but w
[normal]e are not going to have pleadings from every authority.
[normal]Q337 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]This is a kind of a pleading
[normal],
[normal] but, as we were talking about age, it is a plea on behalf of carers. When we were talking 
[normal]earlier
[normal] about 
[normal]the 
[normal]integration fund
[normal],
[normal] you said you would be getting in and examining 
[normal]the 
[normal]plans. A real concern 
[normal]I 
[normal]have is that 
[normal]the 
[normal]carers
[normal]’
[normal] break
[normal]s
[normal] funding
[normal],
[normal] which is in this pooled large amount of money
[normal],
[normal] might just get swallowed up. 
[normal]T
[normal]his is a plea not to do that
[normal],
[normal] because 
[normal]I 
[normal]think some of 
[normal]the 
[normal]changes that have been made in 
[normal]the 
[normal]way that we fund care
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]it 
[normal]could be in integration
[normal],
[normal] mean that carers lose out. 
[normal]I 
[normal]had a case 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]talked 
[normal]about yesterday of an elderly couple 
[normal]who
[normal] were getting eight weeks
[normal]’
[normal] respite care when it was organised by 
[normal]the 
[normal]local authority and it gets lost within a personal budget so that
[normal],
[normal] effectively
[normal],
[normal] all they have now is three weeks and it is not enough. They are older people looking after an adult son
[normal],
[normal] and that is quite a hard task that they have taken on
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]With t
[normal]his undermining of respite care
[normal], it
[normal] is a real worry
[normal], w
[normal]hen you start pooling funding
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]something like that just gets lost. It got 
[normal]lost a bit in local authorities—
[normal]and 
[normal]I 
[normal]know that this Government 
[normal]are not very keen on ring
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]fencing
[normal]—
[normal]but
[normal],
[normal] if you do not do something to tie it to some outcomes or to something
[normal],
[normal] it will 
[normal]just 
[normal]vanish
[normal],
[normal] and that would be a real concern.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that is a very fair concern and we will certainly take that away. Jon, 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know if you want to add anything to that in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]process.
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: 
[normal]There are two things. One, you have to put this in 
[normal]the 
[normal]overall context of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Care Bill as well and new rights for carers that will come in at 
[normal]the 
[normal]same time in April 2015. 
[normal]Q338 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]But it does not have funding attached to the
[normal] rights.
[normal] 
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: 
[normal]No, but there is that right to assessment and to access to certain services. Then
[normal],
[normal] in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]fund itself, we have put a number of things into 
[normal]it:
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]carers
[normal]’
[normal] money, 
[normal]reablement
[normal] money
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]DFG
[normal]—
[normal] 
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Adaptations.
[normal]Jon Rouse[bold]: 
[normal]That was done for a clear purpose
[normal],
[normal] which was to send a strong signal
[normal]: if we a
[normal]re going to have an integrated approach to care, then it has to embrace 
[normal]the 
[normal]needs of carers. If we are wrapping care around 
[normal]the 
[normal]individual, their 
[normal]carer
[normal] and family, then it has to take those carers
[normal]’
[normal] needs into acc
[normal]ount; also, in terms of 
[normal]the 
[normal]DFG
[normal],
[normal] you have to look at 
[normal]the 
[normal]broader environmental factors
[normal],
[normal] and particularly 
[normal]the 
[normal]role of accommodation and housing providers and what happens in that accommodation as well. 
[normal]W
[normal]hen 
[normal]the 
[normal]plans come in
[normal],
[normal] we are going to be looking for all of those things and how 
[normal]they tie
[normal] in
[normal] 
[normal]to 
[normal]the 
[normal]condition we have set around co
[normal]-
[normal]ordinated care. 
[normal]O
[normal]f course, Ministers have 
[normal]the 
[normal]final ability to sign off those plans once N
[normal]HS England and local authority
[normal] colleagues have had a chance to review them.
[normal]Barbara [bold]Keeley[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Hence 
[normal]the 
[normal]plea not to forget 
[normal]the 
[normal]carer role.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am afraid there a
[normal]re some questions that m
[normal]embers of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee wish to pursue, so could we vote and come back in 10 minutes? Thank you.
[normal] 
[normal]Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
[normal]On resuming—
[normal] 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]The Committee is 
[normal]quorate
[normal]. 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand that both 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State and Sir David have meetings elsewhere
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]wrote to you, Secretary of
[normal] State, on 
[normal]the 
[normal]question of NHS Property S
[normal]ervices
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]Charlotte
[normal] wants to follow 
[normal]up your reply on that.
[normal]Q339 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you. First, thank you very much, everyone concerned, for your replies. My questions are pertinent to public expenditure obviously because o
[normal]f 
[normal]the 
[normal]amount of money that NHS Property S
[normal]ervices represents in 
[normal]the 
[normal]portfolio
[normal], and they are pertinent to Property S
[normal]ervices because it regards key individ
[normal]uals and 
[normal]the 
[normal]set
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]up around
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Property S
[normal]ervices
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]rom 
[normal]the 
[normal]answers you have given me
[normal],
[normal] it seems like it w
[normal]as quite a tall order that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]NHS Property S
[normal]ervices had to perform
[normal],
[normal] and, on a layman
[normal]’
[normal]s view, it looks like there were some significant teething difficulties 
[normal]that
[normal] people have worked hard to overcome
[normal]. I
[normal]t is that set
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]up 
[normal]I 
[normal]would like to probe a bit further
[normal],
[normal] if that is all right. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would like to 
[normal]thank 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State for 
[normal]the 
[normal]correspondence that 
[normal]I 
[normal]requested, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]ha
[normal]ve also requested through FOI. 
[normal]I 
[normal]was quite 
[normal]disappointed that 
[normal]I 
[normal]had put in Freedom of I
[normal]nformation requests for this correspondence and was told it was only available at disproportionate cost
[normal],
[normal] which 
[normal]I 
[normal]was surprised at
[normal],
[normal] because it was two named pieces of correspondence with named authorship and sender
[normal]. B
[normal]ut 
[normal]I 
[normal]was able to get it quite easily
[normal],
[normal] thanks to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of State
[normal],
[normal] who was very helpful in providing 
[normal]it. This is a request—in 
[normal]that 
[normal]I 
[normal]was slightly confused as to why 
[normal]the 
[normal]FO
[normal]I 
[normal]should be so difficult to answer
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]then 
[normal]I 
[normal]was able to get 
[normal]the 
[normal]correspondence through other means
[normal]. P
[normal]erhaps you 
[normal]will be
[normal] able to take back to officials that it is not a very intuitive way of answering FOIs in that case
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]U
[normal]nfortunately
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee was not given copies of 
[normal]the 
[normal]correspondence 
[normal]I 
[normal]have, so apologies to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chair and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee that 
[normal]I 
[normal]am referring to material 
[normal]that
[normal] they have not been given. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am directing my questions to Richard Douglas, as 
[normal]I 
[normal]think you are 
[normal]the 
[normal]official to w
[normal]hom 
[normal]the 
[normal]individual concerned, 
[normal]Peter Coates
[normal],
[normal] reported. In 
[normal]the 
[normal]piece of correspondence that 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department very kindly provided for me regarding some
[normal] correspondence between Peter 
[normal]Coates and Deloitte at 
[normal]the 
[normal]beginning of 2010
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]c
[normal]orrespondence refers to Peter 
[normal]Coates
[normal]’s
[normal] note of 19 January 2010 attaching further commentary. 
[normal]There are 
[normal]two things. 
[normal]As the Department
[normal] kindly provided this correspondence, 
[normal]would it be able to 
[normal]provide 
[normal]the 
[normal]note 
[normal]of 19 January 2010 from Peter Coates to 
[normal]Mike Turley of Deloitte so that we can see what that further commentary and 
[normal]the 
[normal]contents of it are? 
[normal]S
[normal]ince you were 
[normal]the 
[normal]chief officer at that time, would you be able to enlighten
[normal] us as to what this event was? They referred to “
[normal]normalising relationships
[normal]”
[normal] between Deloitte and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]the 
[normal]matter which we have been dealing with here
[normal]”,
[normal] and 
[normal]“
[normal]further evidence
[normal]”
[normal] that they require. Could you let us know what that further evidence might be, what 
[normal]the 
[normal]relationships were that were required to be normalised, how they have been disruptive and 
[normal]the 
[normal]background to 
[normal]the 
[normal]letter?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]Could 
[normal]I 
[normal]say first of all that none of that is linked to NHS Property Services Limited at
[normal] all? This discussion with 
[normal]Deloit
[normal]te was pre 
[normal]the 
[normal]general election and
[normal] pre any idea 
[normal]that 
[normal]w
[normal]e would set up something like Property Services Limited.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hose two things are not connected. 
[normal]Q340 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] E
[normal]xcept for 
[normal]the 
[normal]connection that 
[normal]I 
[normal]drew between 
[normal]whether
[normal] there were concerns over an individual, which is what 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose we are questioning here, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]appropriateness of th
[normal]at individual then setting up NHS Property S
[normal]ervices with this question hanging over them, which 
[normal]I 
[normal]note was not resolved until 28 May, whic
[normal]h is after 
[normal]the 
[normal]general election.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hat is why 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose 
[normal]I 
[normal]am asking these questions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t relates to 
[normal]the 
[normal]appropriateness of 
[normal]the 
[normal]individual concerned
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Then, if—and 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not saying it is—
[normal]it was found 
[normal]the 
[normal]individual concerned was not appropriate because events were going on surrounding them in some way
[normal], of course
[normal] that impacts 
[normal]the 
[normal]set-
[normal]up and 
[normal]the 
[normal]wisdom of those to whom they reported a
[normal]nd those who authorised his set-
[normal]up as a director in terms of him being 
[normal]the 
[normal]person to set up a property company of £5 billion. 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough it i
[normal]s not directly to do with Property S
[normal]ervice
[normal]s—
[normal]I 
[normal]do understand that—
[normal]it is very pertinent to it and that is what 
[normal]I 
[normal]am trying to gain from you.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: Okay;
[normal] we will go straight 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]point that there was no
[normal]thing in any discussions with Deloitte
[normal] or anything that 
[normal]I 
[normal]have ever seen that would have me question in any 
[normal]way 
[normal]the 
[normal]personal integrity of 
[normal]Peter Coates.
[normal]Q341 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Could you 
[normal]give
[normal] an illustration of
[normal]—
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]issue with Deloitte at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time was concern expressed to us about whether Deloitte were getting work at 
[normal]the 
[normal]same time as other consultancy firms were getting work.
[normal]Q342 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] In what 
[normal]sense
[normal]—
[normal]that they were getting more or less work?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: No; 
[normal]a view about whether they were getting sufficient work r
[normal]elative to other organisations. 
[normal]That was something that was fully investigated and there were no issues about that at all.
[normal]Q343 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] Why w
[normal]as there any reason to suppose they would not be getting as much work? Was there any suggestion or events that led up to Deloitte raising these concerns? Who raised 
[normal]the 
[normal]concern that they were not 
[normal]getting 
[normal]enough work?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]Concerns were raised separately in an anonymous letter to us 
[normal]and 
[normal]that was fully investigated.
[normal]Q344 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]The
[normal] anonymou
[normal]s letter was sent to you saying,
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]We do not think we are getting enough work.
[normal]”
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]It was sent to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Permanent Secretary of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time.
[normal]Q345 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Who was that?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: It was 
[normal]Sir Hugh Taylor at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time and that was fully investigated
[normal] at the time
[normal].
[normal]Q346 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] A
[normal]n
[normal] anonymous 
[normal]letter
[normal] was sent to 
[normal]Sir Hugh Taylor ra
[normal]ising concerns that Deloitte were
[normal] not receiving enough work.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]Yes.
[normal]Q347 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Would we be able 
[normal]to
[normal] access that anonymous letter?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]would have to check back on that because that was subject then to 
[normal]an
[normal] 
[normal]investigation 
[normal]by the 
[normal]department. It was concerning individuals
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]would have to check
[normal],
[normal] from a legal and HR perspective
[normal],
[normal] whether it would be appropriate for to us do that.
[normal]Q348 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Of course. 
[normal]Was
[normal] it concerning individuals within 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department or individuals within Deloitte?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]That letter was concerning individuals within 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department, yes.
[normal]Q349 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] So n
[normal]o indi
[normal]viduals in Deloitte were named. 
[normal]I 
[normal]am 
[normal]just 
[normal]struggling to understand. You have 
[normal]not really answered my question—
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]In their letter, no.
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] —w
[normal]hy Peter would want 
[normal]“
[normal]further commentary
[normal]”
[normal] and 
[normal]to
[normal] look into 
[normal]the 
[normal]points that 
[normal]were
[normal] raised in 
[normal]the 
[normal]note.
[normal] 
[normal]What were those points that Peter raised in 
[normal]the 
[normal]note?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]Peter had had concerns about 
[normal]the 
[normal]work with Deloitte in relation to a couple of members of Deloitte staff at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time.
[normal]Q350 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Were those concerns ever substantiated?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]They were not issues that were needed to be taken forward because we were having a normal business relationship with Deloitte.
[normal]Q351 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am
[normal] trying to get a narrative here so that 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not have to keep on asking you boring questions and 
[normal]submit 
[normal]FOIs
[normal],
[normal] which 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure your officials are very tired of by now. Peter Coates raised concerns ab
[normal]out two officials in Deloitte; 
[normal]so it is people in Deloitte.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]There were issues about working with some individuals in Deloitte at 
[normal]the 
[normal]time. 
[normal]Q352 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Were those 
[normal]issues
[normal] ever substantiated? Was there any evidence of that? What was going on?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot remember 
[normal]the 
[normal]precise details that far back on that discussion with Deloitte. 
[normal]Q353 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] W
[normal]as 
[normal]the 
[normal]anonymous note with regard to Deloitte not getting enough work in any way related to Peter Coates 
[normal]raising
[normal] concerns about two individuals at Deloitte? Is that an odd coincidence
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]eople might be afraid that, say, work was being diverted from Deloitte because an officer had concerns
[normal],
[normal] which obviously turned out not to
[normal] be substantiated?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]As part of this
[normal],
[normal] we looked at 
[normal]the 
[normal]contracts that had been let for consultancy services, 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis on which they had been let and whether Deloitte appear
[normal]ed
[normal] to have been treated any differently 
[normal]from
[normal] any other organisation. There was no evidence of that.
[normal]Q354 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]So Peter Coates
[normal]’s
[normal] concerns were what again?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot remember 
[normal]the 
[normal]precise nature of it going back to 2010.
[normal]Q355 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Would they be in 
[normal]the 
[normal]note attaching further commentary, would you imagine, that 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department will be able to provide for me?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am not sure whether they are in that note or not.
[normal]Q356 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Okay. You can 
[normal]understand
[normal] why this is of some concern because 
[normal]I 
[normal]am afraid your Department provides quite a lot of information informally from people who have been concerned about 
[normal]the 
[normal]way things have been conducted. S
[normal]o 
[normal]I 
[normal]feel it is my job as a Select Committee member to 
[normal]ask
[normal] these questions and 
[normal]I 
[normal]would be most grateful if we were able to get that note of 19 January
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]ls
[normal]o, it refers to meetings as well. Could 
[normal]I 
[normal]get
[normal] some assistance with FOIs regarding meetings that went on between key indi
[normal]viduals? 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to say 
[normal]I 
[normal]think, and 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]public find, that 
[normal]it 
[normal]is 
[normal]slightly upsetting and difficult to understand when simple requests 
[normal]for
[normal] meeting dates between individuals and minutes of those meetings come back as only ava
[normal]ilable at disproportionate cost. S
[normal]o
[normal],
[normal] in 
[normal]the 
[normal]interests of my never having to raise issues like this again, 
[normal]I would ask 
[normal]that those requests that 
[normal]I 
[normal]will be putting in are treate
[normal]d as effectively as possible. 
[normal]My second question is regarding 
[normal]the 
[normal]re
[normal]placement of 
[normal]the 
[normal]chair of NHS Property S
[normal]ervices. An account was given in correspondence about that chair
[normal]’
[normal]s departure. What process is in place for appointing a new chairman?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]We have advertised for a new chairman. There will be an appoint
[normal]ment panel that I,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the 
[normal]Permanent Secretary and one of our non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]executives
[normal] from another arm
[normal]’
[normal]s length body will sit on. We will then make recommendations to Ministers on that appointment.
[normal]Q357 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Have you any ideas 
[normal]about
[normal] who this might be?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]There are people that we would encourage to apply for it
[normal],
[normal] and we will look and see what 
[normal]the 
[normal]market produces as well.
[normal]Q358 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]reason 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to ask is this. W
[normal]hat cor
[normal]respondence have you had with Mark Boyle from 
[normal]the 
[normal]Shareholder E
[normal]xecutive
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]have been led to understand that he has already received e
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]mail correspondence about taking on this position. Could you perhaps enlighten us as to what that correspondence contains?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]We have encouraged Mark to apply for this.
[normal]Q359 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] I
[normal]t is still a 
[normal]transparent
[normal] process, but you 
[normal]have 
[normal]already approached someone for 
[normal]the 
[normal]job.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]normal process is to make sure we have credible candidates for positions that we advertise.
[normal]Q360 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] [bold]The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]reason 
[normal]I 
[normal]have to ask this is 
[normal]that 
[normal]again someone from within 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department is raising concerns about 
[normal]the 
[normal]way 
[normal]the 
[normal]process 
[normal]has been
[normal] managed
[normal],
[normal] and there is an allegation being made that because of questions 
[normal]I 
[normal]have asked
[normal]—
[normal]I 
[normal]will be very candid with you
[normal]—
[normal]the 
[normal]appointment had already been made and there was a plan to appoint this person slightly more quickly, shall we say, than otherwise. Would you be able to perhaps put our minds at rest and provide us with 
[normal]the 
[normal]correspondence t
[normal]hat has been going on between 
[normal]Mark Boyle and 
[normal]the 
[normal]Department just to prove that these allegations
[normal]—
[normal]Una O’Brien[bold]: 
[normal]Can we 
[normal]just 
[normal]knock 
[normal]that
[normal] on 
[normal]the 
[normal]head? We have placed an advertisement. It is absolutely normal practice to encourage people to apply. Do you know how difficult it is to persuade capable people to come forward to take chairmanships of major organisations? It is extremely difficult to get capable people to step forward. It is absolutely right and legitimate that we should contact people and say, 
[normal]“
[normal]We are interested in and encourage you to apply.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]am chairing 
[normal]the 
[normal]panel
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]can assure you that 
[normal]I 
[normal]will make sure, as will Ri
[normal]chard—
[normal]and we will app
[normal]oint an external non
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]executive
[normal]—
[normal]that this process 
[normal]will be
[normal] conducted as we have said it will be.
[normal]Q361 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]apologise for 
[normal]always
[normal] seeming like 
[normal]the 
[normal]awkward squad at these Committees
[normal],
[normal] but 
[normal]I 
[normal]hope you can understand from my perspective a
[normal]s an MP—
[normal]and it is this Committee
[normal]’s role as a scrutiny body—that, 
[normal]if 
[normal]I 
[normal]receive communications from concerned members of your Department
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]feel it would be remiss of me not to raise these in front of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Committee. 
[normal]I 
[normal]appreciate 
[normal]I 
[normal]am probably not 
[normal]the 
[normal]most popular person
[normal] at all
[normal], but 
[normal]I 
[normal]do hope you appreciate that it would be remiss of me not to raise these concerns with you and not to give you 
[normal]the 
[normal]opportunity to put our minds at rest
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]fter all, 
[normal]the 
[normal]people we are all of us serving are 
[normal]the 
[normal]public and, essentially, 
[normal]the 
[normal]patients
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]reason that 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose scrutiny like this should be a welcome thing is so that things like this can be aired in a collaborative and open way. 
[normal]I 
[normal]would like a
[normal]ny correspondence an
[normal]d help you can give me with my i
[normal]nquiries so that these issu
[normal]es can be cleared up—
[normal]obviously people are concerned
[normal],
[normal] otherwise 
[normal]I 
[normal]would not be g
[normal]etting communications about it—and
[normal] laid to rest
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n that way everyone is able to get on with their jobs
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]at
[normal] which 
[normal]I 
[normal]am sure everyone is working very hard.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]Let me be clear. 
[normal]I 
[normal]interviewed Mark for another role. Mark was considered to be someone who was above 
[normal]the 
[normal]line for that role. He had a very good track record. He was not in 
[normal]the 
[normal]end appointed to 
[normal]the 
[normal]role. 
[normal]I 
[normal]recommended Mark then for repl
[normal]acement to Property S
[normal]ervices chair when 
[normal]I 
[normal]k
[normal]new 
[normal]the 
[normal]chair was going. In 
[normal]light of 
[normal]the 
[normal]con
[normal]cerns around 
[normal]the 
[normal]governance of Property S
[normal]ervices, 
[normal]I 
[normal]then decided 
[normal]that 
[normal]we 
[normal]really 
[normal]need
[normal]ed
[normal] to talk with 
[normal]the 
[normal]Minister about having a full competition
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] which Mark could apply
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]B
[normal]ut he was someone who had been through an interview process that 
[normal]I 
[normal]saw and 
[normal]I 
[normal]thought fitted 
[normal]the 
[normal]bill at that time.
[normal]Q362 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] About when
[normal] would 
[normal]you
[normal] have recommended him? Can you recall?
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]cannot remember 
[normal]the 
[normal]precise dates
[normal] and 
[normal]I 
[normal]am trying to think when 
[normal]the 
[normal]i
[normal]nterview was for 
[normal]the 
[normal]other job, but it would have been towards 
[normal]the 
[normal]beginning of autumn, 
[normal]I 
[normal]would think
[normal],
[normal] on this.
[normal]Q363 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]You will be able to reassure us and any concerned people
[normal]—and I am sure you can—
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]process in 
[normal]appointing
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]next chairman will be 
[normal]completely transparent and open.
[normal]Richard Douglas[bold]: 
[normal]Yes.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think that is 
[normal]just 
[normal]what 
[normal]the 
[normal]Permanent Secretary said. 
[normal]Charlotte Leslie:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you very much. 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Valerie wants to move on to trust finances
[normal],
[normal] and we will try to get you away on 
[normal]the 
[normal]str
[normal]oke of
[normal] five o
[normal]’
[normal]clock.
[normal]Q364 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]T
[normal]his is a very 
[normal]important
[normal] issue. As to t
[normal]rusts and foundation trusts, 
[normal]I 
[normal]think 
[normal]the 
[normal]National Audit Office have said some of them are in difficulty
[normal],
[normal] and with 
[normal]the 
[normal]winter crisi
[normal]s and A and E crisis going on y
[normal]ou have allocated some funds to them
[normal]—
[normal]£250 million.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It is £400 million to help with winter pressures.
[normal]Q365 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] No;
[normal] 
[normal]£
[normal]250 
[normal]million
[normal] for 
[normal]the 
[normal]foundation trusts and £150 million to 
[normal]the 
[normal]CCGs. Is that not right? 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It is 
[normal]£
[normal]400 million to help 
[normal]the 
[normal]whole NHS with winter pressures.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]mechanism through which 
[normal]the 
[normal]money is distributed is
[normal] slightly different with 
[normal]the 
[normal]two funds
[normal],
[normal] but it was about £300 million last y
[normal]ear and we have increased it to £400 
[normal]million this year.
[normal]Q366 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose that will help us to get to 
[normal]the 
[normal]bottom of it
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]was in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Chamber when you made both those announcements, so £250 million was to 
[normal]the 
[normal]foundation trusts. Can we get that correct or not? Just give us 
[normal]the 
[normal]figure then.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]am trying to do that. £250 million was decided in August and it was to 53 areas, some of which were foundation trusts and some of which were NHS trusts and not foundation trusts.
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Yes.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: S
[normal]ome 
[normal]of it 
[normal]w
[normal]ent to help ambulance services and 
[normal]some to help NHS 111 centres. Basically
[normal],
[normal] we decided to allocate that money where we thought 
[normal]the 
[normal]pressures were going to be greatest for winter and we made that decision in August.
[normal]Q367 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Could you tell me what you took 
[normal]into
[normal] account when you made those decisions? Did 
[normal]the 
[normal]trusts or foundation trusts c
[normal]o
[normal]me to you and say they needed 
[normal]the 
[normal]extra money? Were they 
[normal]the 
[normal]failing trusts?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]No.
[normal] 
[normal]I 
[normal]asked NHS England, 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS T
[normal]rust Development Authority and Monitor to collectively decide where they thought 
[normal]the 
[normal]need was greatest in terms of winter funding pressures
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]hey selected 53 health economies where they thought there were particular needs
[normal],
[normal] and then they negotiated with those health economies as to how 
[normal]the 
[normal]fund
[normal]s
[normal] should be spent.
[normal]Q368 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]But 
[normal]I 
[normal]suppose those were 
[normal]areas
[normal] in trouble. What 
[normal]I 
[normal]am gettin
[normal]g is that people in 
[normal]the 
[normal]NHS were saying that you we
[normal]re kind of rewarding failure, which is why your second tranche came out.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]It was a very difficult call
[normal],
[normal] because what happened with 
[normal]the 
[normal]£300 million last year was that essentially it was distributed evenly, including to a lot of areas that were performing extremely well
[normal],
[normal] and of course you have to make a call
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I decided that it
[normal] would be a better use of taxpayers
[normal]’ money and would
[normal] have more impact for 
[normal]the 
[normal]winter if that money was distributed to 
[normal]the 
[normal]areas where we thought 
[normal]the 
[normal]biggest problems existed
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]O
[normal]f course, by definition, those are 
[normal]the 
[normal]areas that are less successful. But because we were then able to identify another £150 million of 
[normal]underspend
[normal], as it happens
[normal]—
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]was going to ask you where 
[normal]the 
[normal]money came from.
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: —
[normal]we were in fact able to give all areas broadly 
[normal]the 
[normal]same as they recei
[normal]ved. When you tot it up to 
[normal]the 
[normal]£400 million, b
[normal]asically all areas got broadly what they got last year
[normal],
[normal] but areas with particular problems got more.
[normal]Q369 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Correct me if 
[normal]I 
[normal]am wrong, but 
[normal]I 
[normal]understand that this £150 million was going to 57 CCGs as opposed to 
[normal]the 
[normal]trusts and 
[normal]the 
[normal]foundation trusts, or is that not correct? 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]I 
[normal]do not know if it was 57 CCGs
[normal],
[normal] but it was essentially designed to go out to 
[normal]the 
[normal]people who had not received 
[normal]the 
[normal]£250 million but had got some support last year.
[normal]Q370 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]When you say 
[normal]“
[normal]people
[normal]”
[normal], what do you mean?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Organisations.
[normal]Q371 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Which 
[normal]particular
[normal] ones? 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: All organisations that
[normal] have A and E departments receive some help from 
[normal]the 
[normal]£400 million.
[normal]Q372 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Can 
[normal]anybody
[normal] help? We had understood that it was going in two di
[normal]fferent directions and w
[normal]e just wanted to find out why.
[normal]Sir David Nicholson[bold]: 
[normal]At 
[normal]the 
[normal]end of 
[normal]the 
[normal]day
[normal],
[normal] £400 million 
[normal]has gone out.
[normal] £300 million of that has essentially gone out on 
[normal]the 
[normal]basis of fair shares in 
[normal]the 
[normal]same way that it would have done and £100 million has been targeted at those areas. That is 
[normal]the 
[normal]net result of what we have done. 
[normal]Q373 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] Is 
[normal]all that money 
[normal]underspend
[normal] money or has it come from different areas?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]No. The
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]£150 million of it is.
[normal]Q374 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] That is 
[normal]underspend
[normal], a
[normal]nd 
[normal]the 
[normal]other lot?
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]That is additional.
[normal]Valerie [bold]Vaz[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]Okay.
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]I 
[normal]think, on that note, three minutes ahead of schedule, we will say a quick thank you
[normal]— 
[normal]Mr Hunt[bold]: 
[normal]Thank you very much.
[normal]Chair:[bold] —
[normal]and good wishes, on my part, to 
[normal]the 
[normal]Prime Minister.
