defaultQ239 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultSecretary
default of State, you come with a big team. You are extremely welcome. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not 
defaultthink Mr Rouse has been before—you are very welcome—
defaultbut others have
default,
default so they probably do not need an introduction. 
defaultI 
defaultwould like, if 
defaultI 
defaultmay, to open 
defaultthe 
defaultquestioning by referring to some evidence John Appleby from 
defaultthe 
defaultKing
default’
defaults Fund gave us when he came to talk about public ex
defaultpenditure in health. He said: “…
defaultthe 
defaultreal 
defaultissue is not about saving money…
defaultbut what you spend that money on.
default”
default That is where 
defaultI 
defaultwant to open 
defaultthe 
defaultdiscussion
default,
default because
default,
default whenever we talk about rising trend
defaults of demand for health and care and 
defaultthe 
defaultr
defaultesource constraints that exist, 
defaultthere is a sort of orthodoxy these days that demand grows by 4% per annum
default—t
defaulthat is a total
default—and 
defaultthat somehow we have 
defaultto meet that growth of demand.
defaultThe 
defaultproposition 
defaultI 
defaultwant to open with is t
defaulthat it is not just about totals; it
default is al
defaultso about who is in that demand and 
defaultwhat 
defaultis 
defaultthe 
defaultchanging nature of 
defaultthe 
defaultdemand that is going to be placed upon 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem in 
defaultthe 
defaultprojected period to 2020 that NHS England 
defaultare
default now 
defaulttalking about.
default 
defaultI 
defaultwould be grateful if you could tell 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee what work is being done either within 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health or within NHS England to understand 
defaultthe 
defaultchanging shape of demand and
default,
default therefore
default,
default by implication of course
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultchanging nature of 
defaultthe 
defaultservices that 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem is going to have to provide.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThis is 
defaultthe 
defaultcentral debate and 
defaultthe 
defaultdiscussion that we need to have if we are going to secure a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm sustainable future for 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS
default,
default which is 
defaultwhat everyone wants. 
defaultI 
defaulthave been doing 
defaultthe 
defaultjob for just over a year
default, and my own view 
defaultis that
default,
default because of Mid Staffordshire and Francis, inevitably 
defaultthe 
defaultnational spotlight has been on hospital care and how we deliver hospital services, but 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaulta much more fundamental issue that we have to wrestle with is out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default care. That 4% figure is not fixed. If we spend our money more wisely, 
defaultand 
defaultin particular move to prevention rather than simply thinking about cure, we have a chance to reduce that demand growth, but of course that is not a novel thing to say. People have been s
defaultaying that for a very long time
default and so we have been doing a lot of thinking about what needs to happen
default.
default NHS England are developing a primary care strategy and 
defaultI 
defaultwork very closely with them on 
defaultthe 
defaultnew GP contract
default,
default which is 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst step
default—
defaultbut only 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst step
default—
defaultin that process. 
defaultThere are still significant efficiency savings that can be found throughout 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem
default—and we can talk about those—
defaultbut in 
defaultthe 
defaultend we need to think about 
defaultthe 
defaultnature of services we provide
default.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultvery big and challenging question, which we have not really had a public debate on in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that we should, is how we maintain and improve 
defaultthe 
defaultlevels of service offered by hospitals at 
defaultthe 
defaultsame time as transferring more resources into out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default care.
defaultQ240 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBut is there not a 
defaulttrap
default always in thinking about what this means for hospitals
default,
default GPs or pharmacists
default,
default rather than, as we were saying in 
defaultthe 
defaultdebate yesterday on 
defaultthe 
defaultCare Bill, starting with 
defaultthe 
defaultpatient and identifying what morbidities 
defaultthe 
defaultpatients of 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture will suffer from
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaulthow 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem meets the
defaultir
default&#xa0;
defaultneed
defaults
default and reflects 
defaultthe 
defaultchanging nature of demand, so that it is not national, global numbers, 
defaultbut within a locality? H
defaultow many people in this area are going to suffer from diabetes
default or from dementia? 
defaultWhat are w
defaulte going to do to risk-
defaultstratify in this community
default,
default to meet 
defaultthe 
defaultdemands placed on 
defaultthe 
defaultservices in this community? Can 
defaultI 
defaultpush you on 
defaultthe 
defaultextent to which there is real research being done
default,
default rather than assumptions being made
default,
default to inform 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy
default&#x2011;
defaultmaking
default process, otherwise we shall be here in two or three years
default’
default time saying, 
default“
defaultWe ran out of money
default”
default? 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultYes, it is 
defaultthe 
defaultright thing to push me on. 
defaultI 
defaultam sure we can do more, but we are doing a lot already, and particularly through Public Health 
defaultEngland
default,
default 
defaultwith 
defaultwh
defaultich 
defaultI 
defaulthad a meeting 
defaultthis morning. 
defaultWe need to address one of 
defaultthe 
defaultcentral challenges 
defaultwith out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital care
default,
default which is where 
defaultthe 
defaultaccountability line lies. When you have frail elderly people or disabled children with complex long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions, it is not always clear where 
defaultthe 
defaultbuck stops in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is something that we need to address if we are going to make sure that they get 
defaultthe 
defaultwrap
default-
defaultaround care they need
default,
default which
default,
default in turn
default,
default will minimise their hospital bills and mean that they get 
defaultthe 
defaultbest care they possibly can. 
defaultBut there is another responsibility as well
default,
default which is 
defaultthe 
defaultresponsibility for people who are healthy
default,
default who
defaultm
default we want to stay healthy
default,
default who
defaultm
default we do not want to get di
defaultabetes or 
defaultdevelop other long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions until 
defaultthe 
defaultlast possible moment. 
defaultO
defaultne of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings 
defaultwe are looking at is population-
defaultlevel health statistics 
defaultheld by GP practices—
defaultfor example, whether it is possible to track by GP practice 
defaultthe 
defaultnumber of cancers that are diagnosed at a late stage rather than an early stage and what
default more can be done. You, Chair
default, talk a lot about integration. 
defaultI 
defaultam not sure that we are integrated enough between 
defaultthe 
defaultactivities of Public Health 
defaultEngland
default, who are responsible, for example, for health checks
default,
default and GP surgeries, who have a responsibility for early diagnosis as well.
defaultQ241 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI 
defaultwill 
defaulthave
default one final shot and then 
defaultI 
defaultshall go to Sarah. If people are going to understand in their local community 
defaultthe 
defaultneed for services to change, surely step one of that process is to show that
default,
default in a loc
defaultality, not just 
defaultthe 
defaultGP services
default but 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole
default health and wellbeing structure
default are asking themselves questions about what demand is going to look like two, three or five years out and create a narrative around what these individuals living in that community are going to need to enjoy a fuller life in five or 10 years
default’ time, and 
defaulte
defaultxplain it at a personal level. 
defaultUntil that exists, they will not accept 
defaultthe 
defaultneed to change 
defaultthe 
defaultservices that they have inherited and trust.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultYes
default, and
default perhaps 
defaultI 
defaultwill ask Sir David to come in on that point as well because he has done a lot o
defaultf thinking about service change;
default but 
defaultI 
defaultagree with that. There is one encouraging example where that did happen
default,
default and that is 
defaultthe 
defaultreconfiguration for north
default&#x2011;
defaultwest London, which 
defaultI 
defaultthink, in 
defaultthe 
defaultend, turned out to be a lot less controversial than people thought it would 
defaultbe 
defaultprecisely because it was locally led
default,
default and local commissioners
default—
defaultlocal GPs
default,
default in particular
default—
defaultwere able to make that very case to their local populations and were able to pres
defaultent 
defaultthe 
defaultup
defaultside of 
defaultthe 
defaultchanges very clearly to go alongside any of 
defaultthe 
defaultchanges that people 
defaultmight have been concerned about,
default 
defaultbut i
defaultn particular 
defaultthe 
defaultfact that part of that package is seven
default&#x2011;
defaultday
default GP surgery opening, which 
defaultI 
defaultthink people could immediately relate to as something they would benefit from.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: Underpinning this—and 
defaultwithout boring you to death with pr
defaultocess, which 
defaultI 
defaultknow can happen—
defaultis that it is at 
defaultthe 
defaultheart of that planning process that we kicked off today, as far as NHS England is concerned, in 
defaultthe 
defaultsense that, for 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst time, we are saying to every CCG that they need to come up with what their services 
defaultwill
default look like in five years
default’
default time. That sounds relatively trivial at one level, but it is quite a significant issue when you think about how you have to build that understanding on both what 
defaultthe 
defaultpopulation 
defaultis
default saying but also on a joint strategic needs assessment over a significant period. Out of that will come a whole set of issues around local demand that we do not really understand at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment
default but we will get out of that
default. 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultwe have 
defaultthe 
defaultbeginnings of a process to enable us to do that in 
defaultthe 
defaultplanning that we did today.
defaultQ242 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultI 
defaultstate for 
defaultthe 
defaultrecord that 
defaultI 
defaultam married to 
defaulta 
defaultforensic psychiatrist
default,
default who works full time in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS. 
defaultMy question is about 
defaultthe 
defaultshift that everyone recognises needs to go into community services
default,
default and particularly into areas like parity of esteem for mental health. Could 
defaultthe 
defaultpanel comment on how we are going to establish parity of esteem for mental health
default,
default when in fact 
defaultthe 
defaultfunding is going in 
defaultthe 
defaultother direction in that 
defaultthe 
defaulthospital acute sector is still 
defaulthoovering
default up 
defaultthe 
defaultvast majority and increasing its share of total spend in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwill make a brief comment and then hand over to Jon Rouse to add to it, if 
defaultI 
defaultmay. This is a problem that, at its heart, is caused by 
defaultthe 
defaultfact that we have an 18
default&#x2011;
defaultweek waiting time target for physical health but no equivalent target for access to mental health. Unintentionally
default, because 
defaultI 
defaultam sure this was never intended
default, 
defaultthat has tended to suck money into 
defaultthe 
defaultarea where people are being measured and highly accountable in a public way and away from mental health
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have seen 
defaultthe 
defaultconsequences of that in additional winter pressures over 
defaultthe 
defaultabsence of easily accessible psychiatric liaison services, for example. 
defaultI
defaultn 
defaultthe 
defaultnew mandate we 
defaulthave 
defaultcommitted ourselves to working towards fully costing out a mental health waiting times target in 
defaultthe 
defaultnext few months. Jon, do you want to add to that?
defaultJon Rousedefault: 
defaultYes
default. You have to tackle this in a multi
defaultfaceted
default way
default. Some of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings we ha
defaultve to focus on are as follows. The first is
default information. We have a lot of information on mental health that is not properly analysed, understood and disseminated to commissioners in a usable form so that they can drive service improvement. Secondly, it is about commissioning itself
default,
default and NHS England and Sir David may want to say more about this as they are do
defaulting a lot of work through 
defaultthe 
defaultCommissioning A
defaultssembly and 
defaultthe 
defaultacademic networks to be able to improve 
defaultthe 
defaultquality of local commissioning for mental health services. Thirdly, it is about standards themselves
default,
default and we now have a proper outcomes framework for challenging localities for progress on mental health. Finally
default, 
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultsuppose it is a bit more philosophical
default, 
defaultprobably 
defaultthe 
defaultmodel of provision for mental health over ma
defaultny years has become over
default&#x2011;
defaultclinici
defaultsed
default and we have to get a better balanc
defaulte between social and clinical. 
defaultThere is a big role for social work within that.
defaultQ243 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultCan 
defaultI 
defaultcome back on one very serious issue
default,
default 
defaultwhich is 
defaultsection 136 and detentions
default?
default In 
defaultthe 
defaultDevon and 
defaultCornwall
default police area
default,
default 25 children so far this year have been detained in cells instead of in an appropriate place of safety. Some of those children were as young as 12 and 13. That is an example of a gross situation where there is no parity of esteem. It would be unthinkable for a child with a broken leg to be waiting in a police cell for an assessment
default.
default 
defaultCan
default 
defaultthe 
defaultpanel reassure us that that will not be happening next year?
defaultJon Rousedefault: It is certainly unacceptable; t
defaulthat is 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst thing to say. The
default&#xa0;
defaultgood news is that there has been a reduction overall in 
defaultthe 
defaultnumbers of people who are having to be detai
defaultned in police cells, and clearly
default we want to have as many people as possible in clinical settings when they are being assessed. One of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings we have been working on over 
defaultthe 
defaulta
defaultutumn is 
defaultthe 
defaultdevelopment of a 
defaultcrisis care concordat
default,
default which has brought together a whole range of organisations, including NHS England, 
defaultthe 
defaultpolice, 
defaultthe 
defaultambulance service and 
defaultthe 
defaultcourts service
default,
default to review from first principles how crisis care should work from pre
default&#x2011;
defaultcrisis
default—
defaultbecause often with people who have long
default&#x2011;
defaultstanding mental health conditions you can plan for crisis
default—
defaultright through to recovery from crisis. We are probably about a month away from being in a position to publish that document
default,
default and that will hold 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole system mutu
defaultally to account for progress. 
defaultFinally, 
defaultand again Sir David m
defaultay want to say more about this, 
defaultBruce Keogh
default’
defaults review of urgent care is crucial here to make sure that 
defaultthe 
defaultpathways that are defined work for people with mental health condit
defaultions as well as physical health conditions—
defaultand, of course, where they have both physical and mental health issues.
defaultQ244 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultCan 
defaultI 
defaultask how you 
defaultthink
default 
defaultthe 
default“
defaultany qualified provider
default” 
defaultsystem is going to help you achieve efficiency gains? CCGs have inherited 
defaultthe 
defaultdecisions of their predecessor PCTs
default,
default who were forced, or required, to commit themselves to a number of contracts under AQP
default. A
defaultcross 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry, not just in my own area, t
defaulthis has resulted in, for example, a high
default&#x2011;
defaultstreet
default optician—
defaulta well
default&#x2011;
defaultknown name
default—
defaultproviding hearing aids, 
defaultand
default 
defaultI 
defaultam sure you know of that particular system. 
defaultI
defaultt has left 
defaultthe 
defaultCCG with 
defaultan impossible-to-
defaultmanage budget
default,
default which has 
defaultno upper limit, so long as p
defaultatients can be driven in through 
defaultthe 
defaultfront door of this particula
defaultr high
default&#x2011;
defaultstreet
default provider and 
defaultthe 
defaultprovider
default will follow human nature or 
defaultthe 
defaultcommercial rationale of doing everything they can to attract them in, in 
defaultthe 
defaultproper manner and within 
defaultthe 
defaultrules, of course. 
defaultHow does that system help 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment achieve their efficiency gain
default, 
defaultwhat monitoring are you undertaking
default,
default and, if you are monitoring it, what decisions are you making with regard to h
defaultow 
defaultyou are going to roll it out
default or
default,
default indeed
default,
default not roll it out any further because it is not providing you with a means by which you can achieve 
defaultthe 
defaultefficiency gains you need?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultShall 
defaultI 
defaultstart on that? It is clear that 
defaultthe 
defaultintention of 
defaultthe 
defaultHealth and Social Care Act is that CCGs should be able to commission 
defaultthe 
defaultservices that they believe are in 
defaultthe 
defaultinterests of patients locally, so 
defaultI 
defaultwould be concerned if any CCG felt that they were not able, in 
defaultthe 
defaultcase that you mentioned, 
defaultto 
defaultcommission services that were in 
defaultthe 
defaultinterests of patients. The
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultinterests of patients
default” also includes
default having a budget that they are abl
defaulte to control at sensible levels, because, i
defaultf they cannot do that
default,
default that impacts on services available to them.
defaultQ245 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default They cannot under AQP. They tell me—t
defaulthey confirmed wit
defaulth me—that they have no control; they inherit this. I
defaultt is not just in NHS 
defaultKernow
default but
default across 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry. Where they have inherited 
defaultthe 
defaultAQP arrangement, my understanding is that they cannot control 
defaultthe 
defaultupper limit of what patients demand from those services.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThey may have inherited a contract from 
defaultthe 
defaultprevious PCT and 
defaultthe 
defaultcontract will not be 
defaultfor ever
default, but in many NHS contracts there are measures in place to control demand. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know 
defaultthe 
defaultindividual details of that case.
defaultQ246 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultNo, but 
defaultI 
defaultam sure that Sir David must be aware of these arrangements.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultmost obvious place where we use 
default“
defaultany qualified provider
default”
default is in elective care in 
defaultthe 
defaultsense that people can choose to go to any provider that they wish to
default, to have elective care,
default and we do not put a ceiling on all that. We think that is a p
defaulterfectly reasonable thing to do,
default driven by patients and their choices. But as to 
defaultthe 
defaultparticular example that you give on hearing aids, if 
defaultthe 
defaultCCG feel that it is inappropriate
default,
default given 
defaultthe 
defaultcontractual framework that they operate in, they can withdraw from it.
defaultQ247 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default They can at any time?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultYes, they can.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ248 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultSecretary 
defaultof
default State, 
defaultI 
defaultwant to ask about available money and pay. Your Department has argued in a submission to 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS pay review bodies that there should be no general 1% salary increase in 2014, contrary to what had been previously indicated, and that progr
defaultession pay should also be ended
default as part of a move to pay 
default“
defaultwith stronger links to 
defaultperformance, quality and productivity.”
default Do you believe that there needs to be continued pay restraint in order to make 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS funding settlement viable?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultYes, 
defaultI 
defaultdo. 
defaultI 
defaulthope 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee will forgive me if 
defaultI 
defaultdo not elaborate too much on this answer because we are in 
defaultthe 
defaultmiddle of negotiations now over this. 
defaultI 
defaultwill 
defaultmake two points. First, 
defaultI 
defaultdearly want to give NHS employees 
defaultthe 
default1% rise that we want to give across 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic sector. If money was no object, 
defaultI 
defaultwould like to give them more because 
defaultI 
defaultthink they are working extremely hard under very challenging circumstances, but budgetary constraints exist. 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultcommitment that 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment made was not 1% regardless of any other increments that you may be getting in your pay package; it was that everyone in 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic sector should get at least a 1% rise
default,
default and we want to honour that, but we do need to negotiate on 
defaultthe 
defaultincrements that are a part of many NHS contracts, which mean
defaults
default that pay in certain contracts can go up by as much as 6% or 7% automatically. My concern is 
defaultthat, 
defaultif we do not do that and we agreed to 
defaultthe 
default1%, essentially an unaffordable 1% increase in 
defaultthe 
defaultpay bill equates to about 10,000 front
default&#x2011;
defaultline posts
default. T
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultthing that makes 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS different from other parts of 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic sector is that we are expanding in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultnumber of people we employ at 
defaultthe 
defaultfront line
default,
default and we want to employ more people, particularly in 
defaultthe 
defaultwake of 
defaultthe 
defaultFrancis report. Hospitals want to employ another 4,000 nurses compared 
defaultwith
default a year ago
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultwant them to employ those extra nurses. 
defaultI
defaultt is something we need to do to meet our commitments under Francis. 
defaultI 
defaultwant to make sure that trusts end up with a financial position that enables them to do that.
defaultQ249 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultDo you think it is a fair accusation to say that there is 
defaultan 
defaultover
default-
defaultreliance on pay restraint to enable 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS to meet its efficiency target
defaults
default?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultWe recognise that 
defaultthe 
defaultpay freeze that we started this Parliament with is not sustainable and that is why we have moved to 1%. We also recognise
default—
defaultand Sir David, 
defaultI 
defaultam sure, would want to comment on this
default—
defaultthat that means we have to be even more imaginative in finding other ways to make efficiency savings because we cannot constantly rely on 
defaultthe 
defaultkind of pay restraint that we have had to date.
defaultQ250 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultSo you are not
default 
defaultconsidering
default maintaining p
defaultay restra
defaultint beyond 2014?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultNo, we are; that is precisely what we are negotiating at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment. We do believe there needs to be pay restraint and it is very important that we are successful in that ambition.
defaultQ251 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultSo there will be pay 
defaultrestraint
default over 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole of 
defaultthe 
defaultnext spe
defaultnding review period. We can take that as read?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultspending review period we have agreed is until 
defaultthe 
defaultend of March 2016, so 
defaultI 
defaultcannot comment on anything beyond that, but certainly until that period, yes, indeed
default,
default there needs to be pay restraint.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ252 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThis follows up, Sir 
defaultDavid
default, 
defaultthe 
defaultpoints 
defaultthat 
defaultwe put to you at our last meeting. The
default&#xa0;
defaultbroad question
default 
defaultI 
defaultwant to ask—
defaultI 
defaulthave some other points to make as well
default—
defaultis 
defaultwhether
default you think you have enough information available about 
defaultthe 
defaultway 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS operates, including on issues such as staffing and redundancy
default,
default so that you can identify and address issues of concern
default.
default 
defaultYou may remember at our last meeting that my colleague Valerie 
defaultVaz
default asked you about 
defaultthe 
defaultfigure for people being made redundant and then rehired
default,
default and we went through a question and answer where in fact you said you did not have that information. But we have been sent 
defaultthe 
defaultinformation in a table since and we have that here. The
default&#xa0;
defaultfigures are quite interesting in 
defaultthe 
defaulttable that 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment sent us
default.
default 
defaultThey state 
defaultthat 19,126 
defaultmembers of 
defaultstaff wer
defaulte made redundant, 3,261 of whom 
defaulthave been rehired to 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS after redundancy, including 2,534 within one year
default,
default and, fascinatingly, 403 within 28 days of being made redundant. 
defaultAt 
defaultthe 
defaultsame meeting you were asked a question about Ruth 
defaultCarnall
default,
default and you 
defaultinitially 
defaulttold us that she was not doing paid work for 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS after she had taken what turns out to be retirement
default,
default but not redundancy
default,
default and a pension, but we learned duri
defaultng 
defaultthe 
defaultmeeting via social media—and in 
defaultfact you told us too—
defaultthat that was not 
defaultthe 
defaultcase and she was being paid for 
defaultthe 
defaultwork she is doing at 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS in Manchester. 
defaultNow, 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy. You told us that there was a policy that people who were made redundant would not then move into paid employment
default—you said—
defaultfor a period of six months, but 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand there is also a policy around re
default&#x2011;
defaultemployment
default of people who have taken early r
defaultetirement and pensions that “O
defaultffers of re
default&#x2011;
defaultemployment
default,
default or payments for consultancy work
default,
default are not expected to 
defaultbe made
default 
defaultto former S
defaultcheme members who have taken early retirement
default from 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS at public expense…” 
defaultSo here we have a policy around r
defaultehiring people after redundancy and
default rehiring people 
defaultwho have taken early retirement
default that just does not seem to work. We seem to have a practice of getting rid of posts for people via redundancy or early retirement, with sometimes very costly pay
default&#x2011;
defaultoffs
default, and then rehiring them. In some cases you are straightforwardly rehiring them as staff again, and that is shown in 
defaultthe 
defaulttable you have sent us, or they have been taken on in other parts of 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS as consultants and you are effectively paying them twice. 
defaultT
defaulthis is really of concern. We thought it was a concern at 
defaultthe 
defaultlast meeting but we did not have much information from you. Can you explain how you have a policy 
defaultthat
default you are just not upholding?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam sure Una will want to talk about 
defaultthe 
defaultbroader issue, but 
defaultI 
defaultcan deal with it from 
defaultthe 
defaultperspective of NHS England and what we have done. 
defaultYes, it is an absolutely legitimate thing to raise this whole issue about rehiring. We went through 
defaultthe 
defaultprocess of 
defaultthe 
defaulttransition
default,
default and we tried to reduce 
defaultthe 
defaultamount of redundancy to 
defaultthe 
defaultabsolute limits of what we could do
default.
default 
defaultA
defaults you know, we originally 
defaultthought we would spend about
default £1.5 billion on redundancy
default,
default and in fact 
defaultwe 
defaultonly spent £600 million or £700 million on
default it. So we managed to do that, a
defaultlthough 
defaultI 
defaulthave to say 
defaultI 
defaulthave also been criticised for transferring too many people from 
defaultthe 
defaultold system into 
defaultthe 
defaultnew one as well. But, nevertheless, we have reduced 
defaultthe 
defaultredundancy bill significantly based on what we thought beforehand. Of course, we have delivered
default—
defaultwe will have done by 
defaultthe 
defaultend of 
defaultthe 
defaultParliament
default—
default£5.5 billion
default&#x2011;
defaultworth
default of savings
default that we can reinvest in front-
defaultline services, which 
defaultI 
defaultthink is not to be ignored at all
default; it is very important. 
defaultIn terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople, you are absolutely right that we have a position where, legally, if someone is made redundant they can be re
default-
defaultemployed within 
default2
default8 days. 
defaultI 
defaultwrote to all 
defaultthe 
defaultsenior people in 
defaultthe 
defaultSHAs as part of 
defaultthe 
defaulttransition arrangement saying that 
defaultI 
defaultunderstood that was 
defaultthe 
defaultcase
default,
default but 
defaultI 
defaultwanted them voluntarily to agree 
defaulteither 
defaultnot to be rehired or work as a consultant for at least six months.
defaultQ253 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThat is 
defaultnot
default happening.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaulthave no legal basis on which to do that. 
defaultI 
defaulthave no power to make it happen. 
defaultI 
defaultjust asked them not to do that. 
defaultI 
defaultcan confirm, in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultvery senior managers, that NHS England has not either funded or employed any of those people over 
defaultthe 
defaultperiod. That is NHS England.
defaultQ254 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultOver which 
defaultperiod
default, sorry?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultOver 
defaultthe 
defaultsix months since 
defaultthe 
defaultbeginning of NHS England
default’
defaults existence.
defaultQ255 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultDo you mean as employees or consultants?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultEither.
defaultQ256 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultSo 
defaultwhat
default about Ruth 
defaultCarnall
default?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultNHS 
defaultEngland 
defaulthave not employed Ruth 
defaultCarnall
default in any capacity. 
defaultQ257 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultShe 
defaultworked
default in 
defaultManchester
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultThe point 
defaultI 
defaultam trying to make i
defaults for NHS England. The
default&#xa0;
defaultissue, of course, as you know, is
default that 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS is not a single organisation. It is made up of almost 500 different employers, all of which have their own arrangements and it is
default—
defaultQ258 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultLet me stop 
defaultyou
default at that point. You have a policy that is impossible for you to enforce because now it is so fragmented that you do not have control over those parts of it. You can write and ask them not to do this
default,
default and they can just ignore it. That is what has happened, is it not? Ruth 
defaultCarnall
default i
defaults one example
default, 
defaultand heaven knows how many others there are
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultam not in any way doubting that s
defaulthe is a talented staff member, 
defaultthat she has skills and something to offer, but this is 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of public money. This is 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of public money
default—
defaultpay
default&#x2011;
defaultoffs
default and redundancies and people taking pensions from 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic purse and then being re
default-
defaultemployed in another capacity and being paid 
defaultfor 
defaultconsultancy. Effectively, what we are seeing is people being paid twice from 
defaultthe 
defaultsame purse.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcompletely understand that and 
defaultI 
defaultthink you are absolutely right. That was why 
defaultI 
defaultwrote 
defaultthe 
defaultletter out saying that 
defaultI 
defaultwanted people voluntarily to do it. Bu
defaultt you are absolutely right—
defaultI 
defaultdo not have 
defaultthe 
defaultpower at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment to enforce that
default—
defaultQ259 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default And 
defaultno
default one does.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault:
default 
default—
defaultin CCGs
default,
default foundation trusts or NHS trusts overall, so that power does not exist in 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem as we operate at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment.
defaultQ260 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default T
defaulthat policy that 
defaultI 
defaultquoted parts of is effectively meaningless
default,
default because you cannot stop people being rehired and you certainly cannot stop people coming back and being paid as consultants at all.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcannot, no, in 
defaultthe 
defaultjob that 
defaultI 
defaultdo.
defaultQ261 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultSo 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy that
default 
defaultI 
defaultquoted
default from is meaningless. 
defaultThey are being paid twice. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know if 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary 
defaultof S
defaulttate wants to say how we come to have a policy that we cannot enforce. 
defaultMr Sharma:default 
defaultIs there anyone who can control that?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultfirst point 
defaultI 
defaultwould make is that 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS is 1.7 million people strong
default,
default and successive Governments, not just this Government, have concluded that it does not work to try and run it as a single structure with everyone reporting up directly to 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of State at 
defaultthe 
defaulttop of 
defaultthe 
defaultpyramid
default.
default 
defaultSo 
defaultsuccessive Governments
default—
defaultfor example, 
defaultthe 
defaultlast Government
default—
defaultintroduced 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy on foundation trusts
default that
default operate as independent bodies. 
defaultW
defaulte do not have 
defaultthe 
defaultpower
default—
defaultSir David is absolutely right
default—
defaultto stop 
defaultsome
defaultone leaving one foundation trust and rejoining another, even though you are absolutely right to say that, ultimately, both salaries or consultancy figures are paid for by 
defaultthe 
defaulttaxpayer. 
defaultW
defaulte took that decision because we recognised that we needed to have a system that is
default—
default 
defaultQ262 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think it is a 
defaultquestion
default of people moving, Secretary of State. 
defaultI 
defaultthink it is a question of 
defaultthe 
defaultreorganisation 
defaultthat
default your Bill forced through and people being made redundant
default—
defaultin some cases, their structures going
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink that 
defaultis 
defaultthe 
defaultcase with Ruth 
defaultCarnall
default. H
defaulter s
defaulttructure disappeared, so there wa
defaults a redundan
defaultcy pay
default&#x2011;
defaultoff
default; there is 
defaultan early retirement
default. T
defaulthese are very substantially highly paid people
default,
default who are getting that amount of money and then just coming back
default in through 
defaultthe 
defaultrevolving door as
default consultants
default,
default just popping up somewhere else in 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry. It is not people moving. The
default&#xa0;
defaultreal issue is people being paid twice.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultOkay. So if we come to reorganisations, which happened a number of times under 
defaultthe 
defaultlast Government as well as under this Government
default— 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultNot as expensively as this one, 
defaultI 
defaulthave to say.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThis one is also saving a lot more money. 
defaultQ263 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultPoint 
defaultto
default one that has cost £3 billion.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt is saving £5.5 billion, but that is a different discussion. As a result of what we have learned from this reorganisation
default—
defaultand indeed practised under previous reorganisations
default—
defaultwe have now changed 
defaultthe 
defaultrules
default.
default 
defaultWhen n
defaultational arm
default’
defaults length bodies are re
default-
defaultemploying someone who has been working for another arm
default’
defaults length b
defaultody or in a previous structure, if they are re-employed within a year, that person pays b
defaultack their redundancy on a pro
default&#x2011;
defaultrata
default basis. That is a change in 
defaultthe 
defaultrules to deal with that issue.
defaultQ264 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultDoes that apply to any of these people 
defaultwho have been re
defaulthired?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultWe cannot apply it retrospectively because people are entitled to their own contractual entitlements, but it is a rule that we have introduced. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know whether 
defaultthe 
defaultPermanent Secretary wants to answer that.
defaultQ265 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultYou have 
defaultrehired
default 17% of 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho
default were made redundant in 
defaultthe 
defaultlast three years, according to 
defaultthe 
defaultfigures 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment sent us, and that is a very substantial proportion; 17% have been taken back on again, a number of them within 28 days, ridiculously enough, and most
default of them within one year. That smacks of appallingly bad planning—
defaultthat they were not able to be redeployed from 
defaultthe 
defaultrole you were moving them out of
default into another one
default. It smacks of carelessness with public money. 
defaultI 
defaultam sure that people outside 
defaulthere will not be impressed that you have policies that you cannot enforce
default,
default and
default,
default now that you have thought of a way of enforcing them
default,
default you cannot do anything about 
defaultthe 
defaultcosts that have already been incurred. 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultLet me ask 
defaultthe 
defaultPermanent Secretary to come in 
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultwill come back 
defaulton that.
defaultUna O’Briendefault: 
defaultThe first thing to say is that very significant
default efforts were made to restrain 
defaultthe 
defaulttotal amount of money spent on redundancy. That was a significant effort
default,
default and it meant that a significant number of people who were entitled to redundancy payments under 
defaultthe 
defaultrules set in 2006 did not get those payments but got jobs in 
defaultthe 
defaultnew system. 
defaultT
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultfacts bear out what David 
defaulthas said—
defaultthat a significant proportion of people employed in 
defaultthe 
defaultnew system are in different jobs
default, many of them,
default and some of them have much bigger jobs
default. B
defaultut 
defaultthe 
defaulttruth is that we did not spend a lot of money on redundancy that we would otherwise have spent. That was our focus and we were very
default, very
default determined to keep that redundancy bill as low as possible. 
defaultIf 
defaultI 
defaultcould come on to 
defaultthe 
defaultnext point
default—
default 
defaultQ266 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultthink 19,000 staff have been made redundant
default.
default 
defaultW
defaultith a good proportion of those coming back
default,
default it does not follow through with what you are saying.
defaultUna O’Briendefault: 
defaultCurrently
default,
default 
defaultthe 
default2006 rule is that
default,
default if someone is re
default-
defaultemployed within 28 days, they have to pay back their redundancy. 
defaultI 
defaultthink that rule is too lax and we now need to change 
defaultit
default. We need to change it so that, as 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary
default 
defaultState
default has said, if you are re
default-
defaultemployed within a year in another NHS organisation and you are in receipt of redundancy payment
default,
default you pay it back pro rata. 
defaultI 
defaultwould point out that it is absolutely true that you have identified for people who have very long service and who are on high salaries that their redundancy payments are significant, but it is most usually 
defaultthe 
defaultcase that people
default’
defaults redundancy payments are relatively modest
default.
default 
defaultS
defaulto there can be a junior administrator made redundant on £15,000 or £20,000
default,
default who, six months later, finds a job in another organisation, a job that was not available or vacant at 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint at which they were made redundant. This is an industry and 
defaultI 
defaultdo think that 
defaultpoint 
defaultneeds to be
default made.
defaultQ267 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave given 
defaultan 
defaultexample
default of one of your most
default high
defaultly
default paid staff
default,
default who has now been effectively paid twice.
defaultUna O’Briendefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwa
defaultnt to come on to that, if may. 
defaultThe th
defaultird point is that 
defaultit is well known, fo
defaultr example, in 
defaultthe 
defaultcivil service that we have 
defaultthe 
defaultAdvisory Committee on Business Appointments
default where there are arrangements
default,
default if you are made redundant or you leave
default for other reasons
default, particularly 
defaultin 
defaulta senior position, that you are restrained in 
defaultthe 
defaultwork that you do, particularly that you should obtain no commercial advantage from your experience. 
defaultI 
defaultnow want all 
defaultthe 
defaultarm
default’
defaults length bodies of 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment to follow 
defaultthe 
defaultexample 
defaultthat
default David has 
defaultset
default in NHS England by beginning as he means to go on
default,
default which is to set business rules equivalent 
defaultto 
defaultthe 
defaultcivil s
defaultervice rules for NHS England. 
defaultI 
defaultnow expect all 
defaultthe 
defaultarm
default’
defaults length bod
defaulties
default for 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health to do that so that 
defaultpeople’s 
defaultexpectations 
defaultare 
defaultthe 
defaultsame as those
default 
defaultfor
default civil servants when they leave office, particularly people who have been in a job where they gain knowledge or contacts
default. Before they move on to their next role or a
defaultt 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint at whi
defaultch they take up their next role,
default they 
defaultwill 
defaulthave to get an agreement 
defaultabout 
defaultwhether they have to have a waiting period or step back for an appropriate amount of time so that we do not get 
defaultthe 
defaultsort of situation that you have described. 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIt sounds as if you needed to have done that before
default,
default because
default,
default clearly
default,
default with 
defaultthe 
defaultreorganisation
default,
default a very large number of 
defaultmanagers—
defaultyou have n
defaultot supplied us with 
defaultthe 
defaultfigures, 
defaultbut we have had other 
defaultfigures in 
defaultthe 
defaultHouse of Commons—who 
defaulthave been made redundant and rehired as well
default,
default and there are examples of people 
defaultwho
default are very highly paid
default,
default 
defaultwho
default have taken packages and are n
defaultow coming back as consultants. 
defaultYou have given us 
defaultthe 
defaultresponse, but 
defaultI 
defaultthink that there will be a view outside her
defaulte that this is not satisfactory;
default 
defaultt
defaulthis should have been dealt with earlier
default;
default if you have policies now that you cannot make retrospective, you have used money from 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic purse that you should not have done
default; and 
defaultthis is not a satisfactory situation. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThere are several members of 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee who want to come in
default on this
default, but if we are going to spend all afternoon on 
defaultit
default we are not going to get
default—
defaultQ268 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultWhile 
defaultwe
default are on pay, 
defaultI 
defaultwant to ask a question about whe
defaultre 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment currently lie
default in respect of 
defaultthe 
defaultrisk, as 
defaultI 
defaultsee it
default—
defaultand perhaps
default,
default Secretary State
default, you
default 
defaultmay
default take a different view
default—
defaultabout 
defaultthe 
defaultpossibility that foundation trusts, NHS trust
defaults, may 
defaultintroduce regional pay. 
defaultYou are aware that your predecessor took 
defaultthe 
defaultview that
default,
default while he was not going to direct 
defaultthe 
defaultsouth
default&#x2011;
defaultwest consortium of 20 or so trusts to discontinue their activity of exploring 
defaultthe 
defaultposs
defaultibility, at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime that 
defaultthe 
defaultAgenda for Change national negotiations concluded
default,
default each of 
defaultthe 
defaulttrusts wrote to me and confirmed that they would abide by 
defaultthe 
defaultnational pay, terms and conditions
default,
default providing they remained, as they put it, fit for purpose, which of course gave them 
defaultthe 
defaultlet
default&#x2011;
defaultout of reintroducing this concept at a later stage. 
defaultI 
defaultwant 
defaultto be clear about whether, if NHS organisations suggested they might introduce 
defaultthe 
defaultconcept of lower
default pay—
defaultthat is critical
default—
defaultin certain areas, 
defaultthat 
defaultis something which, as a Department, you would take action against, 
defaultthat you would discourage.
default What is 
defaultthe 
defaultview of your Department on that issue?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultAs a Department
default,
default we subscribe to 
defaultthe 
defaultprinciples behind autonomy and independence for foundation trusts. That is 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment policy and we want all hospitals over time to become foundation trusts. 
defaultW
defaulte really think it is a matter for them, but, as 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand it, most FTs, if not all, prefer to have national pay scales
default. They fi
defaultnd it easier to negotiate with their staff on 
defaultthe 
defaultbasis of them
default, 
defaultproviding those national pay scales are competitive and fair, both in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultemployees and what 
defaultthe 
defaultFTs want to deliver to their patients. The
default&#xa0;
defaultexample you cite was an example where 
defaultthe 
defaultsouth
default&#x2011;
defaultwest consortium 
defaultfelt
default that 
defaultthe 
defaultnational terms and conditions were not fair. Negotiations then proceeded. There was some flexibility on 
defaultthe 
defaultunion side and they were able to live with 
defaultthe 
defaultresult. 
defaultI 
defaultthink everyone has ended up happy and 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment 
defaultare
default happy as well.
defaultChair:default 
defaultCharlotte Leslie wants to talk about 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration fund
default,
default but before that she wants 
defaultto ask 
defaulta very quick question on this subject and then we 
defaultwill move
default on.
defaultQ269 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultVery quickly to round 
defaultoff
default 
defaultthe 
defaultdiscussion that Barbara led, it seems that a very large and expensive loophole was left in 
defaultthe 
defaultimplementation of 
defaultthe 
defaultreforms whereby people were able to get redundancy payment
defaults
default and pensions from 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth service and then go off into consultancy. It is commendable to write advice asking that these people do not take up any positions within 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS for six months after they have left
default,
default but it is kind of after 
defaultthe 
defaulthorse has bolted. Secretary of State, are you happy with 
defaultthe 
defaultway 
defaultthe 
defaultreforms were implemented in leaving that large loophole open?
defaultMr Huntdefault: Always, w
defaulthen you do something on that scale, 
defaultof course you 
defaultlearn lessons afterwards. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think it is possible in a huge system like 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth service to prevent people 
defaultfrom 
defaultleaving 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth service 
defaultand the
defaultn becoming consultants
default. I
defaultndeed
default,
default it may be in 
defaultthe 
defaultinterests of 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth service and patients that we are able to tap into 
defaultthe 
defaultexpertise of people on a time
default&#x2011;
defaultlimited
default basis through a consultancy contract. But what we do not want is abuse of that system and we do not want 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic to be paying twice. We have tried to learn 
defaultthe 
defaultlessons from this reorganisation and other reorganisations by making some changes, as 
defaultthe 
defaultPermanent Secretary outlined. 
defaultB
defaultut 
defaultthe 
defaultoverall point 
defaultI 
defaultwould make about these changes
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultdo think it is important to take 
defaultthe 
defaultoverall context
default—
defaultis that
default,
default by removing 23,000 administrative posts, including 8,000 managers, we are able to employ 6,500 more doctors. The
default&#xa0;
defaultNHS is able to do 800,000 more operations every year on broadly 
defaultthe 
defaultsame budget
default,
default and that is because we have moved a lot of money from back
default&#x2011;
defaultoffice
default functions to 
defaultthe 
defaultfront line. 
defaultI 
defaultthink that 
defaultthat, 
defaultoverall
default,
default represents a massive increase in value for money for every taxpayer
default’
defaults pound that goes into 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS.
defaultQ270 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default I
defaultn terms of 
defaultthe
default 
defaultperformance being good overall, this is an expensive loophole that, with hindsight, it would have been very good to close before we had this problem arise rather than have to write letters after 
defaultthe 
defaultevent asking people not to take up lucrative posts.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultdon’t think it would have been right not to do—
defaultSome of these things are quite complex and it is not as easy as just wishing 
defaultthe 
defaultproblem would go away or making a simple change
default,
default because people have rights under employment law. 
defaultW
defaulthere there are loopholes that are easy 
defaultto deal with, we have done that.
default 
defaultO
defaultne of those is 
defaultthe 
defaultnew 12
default&#x2011;
defaultmonth rule that we are implementing acr
defaultoss 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem. I
defaultt is not possible to implement those kinds of rules on a 
defaultvery 
defaultlocalised level, but
default,
default 
defaultobviously 
defaultwhere we can, we do everything 
defaultpossible 
defaultto make sure we get best value for money.
defaultChair:default Let us turn to i
defaultntegration transformation. 
defaultQ271 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default Absolutely; t
defaulthat is what 
defaultI 
defaultam 
defaultburning
default to ask about. What will 
defaultthe 
defaultimpact of 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration transformation fund of £3.8 billion 
defaultbe 
defaultand can you clarify whether this is new money or not?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt is not new money in that it comes from 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS budget
default,
default and it is now called, inc
defaultidentally, a much improved name—
defaultthe 
default“better care fund”—
defaultwhich 
defaultI 
defaulthope will make it much less of a mouthful for 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee and indeed all of us. It represents an additional £2 billion going from 
defaultthe 
defaultannual NHS budget into integrated support through 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth and social care system. The
default&#xa0;
defaultintention is to improve out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default services for some of 
defaultthe 
defaultmost frail and vulnerable older people who use 
defaultthe 
defaultsocial care system by giving them a joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default service and by being a catalyst. 
defaultI
defaultn order to access that money
default,
default CCGs and local authorities will have to jointly commission services. There is a list of things 
defaultthat have been on 
defaultthe 
defaultc
defaulthairman
default’
defaults list of requirements for any integrated care package for many years now 
defaultthat
default will have to be done in order to access this money. It is deliberately designed to be a sufficiently large sum of money 
defaultso 
defaultthat no one will feel that they cannot be bothered with accessing it. They will feel they have to access it
default. T
defaulthings like recor
defaultd sharing will be part of it,
default 
defaultand 
defaulthaving a named accountable clinician responsible for each and every one of those vulnerable older people will also be a part of it. But it comes from 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS budget. 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultother point about it is that we expect there will be significant savings both to 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS and 
defaultthe 
defaultsocial care sector in terms of, particularly, omission avoidance by proactively looking after people better in 
defaultthe 
defaultcommunity.
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ272 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThere are real 
defaultconcerns
default about whether 
defaultthe 
defaultplanning for 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration fund is going well. In fact, we have had concerns that it is not going well at all. 
defaultA
default witness 
defaultfrom 
defaultthe 
defaultNuffield Trust said: “M
defaulty anxiety is that planning is happening too late for this and it is happening too late to co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinate with 
defaultthe 
defaultacute sector.”
default 
defaultI
defaultn 
defaultthe 
defaultnext panel 
defaultthat 
defaultday we had witnesses from 
defaultthe 
defaultLGA
default,
default who did not talk about planning for 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration fund but talked about talking and developing relationships. So it seemed that 
defaultthe 
defaultLGA representative evidence bore out what we had heard from 
defaultthe 
defaultNuffield Trust. 
defaultI
defaultt seems that planning for integration is not robust enough
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink there are two things related to that. 
defaultFirst, there
default is a fear that 
defaultthe 
defaultmoney will not be spent as effectively
default, and, s
defaultecondly, 
defaultthat 
defaultyou will not make 
defaultthe 
defaultsavings that you just talked about. 
defaultT
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultreal fear is that there could be problems in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16 and that we will not see effective integrated working established. What we 
defaultwill see is just money going in
default 
defaultto soak up press
defaultures, of which there are plenty—obviously pressures in A and E and
default very substantial pressures around social care. That is what we have heard and we are concerned. Are you concerned and what can be done?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt is absolutely right to express that concern because it is very important that this is a real transformation
default,
default not just either a cosmetic transformation or a continuation of what we had before, which was much more limited in its ambition. But we have tried to mitigate 
defaultthe 
defaultrisk of that happening through a very aggressive timetable. The
default&#xa0;
defaultfund is for 
defaultthe 
defaultfinancial year 2015
default&#x2011;
default16, so it starts in April 2015, and we have said that we require all CCGs and local authorities to have put together their plans by April 
default2014, a
default whole year in advance. That gives us time to go through those plans in detail to check they are robust
default,
default but also, importantly, for 
defaultthe 
defaultplans that are good
default,
default we believe that many local authorities and CCGs will not want to wait. Even though they are not going to get access to 
defaultthe 
defaultfund till 2015, they will probably want to start a lot of 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration well before April 2015 and indeed make it part of their 2014
default&#x2011;
default15 cycle because of 
defaultthe 
defaultprospect of significant savings being made. But 
defaultI 
defaultthink you are absolutely right to say that
default,
default with a plan of this scale, it is all about 
defaultthe 
defaultimplementation and we need to monitor that very carefully.
defaultQ273 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWe did not 
defaulthear
default anything that gave us a lot of confidence that it was happening
default 
defaultbecause 
defaultthe 
defaultLGA representative talked about relationship building and that is 
defaultthe 
defaultstage they were at. 
defaultI
defaultf you are expecting to see plans in four or five months, 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople we have heard from do not suggest that is happening. One of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultdo not want to rehearse everything that happened in 
defaultthe 
defaultdebate yesterday
default—
defaultis that my own local authority, which is suffering from cuts, has had very substantial management resource 
defaultcuts. It has lost a chief executive—that post has been cut—and 
defaultthe 
defaultprevious chief executive
default’s
default job is now shared between three former deputies. There j
defaultust is not 
defaultthe 
defaultresource there. 
defaultYou cannot take 20%, for instance, out of social care and not lose managers and people 
defaultwho
default will do that planning. From what 
defaultI 
defaultsee locally in my area, there are not 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople on 
defaultthe 
defaultground in local government to do that planning. They have just spent all their time and had 
defaultthe 
defaultauditor in
default,
default and been talking about how they are going to make £75 million more cuts. They have to get that budget right because, if not, your colleague in DCLG will come in and do it for them. Where is 
defaultthe 
defaultresource that is going to 
defaultdo
default this planning
default?
default 
defaultW
defaulthat we have heard over 
defaultthe 
defaultlast number of weeks is that it is not happening yet
default.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultWe have said that we require those plans by April, so that is a pretty important deadline for all local authorities and CCGs because those are 
defaultthe 
defaultrules of 
defaultthe 
defaultfund. 
defaultW
defaulte will be following up very closely. But we recognise 
defaultthe 
defaultkind of challenges that you are talking about. It is very tough, particularly for local authorities
default,
default but actually tough for CCGs as well because they have huge pressures on their budgets. 
defaultT
defaulthis is something that is overwhelmingly in everybody
default’s interests. 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultnorth-
defaultwest has made some of 
defaultthe 
defaultbest progress towards integrated care of anywhere in 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry actually.
defaultQ274 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultYou 
defaulthave
default not mentioned 
defaultTorbay
default.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultAnd indeed Torbay
default—
defaultTorbay
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultnorth-
defaultwest.
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultStand by. 
defaultJon Rousedefault: 
defaultCan 
defaultI 
defaultadd 
defaultone point?
default 
defaultIt is 
defaulta counter
default&#x2011;
defaultbalance
default in terms o
defaultf what could give us confidence.
default In 
defaultthe 
defaultsummer
default,
default we asked for applications to be pioneers for integration
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultremember at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime 
defaultthat 
defaultwe had a bit of a sweepstake in 
defaultthe 
defaultoffice in terms of how many bids we would get
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultchose 
defaultthe 
defaulthighest number
default 
defaultand said 35. We actually got 99 and some of those had more than one local authority in them, so we had well over 100 of 
defaultthe 
default152 upper tier authorities bidding to be integration pioneers and putting all 
defaultthe 
defaultwork with their CCGs and their providers into those applications. 
defaultI 
defaultthink there is a real momentum out there. 
defaultI 
defaulttravel pretty extensively around 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry visiting localities. Most places are planning pretty transformational integration models 
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaulthave high hopes that that will be reflected in 
defaultthe 
defaultplans.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIt might be that people were more optimistic in 
defaultthe 
defaultsummer than they are when they are facing winter pressures, but 
defaultI 
defaulthave reflected to you what we have heard over 
defaultthe 
defaultlast few weeks from 
defaultthe 
defaultNuffield Trust and from 
defaultthe 
defaultLGA
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte can only tell you what we hear.
defaultQ275 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default Now o
defaultn to 
defaultTorbay
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultam very glad that they are an integration pioneer. Can 
defaultI 
defaulttouch on 
defaultthe 
defaultimpact of 
defaultthe 
defaultCare Bill
default,
default because 
defaultthe 
defaultCare Bill is going to impose many new statutory responsibilities on councils? If 
defaultI 
defaultlook, say, at an area like Torbay, they are going to have a crunch year in 2015 when their projected funding will fall to below 90% of their projected expenditure
default, 
defaultand that is not including all 
defaultthe 
defaultnew commitments they will have
default. U
defaultnfortunately
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultimpact of that
default, it
default seems to me
default,
default 
defaultis 
defaultthat there is a risk that
default,
default because everything will have to go on t
defaultheir statutory responsibilities,
default there will be nothing left to fund 
defaultthe 
defaultkind of projects around 
defaultthe 
defaultvoluntary sector that provide all 
defaultthe 
defaultwellbeing that was 
defaultthe 
defaultstated aim of 
defaultthe 
defaultBill. 
defaultH
defaultow concerned 
defaultare 
defaultyou, Secretary of State, that we may not be able to put in place a lot of 
defaultthe 
defaultgood intention around wellbeing in 
defaultthe 
defaultCare Bill because of that funding pressure
default?
default In 
defaultTorbay
default’
defaults case, just in 
defaultthe 
defaultnext two years
default,
default they 
defaultwill
default hav
defaulte 
defaultto take out between £22 million and £27 million
default;
default 
defaultthe 
defaultelastic can only stretch so far
default.
default 
defaultA
defaults you will know, there is no fat on 
defaultthe 
defaultbone left. They have already done 
defaultthe 
defaultbul
defaultk of 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration that other
default areas have not even started.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwould not want to underestimate 
defaultthe 
defaultfinancial challenges facing local authorities. 
defaultI 
defaultthink it is very tough and it is very tough in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS, as you know
default,
default as well
default, b
defaultut that is why we are seeing such imagination and energy going into thinking about new ways of working
default.
default 
defaultS
defaultometimes it is at those times of financial pressure that people are at their most imaginative
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultthink that is one of 
defaultthe 
defaultreasons why Jon Rouse found such enthusiasm for 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration pioneers and one of 
defaultthe 
defaultreasons why people will really take seriously 
defaultthe 
defaultplans 
defaultthat we put forward for 
defaultthe 
defaultbetter care fund. 
defaultI 
defaultknow Torbay has also been one of 
defaultthe 
defaultpioneers when it comes to integration, but 
defaultI 
defaultthink there are a lot of things 
defaultwhere,
default even in 
defaultTorbay
default, we can do a lot better than we are currently doing
default. F
defaultor example, 
defaultas to 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of technology, 
defaultthe 
defaultnew GP contract includes agreement from GPs that has not existed before surrounding 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of 
defaultthe 
defaultGP record
default,
default which, with patients
default’
default consent, will now be able to be used throughout 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem electronically. So some very exciting things can happen, but 
defaultthe 
defaulttruth is
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultthink this relates to 
defaultthe 
defaultvery earliest discussion
default—
defaultwe absolutely need them to happen at pace because we need to make 
defaultthe 
defaultproductivity improvements deliver within 
defaultthe 
defaultbudgets.
defaultQ276 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultCan 
defaultI 
defaultcome 
defaultback
default to that
default,
default because within 
defaultTorbay
default, as you know, they have already done a huge amount of 
defaultthe 
defaultwork that ot
defaulther areas have not even started?
default They have 
defaultalready 
defaultcut their acute beds
default and
default have 
defaultthe 
defaultlowest, if you like, h
defaultospital admissions in 
defaultthe 
defaultsouth-
defaultwest; they are doing incredibly well nationally on scales for early discharge; they already have in 
defaultp
defaultlace all those mechanisms for 
defaultrapid equipment 
defaultand a single care co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinator—
defaultall these kinds of things. 
defaultI 
defaultwonder whether they are going to be able, even with 
defaultthe 
defaultmeasures you have outlined, to make sufficient savings and where it is all going to come from. Do you feel 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are going to have to see an increase in overall fund
defaulting for 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS in social care—
defaultnew money coming into 
defaultthe 
defaultsyst
defaultem—
defaultfor it to work?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultthink everyone is going to hav
defaulte to live within their budgets—
defaultbudgets that were agreed in 
defaultthe 
default2015
default&#x2011;
default16 spending settlement. 
defaultIndeed, 
defaultI 
defaultknow that 
defaultthe 
defaultLabour
default party have said if they win 
defaultthe 
defaultnext election they will stick to those spending limits in 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst year of a new Parliament as well. 
defaultW
defaulte are in a very invidious position nationally of having to deal with 
defaultthe 
defaultdeficit and that means we are going to have to live within those spending limits. 
defaultI 
defaultwould say that 
defaultthe 
defaultkind of vision that you have had in Torbay bodes extremely well because you have shown imagination
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultability of different parts of Government to work together has been tried and tested there
default,
default which should mean that you are more than up to meeting that challenge
default,
default 
defaultb
defaultut 
defaultI 
defaultdo not want to pretend it is going to be easy. 
defaultQ277 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI 
defaultthink
default part of 
defaultthe 
defaultscepticism of 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee about 
defaultthe 
defaultpace and scale of necessary change going on in 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem might derive from 
defaultthe 
defaultrelative absence of major proposals for service change affecting disinvestment from traditional models of care. Given 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint you were just making about 
defaultthe 
defaultresource constraints being here for 
defaultthe 
defaultmedium term, 
defaultthe 
defaultproposition that there is somethi
defaultng beyond imaginative thinking—i.e.
default imaginative action
default—would be more credible, would it not, 
defaultif we were seeing significant resource transfers out of 
defaultthe 
defaultacute sector into 
defaultthe 
defaultcommunity service, whereas what we are 
defaultactually 
defaultseeing is resources increasingly drifting into 
defaultthe 
defaultacute sector and out of community and primary care?
defaultMr Huntdefault: T
defaulthat is a fair point to make
default,
default but 
defaultI 
defaultwould say that 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultbetter care fund is a very good example of 
defaultthe 
defaultreverse happening because that is money that, by and large, is not going to be spent in 
defaultthe 
defaultacute sector at all. 
defaultI 
defaultthink that is 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst 
defaultreally 
defaultsignificant step
default.
default 
defaultA
defaults a result of 
defaultthe 
defaultbetter care fund
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultQIPP 
default—
default 
defaultQ278 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultDo we not have to establish in 
defaultthe 
defaultpolicy community
default’
defaults mind 
defaultthe 
defaultprinciple that 
defaultthe 
defaultbetter care fund, if it is to be real, means more community
default&#x2011;
defaultbased
default 
defaultservices, which means, in a cash-
defaultlimited budget, disinvestment from acute services
default,
default which, 
defaultthe 
defaultNAO says, are meeting need that never ought to have arisen?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwould say 
default“
defaultless money
default”
default rather than 
default“
defaultdisinvestment
default”.
default 
defaultL
defaultess money means more efficient use of resources, but 
defaultit 
defaultdoes mean 
defaultless money in 
defaultthe 
defaultacute sector. A
defaults a result 
defaultof 
defaultthe 
defaultbetter care fund, which is going to be real, we have to increase 
defaultthe 
defaultQIPP savings that we will be requiring from around £4.5 billion a year currently to around £5.5 billion in 2015
default&#x2011;
default16
default, and w
defaulte will have to find that extra money
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultam very happy to talk to you about how we can do that
default,
default but, yes, we will have to make savings because it will mean less cash spent in 
defaultthe 
defaultacute sector.
defaultQ279 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI 
defaultdo not want to hog it, but 
defaultI 
defaultguess
default 
defaultI 
defaultwould be more comfortable that it was more than 
default“
defaultearly stage discussions
default”
default if we were seeing some dust being thrown up by these proposals for 
default“less money”,
default to use your phrase
default,
default rather than disinvestment. I, like you, prefer that formulation; it is easier to understand.
defaultMr Huntdefault: Perhaps 
defaultI 
defaultcan re
defaultassure you by saying that we do intend, before 
defaultthe 
defaultend of March, to publish how we will get to 
defaultthe 
defaultnecessary QIPP savings for 2015
default&#x2011;
default16
default,
default and 
defaultthat will show 
defaulthow we think we can deliver that for that period of time. But there is a lot of work happening right 
defaultnow in order to firm up 
defaultthe 
defaultrealistic possibilities for saving money. We can go into those now if you like, but that is
default—
default  
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe do not have time to do that because 
defaultI 
defaultknow Andrew wants to go into 
defaultthe 
defaultimplications of this competition
default policy—
defaultsome of 
defaultthe 
defaultpoints that Sir David was making when he was last here.
defaultQ280 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default In fact 
defaultI 
defaultwill start with a quote from 
defaultyou, 
defaultSir David
default,
default on 5 November when you were before 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee where you described that we have a problem 
defaultthat
default may need legisla
defaulttive change. If 
defaultI 
defaultmay quote: “...c
defaultompetition was a tool to improve quality
default,
default to be used when commissioners felt it was 
defaultthe 
defaultright thing to do, not something that
default would be brought in externally…
defaultFor whatever reason, legislatively and in practice, that is not what is happening. 
defaultWhat is happening at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment…we are in my view
default getting bogged down in a morass of competition law
default,
default which is causing significant cost 
defaultin
default 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem.
default” 
defaultMy question to you, Secretary of State, is
default,
default do you agree with Sir David? Do you think that competition law is resulting in this morass and indeed is costing more than it is saving?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultbelieve that what is happening on 
defaultthe 
defaultground is not what 
defaultthe 
defaultAct intended as much as we want. 
defaultW
defaulte intended with 
defaultthe 
defaultAct that local commissioners—GPs—
defaultwould have 
defaultthe 
defaultpower to commission services in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that they believed was right for patients. They are operating under 
defaultthe 
defaultsame procurement rules as 
defaultthe 
defaultPCTs did
default,
default but they are new teams of people and they are finding that quite onerous. My own view is that we need to look at why that is and
default,
default in particular
default,
default whether there is advice and support we can give them so that they do not feel they are getting bogged down in that competition law. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think that it is a case of 
defaultthe 
defaultcompetition law that, as 
defaultI 
defaultsay, 
defaultthe 
defaultPCTs themselves were operating under necessarily being wrong, but we need to make sure that CCGs feel they have 
defaultthe 
defaultautonomy and 
defaultthe 
defaultability to commission in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that is in 
defaultthe 
defaultinterests of patients.
defaultQ281 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default I
defaultt 
defaultis 
defaultthe
default 
defaultCCGs that need tutoring and support, as it were, through this process
default?
default You would not agree with Sir David that there is a prospect for legislative change to achieve 
defaultthe 
defaultclarity that is needed in order to get 
defaultthe 
defaultefficiencies 
defaultthat 
defaultare clearly not being delivered
default.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultefficiencies are being delivered by a lot of CCGs
default—
defaultby 
defaultthe 
defaultway
default,
default 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think 
defaultthis
default is a problem that affects all CCGs
default—
defaultand, you know, all 
defaultthe 
defaultlegislation that we pass as a Government we keep under review to make sure that 
defaultthe 
defaultpractical way it is being implemented on 
defaultthe 
defaultground is in accordance with our intentions when we passed 
defaultthe 
defaultlegislation
default;
default and that is what we
default&#xa0;
defaultwill continue to do.
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultUnless anyone else wants to come in on that, 
defaultI 
defaultwant to ask a question
default—
default  
defaultQ282 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan 
defaultI 
defaultask a brie
defaultf question? If NHS England comes
default to you with a proposal to change 
defaultthe 
defaultlegislation to ensure that 
defaultthe 
defaultcompetition law is not an inhibition to necessary change, that is something that in principle you are pre
defaultpared to promote?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultOf course 
defaultI 
defaultwould listen to them very carefully because 
defaultI 
defaultwant 
defaultthe 
defaultcommissioning process to work and it is really important that it should work
default. S
defaulto 
defaultI 
defaultwant to make sure that 
defaultthe 
defaultintentions of 
defaultthe 
defaultAct are reflected in what happens on 
defaultthe 
defaultground. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think we are at that stage yet. 
defaultA
defaults 
defaultI 
defaultsay, CCGs are new organisations
default and
default 
defaultthey 
defaultare operating under 
defaultthe 
defaultsame procurement framework as their
default&#xa0;
defaultPCT predecessors, but, of course, PCTs were long 
defaultestablished
default and
default had lots of people who were used to dealing with procurement. EU procurement rules are a nightmare at 
defaultthe 
defaultbest of times. Having run my own private company, 
defaultI 
defaultexperienced them on a number of occasions
default,
default so 
defaultI 
defaultcan well understand 
defaultthe 
defaultfrustrations, but it is very much my job to listen to what NHS England say
default,
default to make sure that CCGs are able to do what 
defaultthe 
defaultAct intended.
defaultQ283 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultI 
defaultwill then move
default on to a 
defaultrelated
default issue, 
defaultwhich is 
defaultthe 
defaultrelationship between tariff funding and 
defaultthe 
defaultrisk or 
defaultthe 
defaultpotential perverse consequences of cherry
default&#x2011;
defaultpicking
default that might happen in 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem, whic
defaulth 
defaultI 
defaulthave raised before with you and we have corresponded on it, 
defaultand indeed with Sir David and Richard Douglas a year ago wh
defaulten we first raised this issue. 
defaultWe were told 
defaultat that stage—a year ago, that is—
defaultthat there was a concern about 
defaultthe 
defaultpotential risk of perverse consequences
default;
default that certain providers would, in effect, cream off 
defaultthe 
defaulteasier work and therefore profit from 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff arrangements and not undertake 
defaultthe 
defaultmore complex work because 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff system enabled them to do that
default;
default and that you
default,
default 
defaultor at least
default 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS commissioning b
defaultoard
default,
default were undertaking a review. 
defaultY
defaulto
defaultu were very specific last year—
defaultand inde
defaulted, Mr Douglas, you were clear—
defaultthat it was 
defaultthe 
defaultcommissioning b
defaultoard
default’
defaults responsibility to 
defaultundertake
default a review and to redesign 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff system to ensure that such unintended consequences did not occur. We sought clarity on that particular point and wanted to be absolutely clear that it was not Monitor
default’
defaults role
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultou were clear that it was not Monitor
default’s role;
default they were there purely to inject 
defaultthe 
defaultprices into 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem, but 
defaultthe 
defaultdesign itself was 
defaultfor 
defaultthe 
defaultcommissioning b
defaultoard. Is that right
default,
default and what progress have you made in 
defaultthe 
defaultlast year 
defaulttowards
default achieving this outcome?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultIn terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultbasic approach, you are absolutely right. In broad terms, 
defaultthe 
defaultcommissioning board sets 
defaultthe 
defaultstructure of what 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff should deliver and Monitor attaches a price to that
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere are some elements around 
defaultthe 
defaultedges, but that is 
defaultthe 
defaultbroad structure. The
default&#xa0;
defaultposition for next year for 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff is, broadly speaking, that it is steady state. There has not been and will not be a fundamental change to 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff for next year. It is now a matter again for NHS England and Monitor to work through what 
defaultthe 
defaultnext stage is
default,
default but there has been a deliberate decision for next year that we will keep 
defaultit
default broadly as it is. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know whether Davi
defaultd wants to add anything on that.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultNo, only to say that 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff is being published 
defaultI 
defaultthink today or tomorrow by Monitor. We have had our input into all that. We think that
default,
default with 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff
default,
default we have taken 
defaultthe 
defaultright balance between changes and continuity to enable trusts to have as much certainty as they can about 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture. But in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultparticular point that you make, if an individual commissioner or trust believes that a provider is acting in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that you describe
default—i.e. for other reasons, 
defaultselecting their
default patients on 
defaultthe 
defaultbasis of that—that is a matter for Monitor. 
defaultThat would be a complaint that could be made to Monitor and Monitor would investigate and take 
defaultthe 
defaultaction that was required.
defaultQ284 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultOn 
defaultwhat
default basis? 
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: Monitor has a responsibility—
defaultthe 
defaulttariff has a responsibility—
defaultboth to improve services to patients and also to enhance integration
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf in those circumstances they find a provider 
defaultis acting against that interest—i.e.
default against 
defaultthe 
defaultinterests of p
defaultatients in those circumstances—
defaultit can take action
default.
default  
defaultQ285 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultBut you 
defaultknow
default that this is going on all 
defaultthe 
defaulttime. You know this is going on all 
defaultthe 
defaulttime because you know that a lot of providers are not taking 
defaultthe 
defaultmore complex 
defaultpatients
default,
default and they have been set up to provide a system, particularly in 
defaultthe 
defaultarea of elective care, where they cannot. So that is going on anyway.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam sorry—
defaultyou were suggesting 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople were doing it
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultou are absolutely right that there are hip and knee providers
default and
default people who provide heart surgery, but that is part of 
defaultthe 
defaultsegmentation of 
defaultthe 
defaultway in which 
defaultthe 
defaultservice is delivered, is it not?
defaultQ286 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIt is
default,
default and
default,
default therefore
default,
default 
defaultfor 
defaultany
default patient 
defaultwho
default comes to them with a set of co
default&#x2011;
defaultmorbidities
default,
default or 
defaultwho 
defaultrepresents an anaesthetic risk 
defaultthat
default they are not prepared to take on, clearly they have designed a service that is cherry
default&#x2011;
defaultpicking
default 
defaultthe 
defaulteasier patients
default,
default for which they are then being paid a decent tariff to provide a service only to those patients and not to others.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: T
defaulthere are two separate issues here. You are absolutely right that in some circumstances, 
defaultin some stand
default&#x2011;
defaultalone elective units, it is not safe for them to treat people with a lot of co
default&#x2011;
defaultmorbidities
default,
default but that seems to me 
defaultthe 
defaultright thing. You would expect them not 
defaultto 
defaultdo it.
defaultQ287 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultNo, you are twisting 
defaultthe 
defaulttables on me—
default 
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: Sorry.
defaultAndrew George: —defaultwhich is a fair point.
default 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultissue is that
default,
default in those circumstances
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultproviders that are providing those elective services in limited circumstances are being paid at a rate that does not properly reflect 
defaultthe 
defaultrelatively low risk of patients that they take on
default. T
defaulthat is not reflected in other settings where they take on significantly more complex patients
default, and
default 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff does not properly reflect that for them.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: If you could give me examples
default that would be great, and 
defaultI 
defaultwill investigate the
defaultm
default. 
defaultQ288 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default Y
defaultou do not accept that this is a theme 
defaultthat has been raised with you?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultNo, it has absolutely be
defaulten
default raised with me
default,
default but on almost every occasion 
defaultwhere 
defaultwe have dealt with it in detail
default,
default we have found it either to be not 
defaultthe 
defaultcase or people 
defaulthave put in 
defaultaction to change it straight away.
defaultQ289 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultLast time 
defaultwe
default discussed this,
default 
defaultyou said that you would be road-
defaulttesting your proposed redesigned tarif
defaultf system.  Where did you road-
defaulttest
default it and what were 
defaultthe 
defaultoutcomes? 
defaultCan we read 
defaultthe 
defaultreport on your road-
defaulttesting, please? 
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcan do you a note
default on all that.
defaultQ290 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultwant to go back 
defaultto
default some of 
defaultthe 
defaultanswers you gave my two colleagues, Barbara 
defaultKeeley
default and Charlotte Leslie. The
default&#xa0;
defaultpoint they were trying to make
default,
default 
defaultto 
defaultwhich we did not quite get an answer
default,
default is that it is as a result of 
defaultthe 
defaultreorganisation that took place that this issue arose about 
defaultthe 
defaultrehiring
default. God bless Norman St
default John
default&#x2011;
defaultStevas
default for having a Select Committee structure, otherwise you would not have come back to us with information and perhaps you would not have discovered this loophole. Is that correct?
defaultMr Huntdefault: “
defaultG
defaultod bless Norman St John
default&#x2011;
defaultStevas
default”
default was not a phrase 
defaultI 
defaultwas expecting 
defaultto 
defaulthear this afternoon. 
defaultListen, 
defaultI 
defaultrecognise that when you do any reorganisation you learn lessons
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS has probably had more than its fair share of reorganisations over recent decades
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is 
defaultwhy we have decided to make this very profound and significant change after this one, which was to say that
default,
default if people rejoined 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS within 12 months of leaving 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS as part of 
defaulta 
defaultreorganisation
default,
default they should repay any redundancy
default money they were given on a pro-
defaultrata
default basis. So we have learned that. 
defaultA
defaultll 
defaultI 
defaultwould say is that in terms of value for money
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultam sorry to repeat myself
default—
defaultthe 
defaultonly reason that we are able now to be doing 600,000 more el
defaultective operations, and
default seeing 1.2 million more people every year in A and E
default,
default is because we have more people at 
defaultthe 
defaultfront line
default,
default and that was made possible by this
default&#xa0;
defaultreorganisation. 
defaultO
defaultverall
default,
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink it was a very big improvement in value for money because it did allow more resources to be 
defaultinvested 
defaultin 
defaultthe 
defaultfront line, which is what we needed to do.
defaultQ291 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultcongratulate
default you on your selective memory, but there was a transition and then a pause
default,
default and a number of people raised issues
default—
defaultprofessionals and we as a Select Committee
default did—
defaultabout 
defaultthe 
defaultHealth and Social Care Act and what was going to happen. 
defaultI
defaultt is clear from 
defaultthe
default letter that you sent 
defaultme—
defaultand
default,
default obviously
default,
default 
defaultI 
defaultam a bit upset
default really—that
default in 
defaultone of 
defaultthe 
defaultsentences you say, “T
defaulthe Department holds information 
defaultrelating to
default NHS managers who have been made redundant
default,
default but does not hold information on numbers re
default-
defaulthired as management consultants.
default” 
defaultAre you saying that money is being paid out of 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health and you have no idea who it is being paid to?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultWe make very significant multi
default&#x2011;
defaultmillion
default and multi
default&#x2011;
defaultbillion
default&#x2011;
defaultpound
default grants to other organisations. We have 
defaultthe 
defaultsecond biggest bu
defaultdget in Government. Then we as
defaultsure how 
defaultthe 
defaultmoney is spent with all those organisations, which is a very important part of 
defaultthe 
defaultrole.
defaultQ292 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Do you know that answer? D
defaultoes someone know 
defaultthe 
defaultanswer?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultWe do not know exactly how much money is spent by consultants in every single NHS organisation
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultquestion we have to ask when we are asked questio
defaultns like that by m
defaultembers of 
defaultthe 
defaultSelect Committee is about 
defaultthe 
defaultvalue for money
default,
default because there are a lot of organisations throughout 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS and it is an expensive business to do that. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know if you want to add anything, Richard.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultWe do not collect 
defaultthe 
defaultdata from every NHS organisation on precise
defaultly who they trade with day on
default day. 
defaultQ293 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut setting 
defaultthat
default aside
default, we are just talking about 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health because you do not seem to know
default—
default 
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultFor 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health itself
default—
default 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou do know 
defaultthe 
defaultanswer?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: —
defaultas opposed to NHS organisations, we will have 
defaultthe 
defaultinformation on every single individual organisation that we have paid out of our budget. 
defaultI
defaultf 
defaultthe 
defaultquestion is
default,
default 
default“C
defaultould we say for 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health 
defaultif there 
defaultis any?
default”, y
defaultes, we could. 
defaultI 
defaultcould go back and do that.
defaultQ294 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultGood. So let us go back to where 
defaultthis
default letter arose from. 
defaultI 
defaultsuppose we are a public exp
defaultenditure hearing or inquiry at 
defaultthe 
defaultminute, are we not? B
defaultut there is no
default mention of any money anywhere—
defaultno figures
default.
default Could we have another letter with some figures in?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam not quite sure which of 
defaultthe 
defaultfigures you are saying are missing.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultOn 
defaultthe 
defaultanswers t
defaulthat you have given me; y
defaultou very carefully set it out.
defaultMr Huntdefault: Okay; 
defaultI 
defaultwill look over that letter
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultf you could let me know 
defaultthe 
defaultexact bits where you would like
default—
default  
defaultQ295 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultFor all 
defaultthe 
defaultanswers
default to my questions here, you have numbers of people, but 
defaultI 
defaultthink it is quite helpful
default—
default 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt is 
defaultthe 
defaultletter you wrote to me.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIt is dated 9 Dece
defaultmber
default or stamped 9 December.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultWe will take that letter and have a look, and where we have numbers available
default—
defaultQ296 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Great; w
defaulte need figures. Obviously
default,
default you have 84,838 temporary staff
default,
default and so we would like to know, roughly, what sort of money is going out of 
defaultthe 
defaultaccounts. You say it is in 
defaultthe 
defaultaccounts, but 
defaultI think 
defaultit would have been helpful to have 
defaultthe 
defaultfig
defaultures here for us. 
defaultJust on 
defaultthe 
defaultother point, to clarify, because obviously Sir David was there and there were lots of 
default“
defaultI 
defaultdon’
defaultt know
default”
default answers, this letter has been written by you
default. S
defaulto
default,
default ultimately
default,
default are you 
defaultthe 
defaultperson responsible for all this information? 
defaultI
defaultf we want information, do we ask you? You are not going 
defaultto 
defaultsay, 
default“
defaultPlease ask Sir David.
default”
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwill either provide you 
defaultwith 
defaultthe 
defaultinformation myself or direct you to somewhere where you can get 
defaultthe 
defaultinformation. 
defaultQ297 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo you do not feel that 
defaultyou
default have a responsibility to 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic that you should be answering for NHS England or anyone else. Is that as a result of what has happened under 
defaultthe 
defaultHealth and Social Care Act?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam absolutely responsible for every penny of taxpayers
default’
default money that goes into 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS, but 
defaultI 
defaultbelieve
default—
defaultand
default,
default in fact
default,
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink this is a cross
default&#x2011;
defaultparty
default view
default—
defaultthat giving NHS organisations some autonomy in a huge ecosystem like 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS is a better way to get value for money than managing it as a sort of centralised monolith. 
defaultT
defaulthere are occasions when you ask me for information where 
defaultI 
defaultwould go to an arm
default’
defaults length body and ask them to provide that information or direct you to 
defaultthe 
defaultarm
default’
defaults length body.
defaultQ298 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultam glad 
defaultyou
default gave me that answer because it comes on to 
defaultthe 
defaultnext part
default,
default which is 
defaultthe 
defaultrole of 
defaultthe 
defaultCCGs
default, and they are statutory bodies
default, but now 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand they are going to be asked for a quarterly assessment of their effectiveness. Is that right?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwill ask Sir David to respond to that.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultYes. We have set up an assurance system, so quarterly
default—
default 
defaultQ299 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhy 
defaultis
default that? 
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultWe think it is 
defaultthe 
defaultbest way of assuring ourselves that they are delivering what they said they would deliver.
defaultQ300 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhy are you 
defaultdoing
default that now?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultBecause we think it is part of our responsibilities to do that.
defaultQ301 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou did not think about it 
defaultbefore
default?
default You did not think it was part of your responsibilities to find out what 
defaultthe 
defaultCCGs were doing before?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultThis is on a relatively limited set of numbers around outcomes that we are agreeing with them as part of their planning.
defaultQ302 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Tell us what they are. 
defaultTell us what you are 
defaultgoing
default to ask for.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultThere are 
defaultthe 
defaultfive elements of 
defaultthe 
defaultoutcomes framework, so stuff around mortality, 
defaultthe 
defaultquality of services for people with long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions, their delivery against a
default whole series of safety issues and 
defaulttheir patient experience issues. Let me get 
defaultthe 
defaultthree. There is 
defaultthe 
defaultstuff around 
defaultthe 
defaultway they govern themselves and organise themselves
default,
default because, as you know, they all went through an authorisation process and we have been working through with them. Some CCGs have had conditions attached to them, and we have been working with them to take them on. 
defaultThen there is 
defaultthe 
defaultquality of 
defaultthe 
defaultleadership of their organisation. 
defaultT
defaulthey are 
defaultthe 
defaultsorts of things you would expect us to do.
defaultQ303 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo they are not 
defaultindependent
default. You would be a kind of “
defaultMonitor
default”
default of CCGs?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwould not describe us as a “
defaultMonitor
default”
default of CCG
defaults
default, but we are assuring ourselves that they are delivering on what they said they would deliver.
defaultQ304 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDo you feel you have enough tools for that or do you think you might need some more?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaulttools are those that are set out in 
defaultthe 
defaultAct
default,
default and, like other organisations now, 
defaultwe 
defaulthave 
defaultto have 
defaulta very clear protocol as to 
defaultthe 
defaultway we deal with organisations that do not deliver. 
defaultW
defaulte think we have 
defaultthe 
defaulttools available to us to ensure that CCGs are either delivering great outcomes 
defaultfor
default their patients or are taking 
defaultthe 
defaultaction that they need to put themselves in place to do so.
defaultQ305 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhat is 
defaultthe 
defaultsanction if they do not?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultWe have a whole variety of sanctions, if you like, 
defaultsuch as 
defaultliterally withholding resource from them. We can withhold their quality premium. As you know, there is 
default£0.25 billion available to CCGs—an incentive fund—
defaultto deliver against those sorts of things
default;
default so we can either give them that or 
defaultwithhold it
default. 
defaultI 
defaulthave 
defaultthe 
defaultpower
default—
defaulthow can 
defaultI 
defaultput it in 
defaultthe 
defaultright way
default?—or 
defaultone of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings that 
defaultI 
defaultdo is
default 
defaultapprove 
defaultthe 
defaultaccountable officer of 
defaultthe 
defaultorganisation, so 
defaultI 
defaultcan withdraw 
defaultthe 
defaultpowers of 
defaultthe 
defaultaccountable officer. We can put people into 
defaultthe 
defaultorganisation, so we can insist that they have people to intervene to make things happen. 
defaultW
defaulte have a variety of things that we can do if we can sustain and justify 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint that we are not just taking action as a matter of our will but it is based on some real measurable alterations to 
defaultthe 
defaultservices that they 
defaultare 
defaultcommission
defaulting
default. 
defaultQ306 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo they are set up as local 
defaultorganisations
default making local decisions
default,
default but NHS England is going to be 
defaultthe 
defaultspider in 
defaultthe 
defaultmiddle
default,
default presumably
default,
default with 
defaultthe 
defaultten
defaulttacles that control all of them?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultMonitor as a spider with tentacles. 
defaultI 
defaultthink
default—
default 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Well, y
defaultou think of something else then.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcannot think of a better one than you have. We are certainly there on behalf of patients and 
defaultthe 
defaulttaxpayer to ensure that they are doing 
defaultthe 
defaultbest that they can for their local populations.
defaultQ307 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default W
defaultill 
defaultyou be 
defaulttaking
default a strategic view? A
default local CCG 
defaultmay make
default a decision, say, about reconfiguration and they take a strat
defaultegic view that both of you like, but w
defaulthat happens in 
defaultthe 
defaultsituation where you do not like it? Do you take a strategic view? Who is going to take 
defaultthe 
defaultstrategic view?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultWe have said in 
defaultthe 
defaultplanning guidance that we published today that CCGs have to come up with their own plans for their own localities for 
defaultthe 
defaultnext five years
default—
defaulttwo years operational, five years strategic. But for some services they have to come together in larger groups
default,
default because, obviously, 
defaultthe 
defaultpopulation size on which some of 
defaultthe 
defaultservices are planned 
defaultis
default greater than an individual CCG. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultprocess we would take is a process of assurance. They would set out their plans
default,
default organise their locality to make them happen
default,
default and we would assure ourselves that they were using 
defaultthe 
defaultfou
defaultr tests, for example, and make
default sure that they are properly consulting their public around them to enable us to make a judgment about whether they should go ahead.
defaultQ308 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultI 
defaultget what you are saying
default,
default but 
defaultI 
defaultam trying to work out why, then, if they are local and you have 
defaultthe 
defaultstrategic view, you need
default clause 118, Secretary of State.
defaultMr Huntdefault: C
defaultlause 118 is for 
defaultthe 
defaultvery particular situation where you have a trust that is in extreme difficulty and we need to find a solution because, for example, patient safety may be at risk
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is incredibly important in 
defaultthe 
defaultwake of Francis that we have a structure in place that is able to sort out those problems quickly and decisively
default. A
defaults part of 
defaultthe 
defaulttrust special administrator
default’
defaults remit, when a trust goes into administration, they are required to consult CCGs and 
defaultthe 
defaultfour tests do apply, but 
defaultthe 
defaultfour tests were never meant to give any individual CCG in a situation 
defaultthat
default involved multiple CCGs an absolute veto on change. 
defaultW
defaulte did not believe we needed clause 118 until 
defaultthe 
defaultHigh Court ruled that 
defaultI 
defaultwas not able to do what 
defaultI 
defaultdid over Lewisham hospital
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte realised that
default,
default in fact
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultintention of 
defaultthe 
defaultAct was not reflected in how 
defaultthe 
defaultcourts interpreted it;
default so that is why we need to make 
defaultthe 
defaultchange in clause 118.
defaultQ309 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultRig
defaultht. S
defaulto it goes 
defaultwider
default than just failing trusts, does it not? You have a very wide power there. Have you taken advice on that?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt applies to situations where trusts are in administration
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is why it is really important.
defaultQ310 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIs 
defaultthat 
defaultright
default, Secretary of State—
defaultjust trusts in administration?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultbelieve so.
defaultQ311 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAll right, okay. Does 
defaultanybody
default else want to comment? 
defaultI 
defaultunderstood it was much wider than that. Is it not?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultAs 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand it, it is to deal with 
defaultthe 
defaultsituation that 
defaultI 
defaulthave to
default—
default 
defaultQ312 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo if you lose in 
defaultthe 
defaultcourts, you have a power?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultNo, it is not if 
defaultI 
defaultlose in 
defaultthe 
defaultcourts. It is because we believed that 
defaultI 
defaultwas entitled to do that in 
defaultthe 
defaultcase of Lewisham
default; 
defaultthe 
defaultHigh Court disagreed
default,
default 
defaultso
default we have to respect 
defaultthe 
defaultcourt
default judgment.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultYes, you do.
default 
defaultMr Huntdefault: B
defaultut we want to change 
defaultthe 
defaultlaw now to make it clear that
default—
default 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultNot to respect 
defaultthe 
defaultcourt judgment.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultNo. The
default&#xa0;
defaultcourt was interpreting 
defaultthe 
defaultlaw as it 
defaultstands
default before, but Parliament is always entitled to change 
defaultthe 
defaultlaw, as you well know.
defaultQ313 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut you changed 
defaultthe 
defaultlaw afterwards because you did not like 
defaultthe 
defaultjudgment. You wanted to give yourself wider powers.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultNo, we changed 
defaultthe 
defaultlaw afterwards because we believed that we were entitled to do something under 
defaultthe 
defaultprevious law that 
defaultthe 
defaultcourt disagreed with and we think it is incredibly important for patient safety reasons. 
defaultI 
defaultam happy to write to you with chapter and verse as to how we intend clause 118 to be applied. 
defaultQ314 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat would be great
default,
default 
defaultbecause
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultunderstanding is that it is not just failing trusts
default,
default but 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can take over anything
default t
defaulthat you want to
default. Clarification would be really helpful. 
defaultCan 
defaultI 
defaultgo 
defaultback
default to a question 
defaultthat 
defaultI 
defaultasked you in 
defaultthe 
defaultChamber—
defaultand 
defaultthe 
defaultChair has been very kind and i
defaults allowing me to ask this again?
default 
defaultI 
defaultdid not quite get an answer from 
defaultyou, apart from a political one.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI 
defaultam kind—
defaultor just recognising reality.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultKind, 
defaultI 
defaulthope
default, Chair. 
defaultThe question is on 
defaultthe 
defaultunderspend
default. There is some 
defaultunderspend
default from 
defaultthe 
defaultprevious year, £2 billion
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultyear before that
default,
default and £600 million this year. You know that 
defaultthe 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultEmergency Medicine
default—
default 
defaultMr Huntdefault: £600 million this year?
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYes. If you dispute 
defaultthe 
defaultfigures, please write to us; that would be great.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: We do not h
defaultave 
defaultthe 
defaultunder
defaultspend
default for this year until we reach 
defaultthe 
defaultend
default of the
default year.
defaultQ315 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Up until 
defaultthe 
defaultend, but 
defaultit is 
default£600 million so far. If you dispute any of these figures, please write to us and let us know what 
defaultthe 
defaultunderspend
default is
default. Why did it go back to 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury? Why 
defaultdid it 
defaultnot 
defaultgo 
defaultto front
default&#x2011;
defaultline 
defaultservices
default? T
defaulthe 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultEmergency Medicine
default are desperate for doctors
default. 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThere are two reasons. It is 
defaultthe 
defaultpractice of all Governmen
defaultts, including 
defaultthe 
defaultlast Labour G
defaultovernment, that they return 
defaultunderspends
default to 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultunderspend
default that we have been returning to 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS is broadly similar to 
defaultthe 
defaultlevels of 
defaultunderspend
default that were returned to 
defaultthe 
defaultTreasury under 
defaultthe 
defaultprevious Government. So this is Government accounting practice. The
default&#xa0;
defaultpoint 
defaultI 
defaultwould make
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultthink it is really important to understand
default—
defaultis that under Government accounting rules 
defaultthe 
defaultunderspend
default, if it is going to be used for something else, has to be spent within 
defaultthe 
defaultsame financial year
default.
default 
defaultS
defaulto it is not always 
defaultthe 
defaultpanacea that it seems
default,
default because if you have a multi
default&#x2011;
defaultbillion
default pound 
defaultunderspend
default you would only be able to give it to somewhere that could actually use that money in that very year, 
defaultin
default a matter of a couple of months. 
defaultT
defaulthat is why, in practice, it is much more difficult to use 
defaultthe 
defaultunderspend
default in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that you are suggesting.
defaultQ316 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultHowever, you have had Francis saying we need 
defaultmore nurses, and 
defaultthe 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultEmergency Medicine
default saying for 
defaultthe 
defaultlast 
defaultthree
default years there was a 50% non
default&#x2011;
defaultfill
default of emergency doctors and consultants
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultou said to me in a previous session that it was Stalinist to plan
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultam saying to you 
defaultthat 
defaultyou had this information t
defaultwo years ago, you had 
defaultthe 
defaultmoney and
default you could even use it for a pay rise, which you are desperate to give to 
defaultthe 
defaultstaff of 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS. Why do you not use that money for that purpose?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultFor 
defaultthe 
defaultreason that 
defaultthe 
defaultfinance director just explained. This is money that has been committed to NHS budgets in many 
defaultdifferent 
defaultparts of 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS 
defaultand
default we did not know 
defaultthat 
defaultwe were going to 
defaultunderspend
default until it came to 
defaultthe 
defaultend of 
defaultthe 
defaultyear. S
defaulto it is not possible to plan in advance to spend an 
defaultunderspend
default,
default except with very small margins.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have done that, for example, this year with 
default£
default150 million of 
defaultthe 
default£400 million that is going to help support hospitals deal with winter A and E pressures and we used some 
defaultunderspend
default money for that last year. 
defaultI
defaultt is possible to do that where you are very certain that you are going to 
defaultunderspend
default by a certain amount, but it is not possible to plan at 
defaultthe 
defaultstart of 
defaultthe 
defaultyear to fund things like pay rises from 
defaultunderspend
default because you do not know. This money does not sit in 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health. It gets distributed out to CCGs and they distribute it out to trusts
default,
default and so it is sitting in many different parts of 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem.
defaultQ317 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultNow you will know because you are going to be monitoring what 
defaultthe 
defaultCCGs do. Secretary of State, you went to 
defaultChina
default. Did you go on a personal basis or on behalf of 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment of Health? 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwent as a Government representative. 
defaultQ318 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave a quick question rel
defaultated to what we were discussing and it is
default about patient choice. It has often been said that patient choice is at 
defaultthe 
defaultheart of 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth service now—
defaulta complete change in thinking. Going back to clinical commissioning groups and what Sir David was saying just now, do you have a mechanism for how clinical commissioning groups are taking note of 
defaultthe 
defaultchanges in patient requests—
defaulthow patient choice is actually working on 
defaultthe 
defaultg
defaultround? We had your
default&#xa0;
defaultMinister of S
defaulttate recently in front of 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee and 
defaultI 
defaultasked him whether patient choice had priority over doctor choice
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultanswer was that patient choice came first. 
defaultI
defaultf this 
defaultis actually happening, are we 
defaultrecording them
default now? I
defaultn this new paradigm
default 
defaultare we trying to draw any information, i
defaultf there is any new information—and maybe there is not—
defaultfrom 
defaultthe 
defaultclinical 
defaultcommissioning 
defaultgroups on how patients are exercising patient choice? If they have patient choice, presumably they are doing something with it.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultPatient choice is a right under 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS constitution, so nothing should change with respect to 
defaultthe 
defaultnew powers being given to clinical commissioning groups
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultn terms of choice of provider
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultchoices that patients had before still exist
default,
default and indeed we want to extend them where we can. The
default&#xa0;
defaultchallenge is to make a reality of that ability to choose. 
defaultS
defaultometimes people want to change their GP, for example, but they find 
defaultthe 
defaultGP they want to get to is not accepting new patients and so their effective choice is not as great as it might be. 
defaultS
defaultometimes
default,
default people do not know about their ability to choose
default as well
default. 
defaultT
defaulthere is much work to do
default,
default but it is one of 
defaultthe 
defaultmechanisms we have for promoting a patient
default&#x2011;
defaultcentred
default NHS.
defaultQ319 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave one follow
default&#x2011;
defaultup on this. With personal budgets, 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand that there has been a great success in that patients and carers are finding it easier to manage their lives and their budgets
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaulttreatments 
defaultthe 
defaultpatients choose are 
defaultvery successful.
default 
defaultI 
defaultsee Mr Rouse nodding his head, which is a very encouraging start. Surely
default,
default if this is 
defaultthe 
defaultparadigm with 
defaultthe 
defaultsmall budget for personal budgets, then this is something we need to roll out a little further. Perhaps we can let Mr Rouse, through you, Chair, respond and then 
defaultI 
defaultwill say no more.
default 
defaultJon Rousedefault: 
defaultWe have made some good progress on personal budgets
default,
default and of course this is something that cuts across both social care and health, and social care were 
defaultthe 
defaultforerunners
default.
default 
defaultAs of this year,
default we are now up at 55% of people with social care packages with personal budgets. We have a target of 70%
default,
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultCare Bill will take that to 100% because it will become an entitlement for those who want it
default. Then, of course, with 
defaultextens
defaultion into continuing health care, 
defaultyou begin to be able to put personal care and personal health budgets together if you have a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm condition so 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have a lot more control of your life and can make your own choices. 
defaultO
defaultbviously
default,
default we 
defaultmust 
defaultnot do it in a way that undermines 
defaultthe 
defaultproper operating of 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth system, but
default,
default where there is 
defaultthe 
defaultability to do so, personal health budgets are definitely an expression of control and choice.
defaultQ320 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave a quick question for Mr 
defaultDouglas about 
defaultthe 
defaultunderspend
default—
defaultwhether there is any mechanism at all towards 
defaultthe 
defaultend of 
defaultthe 
defaultyear
default,
default or once it becomes clear what level of 
defaultunderspend
default there is, 
defaultwhereby
default some of that could be used to repay PF
defaultI 
defaultdebt
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultask because it
default seems 
defaultthat PF
defaultI 
defaultpayments are just an ongoing drag on 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole system
default.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThere are two things there. One is
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of State said
default—that 
defaultthe 
defaultunderspend
default is 
defaultthe 
defaultsum of 473 organisations, so trying to pick 
defaultthat 
defaultup organisation by organi
defaultsation and then potentially moving
default it around 
defaultwould be difficult. Then, f
defaultor any trust or foundation trust we allow them to keep 
defaultthe 
defaultcash, so 
defaultI 
defaultcannot just go back and take 
defaultthe 
defaultcash from them. They can keep 
defaultthe 
defaultcash and spend it in future years. It is not
default—
default 
defaultQ321 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultSo th
defaultey can spend it in future years?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThey can spend 
defaultthe 
defaultcash. 
defaultI
defaultt is clear with foundation trus
defaultts that 
defaultthe 
defaultcash goes into their bank accounts as part of their surplus
default. It is there and 
defaultit does not get taken back from them. The
default&#xa0;
defaultissue 
defaultI 
defaultthink we discussed last year is that
default,
default at 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint at which they spend it
default, it
default scores against 
defaultthe 
defaultspending limit of 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment, but it is there for them to spend. 
defaultI 
defaulthave looked at what we could do around PF
defaultI 
defaultdebt and whether there would be opportunities to use some capital 
defaultunderspends
default for that purpose. The
default&#xa0;
defaultdifficulty is that every time we have looked at this
default—
defaultthe 
defaultvalue for money of tryin
defaultg to re
default&#x2011;
defaultopen
default one of those deals—
defaultit does not stack up financially. So 
defaultit
default is not a simple thing
default,
default 
defaultsuch 
defaultas we pay down a bit of debt. 
defaultThey are
default quite complicated financial arrangements 
defaultthat 
defaultwe ha
defaultve in most of th
defaulte
default deals
default. 
defaultI 
defaulthave not yet found a way t
defaulthat we can use money in a value-for-
defaultmoney sense that could buy out some of 
defaultthe 
defaultPFIs. It is something that we will keep looking at because
default,
default if there is an 
defaultunderspend
default on 
defaultthe 
defaultcapital side
default,
default it is something potentially we could do.
defaultChair:default Mr
default Douglas has given us enough evidence to offer an opinion again about 
defaultthe 
defaultabsurdity of end
default&#x2011;
defaultyear
default inflexibility 
defaultas it exists for NHS trusts. 
defaultQ322 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultSecretary of State, you are aware that we have invited you here as part of our inquiry into public expenditure in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS. In 
defaultthe 
defaults
defaultecond of our terms of reference
default that we are looking at is 
defaultthe 
defaulteffectiveness of 
defaultthe 
defaultmechanisms by which resources are distributed geographically in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS. 
defaultI 
defaultam sure you 
defaultcan
default recall from our debate yesterday that some concerns were expressed about NHS England
default’
defaults current remit to review 
defaultthe 
defaultformula by which resources are allocated to clinical commissioning groups. To begin with, Secretary of State, how satisfied are you that 
defaultthe 
defaultmechanisms for deciding on geographical allocations of funding
default—
defaultto CCGs for primary care and specialised services
default—
defaultare both effective and fair in providing sufficient resources on 
defaultthe 
defaultbasis of need?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultfirst point to make is that this is such an important issue
default—
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIt is very important.
defaultMr Huntdefault:
default 
default—
defaultthat 
defaultit is really important that it is
default put beyond party politics. That is why my predecessor decided that that should be a decision that was made at arm
default’
defaults length from serving Secretaries of State
default,
default and that is what we have done. 
defaultIn terms of how good 
defaultthe 
defaultmechanisms are
default—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultwill ask Sir David to comment because it is 
defaultthe 
defaultresponsibility of NHS England
default—
defaultas they have been explained to me, 
defaultI 
defaultam very happy with 
defaultthe 
defaultprinciples that are used. 
defaultT
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultchallenge that we have is that
default,
default where overall 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS budget is not increasing by any significant margin, where you have people who are a long way off what their target allocation would be under any funding formula, it is incredibly difficult to move more closely to that target funding without other people having to lose out
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is 
defaultthe 
defaultreal challenge that we have. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know if Sir David wants to add anything about 
defaultthe 
defaultprinciples.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultYes. This morning NHS England have considered an extensive paper on allocation. It is all in 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic domain. We did it openly and transparently for everyone to see and that document is available for everybody. You can, if you want, go home tonight and watch 
defaultthe 
defaultlive stream
default—
defaultnot live obviously
default but 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole of 
defaultthe 
defaultdebate we had at NHS England.
default 
defaultThis is 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst time in my experience that allocations have been done in such a transparent and open way 
defaultwith
default 
defaultthe 
defaultworkings of how you got there also being set out to 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic in a way they have never been done before. Inevitably, in 
defaultthe 
defaultcircumstances, there is a kind of technocratic argument, a technical argument, around it all
default,
default but there is one of principle as well. 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know whether you want me to go on to 
defaultthe 
defaultprinciple bit yet or
default—
defaultQ323 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave a number of questions. 
defaultI 
defaulthave stayed very quiet because 
defaultI 
defaultthink this is really very important
default,
default bo
defaultth to me and a number of other Committee m
defaultembers
default,
default and it has been a focus of a number of debates, but 
defaultI 
defaultwonder if 
defaultI 
defaultcan pick up a couple of points that both you and 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of State have made
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte are aware on 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee that there has been a written statement produced today
default,
default which is very brief. 
defaultI 
defaultmust say 
defaultthat 
defaultI 
defaultam rather disappointed that it does 
defaultsay—
defaultalthough you hav
defaulte said it is already available—
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultfinal documents will be published by NHS England on 
defaultthe 
defaultwebsite by Friday 20 December
default,
default which is 
defaultthe 
defaultday we go into recess
default;
default so we will not have any opportunity to hold 
defaultthe 
defaultMinisters to account. Is that not right?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: It says that. You have probably picked up that 
defaultthe 
defaultmeeting 
defaultitself took place this morning. T
defaulthere were a number of options available to NHS England about which one it chose
default,
default and my guess is 
defaultthat
default turning that document into something p
defaultristine will take a bit of time. B
defaultut to short
default&#x2011;
defaultcircuit that
default,
default we can circulate that document and it was option 4 that we agreed.
defaultQ324 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultCould
default we have that before Friday?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: Yes;
default you can have it straight away.
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt is on 
defaultthe 
defaultwebsite, as 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand it.
defaultQ325 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultNot in 
defaultits
default final form. 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultkind of online consultation
default—
defaultI 
defaulthave forgotten what it is called
default—
defaultis there, but 
defaultI 
defaultdo not think 
defaultthe 
defaultfinal version is there
default,
default and, according to 
defaultthe 
defaultwritten statement, it is not available 
defaultuntil
default Friday. But 
defaultI 
defaultwant to ask you a couple of questions just on this subject. 
defaultI 
defaulthave been lobbied heavily, as have other Members of Parliament, by our clinical commissioning groups, 
defaultthe 
defaultBMA, local government and 
defaultthe 
defaultdirectors of public health
default,
default who are all very concerned about 
defaultthe 
defaultpossible consequences for particularly more deprived and poorer areas of any change in 
defaultthe 
defaultfunding formula where there is a greater emphasis placed on areas that have more ag
defaulte
defaulting populations
default,
default which presumably, by definition, must have better health outcomes because people live longer. 
defaultI 
defaultwant 
defaultto seek 
defaultsome clarification on where we go and on what evidence NHS England have come to their conclusions
default,
default because 
defaultI 
defaultam rather concerned, having had discussions with people who know about these things, in terms of populations, 
defaultas to 
defaultwhether there has been any assessment of 
defaultthe 
defaultnumbers of disabled people in populations
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is relevant
default, for example, in my area because 
defaultit was a coal
default&#x2011;
defaultmining
default area
default,
default with shipbuilding and steel on 
defaultthe 
defaultdoorstep
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultphysical manifestation of that in later life is that many people su
defaultffer from pneumoconiosis, COPD and 
defaultforms of 
defaultmesothelioma
default, and that must have an impact 
defaulton 
defaultthe 
defaultcall on health resources, although,
default 
defaultp
defaulterversely
default,
default if it is going to be on age
default,
default those people die prematurely so that would not be reflected in 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation. 
defaultT
defaulthat is a huge concern and 
defaultI 
defaulthope, when NHS England are considering 
defaultthe 
defaultformula, there is a proper equalities impact study, or whatever it is called, to weight that
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulthat 
defaultare 
defaultthe 
defaultimplications 
defaultof using 
defaultthe 
defaultONS population 
defaultdata rather than GP list sizes? 
defaultI 
defaultwant
default to ask 
defaultthe 
defaultSe
defaultcretary of State
default because you very niftily said, 
default“
defaultSir David Nicholson, this is one of 
defaultthe 
defaultareas of responsibility that is devolved to you.
default”
default Whatever it says in 
defaultthe 
defaultActs, 
defaultI 
defaultcan 
defaultas
defaultsure you that people in my area hold me to account for resource allocations and 
defaultI 
defaultintend to hold you to account for them as well. 
defaultD
defaulto you share my concern that it is your responsibility to ensure that CCGs have 
defaultthe 
defaultnecessary resources to be able to provide funding to provide 
defaultthe 
defaulttreatment that people require?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcompletely agree with that and 
defaultI 
defaultwant to stress that 
defaultI 
defaultam completely accountable for 
defaultthe 
defaultdecisions that NHS England ma
defaultke. 
defaultI 
defaulthave subcontracted that decision, 
defaultor 
defaultthe 
defaultAct
default—
defaultI 
defaultshould say more accurately—subcontracts that 
defaultdecision to them because we think it is better if it is decided at arm
default’
defaults length from Ministers
default,
default but 
defaultI 
defaultam completely accountable for 
defaultthe 
defaultdecision to 
defaultmake
default that decision at arm
default’
defaults length and
default,
default indeed
default,
default for whatever it is that they actually decide. As 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand it
default—
defaultSir David will correct me if 
defaultI 
defaultam wrong
default—
defaultthe 
defaultdecision that NHS England took this morning, option 4, does include a weighting for social deprivation so that it does take account of some of 
defaultthe 
defaultfactors that you have talked about. 
defaultQ326 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultThere was already weighting there for social deprivation. Is there any change in it?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultAs 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand it, no, but 
defaultI 
defaultwill allow Sir David to come in
default. 
defaultI 
defaultcould just add that 
defaultI 
defaultthink it is also a matter of social justice
default. 
defaultI 
defaultagree with you 
defaultthat in 
defaultthe 
defaultend 
defaultit is 
defaultabout need
default,
default and that means that we do need to respect 
defaultthe 
defaultneeds of older people because they have greater health needs than younger people and it is important that we have a formula that adequately reflects their needs
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is also important that it is a formula that reflects 
defaultthe 
defaultneeds of people who live in pockets of deprivation and not just people who live in areas where deprivation is more widespread
default,
default because people who live in pockets of deprivation also have 
defaultthe 
defaultkind of needs that you talked about.
defaultQ327 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave 
defaultone more supplementary. Just before 
defaultthe 
defaultmeeting started, my colleague Andrew George and 
defaultI 
defaultwere having an argument about CCGs
default—
defaultor a discussion
default—
defaultabout allocations about 
defaultthe 
defaultareas 
defaultthat
default were furthest away from target
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultcan remember being part of 
defaultthe 
defaultlobbying effort. This is when we had relatively small PCTs and we h
defaultad one for Easington lobbying 
defaultJohn Reid
default,
default who was 
defaultthe 
defaultHealth Minister at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime
default,
default because Easington was 
defaultthe 
defaultfurthest away in 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry. 
defaultI 
defaultd
defaulto not know whether that is lost or has
default b
defaulteen subsumed into a larger PCT and
default then 
defaulta 
defaultCCG, but
default,
default 
defaultas to 
defaultthe 
defaultability to target pockets of deprivation, 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know whether you have thought about how that might be achieved. 
defaultI 
defaultknow in local government we use super output areas to tackle particular pockets, but it might be something that needs some further work.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultthink we have put that in.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam not quite sure at what level to deal with this
default,
default but 
defaultas to 
defaultthe 
defaultissues that we are faced with
default,
default 
defaultlet us
default think about 12 months ago, when we originally looked at this as NHS England for 
defaultthe 
defaultallocations for this financial year and we were faced with 
defaultthe 
defaultwork that ACRA had been asked to do by 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment, which essentially said that older people w
defaultere 
defaultthe 
defaultbig driver in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that you should allocate resources
default. T
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultissue for us, when we looked at that as an issue to change 
defaultthe 
defaultformula, was that we did not think it necessarily dealt with 
defaultthe 
defaultissue that you describe, which is unmet need, because very often most of 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation form in 
defaultthe 
defaultpast was dr
defaultiven by utilisation of resource.
default 
defaultI
defaultf you use a lot of resource you tend to get 
defaultit, 
defaultbut how do you deal with unmet need? 
defaultT
defaulthis whole issue about deprivation and unmet need was an important thing
default,
default and we have
default been working with 
defaultACRA over 
defaultthe 
defaultlast 12 months to get that in 
defaultthe 
defaultright kind of place. 
defaultA
defaults far as 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation to CCGs is concerned
default,
default we have put a 10% weighting on deprivation for CCGs and a 15% weighting for primary care
default,
default because we think that primary care is a much more targeted way of delivering more equal services for patients. 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultsecond area was how you measure that deprivation
default,
default and we are using 
defaultthe 
defaultstandard
defaultised mortality ratio for under-
default75s
default.
default The
default&#xa0;
defaultexperts tell us that that is 
defaultthe 
defaultbest way because it captures 
defaultthe 
default“early die-
defaulters
default”
default, if you like, that you have described there and does give you a better case for it. It also has 
defaultthe 
defaultbenefit of being able to pinpoint relatively small populations
default.
default 
defaultThe example in 
defaultthe 
defaultpaper for o
defaultne of 
defaultthe 
defaultissues we were tackling is 
defaultIpswich
default. Ipswich in 
defaultSuffolk
default, if 
defaultyou look at 
defaultthe 
defaulttotality of 
defaultthe 
defaultpopulation, does relatively well in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaulthealth of its population and 
defaulthas 
defaulta relatively low growth rate in terms of its allocation. But there are particular points in 
defaultIpswich
default, particular localities
default,
default which are among 
defaultthe 
defaultmost deprived in 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry. By using 
defaultthe 
defaultSMR &lt;
default75
default,
default you can pinpoint very small localities in your allocation process and so identify them and give 
defaultthe 
defaultbenefit to 
defaultthe 
defaultC
defaultCGs for that. So that is one thing. 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultsecond thing was population
default. T
defaulthere has been significant population shift over 
defaultthe 
defaultlast few years that we thought had to be taken account of in what we did
default,
default and that is what we have done in 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation process.
defaultQ328 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultThey are very full answers, but 
defaultI 
defaultthink they generate 
defaultsome more thoughts and questions. C
defaultan you 
defaulttell
default us where we are going in terms of option 4? What does that mean for 
defaultthe 
defaultnext few years?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: With 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation arrangements that we have put into place, first
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultmost deprived populations get 
defaultthe 
defaultmost money. That is 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst and most obvious thing. 
defaultI
defaultf you are 
defaultthinking about somewhere like 
defaultKnow
defaults
defaultley
default at 
defaultthe 
defaultone end
default,
default 
defaultit 
defaultwill get, 
defaultI 
defaultthink, £1,500 per head
default,
default and Oxford CCG at 
defaultthe 
defaultother end 
defaultwill get
default £850. 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultmoney goes, on a per-
defaulthead basis, to 
defaultthe 
defaultmost deprived population. That is 
defaultthe 
defaultfirst thing. 
defaultS
defaultecond
defaultly, 
defaultthere is 
defaulta 
defaultshift around 
defaultthe 
defaultcountry in terms of population
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultou can see that in 
defaultthe 
defaultway 
defaultthe 
defaultpopulation has moved
default,
default and that is recognised in 
defaultthe 
defaultway we have allocated 
defaultthe 
defaultresource. 
defaultT
defaulthird
defaultly,
default 
defaultwe wanted to ensure—
defaultit was one of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings that was put in 
defaultthe 
defaultmandate from 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment—that we kept
default as much stability as we could in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS
default,
default so 
defaultthat 
defaulteveryone is getting flat real terms no matter where they are in 
defaultthe 
defaultsystem. 
defaultE
defaultverybody gets that basic thing. But we have been able to invest about £250 million
default in bringing some of 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople
default furthest away from target closer to target
default,
default and what we are saying to people in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultfive
default&#x2011;
defaultyear strategy is that they should assume that over 
defaultthe 
defaultnext five years we are going to work to bring people closer to target.
defaultQ329 default&#xa0; 
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultAndrew
default says 
defaultCornwall
default is 
defaultthe 
defaultfurthe
defaults
defaultt
default away. What is 
defaultthe 
defaultbiggest percentage increase from areas that are furthest away from target?
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultBelow target
default I did say
default.
defaultGrahame M. Morris:default 
defaultIs he right?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwould not want to comment. 
defaultI think y
defaultou should look at 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole thing. One of 
defaultthe 
defaultthings we tried to do all along is not to go through this process 
defaultand identify
default where everyone is, 
defaultbut 
defaultto focus really hard on 
defaultthe 
defaultarrangements so 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are absolutely fair and transparent in what we do.
defaultQ330 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIt 
defaultwould
default be very easy for 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole Select Committee to get into special pleading to manipulate 
defaultthe 
defaultformula to suit our own areas
default,
default and certainly 
defaultwith 
defaultmy area
default—
defaultit would not be easy because 
defaultthe 
defaultChair would stop us
default—
defaultI 
defaultwould endorse 
defaultthe 
defaultview 
defaultthat
default deprivation, age, and
default,
default 
defaultI 
defaultthink Sarah and 
defaultI 
defaultwould add
default,
default 
defaultrurality
default and 
defaultso on
default need to be there. 
defaultOne element is 
defaultthe 
defaultmarket forces factor. 
defaultI 
defaultwould be interested to hear where that sits
default,
default because that is cause for significant concern in
default those areas where wage levels, 
defaultindeed
default, outside 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS 
defaultare rather lower and
default,
default therefore
default,
default those areas get lower investment in spite of 
defaultthe 
defaultfact that employees are on national pay scales. 
defaultI 
defaultwould be interested in that and you may wish
default to comment on it, but 
defaultI 
defaultwant 
defaultreally to come back to 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint where you arrived at, Sir David, that this 
defaultis 
defaultnot actually resource allocation
default but
default target allocation
default.
default 
defaultThere is
default&#xa0;
defaultfrustration 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultpace of change, as 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand it, over 
defaultthe 
defaultlast d
defaultecade, has been incredibly slow. Y
defaultou can set 
defaultthe 
defaulttargets, but it is almost a pointless exercise
default,
default because those areas that are significantly below target
default remain
default, 
defaultand 
defaultparticula
defaultrly those that are below target
default seem not to move very rapidly towards their target over a period of a decade, let us say
default. O
defaultne of 
defaultthe 
defaultreasons for that is because 
defaultthe 
defaultprevious and 
defaultthe 
defaultpresent 
defaultGovernment
default take 
defaultthe 
defaultview that those who are above their target should not experience 
defaultthe 
defaultshock wave of being moved closer to t
defaultarget by reducing their budget. 
defaultP
defaultroviding you
default continue to take that approach—
defaultwhile you say you think that people will be closer to target within a five
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period, 
defaultI 
defaultam not sure on 
defaultthe 
defaultbasis of 
defaultthe 
defaultevidence 
defaultI 
defaulthave seen that
default you are going to achieve that—
defaulthow realistic 
defaultis 
defaultit that you believe that you are going to achieve these target allocations within a five
default&#x2011;
defaultyear period
default?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultI 
defaultabsolutely understand what you are saying and 
defaultI 
defaulthave seen all those things in operation myself
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultn a sense
default,
default this was 
defaultthe 
defaultdilemma for us because it is said, of course, that 
defaultat 
defaulta time when you have very little growth 
defaultit 
defaultis 
defaultthe 
defaultlast time you should actually start thinking about moving this around. But
default,
default in a sense
default,
default that is why we have taken 12 months over getting this, we think, into 
defaultthe 
defaultright kind of place
default.
default 
defaultP
defaultart of our statutory responsibilities as an organisation is to tackle inequalities. 
defaultI
defaultt is not a statutory respons
defaultibility that we can put aside. 
defaultWe have to do something about it
default,
default and over 
defaultthe 
defaultnext two years
default,
default because of 
defaultthe 
defaultspending review
default,
default we can
default give everyone flat real terms—
defaultwe 
defaultcan 
defaultgive everyone 
defaultthe 
defaultuplift
default—b
defaultut we can invest on making people close
defaultr
default to 
defaultthe 
defaulttarget. How quickly we can do that for 
defaultthe 
defaultthree years 
defaultafter
default that will clearly depend on 
defaultthe 
defaultspending review afterwards. One of 
defaultthe 
defaultoptions we looked at was, in a sense, not giving organisations 
defaultthat
default were above target any increase at all, but we judge that that would be too destabilising for 
defaultthe 
defaultservice as a whole, particularly in those areas. 
defaultI 
defaultshould say, on 
defaultthe 
defaultother side, which is quite interesting, 
defaultthat, 
defaultof 
defaultthe 
default37 CCGs that we are worried about who are showing 
defaultthe 
defaultmost pressure financially at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment, 31 are gainers from these arrangements. 
defaultQ331 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIn those areas that have been 
defaultconsistently well above target—
defaultand most of them 
defaulthave been in 
defaultthe 
defaultsouth-
defaulteast, 
defaultthe 
defaultleafy suburbs and 
defaultthe 
defaultmetropolitan boroughs of London
default—
defaultit seems to me that some of them have b
defaulte
defaulten 10%, 12% or 
defaultan 
defaulteven larger 
defaultper cent 
defaultabove target. Are you saying that they will be brought closer to 
defaulttarget over 
defaultthe 
defaultnext five years? I
defaultn reality, unless 
defaultthe 
defaulttarget changes, that 
defaultclearly 
defaultis not going to happen because you are not going to be reducing 
defaulttheir
default budgets.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: T
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaulttargets have changed because we have changed 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation formula. 
defaultY
defaultou have to look at 
defaultthe 
defaulttotality of all of that.
defaultQ332 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default W
defaulte 
defaulthave
default to 
defaultlook
default at it afresh. But
default,
default even so, let us say it is a new set of CCGs and health economies that are getting a target that is significantly below where their actual settlement is and no doubt
default will continue to be therefore. A
defaultre they going to be brought closer to target over a period of time?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultYes, they are. It is part of our statutory responsibility to make that happen. The
default&#xa0;
defaultfact that we can make it happen at 
defaultthe 
defaultmoment by giving flat real terms to everybody is a benefit, but
default,
default if in 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture we are unable to do that
default,
default we will still have to look at 
defaultthe 
defaultway in which we are going to deal with those as health inequalities.
defaultQ333 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultBut you said that you would not be giving flat real terms settlements to
default—
default 
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: No.
default 
defaultI 
defaultsaid we would give it so that everyone has flat real terms, yes.
defaultQ334 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultI 
defaulthave to say 
defaultI 
defaultam 
defaultrather
default appalled that there are going to be flat real terms and 
defaultI 
defaultwas not clear whether there was going to be any extra weighting for age, but that matters in an area like mine where they 
defaultare 
default31 years ahead of 
defaultthe 
defaultcurve in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultchanges in age structure
default.
default 
defaultB
defaulty 
defaultthe 
defaultend of 2021 they are going to have 4.9% of their population over 85 as opposed to 2.9% nationally. In addition to that, they have pockets of very serious deprivation
default,
default and in other parts of 
defaultthe 
defaultCCG they have 
defaultreal 
defaultissues about 
defaultrurality
default and 
defaultsparsity
default and 
defaultthe 
defaultextra costs that go with that. 
defaultW
defaulthat comfort is there for CCGs like that
default,
default which, if you like, have all of those very challenging issues?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultformula takes account of all of that and you will see that
default,
default in 
defaultthe 
defaulttarget allocations
default,
default that is taken 
defaultinto 
defaultaccount
default. But c
defaultan 
defaultI 
defaultsay that 
defaultI 
defaultdid not mean that everybody got flat rea
defaultl terms and nobody got any more? We have about £250 million now, 
defaultand 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation paper sets out
default how—
defaultI 
defaultwill get it absolutely right—
defaulteither 70 or 71 CCGs can make more rapid progress and get more than fl
defaultat real terms for 
defaultthe 
defaulttwo years 2014
default&#x2011;
default15 and 2015
default&#x2011;
default16. W
defaulthen you look at 
defaultthe 
defaultallocation you will see that in it.

defaultecause 
defaultof

defaults there going to be a change in 
defaultthe 
defaultweighting for age or 
defaultsparsity
default?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: Certainly age
default 
defaultbut 
defaultnot for 
defaultsparsity
default.
defaultQ336 default&#xa0; 
defaultDr Wollaston:default 
defaultIs 
defaultthat
default something you would consider for 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture?
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultYes. When

defaultthe 
defaultCommittee 
defaultyou raised 
defaultthe 
defaultissue with 
defaultPaul 
defaultBaumann,
default and we said we would t
defaultake it back to 
defaultACRA for them to have another look. They have looked at it before and concluded about three years ago that there was not sufficient evidence to support a weighting for that
default.
default 
defaultG
defaultiven that things have moved on
default,
default there is more information about what happens and we can 
defaultnow 
defaultdo this very much more identified small population work, we are going to ask them to look again at 
defaultsparsity
default. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBarbara 
defaultis 
defaultnext and then we are going to move on
default.
default Leicestershire is going to take a self
default&#x2011;
defaultdenying ord
defaulti
defaultnance from 
defaultthe 
defaultChair and Mr 
defaultTredinnick
default, but w
defaulte are not going to have pleadings from every authority.
defaultQ337 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThis is a kind of a pleading
default,
default but, as we were talking about age, it is a plea on behalf of carers. When we were talking 
defaultearlier
default about 
defaultthe 
defaultintegration fund
default,
default you said you would be getting in and examining 
defaultthe 
defaultplans. A real concern 
defaultI 
defaulthave is that 
defaultthe 
defaultcarers
default’
default break
defaults
default funding
default,
default which is in this pooled large amount of money
default,
default might just get swallowed up. 
defaultT
defaulthis is a plea not to do that
default,
default because 
defaultI 
defaultthink some of 
defaultthe 
defaultchanges that have been made in 
defaultthe 
defaultway that we fund care
default,
default and 
defaultit 
defaultcould be in integration
default,
default mean that carers lose out. 
defaultI 
defaulthad a case 
defaultthat
default 
defaultI 
defaulttalked 
defaultabout yesterday of an elderly couple 
defaultwho
default were getting eight weeks
default’
default respite care when it was organised by 
defaultthe 
defaultlocal authority and it gets lost within a personal budget so that
default,
default effectively
default,
default all they have now is three weeks and it is not enough. They are older people looking after an adult son
default,
default and that is quite a hard task that they have taken on
default.
default 
defaultWith t
defaulthis undermining of respite care
default, it
default is a real worry
default, w
defaulthen you start pooling funding
default,
default 
defaultthat 
defaultsomething like that just gets lost. It got 
defaultlost a bit in local authorities—
defaultand 
defaultI 
defaultknow that this Government 
defaultare not very keen on ring
default&#x2011;
defaultfencing
default—
defaultbut
default,
default if you do not do something to tie it to some outcomes or to something
default,
default it will 
defaultjust 
defaultvanish
default,
default and that would be a real concern.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultthink that is a very fair concern and we will certainly take that away. Jon, 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know if you want to add anything to that in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultprocess.
defaultJon Rousedefault: 
defaultThere are two things. One, you have to put this in 
defaultthe 
defaultoverall context of 
defaultthe 
defaultCare Bill as well and new rights for carers that will come in at 
defaultthe 
defaultsame time in April 2015. 
defaultQ338 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut it does not have funding attached to the
default rights.
default 
defaultJon Rousedefault: 
defaultNo, but there is that right to assessment and to access to certain services. Then
default,
default in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultfund itself, we have put a number of things into 
defaultit:
default 
defaultthe 
defaultcarers
default’
default money, 
defaultreablement
default money
default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultDFG
default—
default 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultAdaptations.
defaultJon Rousedefault: 
defaultThat was done for a clear purpose
default,
default which was to send a strong signal
default: if we a
defaultre going to have an integrated approach to care, then it has to embrace 
defaultthe 
defaultneeds of carers. If we are wrapping care around 
defaultthe 
defaultindividual, their 
defaultcarer
default and family, then it has to take those carers
default’
default needs into acc
defaultount; also, in terms of 
defaultthe 
defaultDFG
default,
default you have to look at 
defaultthe 
defaultbroader environmental factors
default,
default and particularly 
defaultthe 
defaultrole of accommodation and housing providers and what happens in that accommodation as well. 
defaultW
defaulthen 
defaultthe 
defaultplans come in
default,
default we are going to be looking for all of those things and how 
defaultthey tie
default in
default 
defaultto 
defaultthe 
defaultcondition we have set around co
default-
defaultordinated care. 
defaultO
defaultf course, Ministers have 
defaultthe 
defaultfinal ability to sign off those plans once N
defaultHS England and local authority
default colleagues have had a chance to review them.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultHence 
defaultthe 
defaultplea not to forget 
defaultthe 
defaultcarer role.

defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you. First, thank you very much, everyone concerned, for your replies. My questions are pertinent to public expenditure obviously because o

defaultthe

default,
default it seems like it w

default&#xa0;
defaultNHS Property S
defaultervices had to perform
default,
default and, on a layman
default’
defaults view, it looks like there were some significant teething difficulties 
defaultthat
default people have worked hard to overcome
default. I
defaultt is that set
default&#x2011;
defaultup 
defaultI 
defaultwould like to probe a bit further
default,
default if that is all right. 
defaultI 
defaultwould like to 
defaultthank 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of State for 
defaultthe 
defaultcorrespondence that 
defaultI 
defaultrequested, which 
defaultI 
defaultha
defaultve also requested through FOI. 
defaultI 
defaultwas quite 
defaultdisappointed that 
defaultI 
defaulthad put in Freedom of I
defaultnformation requests for this correspondence and was told it was only available at disproportionate cost
default,
default which 
defaultI 
defaultwas surprised at
default,
default because it was two named pieces of correspondence with named authorship and sender
default. B
defaultut 
defaultI 
defaultwas able to get it quite easily
default,
default thanks to 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of State
default,
default who was very helpful in providing 
defaultit. This is a request—in 
defaultthat 
defaultI 
defaultwas slightly confused as to why 
defaultthe 
defaultFO
defaultI 
defaultshould be so difficult to answer
default,
default but 
defaultthen 
defaultI 
defaultwas able to get 
defaultthe 
defaultcorrespondence through other means
default. P
defaulterhaps you 
defaultwill be
default able to take back to officials that it is not a very intuitive way of answering FOIs in that case
default.
default 
defaultU
defaultnfortunately
default,
default 
defaultthe

default,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultc
defaultorrespondence refers to Peter

default’s
default note of 19 January 2010 attaching further commentary. 
defaultThere are 
defaulttwo things. 
defaultAs the Department
default kindly provided this correspondence, 
defaultwould it be able to 
defaultprovide 
defaultthe 
defaultnote 
defaultof 19 January 2010 from Peter Coates to 
defaultMike Turley of Deloitte so that we can see what that further commentary and 
defaultthe 
defaultcontents of it are? 
defaultS
defaultince you were 
defaultthe 
defaultchief officer at that time, would you be able to enlighten
default us as to what this event was? They referred to “
defaultnormalising relationships
default”
default between Deloitte and 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment
default,
default 
default“
defaultthe 
defaultmatter which we have been dealing with here
default”,
default and 
default“
defaultfurther evidence

default that they require. Could you let us know what that further evidence might be, what 
defaultthe 
defaultrelationships were that were required to be normalised, how they have been disruptive and 
defaultthe 
defaultbackground to 
defaultthe 
defaultletter?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultCould 
defaultI 
defaultsay first of all that none of that is linked to NHS Property Services Limited at

defaultit was found 
defaultthe 
defaultindividual concerned was not appropriate because events were going on surrounding them in some way
default, of course
default that impacts 
defaultthe 
defaultset-
defaultup and 
defaultthe 
defaultwisdom of those to whom they reported a
defaultnd those who authorised his set-
defaultup as a director in terms of him being 
defaultthe 
defaultperson to set up a property company of £5 billion. 
defaultA
defaultlthough it i
defaults not directly to do with Property S
defaultervice
defaults—
defaultI 
defaultdo understand that—
defaultit is very pertinent to it and that is what 
defaultI 
defaultam trying to gain from you.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: Okay;
default we will go straight 
defaultto
default 
defaultthe 
defaultpoint that there was no
defaultthing in any discussions with Deloitte
default or anything that 
defaultI 
defaulthave ever seen that would have me question in any 
defaultway 
defaultthe 
defaultpersonal integrity of 
defaultPeter Coates.
defaultQ341 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultCould you 
defaultgive
default an illustration of
default—
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultissue with Deloitte at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime was concern expressed to us about whether Deloitte were getting work at 
defaultthe 
defaultsame time as other consultancy firms were getting work.
defaultQ342 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default In what 
defaultsense
default—
defaultthat they were getting more or less work?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: No; 
defaulta view about whether they were getting sufficient work r
defaultelative to other organisations. 
defaultThat was something that was fully investigated and there were no issues about that at all.
defaultQ343 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default Why w
defaultas there any reason to suppose they would not be getting as much work? Was there any suggestion or events that led up to Deloitte raising these concerns? Who raised 
defaultthe 
defaultconcern that they were not 
defaultgetting 
defaultenough work?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultConcerns were raised separately in an anonymous letter to us 
defaultand 
defaultthat was fully investigated.
defaultQ344 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThe
default anonymou
defaults letter was sent to you saying,
default 
default“
defaultWe do not think we are getting enough work.
default”
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultIt was sent to 
defaultthe 
defaultPermanent Secretary of 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime.
defaultQ345 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultWho was that?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: It was 
defaultSir Hugh Taylor at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime and that was fully investigated
default at the time
default.
defaultQ346 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default A
defaultn
default anonymous 
defaultletter
default was sent to 
defaultSir Hugh Taylor ra
defaultising concerns that Deloitte were
default not receiving enough work.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ347 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultWould we be able 
defaultto
default access that anonymous letter?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultwould have to check back on that because that was subject then to 
defaultan
default 
defaultinvestigation 
defaultby the 
defaultdepartment. It was concerning individuals
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultwould have to check
default,
default from a legal and HR perspective
default,
default whether it would be appropriate for to us do that.
defaultQ348 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultOf course. 
defaultWas
default it concerning individuals within 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment or individuals within Deloitte?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThat letter was concerning individuals within 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment, yes.
defaultQ349 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default So n
defaulto indi
defaultviduals in Deloitte were named. 
defaultI 
defaultam 
defaultjust 
defaultstruggling to understand. You have 
defaultnot really answered my question—
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultIn their letter, no.
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default —w
defaulthy Peter would want 
default“
defaultfurther commentary
default”
default and 
defaultto
default look into 
defaultthe 
defaultpoints that 
defaultwere
default raised in 
defaultthe 
defaultnote.
default 
defaultWhat were those points that Peter raised in 
defaultthe 
defaultnote?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultPeter had had concerns about 
defaultthe 
defaultwork with Deloitte in relation to a couple of members of Deloitte staff at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime.
defaultQ350 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultWere those concerns ever substantiated?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThey were not issues that were needed to be taken forward because we were having a normal business relationship with Deloitte.
defaultQ351 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultI 
defaultam
default trying to get a narrative here so that 
defaultI 
defaultdo not have to keep on asking you boring questions and 
defaultsubmit 
defaultFOIs
default,
default which 
defaultI 
defaultam sure your officials are very tired of by now. Peter Coates raised concerns ab
defaultout two officials in Deloitte; 
defaultso it is people in Deloitte.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThere were issues about working with some individuals in Deloitte at 
defaultthe 
defaulttime. 
defaultQ352 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultWere those 
defaultissues
default ever substantiated? Was there any evidence of that? What was going on?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcannot remember 
defaultthe 
defaultprecise details that far back on that discussion with Deloitte. 
defaultQ353 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default W
defaultas 
defaultthe 
defaultanonymous note with regard to Deloitte not getting enough work in any way related to Peter Coates 
defaultraising
default concerns about two individuals at Deloitte? Is that an odd coincidence
default?
default 
defaultP
defaulteople might be afraid that, say, work was being diverted from Deloitte because an officer had concerns
default,
default which obviously turned out not to
default be substantiated?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultAs part of this
default,
default we looked at 
defaultthe 
defaultcontracts that had been let for consultancy services, 
defaultthe 
defaultbasis on which they had been let and whether Deloitte appear
defaulted
default to have been treated any differently 
defaultfrom
default any other organisation. There was no evidence of that.
defaultQ354 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultSo Peter Coates
default’s
default concerns were what again?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcannot remember 
defaultthe 
defaultprecise nature of it going back to 2010.
defaultQ355 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultWould they be in 
defaultthe 
defaultnote attaching further commentary, would you imagine, that 
defaultI 
defaultam sure 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment will be able to provide for me?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam not sure whether they are in that note or not.
defaultQ356 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultOkay. You can 
defaultunderstand
default why this is of some concern because 
defaultI 
defaultam afraid your Department provides quite a lot of information informally from people who have been concerned about 
defaultthe 
defaultway things have been conducted. S
defaulto 
defaultI 
defaultfeel it is my job as a Select Committee member to 
defaultask
default these questions and 
defaultI 
defaultwould be most grateful if we were able to get that note of 19 January
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultls
defaulto, it refers to meetings as well. Could 
defaultI 
defaultget
default some assistance with FOIs regarding meetings that went on between key indi
defaultviduals? 
defaultI 
defaulthave to say 
defaultI 
defaultthink, and 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic find, that 
defaultit 
defaultis 
defaultslightly upsetting and difficult to understand when simple requests 
defaultfor
default meeting dates between individuals and minutes of those meetings come back as only ava
defaultilable at disproportionate cost. S
defaulto
default,
default in 
defaultthe 
defaultinterests of my never having to raise issues like this again, 
defaultI would ask 
defaultthat those requests that 
defaultI 
defaultwill be putting in are treate
defaultd as effectively as possible. 
defaultMy second question is regarding 
defaultthe 
defaultre
defaultplacement of 
defaultthe 
defaultchair of NHS Property S
defaultervices. An account was given in correspondence about that chair
default’
defaults departure. What process is in place for appointing a new chairman?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultWe have advertised for a new chairman. There will be an appoint
defaultment panel that I,
default&#xa0;
defaultthe 
defaultPermanent Secretary and one of our non
default&#x2011;
defaultexecutives
default from another arm
default’
defaults length body will sit on. We will then make recommendations to Ministers on that appointment.
defaultQ357 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultHave you any ideas 
defaultabout
default who this might be?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThere are people that we would encourage to apply for it
default,
default and we will look and see what 
defaultthe 
defaultmarket produces as well.
defaultQ358 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default The
default&#xa0;
defaultreason 
defaultI 
defaulthave to ask is this. W
defaulthat cor
defaultrespondence have you had with Mark Boyle from 
defaultthe 
defaultShareholder E
defaultxecutive
default?
default 
defaultI 
defaulthave been led to understand that he has already received e
default&#x2011;
defaultmail correspondence about taking on this position. Could you perhaps enlighten us as to what that correspondence contains?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultWe have encouraged Mark to apply for this.
defaultQ359 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default I
defaultt is still a 
defaulttransparent
default process, but you 
defaulthave 
defaultalready approached someone for 
defaultthe 
defaultjob.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultnormal process is to make sure we have credible candidates for positions that we advertise.
defaultQ360 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultreason 
defaultI 
defaulthave to ask this is 
defaultthat 
defaultagain someone from within 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment is raising concerns about 
defaultthe 
defaultway 
defaultthe 
defaultprocess 
defaulthas been
default managed
default,
default and there is an allegation being made that because of questions 
defaultI 
defaulthave asked
default—
defaultI 
defaultwill be very candid with you
default—
defaultthe 
defaultappointment had already been made and there was a plan to appoint this person slightly more quickly, shall we say, than otherwise. Would you be able to perhaps put our minds at rest and provide us with 
defaultthe 
defaultcorrespondence t
defaulthat has been going on between 
defaultMark Boyle and 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment just to prove that these allegations
default—
defaultUna O’Briendefault: 
defaultCan we 
defaultjust 
defaultknock 
defaultthat
default on 
defaultthe 
defaulthead? We have placed an advertisement. It is absolutely normal practice to encourage people to apply. Do you know how difficult it is to persuade capable people to come forward to take chairmanships of major organisations? It is extremely difficult to get capable people to step forward. It is absolutely right and legitimate that we should contact people and say, 
default“
defaultWe are interested in and encourage you to apply.
default”
default 
defaultI 
defaultam chairing 
defaultthe 
defaultpanel
default,
default and 
defaultI 
defaultcan assure you that 
defaultI 
defaultwill make sure, as will Ri
defaultchard—
defaultand we will app
defaultoint an external non
default&#x2011;
defaultexecutive
default—
defaultthat this process 
defaultwill be
default conducted as we have said it will be.
defaultQ361 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultI 
defaultapologise for 
defaultalways
default seeming like 
defaultthe 
defaultawkward squad at these Committees
default,
default but 
defaultI 
defaulthope you can understand from my perspective a
defaults an MP—
defaultand it is this Committee
default’s role as a scrutiny body—that, 
defaultif 
defaultI 
defaultreceive communications from concerned members of your Department
default,
default 
defaultI 
defaultfeel it would be remiss of me not to raise these in front of 
defaultthe 
defaultCommittee. 
defaultI 
defaultappreciate 
defaultI 
defaultam probably not 
defaultthe 
defaultmost popular person
default at all
default, but 
defaultI 
defaultdo hope you appreciate that it would be remiss of me not to raise these concerns with you and not to give you 
defaultthe 
defaultopportunity to put our minds at rest
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultfter all, 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople we are all of us serving are 
defaultthe 
defaultpublic and, essentially, 
defaultthe 
defaultpatients
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe
default&#xa0;
defaultreason that 
defaultI 
defaultsuppose scrutiny like this should be a welcome thing is so that things like this can be aired in a collaborative and open way. 
defaultI 
defaultwould like a
defaultny correspondence an
defaultd help you can give me with my i
defaultnquiries so that these issu
defaultes can be cleared up—
defaultobviously people are concerned
default,
default otherwise 
defaultI 
defaultwould not be g
defaultetting communications about it—and
default laid to rest
default.
default 
defaultI
defaultn that way everyone is able to get on with their jobs
default,
default 
defaultat
default which 
defaultI 
defaultam sure everyone is working very hard.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultLet me be clear. 
defaultI 
defaultinterviewed Mark for another role. Mark was considered to be someone who was above 
defaultthe 
defaultline for that role. He had a very good track record. He was not in 
defaultthe 
defaultend appointed to 
defaultthe 
defaultrole. 
defaultI 
defaultrecommended Mark then for repl
defaultacement to Property S
defaultervices chair when 
defaultI 
defaultk
defaultnew 
defaultthe 
defaultchair was going. In 
defaultlight of 
defaultthe 
defaultcon
defaultcerns around 
defaultthe 
defaultgovernance of Property S
defaultervices, 
defaultI 
defaultthen decided 
defaultthat 
defaultwe 
defaultreally 
defaultneed
defaulted
default to talk with 
defaultthe 
defaultMinister about having a full competition
default,
default 
defaultfor
default which Mark could apply
default.
default 
defaultB
defaultut he was someone who had been through an interview process that 
defaultI 
defaultsaw and 
defaultI 
defaultthought fitted 
defaultthe 
defaultbill at that time.
defaultQ362 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default About when
default would 
defaultyou
default have recommended him? Can you recall?
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultcannot remember 
defaultthe 
defaultprecise dates
default and 
defaultI 
defaultam trying to think when 
defaultthe 
defaulti
defaultnterview was for 
defaultthe 
defaultother job, but it would have been towards 
defaultthe 
defaultbeginning of autumn, 
defaultI 
defaultwould think
default,
default on this.
defaultQ363 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultYou will be able to reassure us and any concerned people
default—and I am sure you can—
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultprocess in 
defaultappointing
default 
defaultthe 
defaultnext chairman will be 
defaultcompletely transparent and open.
defaultRichard Douglasdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI 
defaultthink that is 
defaultjust 
defaultwhat 
defaultthe 
defaultPermanent Secretary said. 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you very much. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultValerie wants to move on to trust finances
default,
default and we will try to get you away on 
defaultthe 
defaultstr
defaultoke of
default five o
default’
defaultclock.
defaultQ364 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultT
defaulthis is a very 
defaultimportant
default issue. As to t
defaultrusts and foundation trusts, 
defaultI 
defaultthink 
defaultthe 
defaultNational Audit Office have said some of them are in difficulty
default,
default and with 
defaultthe 
defaultwinter crisi
defaults and A and E crisis going on y
defaultou have allocated some funds to them
default—
default£250 million.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt is £400 million to help with winter pressures.
defaultQ365 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default No;
default 
default£
default250 
defaultmillion
default for 
defaultthe 
defaultfoundation trusts and £150 million to 
defaultthe 
defaultCCGs. Is that not right? 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt is 
default£
default400 million to help 
defaultthe 
defaultwhole NHS with winter pressures.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultmechanism through which 
defaultthe 
defaultmoney is distributed is
default slightly different with 
defaultthe 
defaulttwo funds
default,
default but it was about £300 million last y
defaultear and we have increased it to £400 
defaultmillion this year.
defaultQ366 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultsuppose that will help us to get to 
defaultthe 
defaultbottom of it
default.
default 
defaultI 
defaultwas in 
defaultthe 
defaultChamber when you made both those announcements, so £250 million was to 
defaultthe 
defaultfoundation trusts. Can we get that correct or not? Just give us 
defaultthe 
defaultfigure then.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultam trying to do that. £250 million was decided in August and it was to 53 areas, some of which were foundation trusts and some of which were NHS trusts and not foundation trusts.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYes.
defaultMr Huntdefault: S
defaultome 
defaultof it 
defaultw
defaultent to help ambulance services and 
defaultsome to help NHS 111 centres. Basically
default,
default we decided to allocate that money where we thought 
defaultthe 
defaultpressures were going to be greatest for winter and we made that decision in August.
defaultQ367 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCould you tell me what you took 
defaultinto
default account when you made those decisions? Did 
defaultthe 
defaulttrusts or foundation trusts c
defaulto
defaultme to you and say they needed 
defaultthe 
defaultextra money? Were they 
defaultthe 
defaultfailing trusts?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultNo.
default 
defaultI 
defaultasked NHS England, 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS T
defaultrust Development Authority and Monitor to collectively decide where they thought 
defaultthe 
defaultneed was greatest in terms of winter funding pressures
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthey selected 53 health economies where they thought there were particular needs
default,
default and then they negotiated with those health economies as to how 
defaultthe 
defaultfund
defaults
default should be spent.
defaultQ368 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut 
defaultI 
defaultsuppose those were 
defaultareas
default in trouble. What 
defaultI 
defaultam gettin
defaultg is that people in 
defaultthe 
defaultNHS were saying that you we
defaultre kind of rewarding failure, which is why your second tranche came out.
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultIt was a very difficult call
default,
default because what happened with 
defaultthe 
default£300 million last year was that essentially it was distributed evenly, including to a lot of areas that were performing extremely well
default,
default and of course you have to make a call
default.
default 
defaultI decided that it
default would be a better use of taxpayers
default’ money and would
default have more impact for 
defaultthe 
defaultwinter if that money was distributed to 
defaultthe 
defaultareas where we thought 
defaultthe 
defaultbiggest problems existed
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultf course, by definition, those are 
defaultthe 
defaultareas that are less successful. But because we were then able to identify another £150 million of 
defaultunderspend
default, as it happens
default—
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultwas going to ask you where 
defaultthe 
defaultmoney came from.
defaultMr Huntdefault: —
defaultwe were in fact able to give all areas broadly 
defaultthe 
defaultsame as they recei
defaultved. When you tot it up to 
defaultthe 
default£400 million, b
defaultasically all areas got broadly what they got last year
default,
default but areas with particular problems got more.
defaultQ369 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCorrect me if 
defaultI 
defaultam wrong, but 
defaultI 
defaultunderstand that this £150 million was going to 57 CCGs as opposed to 
defaultthe 
defaulttrusts and 
defaultthe 
defaultfoundation trusts, or is that not correct? 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultI 
defaultdo not know if it was 57 CCGs
default,
default but it was essentially designed to go out to 
defaultthe 
defaultpeople who had not received 
defaultthe 
default£250 million but had got some support last year.
defaultQ370 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhen you say 
default“
defaultpeople
default”
default, what do you mean?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultOrganisations.
defaultQ371 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhich 
defaultparticular
default ones? 
defaultMr Huntdefault: All organisations that
default have A and E departments receive some help from 
defaultthe 
default£400 million.
defaultQ372 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCan 
defaultanybody
default help? We had understood that it was going in two di
defaultfferent directions and w
defaulte just wanted to find out why.
defaultSir David Nicholsondefault: 
defaultAt 
defaultthe 
defaultend of 
defaultthe 
defaultday
default,
default £400 million 
defaulthas gone out.
default £300 million of that has essentially gone out on 
defaultthe 
defaultbasis of fair shares in 
defaultthe 
defaultsame way that it would have done and £100 million has been targeted at those areas. That is 
defaultthe 
defaultnet result of what we have done. 
defaultQ373 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Is 
defaultall that money 
defaultunderspend
default money or has it come from different areas?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultNo. The
default&#xa0;
default£150 million of it is.
defaultQ374 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default That is 
defaultunderspend
default, a
defaultnd 
defaultthe 
defaultother lot?
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThat is additional.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultOkay.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI 
defaultthink, on that note, three minutes ahead of schedule, we will say a quick thank you
default— 
defaultMr Huntdefault: 
defaultThank you very much.
defaultChair:default —
defaultand good wishes, on my part, to 
defaultthe 
defaultPrime Minister.
