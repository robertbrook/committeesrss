&#xa0;Written evidence from Andrew McCloy TIC 094)&#xa0;1              Introduction – Andrew McCloy&#xa0;From 2009-13 I was the Business Development Manager for Bakewell &amp; Eyam Community Transport (BECT) in Derbyshire, a post funded through the Rural Social Enterprise Programme. The aim of this DfT-supported project was to help rural Community Transport operators adopt a more enterprise-led approach, win more contracts and generate more income. Since leaving BECT I have undertaken some consultancy work for the Community Transport Association. I am a parish councillor and an elected Parish Member on the Peak District National Park Authority. I also write walking guidebooks and run a website promoting cycling in the Peak District. The following submission is from myself as an individual and not on behalf of any organisation.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2              Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3              Bus transport in rural areas&#xa0;

[[[To what ]]]

[[[extent are the needs of different groups of passengers taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?]]]&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; From my experience of rural Derbyshire and in particular the villages of the Peak District (not the valley arteries connecting the towns), publicly subsidised service buses are routinely running round empty or near empty in the middle of the day. This is even the case at weekends, when visitors and recreational users should be using them. It is a ludicrous situation that points to a fundamental lack of understanding of their customers’ needs in terms of where they actually want to go and when. It also suggests a lack of political will to explore new and imaginative solutions for rural public transport delivery. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The problem is being compounded by the local authority (as elsewhere) cutting back services, in particular those deemed fringe or unprofitable that hit the vulnerable users even harder. In my own village the late evening bus back from Bakewell has been axed so that the teenagers now have to rely on lifts or taxis and have stopped using the bus for even the earlier outward journey. We are in danger of developing a rural generation for whom bus transport is an altogether alien concept!&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Quite apart from provision, the marketing and promotion of rural bus services is often poor or lacklustre, especially towards a younger age group. There is little or no regard for the customer profile and what publicity there is tends to be formulaic and unimaginative. The portrayal of bus transport in rural areas is staid and comes across as the preserve of the elderly or poor, which is wholly wrong.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be ma]]]

[[[de more affordable?]]]&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There has to be an acceptance that delivering bus transport for remote rural communities is not and never will be as cost effective as it is in urban areas, or even clusters of market towns; but that inhabitants of rural communities should not be penalised for this. Indeed, it is arguable that people from deep rural areas are more in need of effective and efficient transport solutions, as transport poverty can lead to real and not just relative social isolation.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; More imaginative approaches to rural bus transport have to be trialled that seek to integrate services and so reduce unit costs (see below); encourage local providers like Community Transport operators to play a more proactive role; and explore new ways of working like demand responsive minibuses instead of old and inflexible 50-seater coaches (see below).&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In my own area (the Derbyshire Peak District) any subsidised bus service deemed visitor-oriented is being cut – but this is an entirely backward-looking step! In a popular National Park visitors should be using buses to get around and reach the remote villages and walks that they are seeking, just as long as they can get to the location, the timetable meets their needs and the service is reliable. And if they were doing this in sufficient numbers the routes wouldn’t need so much subsidy and the services could in turn be more affordable to local people. Local tourism businesses and attractions might then sponsor or advertise on the buses more and thus help drive down costs further. Rural buses must be marketed to all users so that all users benefit.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities?]]]&#xa0;3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the obvious first steps is to understand the rural communities themselves – where people want to go, when, how, etc? Parish Councils and community groups can help with accessibility audits to plot work/shopping/health/leisure transport movements of local residents, so that gaps and opportunities can be identified, pilot service ideas can be worked up and even more creative solutions such as local travel clubs explored. In this way transport should be made a key plank of emerging Neighbourhood Plans so that local communities take more ownership of transport matters and themselves identify possible solutions.&#xa0;3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transport operators, social enterprises, local authorities – whoever! – should work hand in hand with these local representatives to explore new delivery models that connect village to village, village to town, etc, and seek to integrate as many types of journey as possible. For example, a shopping service from a cluster of villages to a town that is also timed to coincide with the health centre’s opening hours; an early morning work/training bus that goes on to do a school run; an evening service from villages to an adult education centre in a nearby town that also visits the local cinema/skate park, etc. The aim is to reduce unit costs, create a single market and optimise the operator’s resources. &#xa0;3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Think bold, think imaginatively! Instead of rigid timetabled services that don’t necessarily correspond with people’s desired journey times and patterns, perhaps a demand responsive approach might work best in some rural locations? Moorlands Connect bus service (run by Ashbourne Community Transport) is one such example, combining shopping services and even school runs for remote villages on the Staffordshire Moorlands with income from visiting walkers and cyclists, since the buses have bike racks attached (www.staffordshire.gov.uk/transport/publictransport/buses/connect/ MoorlandsConnect.aspx).&#xa0;3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The demand responsive transport (DRT) concept can take some understanding, but essentially only sending a vehicle where it’s needed and when makes perfect sense in the rural context where passenger patterns can alter (and if the bus is idle for too long there’s something wrong with its coverage, promotion or pricing). However, DRT can also operate very well on a semi-flexible or semi-timetabled basis, so that the driver can deviate from a set route to collect passengers. It’s ideal for a rural bus route that connects a string of villages and hamlets (with fluctuating passenger numbers) to a town. Although DRT can be expensive to set up, if it’s designed so that it incorporates other services (eg a daily run to a rural primary school, a regular adult social care run, a weekly luncheon club run for elderly villagers, etc) and also marketed to other users like visitors, then it can be cost effective and viable for rural situations. &#xa0;3.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There needs to be more joined-up thinking from transport authorities and operators, so that, for instance, bus routes from remoter rural locations clearly act as feeders to main bus routes and the wider rural bus network is presented more logically and coherently. As an example, see the Interconnect and Call Connect rural bus networks in Lincolnshire that all feed into each other and are presented as such (www.lincsinterconnect.com).&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address]]]

[[[ the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?]]]&#xa0;3.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Community Transport operators (CTOs) have the potential to deliver effective local solutions for rural people, not least because of their social commitment, energy and enthusiasm, local knowledge, as well as capacity and expertise in dealing with elderly and disabled passengers. In fact, there are numerous examples where CTOs are already a lifeline for people with access issues from remote or hard-to-reach rural communities. Furthermore, many CTOs are already and successfully running contracted services for local authorities, NHS trusts, and so on. &#xa0;3.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, too many service commissioners still appear to regard CTOs as amateurish and voluntary, fringe transport for older people on the cheap. Many local authorities in particular need to start embracing Community Transport as part of the solution for delivering rural public transport in deep rural areas and work with them on a more level playing field, rather than turning to the commercial operators first every time. Procurement processes still tend to be geared up towards the big operators and it can be a frustrating and difficult nut for CTOs to crack. It’s hoped that the Public Services (Social Value) Act may gradually begin to change procurement attitudes – but there doesn’t seem to be much evidence of this yet. Perceptions of Community Transport must change if CTOs are to play a more fulfilling role.&#xa0;3.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With some notable exceptions, CTOs themselves are mostly small social enterprises and organisations that are at various stages of relatively early growth. Some will probably choose to stay small and local, but those others that seek to grow need more assistance in terms of business advice and development, so that they can build capacity and resilience, improve their financial know-how and so on. (This is evidenced with the recent sad demise of Little Red Bus and Nene &amp; Ouse Community Transport.)&#xa0;3.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Without losing sight of their social goals, these CTOs also need to be encouraged to think more enterprisingly and so overcome internal cultural barriers as well as physical challenges like cash flow, regulations, contract law, accreditation, etc. There’s a need for training for board members/trustees and not just key staff in terms of strategic development and risk taking, for example. Although most CTOs may be young and relatively small, those that I have come across certainly have the drive and commitment to deliver effective transport solutions for rural communities – they just need the right social enterprise tools and opportunities. &#xa0;3.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In most instances CTOs will simply be part of the rural transport mix and transport authorities and service commissioners must understand this a little better, recognising both the strengths and limitations of Community Transport. While the big commercial operators will no doubt carry on covering the main through routes, busy school runs, etc, CTOs are ideally placed to supply the feeder services, link the remoter and hard to reach villages, not least because of the composition of their fleets (accessible small minibuses) and expert knowledge in terms of both local geography and running demand responsive services. There are already workable examples in some locations, but elsewhere national operators are still paid to trundle empty service buses around villages based on inflexible timetables.&#xa0;3.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite the shortcomings and barriers, where Community Transport is well run – and in particular works with a progressive local authority to address particular issues – it is quite clear that it can deliver lasting results for rural communities. For instance, see bus routes operated by Third Sector Services and CCVS Trading in the Cotswolds, or the Suffolk Links DRT routes run by Coastal Accessible Transport Services (www.suffolkonboard.com/suffolk-links-demand-responsive-transport).&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;1&#xa0;
