&#xa0;Submission to by the Ash Veterinary Surgery&#xa0;I have worked for 30 years as a veterinary practitioner in companion animal practice. I have special interest in “exotic” pets and see occasional primates as pets of my clients. I also see several cases of inappropriate primate pet care, brought to my attention via the investigations of local RSPCA Inspectors. I have been involved, as an expert witness in several cases involving the inappropriate care of primates.&#xa0;I have a deep interest in the management and care of exotic animals as pets and carry out local authority inspections for pet shop facilities for 4 local councils. I am often asked to comment on the appropriate management of primates.&#xa0;It is my opinion that all species of primate are unsuitable for pet management. Even the current unregulated small species of primate, the tamarind and marmoset monkeys have a miserable existence in private hands. I have yet to see a private facility that can cater for the specialist needs of these animals. &#xa0;In all my years of dealing with pet primates I cannot recall a fit and healthy individual.&#xa0;In my opinion the simplest means of controlling the pet trade in small species primates would be to include them under the Dangerous Wild Animal legislation. They would then join their larger cousins. Reasonable arguments for inclusion would be their known high zoonotic risk for infectious disease. This would allow inspection to ensure adequate protection for the animals, owners and visitors were in place. There is also an environmental protection to ensure that escape in warmer parts of the UK did not lead to environmental colonisation. Use of the DWA could be quick and utilizes existing legislative powers.&#xa0;In the longer term, the European and UK interest in developing evidence based positive lists for the various species to be traded as pets will offer a means of controlling primates as pets. There is no available evidence to show that primates make suitable pets.&#xa0;The simple solution to this serious welfare problem lies in the DWA. &#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;
