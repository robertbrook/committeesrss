"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Learndirect (FDC18)&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;learndirect is the largest provider of skills, training and employment services in the UK and has supported \nmore than\n \n4\n million individual customers and over \n75\n,000 employers.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2000 we challenged the norm and took a bold step to deliver learning online. \nlearndirect became established as the foremost UK provider of Adult Basic Skills delivering learning to thousands of people each year through a network of hundreds of centres. \nTen years later we challenged it again by opening a state-of-the-art, unique support centre in Leicester, which has already worked with more than 10,000 learners. \nIn 2012, \nlearndirect merged with JHP Group to become the UK’s largest integrated provider of \nemployability and skills.\n&#xa0;\nWe are the largest provider of Apprenticeships in England\n, a Prime Provider for the Work Programme and a subcontractor to seven other Primes,\n and hold major funding contracts with the Skills Funding Agency, \nEducation Funding Agen\ncy, \nthe Department for Work and Pensions, Skills Development S\ncotland, and the Welsh \nGovernment; as well as commercial contracts with clients including the Ministry of Defence and The Co-operative Group. Our employer clients include thousands of SMEs and l\narge national organisations.  \n&#xa0;\nlearndirect operates across England, Wales and Scotland using flexible delivery models via four main channels: online, work-based, local centres and network partners. By utilising our geographical scale, technological strengths and service portfolio, we provide holis\ntic, end-to-end employment and skills solutions for individuals and employers\n alike\n, benefiting local communities and economies. \n&#xa0;\n“We have helped more than \n4\n million individuals get the skills they need for work and more than \n75\n,000 businesses improve the skills of their workforce.” \n&#xa0;\nWe are Ofsted grade 2 and our consistently high standards of delivery result in above-average achievem\nent rates which exceed targets.\n&#xa0;\nlearndirect \nis grateful for the opportunity to respond to this \ncall for ideas and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss our response in more detail\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCall for evidence&#xa0;Defining geographical areas&#xa0;The views and evidence provided below is based on \nlearndirect’s experience as a national training and employment services provider delivering on a local level to meet the needs of employers, individuals and communities.\n \n Through our contracts with a range of funding bodies at national and local level, we have successf\nully integrated employment and skills provision, improving the experience and outcomes \nfor\n our customers.\n&#xa0;\nThe current local landscape for employment, skills and welfare services is too complex, \nwith a plethora of agencies and organisations involved in the\n planning and delivery of services, often with conflicting priorities.  \n&#xa0;\nThe different sub-regional geographical boundaries which are in existence can also be confusing for all parties involved in the delivery of services\n.  There is often overlap across \nthe \nboundaries \nlisted below \nwhich would benefit from being more aligned with a consistent approach to the commissioning of skills, employment and welfare services\n, for example\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA \nsimplified structure, with a reduced number of different geographic boundaries\n \nis needed.  Contract areas for commissioning purposes should be aligned to existing local boundaries such as Local \nA\nuthorities o\nr\n Local Enterprise\n Partnerships, whether individual or clustered, as appropriate to factors such as population density etc.\n  This would encourage shared objectives and understanding of respective priorities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA local ‘v’ national approach&#xa0;\nlearndirect supports\n localisation which is essential if we are to meet the needs of local economies and local employers.  However, a pur\nely\n local approach can create barriers for large, national employers and service providers which span regional and sub-regional boundaries. \n In \nlearndirect’s experience as a national training and welfare services provider\n,\n \nlarge \nnational organisations prefer to have a single point of contact.\n&#xa0;\nWe recognise the importance of local programmes but only where they add value to the national program\nmes and where provision builds on best practice and lessons learnt, thus focusing valuable resources and funds on activity that will deliver their intended objectives. We would expect local commissioners to have adequate expertise, knowledge and capacity t\no professionally conduct procurement exercises, and would argue for national support/partnerships in this regard.  \n&#xa0;\nAny local commissioning process must be fairly executed.  The commissioning body must be impartial, for example in Scotland a co-commission\ning process has been put in place where Employability Fund applications are scored nationally by Skills Development Scotland and then scored by the Community Planning Partnership.  However some members of this partnership are also provides, eg the Local Au\nthority and Colleges, therefore the scoring process is not truly impartial. \n&#xa0;\nBased on \nlearndirect’s experience working at local level to meet local priorities, we are concerned about the \nvarying\n capacity and expertise \nwithin\n some LEPs and other local agen\ncies/partnerships to manage the commissioning processing\n and supply chain management\n, particularly \nas the \ncommissioning of public s\nervices is resource intensive.  All parties involved in the commissioning process would need to ensure they have \nappropriately skilled, professional staff.\n&#xa0;\nFinally, c\nonsideration should be given to ensuring appropriate parity of access to essential services of a high quality to avoid \ncreat\ning\n a\nn unfair\n ‘postcode’ lottery as seen in the \nhealth service\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFor the ski\nlls and employment sector, w\ne \nsupport\n central commissioning of national programmes but with local input within a commissioning strategy of contestability to deliver value for money, outcomes and, also most importantly, quality of service\n for individuals, e\nmployers and communities.  Every locality has a common set of core needs, eg access to skills and training, careers services and welfare support, but what differs from locality to locality is, for example\n: the level of training required, eg basic \nemployabi\nlity \nskills, vocational skills, or higher level skills; \ntraining \nwhich will meet the priority sectors of the area \netc \n– and these should be determined locally. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Page \n1\n of \n3\n&#xa0;\n"
