"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written Evidence from Gary M. Cavazzi &amp; Dr Steve McVittie (MFOM) on behalf of NeuroPAS Global UK Limited (CMI 002)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;IntroductionWe are the CFO and Medical Director, respectively, of NeuroPAS Global UK Limited. \nWe are submitting evidence because we believe our Company can make a major contribution towards helping the UK Government resolve the Whiplash Epidemic. \nOur evidenced based pain assessment tool enables, for the first time, a change in the diagnostic process in whiplash and other delayed recovery patient cases from one that relies almost solely on subjective clinical opinion to an objective approach that eliminates patient and clinician bias. \nWe believe our medical assessment tool can significantly contribute to reducing ambiguity in the diagnostic process, corroborate valid injury cases and help substantially reduce fraudulent or exaggerated claims. Honest patients will benefit from recognition and proper triage to the best care for them, while others will be identified and dealt with more judiciously.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Weakness in Contemplated Strategy&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFactors Contributing to Diagnostic Imprecision&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsubjective clinical opinion based on a doctor’s training, experience with patients, and his/her understanding of current medical knowledge \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nself-reporting by patients, which even if done honestly, is prone to be \nsubject to bias as the inability of a patient/claimant to clearly describe their pain experience objectively often makes descriptions colourful, subject to misinterpretation, not within the physician's experiential remit, and there can also be\n intentional \nor subconscious \nexaggeration\n.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nuse of current medical assessments such as MRIs, CAT scans and other imaging techniques. These have been shown by \nmultiple\n studies\n to\n \nbring no bearing on the anatomical diagnosis of pain symptoms (confirmed by NICE).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;A Solution to Help Scientifically Resolve Whiplash Cases in the UK &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n-\n the pain syndrome can be fabricated itself, or\n-\n a mild pain syndrome can be consciously amplified.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Utilization of a new diagnostic tool in Small Claims Track, Fast Track and Multi-Track (Complex) Whiplash cases.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;NeuroPAS Global (UK) Limited&#xa0;Gary CavazziCFO/COO&#xa0;Dr Steve McVittie MFOMConsultant Occupational Physician Chief Medical Officer&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Consultation questions:&#xa0;Question 1: Do you agree that, in future, medical reports for whiplash injury claims should be supplied by independent medical panels, using a standard report form, and should be available equally to claimants, insurers, and (for contested claims) the courts?Yes\n&#xa0;Question 2; If not, how would you address the problems listed at paras. 35–39 above?N/A\n&#xa0;Question 3: Which model should be used for the independent medical panels – Accreditation, national call-off contract or some other variant?Accreditation of Independent medical practitioners (only if a scientifically sound objective medical tool is used to augment the diagnostic process, rather than only using subjective opinion). \n&#xa0;Question 4: Do you consider that an element of peer review should be built into every assessment, or only for a sample of assessments for audit purposes?Peer reviews should be used for a sample of assessments, but only if an augmented diagnostic process is used. If not, a second opinion would be needed for 100% of claims.\n&#xa0;Question 6: Should the Small Claims track threshold be increased to £5,000 for RTA related whiplash claims, be increased to £5,000 for all RTA PI claims or not changed?The threshold should be raised to £5,000 for all RTA related to whiplash claims, but with a caveat that random medical checks being made. \n&#xa0;Question 7: Will there be an impact on the RTA Protocol and could this be mitigated?Unknown\n&#xa0;Question 8: What more should the Government consider doing to reduce the cost of exaggerated and/or fraudulent whiplash claims?Use a scientifically sound objective medical tool is to augment the diagnostic process, and stop relying solely on subjective clinical opinion).\nQuestion 9: Do you agree with the accompanying equality screening? If not, please explain why.Yes\nQuestion 10: Can you identify ways in which the procedure under current arrangements impacts on people with protected characteristics? If so please provide evidence of impact.No, except that reactions to a whiplash experience can be influenced by gender, cultural or social factors. \nQuestion 11: Do you consider that the introduction of independent medical panels to assess whiplash injuries will impact on people with protected characteristics? If so, please give details.Not if suitable code of practice is encompassed with the accreditation process.\n&#xa0;Question 12: Do you consider that an increase in the small claims limit for Whiplash/RTA personal injury claims from £1,000 to £5,000 will affect people with protected equality characteristics? If so, please give details.Not if suitable code of practice is encompassed with the accreditation process.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nwww.neuropasglobal.com    Tele: 1-888-472-3188  Email: info@neuropasglobal.com                 VAT Reg No:  944204146 Reg.
