default&#xa0;defaultWhy do 
defaultyou think the number of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen women do choose to con
defaulttinue within science, and apply for positions, they might encounter barriers to their progression 
defaultthrough the biases of interview, promotion or peer review 
defaultpanels. The fact that academics in STEMM subjects are often men means that female academics are ofte
defaultn interviewed by all male panels. There is well documented evidence that people often unconsciously select people who are like themselves 
default–
default which means that departments 
defaultcontinue
default to replicate the white, middle class, male academic workforce
default in their selecti
defaultons
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe social assumptions and norms around gender also have a huge impact. People
default’
defaults understanding of what they
default’
defaultre looking for in a surgeon, an engineer, a mathematician or a chemist are also tied up with people
default’
defaults assumptions around gender 
default–
default the assumed 
defaultidentity of an academic in STEMM tends to be linked to masculinity. This is also similar for leadership roles 
default–
default the skills or abilities that people think they need in a leader or a manager are also connected to a normative masculine identity, and women who
default display these skills are often judged negatively because they are perceived to be presenting stereotypically masculine traits. Conversely, women who don
default’
defaultt display these traits may be viewed as unsuitable for the role.  
defaultThese assumptions can also lead to w
defaultomen being given ‘pastoral’ roles within departments, such as teaching and student support roles. This often means that men have more time to focus on research activities – which are more likely to lead to a promotion. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTypically, statistical and survey data demonstrates that the biggest barriers are enco
defaultunter
defaulted when moving from PhD to post-
defaultdoc
defaulttoral
default positions, and from 
defaultpost-
defaultdoc
defaulttoral
default to permanent lecturer positions.
default The career structure is often not made clear to student.
default In addition
default,
default securing a permanent lecturer job can be difficult for post docs, especia
defaultlly if they have little support from their departments or university in preparing their CVs and interviews. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever it should also be noted that 
defaultvery successful women
default can sometimes act as a disincentive. Women who have succeeded in male dominated fields are often highly motivated and high achie
defaultvers
default, and may also be able to afford high-quality assistance with caring responsibilities and housework
default. This can lead to a negative response 
default–
default when women feel that they can only achieve success in particular fields if they are 
default‘
defaultsuper women
default’
default. 
defaultThe pressure 
defaulton female scientists to act as good role models also adds an extra pressure 
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different
default employment sectors?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default‘A greater presence of women in the world of science and technology is essential for scientific excellence and a
defaultlso for the economic development of the country’.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default‘Attending institutions with m
defaultore female professors strengthens female students' scholarly confidence, motivation to achieve, and grade-point average. Yet the presence of female professors appears to bring a broader range of benefits to male students, including gains in mathematical co
defaultnfidence, scientific orientation, leadership ability, and emotional well-being. An obvious implication of those findings would be for colleges to hire more female faculty members. That could be an opportunity to shape the academic climate, as female facult
defaulty members have been shown to be generally more concerned than male faculty members with students' emotional development, character development, and self-understanding’ 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default‘We benefit in this country from having people from the United States, from Canada….so a mobile academic population is incredibly beneficial,... the benefit is that they provide some cross cultural, cross class, cross ethnicity diversity of cultures.  They
default expand horizon thinking, forms, views, in and across a variety of different subjects, and that’s true in every respect’
default  
default(Expert 2)
default&#xa0;
default‘There’s more creativity.  There’s more debate.  Actually, leading a diverse team isn’t easy because people just don’t go 
defaultwith the 
defaultflow
default; they sort of question which way you’re flowing.  But actually I think they’re more creative because more people come up with different ideas and perhaps conflicting ideas, but everybody learns.  It’s not just the end result is arguably bette
defaultr but everybody learns other people’s ideas and drawing from very, very different experiences.  It’s almost like a win-win
default’ 
default              
default(Expert 3)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default‘We have seen more of the change is more around the cu
defaultlture of the organisation. So I think the culture in terms of 
defaultbeing
default more family friendly, you know, in terms of looking at how they operate in terms of when meetings take place, in terms of how people feel about protection in terms of research time, when p
defaulteople come back from maternity leave.’
