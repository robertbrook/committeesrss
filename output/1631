[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Why do 
[normal]you think the number of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women do choose to con
[normal]tinue within science, and apply for positions, they might encounter barriers to their progression 
[normal]through the biases of interview, promotion or peer review 
[normal]panels. The fact that academics in STEMM subjects are often men means that female academics are ofte
[normal]n interviewed by all male panels. There is well documented evidence that people often unconsciously select people who are like themselves 
[normal]–
[normal] which means that departments 
[normal]continue
[normal] to replicate the white, middle class, male academic workforce
[normal] in their selecti
[normal]ons
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The social assumptions and norms around gender also have a huge impact. People
[normal]’
[normal]s understanding of what they
[normal]’
[normal]re looking for in a surgeon, an engineer, a mathematician or a chemist are also tied up with people
[normal]’
[normal]s assumptions around gender 
[normal]–
[normal] the assumed 
[normal]identity of an academic in STEMM tends to be linked to masculinity. This is also similar for leadership roles 
[normal]–
[normal] the skills or abilities that people think they need in a leader or a manager are also connected to a normative masculine identity, and women who
[normal] display these skills are often judged negatively because they are perceived to be presenting stereotypically masculine traits. Conversely, women who don
[normal]’
[normal]t display these traits may be viewed as unsuitable for the role.  
[normal]These assumptions can also lead to w
[normal]omen being given ‘pastoral’ roles within departments, such as teaching and student support roles. This often means that men have more time to focus on research activities – which are more likely to lead to a promotion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Typically, statistical and survey data demonstrates that the biggest barriers are enco
[normal]unter
[normal]ed when moving from PhD to post-
[normal]doc
[normal]toral
[normal] positions, and from 
[normal]post-
[normal]doc
[normal]toral
[normal] to permanent lecturer positions.
[normal] The career structure is often not made clear to student.
[normal] In addition
[normal],
[normal] securing a permanent lecturer job can be difficult for post docs, especia
[normal]lly if they have little support from their departments or university in preparing their CVs and interviews. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However it should also be noted that 
[normal]very successful women
[normal] can sometimes act as a disincentive. Women who have succeeded in male dominated fields are often highly motivated and high achie
[normal]vers
[normal], and may also be able to afford high-quality assistance with caring responsibilities and housework
[normal]. This can lead to a negative response 
[normal]–
[normal] when women feel that they can only achieve success in particular fields if they are 
[normal]‘
[normal]super women
[normal]’
[normal]. 
[normal]The pressure 
[normal]on female scientists to act as good role models also adds an extra pressure 
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different
[normal] employment sectors?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘A greater presence of women in the world of science and technology is essential for scientific excellence and a
[normal]lso for the economic development of the country’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘Attending institutions with m
[normal]ore female professors strengthens female students' scholarly confidence, motivation to achieve, and grade-point average. Yet the presence of female professors appears to bring a broader range of benefits to male students, including gains in mathematical co
[normal]nfidence, scientific orientation, leadership ability, and emotional well-being. An obvious implication of those findings would be for colleges to hire more female faculty members. That could be an opportunity to shape the academic climate, as female facult
[normal]y members have been shown to be generally more concerned than male faculty members with students' emotional development, character development, and self-understanding’ 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘We benefit in this country from having people from the United States, from Canada….so a mobile academic population is incredibly beneficial,... the benefit is that they provide some cross cultural, cross class, cross ethnicity diversity of cultures.  They
[normal] expand horizon thinking, forms, views, in and across a variety of different subjects, and that’s true in every respect’
[normal]  
[normal](Expert 2)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘There’s more creativity.  There’s more debate.  Actually, leading a diverse team isn’t easy because people just don’t go 
[normal]with the 
[normal]flow
[normal]; they sort of question which way you’re flowing.  But actually I think they’re more creative because more people come up with different ideas and perhaps conflicting ideas, but everybody learns.  It’s not just the end result is arguably bette
[normal]r but everybody learns other people’s ideas and drawing from very, very different experiences.  It’s almost like a win-win
[normal]’ 
[normal]              
[normal](Expert 3)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘We have seen more of the change is more around the cu
[normal]lture of the organisation. So I think the culture in terms of 
[normal]being
[normal] more family friendly, you know, in terms of looking at how they operate in terms of when meetings take place, in terms of how people feel about protection in terms of research time, when p
[normal]eople come back from maternity leave.’
