defaultDdefaultraft Deregulation BilldefaultSupplementary evidence from the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance following oral witness session on 4 Novemberdefault&#xa0;
defaultPDGLA is grateful to the Committee for giving us the opportunity to give oral evidence on the Rights of Way clauses of the Bill on 4 November.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the light of the very limited opportunity for Committee Members to ask us any questions during that session (time 
defaulthaving been monopoliz
defaulted by two members of an unknown group), we would like to take up the offer made by 
defaultthe Chair at the opening of 
defaultoral evidence sessions to provide further written evidence. Our supplementary evidence covers
default 
defaultpoints which we were not able to raise and which we think are important in helping the Committee understand how our proposals are pertinent to the Bill and its deregulatory purpose. It also provides our answers to the specific questions on the rights of way clauses in the Bill to which the Committee alerted us in advance but for which there was no time during the particular oral evidence session of which we were a part.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis additional submission is endorsed by the Green Lanes Protection Group, the Green Lanes Environmental Action Movement and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance.
default&#xa0;
default1default              defaultOur proposals: two birds with one stonedefaultOur
default core proposal will do two things: 
default&#xa0;
defaulta) by giving unsealed unclassified county roads (UUCRs), commonly known as 'green lanes’, the classification of restricted byway (RB), it will make a very large contribution to deregulation because it will take out of out of the burdensome definitive map modification process many thousands of kilometers of rights of way claims which are contributing to the growing backlog and burden of claims which m
defaultust be made before the 2026 cut-
defaultoff date for claiming ways. This proposal meets
default defaultthe objective stressed by 
defaultDefra
default in November 2006, identified by the rights of way Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) and included by the Minister on 4 May 2012 in the Impact Assessment for the Bill. 
defaultb) It will end the damaging use of unsealed rights of way by recreational motor vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth objectives subscribe to Government policy as stated by the Minister in December 2003.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe also wish to see motor vehicle rights removed from unsealed BOATs as well as from UUCRs, at least in the national parks, but we recognize that this would neither add to nor reduce current levels of regulation and is therefore not in itself an inherently deregulatory measure.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs the Bill a suitable mechanism?default2
default              
defaultWe recognize that dealing with motor vehicle use of unsealed ways is not the primary purpose of the Deregulation Bill, but our proposal is nonetheless highly deregulatory and it is fully compatible with the rights of way measures already in the Bill as proposed by the SWG.
default&#xa0;
default3
default              
defaultOne of the members of the committee suggested to us in questioning that an alternative might be for Parliament to enact entirely separate legislation confining motor vehicles to using only sealed roads. We have two comments on this: firstly such legislation would not be deregulatory as it would still be necessary to establish lower rights (for public use on foot, horseback or in horse-drawn vehicles).  The regulatory burden for individuals and for local authorities would remain exactly as it is today and there would be no impact whatsoever on the huge backlog of rights of way claims pending and still to grow between now and 2026.  
default&#xa0;
default4
default              
defaultSecondly, we stress that there is no likelihood during this Parliament of another opportunity for new primary legislation to deal with the now severe problem of motor vehicle use of unsealed ways and the damage to the environment it is causing. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPrecedent for wholesale statutory classificationdefault5
default              
defaultAs
default we mentioned in oral evidence, there is precedent for wholesale classification of a category of ways with undetermined rights. This is the classification of Roads Used as Public Paths (RUPPs) as RBs under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, implemented at the same time as the 2006 NERC Act. We add that the NERC Act did a similar thing by extinguishing unrecorded motor vehicular rights on a very large sector of minor ways.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultScale of the problem UUCRsdefault6
default              
defaultWe
default mentioned in oral evidence that 
defaultDefra
default has estimated that there are 9
default,
default700 kilometres of unsealed ways which will need to be claimed by 2026 if the public’s right to use them is to be established.  Very few of these are genuine ‘lost ways’. The vast majority are the unsealed ways on highway authorit
defaulties’
default List of Streets which fall between the classification of the ordinary tarmac road system (A, B and C roads) and rights of way. These are the UUCRs. They usually appear on the OS map as ‘Other route with Public Access’. They were exempted from the extinguishment of motor vehicle rights under the 2006 NERC Act and under current law there is no means of preventing their use and damage by motor vehicles other than by individual Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) (see 
defaultparagraph 8 
defaultbelow for TROs). This NERC exemption has allowed the use of these ways by motor vehicles to proliferate nationwide. As the law is currently framed, this highly unsatisfactory 
defaultsituation will be perpetuated beyond
default 2026 and prevention of motor vehicle use will not be achievable even where rights do not exist (see GLPG's submission at Reason 5).
default&#xa0;
default7
default              
defaultWe are researching the length and/or number of UUCRs open to use by motor vehicles in the national parks and within each highway authority. We do not yet have a complete picture but in the Peak District National Park there are 235 unsealed ways open to motor vehicle use, 256 kilometers in the North York Moors National Park,
default 94 kilometers in the Lake District National Park, 728

defaultilometers
default in Hants, 460
default kilometers i
defaultn Norfolk, 390
default kilometers 
defaultin 
defaultCumbria
default and 264
default kilometers
default in Northumberland. These are all in addition to existing Byways Open to All Traffic.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditional contribution to deregulation: Traffic Regulation Ordersdefault8
default              
defaultWe explained in our original submission that as well as taking all unsealed ways on the List of Streets out of the lengthy bureaucratic procedure for claiming rights of way, our proposals will remove the need for highway authorities and national parks to put in place Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) to prevent damage of unsealed ways by motor vehicles or keep non-vehicle users safe. We would like to take the opportunity of this additional submission to help the Committee understand the burdensome nature of TROs and also give some examples of the difficulties and costs involved for Authorities trying to use them. 
defaultIn principle it should cost only around £5k for a national park of highway authority to put a TRO in place, but in practice the picture is very different:
default&#xa0;
defaultExamples of the costs and burdens of TROs
defaultGorbeck
default Road, a Byway Open to All Traffic in the Yorkshire Dales: cost the National Park Authority £10,700 in legal and other fees but excluding staff time in a 6 year-long, eventually successful, attempt to impose a TRO on this 4-mile unsealed way which is part of the 
defaultPennine
default Bridleway.
default&#xa0;
defaultChapel Gate Derbyshire: the Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA) has been trying to get a TRO on Chapel Gate for several years. It has taken so far 
defaultlarge amounts of staff time, a High C
defaultourt case and significant legal fees and costs. The TRO is still not in place and PDNPA may well face a furt
defaulther legal challenge from organiz
defaultations representing drivers of 4x4s and motor bikes.
default&#xa0;
defaultPDNP
defaultA is currently spending over £100
defaultk a year on trying to get just five TROs in place and so far has managed to achieve just two. At this rate of progress it would take PDNPA several decades to get TROs in place just on the 36 unsealed routes which are currently causing it most concern.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultEast 
defaultMeon
default Hants and Chute in Wiltshire: TROs were eventually successfully brought in on these two lanes only after lengthy public inquiries. The inquiries were initiated by the highway authorities concerned in order to avoid the risk of expensive legal challenges. The inquiries were run by the Planning Inspectorate and paid for by the highway authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultDerbyshire County Council: has a policy which commits it to using TROs to exclude motor vehicles from unsealed lanes wherever necessary but has told us that in the light of PDNPA’s struggle to get any TROs in place, it has no intention of using them. As there is 
defaultno statutory duty to use a TRO
default, local communities and non-vehicle users have no redress. As GLEAM pointed out in its written evidence to the Committee, this is a nationwide problem.
default&#xa0;
defaultC
defaultosts and legal risks
default: the costs and 
defaultrisks 
default involved
default for any highway authority trying to use a TRO to exclude motor vehicles are proving prohibitive. 
defaultThere is no statutory duty to use a TRO where one is necessary. But there is a statutory duty on highways authorities to keep all highways in a state of good repair. 
defaultThe result is that 
defaultrather than acting to exclude motor vehicles where it is patently necessary to do so, 
defaulthighway authorities  are spending huge amounts of tax payers’ money on repairing, and re-repairing, unsealed ways used by motor vehicles. The cost of repairing a badly damaged UUCR or 
defaultunsurfaced
default BOAT can be up to £75,000 per mile.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultLandownersdefault9
default              
defaultPDGLA  is
default acutely aware of the position of landowners affected by damaging motor vehicle use of UUCRs that cross their land. Under present law, such use cannot be prevented, other than via a TRO.  The classification of UUCRs as restricted byways (RBs) will make motor vehicle use of these ways illegal and will thus be of great 
defaultassistance to the many landowners suffering adverse effects from motor vehicles. For most landowners an RB will be vastly preferable to an unsealed UCR which can be used with impunity by motor vehicles because the precise rights on it are unknown and prosecutions cannot therefore succeed.
default&#xa0;
default10
default              
defaultAny legitimate landowner objections to a particular RB created under our proposals can be resolved by mechanisms already in the Bill or available under other legislation.  For example, we are aware that some unsealed ways have been added to the List of Streets in error. The historic evidence shows them to be footpaths or bridleways, or they do not appear on any old OS maps. Some are not even visible on the ground today.
default&#xa0;
default A landowner would understandably object to such a way automatically becoming an RB. However, situations such as these can be resolved under the provisions already in the Bill. If an unsealed unclassified road is patently a footpath or a bridleway, the surveying authority would be able to designate it, allowing historic and/or user evidence to be used to record it as a footpath or bridleway. They could do so using clause 13 of the Bill as currently drafted.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Green Lanes Protection Group has explained this in Reason 6 of it submission to the committee in support of our proposal. 
default&#xa0;
default11
default              
defaultThe provision already in the Bill (clause 16) which allows authorization of gates on RBs will be of comfort to landowners as this will allow farmers to manage their stock on land crossed by RBs.
default&#xa0;
default12
default              
defaultThe wholesale reclassification of RUPPs to RB under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (see 
defaultpara
default 5 above)
default defaultwas not challenged by landowners and seems to have worked well.  
default&#xa0;
defaultDisabilitydefault13
default              
defaultWe
default would like to point out that use of unsealed ways by motor vehicles puts at particular risk people with visual impairment or limited mobility 
defaultwho want to be able to use their local green lanes in safety. 
defaultEvidence given to Parliament 
defaulton this by the dedicated charity Open Country in 2005 was welcomed.
default&#xa0;
default14
default              
defaultIt is legal to use an RB in or on a
default disability vehicle. Our proposal to classify UUCRs as RBs will not therefore affect the existing rights of people with disabilities to use UUCRs (se
defaulte S185 of the Road Traffic Act 1988).
default&#xa0;
default15
default              
defaultMany people with physical disabilities also use rugged ‘Tramper’ scooters which can go off-road. But di
defaultsability scooters cannot cope with lanes which have been badly rutted and damaged by motor vehicles. On narrow lanes with blind bends and no escape from oncoming motor vehicles, drivers of disability scooters are also exposed to the same risks from motor vehicles as walkers and horse riders. 
default&#xa0;
default16
default              
defaultThe Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance has evidence that charities which get disabled people into the countryside have had activities disrupted by motor vehicles using UUCRs and BOATs. 
default&#xa0;
default17
default              
defaultPublic inquiries into BOAT claims on UUCRs invariably receive evidence from elderly and less mobile local residents who are very upset that they no longer feel safe on their local green lanes and no longer dare use them because of the presence of motor vehicles. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultVehicle trialsdefault18
default              
defaultWe
default have no issue of principle with the use of unsealed unclassified ways by 
defaultexisting historic 
defaultmotor vehicle trials where appropriate. Restricted byway status will 
defaultpermit use of RBs by well managed vehicle trials, provided permission is given by the landowner (Road Traffic act 1988 Section 33). 
default&#xa0;
default19
default              
defaultAt present landowner consent is not required and vehicle trials can use any UUCR regardless of the landowner’s wishes or the degree of damage which might be done by the rally or vehicle trial involved.  
default&#xa0;
default20
default              
defaultMotor vehicle trials are well organized and stewarded. The problem with all other recreational motor vehicle use of unsealed lanes is that it is in effect a motor sport conducted on highways used by pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders where there are no pavements for refuge, no legal controls other than a 60mph speed limit, no enforceable codes of conduct, no stewards, and no safety assessments or standards. This is quite unlike vehicle trials or any other form of motor sport and it puts the public at risk. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ordinary road network default21
default              
defaultSome UUCRs and BOATs are sealed and form part of the ordinary road network. These are unaffected by our proposals. 
defaultUnsealed 
defaultUCRs and BOATs cannot sensibly be described as ‘ordinary roads’.  If they were, they would have been sealed by the highway authorities.
default&#xa0;
default22
default              
defaultThere is a statutory definition in highway law which identifies unsealed UCRs.  An “unsealed way” is defined by reference to 
defaultS22BB(
default1)(b)(ii) Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 as a way whose ‘surface, or most of whose surface, does not consist of concrete, 
defaulttarmacadam
default, coated 
defaultroadstone
default or other prescribed material’.   
default&#xa0;
default23
default              
defaultOur proposals will not interfere with the ordinary sealed road network.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe question of rightsdefault24
default              
defaultThe Committee may wish to know whether a reclassification to RB of all UUCRs would be taking away existing motor vehicle rights. This is not the case.  There are no established legal rights of way on any UUCR, only the 
defaultpossibility
default that a public right of way 
defaultmight
default exist either on foot, on a bicycle and horse, in a horse drawn carriage or in a motor vehicle. The latent rights on any UUCR are unknown.  The reclassification to RB would exclude the 
defaultpossibility
default of motor vehicle rights. It would not remove any existing rights. .  
default&#xa0;
default25
default              
defaultThe position is different for Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), as these do carry motor vehicle rights.  Reclassifying these as RBs would remove these rights.  It would not however offend Human Rights law.  The Green Lanes Protection Group sought Leading Counsel’s advice on this point in relation to 
defaultthe 
defaultextinguishment  of
default  unrecorded vehicle rights under the NERC Act
default. This advice
default was accepted by the Minister.  
default 
defaultPublic supportdefault26
default              
defaultThere is clear public support for putting an end to motor vehicle use of all unsealed rights of way.   87% of people surveyed in an IPM 2004 national opinion poll commissioned by the Ramblers wanted it stopped in national parks. 79% said it is dangerous for non vehicle users and damages the environment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCommittee questions sent to us in advancedefault27
default              
defaultAs
default we did not have an opportunity to answer the questions which the Committee sent to us for information in writing prior to our oral evidence session, we would like to answer them for the Committee here:
default&#xa0;
default29
default              defaultPolicy objectives – do we support the objective of enabling the cut-off date to be met?defaultYes. And we believe that the reclassification of UUCRs to RB will make a huge contribution to the meeting of this objective.
default&#xa0;
default30
default              defaultProcess – to what extent are our views represented by the SWG?defaultNot at all.
default Our views could never have been represented by the SWG as the SWG includes representatives from organizations representing recreational vehicle users and operates by consensus. There is no way the SWG would have been able to produce a recommendation inimical to the interests of groups wishing to drive motor vehicles on unsealed ways.  Our proposals would also have been outside the SWG remit imposed by 
defaultDefra
default.  
default&#xa0;
default31
default              defaultDeregulation – how are burdens shifted or increased? Could the policy objectives have been achieved without some fresh burdens being imposed?defaultWe have not studied the question of burden shifting in relation to the SWG proposals. We are 
defaultvery clear 
defaultthat 
defaultour proposal will make a very significant contribution to deregulation and current rights of way burdens.
default 
defaultIt is 
defaultgenuinely deregulatory whereas the SWG proposals make only a very modest contribution to deregulation.
default&#xa0;
default32
default              defaultAdditional provision – is our argument that the Bill shoulddefault have included our issue?  How ddefaulto we respond to the view that the proposals in the draft Bill are a coherent whole which should not be destabilized by additional provisions?defaultYes, we believe our issue should be included in the Bill as the problem of damage and danger to others from use of green lanes by motor vehicles has been extensively 
defaultrecognized and the Bill is an opportunity to deal with the problem in manner which is highly deregulatory
default.  Including our issue would not in any way destabilize the SWG proposals with which our own are fully compatible. The SWG proposals would remain intact and the provisions under S13 of the Bill as drafted will accommodate any anomalies 
defaultarising from our proposal
default (we have given the example of UUCRs which are patently only footpaths). 
default&#xa0;
default33
default              defaultDo we support the provisions in the Bill?defaultYes, but we think they will make only a marginal difference to the regulatory burden of rights of way claims.
default&#xa0;
default34
default              defaultIs there anything else we would like to have seen included?defaultOther than our own proposals, no.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusiondefault 
default35
default              
defaultNew primary legislation
default is 
defaulturgently 
defaultneeded to deal with the severe problems caused by use of unsealed ways by motor vehicles
default. The 
defaultDeregulation Bill is a rare opportunity for Parliament to deal with the
defaultse problems once and 
defaultfor all. It is an opportunity which should be seized as there is unlikely to be another suitable Bill for many years. Our proposals are signally deregulatory as a package and have widespread public support. We urge the Committee to recommend them.
