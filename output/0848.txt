[[[ Mental Health Services]]]5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Young people are put off accessing services for a variety of reasons, but the chief reason is the stigma associated with mental health. Other reasons include long waiting lists, difficult referral systems, not being taken seriously etc. Young people have reported in numerous consultations that they want holistic services that meet their mental health needs, but also provide access to a range of help and support; and they want the opportunity to take part in activities that are fun and creative, and help them build a range of softer skills such as building friendships. This range of services, especially the opportunity to develop the softer skills is especially important for young people with long-term mental health problems as their illness can significantly impact on their school and personal life. 5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is important that young people have easy access to services that are flexible and tailored to individual needs e.g. not ‘9 to 5’ or ‘wait until Monday’; and they want to be seen in the environment that works best for them – this may be at home, or in the clinic, but it may also be in a coffee shop They want services to use the web, mobiles, text, email to improve communication; and services should outreach into schools and other agencies. 5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Involving young people in decisions about what services should look like and how they should operate will help engage them with their own care and improve the quality of long-term health care.

[[[Home Treatment]]]6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In South Wales, there is the Community Intensive Therapy Team (CITT), which is aimed at young people who need more support than that usually provided in outpatient settings. This service reduced the need to admit young people to inpatient units, and between 2001-2006 there were no referrals to Tier 4 services (inpatient services and other highly specialist provision) outside of the region. http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/31/community-intensive-therapy-team There is also the Fife Intensive Therapy Team, which uses a similar service model, which sees young people in their homes or in a suitable community facility. This service has also been shown to be effective in improving young people’s mental health.6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many young people prefer to access voluntary sector services as they are often on the high street and are less stigmatising. For instance, Youth, Information, Advice and Counselling Services (YIACS) offer a range of different services under one roof. Research has found that the young people accessing these services have very high levels of mental illness (Youth Access, 2012). YIACs have different configurations including counselling services, sexual health, drugs advice etc, but The Zone in Plymouth - http://www.thezoneplymouth.co.uk/ offers a range of services including access to an early intervention psychosis service, and a service for young people with emerging personality disorders. 

[[[Integrated services]]]7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are many reasons why local agencies have difficulties with integrated working. For instance, different agencies often use different terminology and this can hinder integrated working. There needs to be a shared understanding of mental health and wellbeing, and of the range of services that are required, and what the responsibilities are for each agency. 7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Relevant services in a given area need to work in genuine partnership to plan, commission and deliver the full range of mental health services including those for long-term conditions. The different agencies need to have a mandate and incentives to encourage them to work in partnership. There also needs to be good leadership within these agencies to drive forward partnership working. Partnership working relies on trust, and this needs to be nurtured and developed through good working relationships between staff in different agencies. 7.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Health and Wellbeing Boards are in a good position to improve integrated working. In order for these new bodies to achieve this, they must have representation from voluntary sector organisations, the justice system, and education, as well as the members stipulated in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. This will enable a wide range of agencies to come together and feed in to their local joint strategic needs assessment (JSNA) and their joint health and wellbeing strategy.7.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Health and Wellbeing Boards must ensure that their JSNAs take account of the mental health needs of children and young people. This needs analysis data must be reflected in their joint health and wellbeing strategies and ultimately in the local commissioning plans of the clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and the local authority. 

[[[Transitions]]]8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Problems associated with this transition can result in vulnerable young adults being left with no support at a critical point in their lives, when they most need help. In particular, there is particular a lack of continuity of care and service provision for young adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and personality disorders (ref Singh). All of these conditions are long-term conditions, often with negative outcomes. For instance, the consequences of not providing adequate support can result in people not accessing help until they come into contact with the justice system. 

[[[Conclusion]]]9.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many people with mental health problems have multiple morbidities, but we know that most will not receive a holistic service that addresses the full range of their needs. Therefore, long-term care needs to be more holistic to address these people’s needs. 9.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mental health services for young people need to be accessible and they need to have a choice about where they are seen, whether that is at home, a cafe, or other appropriate locations. This is because clinics can be stigmatising and put young people off accessing help when they need it. 9.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transitions between CAMHS and AMHS is a perennial problem, and not addressing this problem can result in young people dropping out of services until their problems become more chronic and enduring.
