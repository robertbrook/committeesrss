"&#xa0;\nAshover Parish Council – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The Deregulation Bill – Rights of Way&#xa0;Ashover\n Parish Council holds its next meeting on 17 September 2013, which will be too late to submit comments, as a corporate body, before the deadline of 16 September 2013.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, as Clerk, and having consulted with the Chairman, I feel it necessary to place on record this Council’s previous action in seeking to prevent BOATs being awarded on lanes within the parish, by attending a Public Enquiry and participating in a subsequent Appeal relating to Ralph Lane at Marsh Green, \nAshover\n.  On appeal this lane was designated a BOAT and is an unsealed lane frequently used by Trail Riders on Motorbikes, causing damage to the environment and the lane.\n&#xa0;\nI list below the current situation relating to claims on rights of way within the parish:-\n&#xa0;\nA total of 12 applications have been submitted to Derbyshire County Council under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to add non-classified highways, bridleways and footpaths to the Definitive Map and Statement as a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT).  \nAshover\n Parish Council has lodged strong objections to each application received for consultation.  Application locations (and decisions made to date by DCC) are shown below:-\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.  Non-classified highway at \nNuttingfield\n Farm, \nLittlemoor\n - BOAT rejected and an Order made and advertised adding it to the definitive map as a bridleway – no objections were received and this route has now been confirmed as a bridleway.\n&#xa0;\n3. Footpath \n146 \nHolestone\n Gate Rd\n to \nOverton Rd\n - BOAT rejected and footpath status to remain.\n&#xa0;\n4. Bridleway 140 Vernon Lane, \nKelstedge\n - BOAT rejected and Bridleway status to remain.\n&#xa0;\n5. Non-classified highway at Marsh Green – An Order adding it to the definitive map as a BOAT has been confirmed.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI trust the above information indicates \nAshover\n Parish Council’s resistance to BOAT claims, and the need for legislation to protect these lanes, together with a right of appeal against any highway authority refusing to use a Traffic Regulation Order.\n&#xa0;\nSara Atkinson\nParish Clerk\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n20 August 2013\n&#xa0;"
