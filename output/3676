[normal]BiblioFox
[normal] Research is a research consultancy established in 2000. We specialise in document-based research and archival research and have recently been 
[normal]investigating the implications of the HS2 business case for existing intercity services on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]In our opinion 
[normal]there is a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the HS2 strategic case.  This concerns pla
[normal]n
[normal]s
[normal] to divert 
[normal]north-south 
[normal]intercity travellers to HS2 
[normal]services
[normal] and remove 
[normal]a high number of 
[normal]‘classic’ 
[normal](
[normal]i.e
[normal] 
[normal]traditional
[normal])
[normal] intercity services from 
[normal]the 
[normal]existing 
[normal]north-south 
[normal]lines
[normal], 
[normal]thus 
[normal]freeing those lines 
[normal]for more commuter, regional and freight services.  We 
[normal]exp
[normal]lain 
[normal]this contradiction below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. On the one hand, the Government says its aim is that “all towns and cities which currently have a direct service to London will retain broadly comparable or better services once HS2 is completed”
[normal] (Strategic C
[normal]ase, 4.2.6).
[normal] 
[normal]On the other, it proposes that long distance services are diverted onto HS2, freeing capacity on the existing network for new services (
[normal]Strateg
[normal]ic C
[normal]ase, Executive Summary, 
[normal]para
[normal] 57). 
[normal] Figure 10 (
[normal]Strategic Case 
[normal]p.24) shows how, with HS2 taking 
[normal]responsibility 
[normal]for 
[normal]most long-distance services, the number of commuter services into Euston can be increased greatly. 
[normal] 
[normal]The same figure shows
[normal], 
[normal]though, 
[normal]that this comes through a 
[normal]massive reduction in classic intercity 
[normal]services
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. While it might be assumed that many passen
[normal]gers travelling between cities 
[normal]such as Manchester, Birmingham and London 
[normal]will be happy to use HS2 services instead of the classic intercity services that 
[normal]HS2
[normal] will replace, 
[normal]HS2 cannot – by its nature – 
[normal]exactly 
[normal]replicate the current north-south intercity 
[normal]timetables on the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Line
[normal]s
[normal].  It will call at far fewer stations than current intercity services. If classi
[normal]c intercity services are reduce
[normal]d in number, the 
[normal]towns and cities 
[normal]not served by HS2 trains, such as Stoke-on-Trent
[normal], Wilmslow and Stockport on the WCML, Leicester on the MML
[normal],
[normal] and Wakefield and Doncaster on the ECML, will 
[normal]almost certainly 
[normal]face 
[normal]reduction
[normal]s
[normal] in 
[normal]direct services to London.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. Despite the Government’s claim that all towns and cities currently with direct serv
[normal]ices to London should receive broadly comparable or better services, and that decisions on future services will be taken nearer the time, its own business case for HS2 
[normal]is predicated on 
[normal]significant 
[normal]savings 
[normal]being made through 
[normal]reductions in 
[normal]intercity services
[normal] on existing lines. 
[normal]These 
[normal]‘
[normal]classic line 
[normal]savings’ 
[normal]are a fundamental part of the business case, yet do not appear to be mentioned in the 
[normal]Strategic Case document.  They may be found instead in 
[normal]The Economic Case for HS2 
[normal](October 2013) at
[normal] 
[normal]http://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%201_Economic%20case_0.pdf
[normal] (Table 9). This reveals that 
[normal]savings of £8.2 billion are being 
[normal]used to 
[normal]offset 
[normal]part of 
[normal]the pr
[normal]edicted cost of operating HS2, thus reducing the ‘headline’ 
[normal]operating cost
[normal].  The 
[normal]actual cost of operating the full HS2 network over the 60 year appraisal period is calculated to be £30,408 million.  Offset against this are savings from reductions in spendi
[normal]ng on the existing 
[normal]lins
[normal] of £8,265 million (savings on staff, electricity, diesel, lease costs, maintenance etc). This gives a headline figure 
[normal]for the cost of operating HS2 
[normal]of £22,143.  It is this latter figure that is used in the 
[normal]HS2 business case benefit-
[normal]cost ratio (
[normal]BCR
[normal])
[normal].  If all these classic savings were not to materialise, the BCR would 
[normal]of course 
[normal]be 
[normal]significantly 
[normal]lower.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. The reductions in classic line intercity services that 
[normal]make up 
[normal]th
[normal]ose 
[normal]£8.2 billion 
[normal]of savings 
[normal]may be found in 
[normal]HS2 Ltd’s report 
[normal]PFM 
[normal]V.4.3 Assumptions report
[normal] 
[normal]http://assets.hs2.org.uk/sites/default/files/inserts/S%26A%2020_PFM%20assumptions%20report.pdf
[normal](section 6.4).  Comparing
[normal] the proposed classic line 
[normal]intercity 
[normal]service patterns with today’s intercity services revea
[normal]ls that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. In conclusion, the Government’s claim that no towns and cities will face worse services to London appears t
[normal]o be in conflict with its incorporation of £8.2 billion of classic line savings into the business case for HS2.  Without the
[normal]se
[normal] savings, the HS2 BCR will fall
[normal] significantly
[normal], but with them, it will be 
[normal]extremely 
[normal]difficult, we believe, to maintain 
[normal]the level
[normal]s
[normal] of service 
[normal]to 
[normal]users of 
[normal]current intercity services
[normal] to London
[normal] that the Government claims is their aim
[normal].
