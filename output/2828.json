In \n2011,\n the last year we had figures available, there were 11,359 applications for judicial review. In the end 144 were successful and \nall the rest of them tied up gove\nrnment \nlawyers,\n local authority lawyers in time, in expense for a huge number of \ncases of\n which virtually none were successful. We’re not saying that there shouldn’t be judicial review, we’re not saying that members of the public and organisations should n\not be able to challenge public bodies, but what we are saying is that we have to raise the bar so that we have fewer cases that have no chance of succeeding.”\n \n [Emphasis added.]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Merits assessments&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVariation in permission grant rates between judges&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLack of precision in the ‘arguability’ test&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLimited access to information &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n          “which falls to be conducted with all the cards face upwards on the table  and \n[where] \nthe vast majority of the cards will start in the \n[public] \nauthority’s hands.\n”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA sustainable risk for providers? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPre-issue ‘settlement’&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPre-permission ‘settlement’ &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPre-permission inter partes costs&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“\nI would accept the argument that , where the parties have settled the claimant’s substantive claims on the basis that he succeeds only in  part there is often much to be said for concluding there is no order for costs….. In some such cases, it may help to \nconsider who would have won if the matter had proceeded to trial …” \n(\npara\n 62)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“No order for co\ns\nts will be the default order when the judge cannot without disproportionate expenditure of judicial time , if at all, fairly and sensibly make an order in favour of either party\n.” (Para 77)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe consequences of risk reduction behaviour by practitioners  &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Will the proposal save money?&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“It may be saving the Legal Services Commission which no longer offers legal aid for this k\nind of litigation  but saving expenditure in one public department in this instance simply increases it in the courts. The expense of three judges of the Court of Appeal dealing with this kind of appeal is enormous. The consequences by way of delay  of oth\ner appeals which \nneed to\n be heard are unquantifiable. The appeal would certainly never have occurred if the litigants had been represented.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Government’s latest response &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27\n September 2013 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n12\n&#xa0;\n \nDynamics of \nJudical\n Review \nLitigation:The\n resolutio\nn of Public Law Challenges befo\nre\n \nthe final hearing: \nBondy\n and \nSunkin\n Public L\na\nw Project 2009\n  Dynamics of Judicial Review Litigation: The resolution of Public Law Challenges before the final \nhearing: \nBondy\n and \nSunkin\n Public Law Project 2009\n&#xa0;\n Administrative Law :Judicial Review and Statutory Appeals (LAW \nCOM.No\n 226 1994)\n \nR v Lancashire County Council ex parte Huddleston\n [\n1986] 2 All ER 941, Sir John Donaldson at 945g.\n&#xa0;\n"
