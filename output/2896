[normal]Written evidence from Freight on Rail (SRN 004)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Freight on Rail thanks the Transport Select Committee for the opportunity to comment on its inquiry into the strategic road network.  We are commenting on 3 of the subject headings.
[normal]A [bold]How [bold]does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes[bold]1. 
[normal]The Government must 
[normal]look at 
[normal]multi-modal 
[normal]solutions along 
[normal]key strategic corridors with significant lorry traffic, in order to meet its economic, environmental and safety g
[normal]oals. 
[normal] Therefore it must 
[normal]consider rail freight options in the route based strategies and in the feasibility studies. Because r
[normal]oad and rail complement each other rail freight has a key role in helping the Government reduce road congestion
[normal] and meet its road
[normal] safety
[normal] and emissions
[normal] targets especially on key arterial freight routes. 
[normal]Rail 
[normal]can offer an alternative integrated solution for the T
[normal]ranspennine route, A303/A30 corridor, the A1 west and north of Newcastle and around Leeds
[normal].
[normal] Multi-modal transport options should be evaluated to  
[normal]address future problems including the five transport hotspots
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2. 
[normal]Rail freight alternatives were assessed to some extent in the A14 corridor study
[normal]. 
[normal]In 2012, the intermodal analysis of the A14 corrido
[normal]r showed that there was considerable suppressed demand for rail out of the Felixstowe port because of the current limitations of the rail network and it highlighted the value of implementing rail capacity upgrades on the A14. These enhancements were subseq
[normal]uently included in the HLOS funding for the CP5 period. The evaluation showed that the extra capacity, would allow daily trains operations in and out of the port each day to increase from 30 to 50 which will increase rail’s market share increasing from 25%
[normal] to around 38%. Furthermore, these upgrades will result in the removal of 40 million long distance lorry miles from the A14 corridor per annum. 
[normal]3. 
[normal]Targeted rail freight upgrades work; rai
[normal]l’s market share out of Southampton port increased from 29-36% withi
[normal]n a year of completion of the gauge upgrade demonstrating the direct benefits of rail enhancements
[normal].
[normal]4. 
[normal]The CEO of HPUK, Clemence Cheung, told 
[normal]the Transport Select Committee hearing on Access to Ports
[normal] 
[normal]earlier in the year
[normal] that improved rail capacity was key
[normal] to Felixstowe port and would improve the competitive position of the port relative to ports such as Rotterdam. He said that less than three per cent of containers from the port were transported via the A14.
[normal]5. [bold]Work with rail freight industry [bold]to achieve [bold]in[bold]tegrated solution [bold]The DfT Roads directorate should work with Network Rail
[normal], the Focs, RFG
[normal] and the Rail Delivery Group to ensure that an integrated approach is adopted
[normal] on key corridors as r
[normal]ail freight links are an important driver of economic regeneration w
[normal]hich can help the Coalition Government meet its transport objective to promote the green sustainable economy with green jobs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]RFG/RFOA commissioned rail freight forecasts which showed that  traffic overall is expected to double in the period between 2010
[normal] and 2030 with consumer traffic growing four fold.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As you will be aware, Network Rail has undertaken a comprehensive Freight market study
[normal] which includes forecasts for growth, due to be released later this year which can be fed into these feasibility studies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Planned [bold]r[bold]ail freight enhancements must be taken into account[bold]It is also crucial that the existing committed enhancements for the rail
[normal] network are taken into consideration when planning the strategic road network. The Government has committed to a series of upgrades in the Control Period 5 which must be taken into account.

[normal]Additionall
[normal]y, the following projects are the main schemes which will benefit freight and passenger services:- 
[normal]ii) Reconstruction of Ely North Junction 
[normal]iii) Leicester area capacity
[normal]iv) Electric Spin – Southampton Port to Basingstoke, Basingstoke – Reading- Oxford –B
[normal]anbury – Leamington Spa – Coventry
[normal]v) Capacity upgrades to the West and East Coast Mainline
[normal]vi) Great Western electrification
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Released capacity on WCML for freight as a result of HS2 [bold]The benefits of using 
[normal] at least three extra freight paths per hour off 
[normal]peak
[normal] on the WCML from released capacity should be taken into account
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]B[bold]. How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network?[bold]1. 
[normal]Shifting more freight to rail reduces road congestion
[normal] and exposure to road collisions 
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]hich c
[normal]rucially 
[normal]improves 
[normal]reliability as recognised by the Government Mode Shift grants system. The following statistics demonstrate the role rail has in alleviating road congestion; an average consumer freight train can remove up to 60 HGVs from our  roads 
[normal]and an aggregates train can remove up to 130 HGVs from our roads. 
[normal]2. [bold]Contradictions in DfT Freight Policy  [bold]However, p
[normal]olicies such as the  
[normal]DfT’s decision to allow trials of 7ft longer lorries, 
[normal]which its own research stated would 
[normal]undermine
[normal] rail freight a
[normal]nd
[normal] encourage more road freight
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]contradicts its stated policy to promote rail freight and reduce road collisions and pollution.  Because longer trailers will 
[normal]result in more external costs, more unreliability and more congestion on the strategic road network.
[normal]The DfT central case for longer trailers was built on the prediction that road operators will increase their share of goods traffic as a result of introducing longer lorries
[normal]. 
[normal]In particular, consumer rail freight
[normal] a key growth market
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]would
[normal],
[normal] using the DfT figures be severely undermined
[normal],
[normal] and forecasted growth would be cut by two thirds.
[normal]DfT research stated - [bold]Lower rail use [bold]was[bold] a major source of benefits in having longer trailers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Between 27% to 32% of the environmental benefits of longer trail
[normal]ers are assumed to be gained by running fewer trains. By 2025 - 84% of the industry operational savings would be from lower rail costs. 
[normal]The assessment is very sensitive to the way that less rail traffic translates into fewer train kilometers and a realisti
[normal]c picture would be of external costs rising significantly. Also, if trains were electrified or became quieter, the benefits of not running them would fall and so would the benefits of longer trailers. 
[normal]Longer trailers would undermine low carbon energy-effi[bold]cient rail[bold], particularly the emerging supermarket (domestic intermodal) rail traffic, the sector with the highest growth potential of up to 12 
[normal]times in a 25 year period 
[normal]. Even the DfT figures states that the 2 metre trailer would reduce rail freight growt
[normal]h by two thirds (down from 732% to 262%) by 2025. This is because the relative costs of road and rail will be adversely affected by the new units, and rail will face a cost disadvantage; savings of up to 15% are predicted by some in the road haulage indust
[normal]ry. However the DfT suggest that this impact would be offset by rail operator being able to use longer intermodal units than at present, increasing their own efficiencies.  However, this assumes that customers will want to invest in such units, ahead of in
[normal]vesting in road fleet and also that the existing equipment, much of which is new, can be written off. All this is likely to result in a downward spiral for rail freight in this sector as critical mass is lost.
[normal]Longer trucks [bold]c[bold]ould mean more lorry miles not fewer [bold]because demand will be stimulated as longer trailers would reduce road haulage costs by up to 13%. Distribution centre are likely to be rationalised, saving on real estate costs, with lorry tonne kilometres increasing a
[normal]s the same freight is carried further.
[normal] 
[normal]The economic assumptions in the report are not realistic as they underestimate the extent to which longer vehicles will add to road mileage. 
[normal]Longer trailers will be slower to negotiate road junctions and add to road [bold]congestion[bold]The actual length of traffic lane occupied and the time that the lane is occupied needs to be fully taken into account. HGVs are considered to take up almost 4 times the space of an average car when stationery (passenger car units). Then one has
[normal] to allow for the fact that HGVs are slower to negotiate junctions and need longer front and rear headway than cars as braking distances are greater.
[normal]C  [bold]What mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors. [bold]A[bold]re there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK.[bold]1. [bold]Distance based lorry road user charging [bold]Freight on Rail 
[normal]supports
[normal] the principal of introducing a lorry road user charging system to ensure ensures fairer arrangements for the UK haulage industry. 
[normal]At present UK hauliers face unfair competition, with foreign hauliers not paying anything towards the costs of their use of U
[normal]K roads. 
[normal]However, we believe that the Government’s chosen time based system charges foreign hauliers too little, because of the EU restrictions, and 
[normal]could end up actually costing more in administration and enforcement than it raises. We believe that t
[normal]he Go
[normal]vernment should instead have gone for a distance-based charging scheme, as most European countries are now doing. This would charge foreign lorries properly for using UK roads, and would raise revenue that could be used to fund a more efficient and greener
[normal] UK freight industry. We therefore urge the Government to consider a comprehensive distance based system which could actually help reduce road congestion, emissions, accidents a
[normal]s well as raising revenue. 
[normal]Disadvantages of the Time based system [bold]being introd[bold]uced next April 2014[bold]Given that foreign hauliers only account for 6% of UK vehicle miles, the administrative burden of this 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]both for UK operators and DfT seems too high and could end up actually costing more in administration and enforcement than it
[normal] raises.
[normal]A simple but effective distance based  lorry road user charging scheme would therefore be fairer to UK hauliers but could also deliver wider objectives to:
[normal]• Improve road safety
[normal]• Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
[normal]• Minimise the external costs from 
[normal]heavy good vehicle traffic, including local air pollution, noise and congestion
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The experience from Europe shows that lorry road user charging schemes can be introduced, that the technology is proven and that this delivers significant benefits, particular
[normal]ly to support the economy and reduce climate change – the two main objectives in the new Government’s transport policies.
[normal] 
[normal]The German Maut system
[normal], developed within the Eurovignette guidelines, 
[normal]reduced empty running by 11% down to under 20%, increased rail f
[normal]reight by 7% and loaded runs by 2.1% in the ten year period up to 2010.
