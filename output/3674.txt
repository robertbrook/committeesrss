[[[ Macpherson]]]&#xa0;The Future is Organic&#xa0;In every known test which has taken place so far, organic food outperforms GM in terms of both yield and nutrition.&#xa0;The GM crop which outperforms its organic equivalent has never been invented. Based on the existing evidence (ie past performance), GM food is much more expensive and vastly inferior to all the alternatives.&#xa0;The only scientific way a product can be judged is on past performance. Past performance is the means by which future performance is estimated. All of the existing evidence tells us that GM will lead to reduced yields and reduced levels of nutrition. Farmers will produce less and what they produce will be less nutritious.&#xa0;The introduction of GM agriculture into the UK will make the UK more dependant on imports. It will also make British exports of food less competitive and will have a negative impact upon the Balance of Payments.&#xa0;To argue that GM will increase yield based only on absurd hope with no supporting evidence is not merely unscientific, it is negligent. Such uninformed attitudes will lead British agriculture towards catastrophe.&#xa0;If agricultural crops which are grown in the UK are patented and owned by foreign multinational corporations when what we have in the UK is food insecurity because we do not have control over own food production. GM or genetically-modified food equals food insecurity; biodiversity gives us food security.Â  &#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013 &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
