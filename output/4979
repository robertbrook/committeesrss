[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Mifalot is proud to share information about ourselves and our successful coexistence programs. Below is general information and we are happy to provide further details upon request. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Mifalot:[bold] Sport for Education, Development, and Peace[bold]Mifalot is the largest and most diverse sport for development and peace organization in the Middle East. To date, over 2
[normal]5
[normal],000 children and youth in Israel, Palestine and Jordan participate in Mifalot's
[normal] programs each year. Founded in 1997 by the owners of Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club and the Kahanoff Foundation, Mifalot's 
[normal]vision[bold] is:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Children and youth in our region graduate from our programs with the life skills and tools to learn, grow, excel and develop their co
[normal]mmunity and world. Mifalot has over 300 projects that use football to accomplish the following 
[normal]program objectives[bold]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mifalot’s local success over the past 16 years is driving our new
[normal] international initiative[bold]. To date, we have assisted communities in implementing and adapting our project models to their local needs in Jordan, Palestine, Nigeria, Liberia, Rwanda, 
[normal]India, 
[normal]Haiti and Cameroon. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mifalot leverages the platform provided by th
[normal]e 
[normal]Hapoel Tel Aviv Football Club[bold] to engage political institutions, the corporate sector, the general public and the international community to ensure that due attention is paid to the most pressing social issues in the region and internationally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Hapoe
[normal]l Tel Aviv Football Club has shifted the public’s perception about 
[normal]the role of a professional club[bold] in helping children and communities. Rather than carrying the image of a 
[normal]marketing ploy or public relations campaign, Mifalot is viewed by its funders, suppo
[normal]rters, and partners as an earnest and effective use of sport to promote social development and peace.

[normal]Mifalot
[normal] operates a number of programs focused on peace and coexistence. The goal of these programs is to bring together 
[normal]different groups within the
[normal] diverse population
[normal]s in Israel and in the region including Jordan and Palestine. With all of these groups 
[normal]football 
[normal]b
[normal]ecomes a tool for bridging
[normal] social, religious and ethnic divides. Football 
[normal]is
[normal] the common ground that all people like and relate to. It helps individuals from opposing groups realize that they are not so different. From there, we use this common ground to ho
[normal]ld a dialogue about differences
[normal], coexistence, conflict mitigation
[normal] and how to understand and accept each other.
[normal]Mifalot's projects include the following:
[normal]-
[normal] 
[normal]Know Your Neighbor/Neighbor's United: Breaking down stereotypes and building trust - both on and off
[normal] the field - between youth from different groups within Israel and between Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians.
[normal]-
[normal] 
[normal]Coaches for Social Change: Educating Palestinian and Israeli young adults together to be football coaches and peace educators and then sendi
[normal]ng them out into their communities to work as coaches with teams of youth.
