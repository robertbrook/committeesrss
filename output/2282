EIS 18
defaultWritten evidence submitted by thedefault defaultConfederation of UK Coal Producers (COALPRO)default&#xa0;
defaultBackgrounddefaultThe C
defaultonfederation of UK Coal Producers (Coalpro)
default represents the 
defaultcoal
default ind
defaultustry within the United Kingdom, our members produce 95% of the 
defaultcoal
default mined in the UK from both deep and surface mines
default. The UK 
defaultCoal 
defaultIndustry
default produced 16.3Mt in 2012 around 90% of which was sold into power stations in the UK.
default 
defaultCoalpro is a member of the CBI M
defaultinerals Group.
defaultThese sales would otherwise be replaced by imported coal as almost 50Mt was consumed by UK power stations in 2012. The industry employed just over 6,000 people to produce this output and although this has declined in 2013 following the closu
defaultre of Maltby Colliery and Daw Mill Colliery and the collapse of two of the companies operating surface mines in Scotland we expect the figure to be well in excess of 4,500 direct employees by the early part of 2014 as some the operations in Scotland re-com
defaultmence production. In addition to the power station market coal is an essential and affordable fuel for households which are off the gas grid (estimated to be 6 million homes) and of course is used by some key industries such as cement and sugar processing.
default 
defaultOne industry which has to use coal is steel-making as the carbon in the coal and the iron ore chemically bond in the blast furnace, in this case there is no alternative fuel and although the majority of the coal used in this process in the UK is imported
default there are some coals which are suitable in parts of the UK, notably North-East England and South Wales. Tata steel have a policy of preferring to purchase these coals when they are available, as they provide secure and local supplies with reduced costs of
default transportation both in fuel and emissions. The suitability depends on the characteristics of each individual coal seam in the mine and the mine must have other markets for the other coal seams it mines (principally power generation).   
defaultExecutive defaultSummarydefaultQuestionsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultCoal mining in the UK contributes both financially and socially on a national and local level. Coal deposits are present in some of the more economically deprived areas of Scotland , Northern England and South Wales and the mines, whether surface or underg
defaultround,  predominantly employ local labour. The cost of regenerating these areas after deep mine closure both in social and economic terms is well known to Government. In addition, local haulage and small engineering businesses depend on the coal mines, bot
defaulth surface and underground, for a large proportion of their turnover. 
defaultA large proportion of rail freight traffic is from the transport of bulk materials, c35% in 2010 of all freight was the haulage of coal to power stations, UK produced coal accounts for a
defaultbout one third of this total. Track access fees for these movements make up a significant portion of Network Rail’s income.

defaultCase Study 
default&#xa0;
default              
default              
defaultKier Minerals Ltd Greenburn Surface Coal Mine
defaultKier Minerals Ltd (part of Kier Group Plc)   currently own and operate
default a surface coal mine in the UK, the Greenburn Surface Mine, near New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Reserves exist to continue until 2022.
defaultAt the end of August 2013
default the
default site has produced 5,492,000 tonnes of coal supplying English power stations by rail and cont
defaultributing to an indigenous solution to UK energy security.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Greenburn operation currently employs 151 hourly paid individuals and additionally 48 sub-contractors are permanently employed giving a total of 199. Of this total 84 live within 10 miles of th
defaulte site and 116 live within a 15 mile radius. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBased on the above employment figures and using Scottish Government published multipliers
default,
default a further 160 
defaultindirect jobsdefault (plant hire
default,

defaulthaulage eq
defaultuipment repair etc) are created
default,

defaultThese figure are in the context of sign
defaultificant unemployment of 10.9% (
defaultApril 2012 to March 2013)
default for East Ayrshire 
defaultwhich rises to 11.9% when considering males only
default, who are typically 
defaultemployed
default in mining
default. The wage bill in the
default last financial year was £5.73 million

default&#xa0;
defaultKier have also contributed £1.54 million (end August 2013) into the local community trust which p
defaultrovides funding to local community projects and will continue to contribute on future production.  
default&#xa0;
defaultKier Group plc has established a Non-Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Centre at Greenburn. To date the Centre has completed 116 vocational qualifications in 
defaultlevel 2 Plant Operations plus 6 supervisors achieving level 3 awards. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther Example
default&#xa0;
defaultUK Coal Production Ltd operates a surface coal mine called Potland Burn near Ashington in Northumberland. The site commenced operations in 2010 and will extract 2.2 mi
defaultllion tonnes of coal over its five year life
default, in 2012 the site employed 96 people of whom 82% live within 15 miles of the site. As part of a signed Legal Agreement the company has contributed £500,000 into a local community fund which is used to promote co
defaultmmunity benefits and amenities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAll the coal from site is transported by rail to English Power Stations and has a much lower Carbon Footprint from both excavation and delivery than imported coal.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe indigenous 
defaultcoal
default industry
default in the UK provides high quality jobs in rural or deprived areas, both directly employed in the mining operations but also in the supply chain and in particular the speci
defaultalist equipment and plant required, and the maintenance and small engineering and repair sector. The coal industry employed over 6,000 people in 2012 and despite the closure of Maltby and Daw Mill Collieries in 2013 and the suspension of operations at the 
defaultmajority of sites in Scotland there are 4,100 employees at the end of August 2013 which we expect to increase to in excess of 4,500 during the next six months as operations in Scotland re-start. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSupply chain jobs dependent on the coal mining sector are a
defaultround 15,000.
default&#xa0;
defaultMining consultants from UK based organisations are busy on coal and other mineral projects worldwide and particularly in India currently. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultConsultancy services from the UK on mining projects are in high demand, and the fact that they are familiar with UK coal underground systems gives the competitive advan
defaulttage that the deep reserves worked here give unique experience, compared with some other coal deposits worldwide.
default&#xa0;
defaultUK manufacturers were involved at the start of the mechanisation programme which changed the face of underground coal production in the 
default1960’s and 1970’s. The continuing development and improvements made to this equipment as reserves became deeper again enhances the design and supply reputation of UK based companies.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the coal sector
default,
default UK operations are all performed by UK based companies and very few have overseas interests. The presence of large mining compan
defaulties in London offices does not encourage them to use UK based suppliers
default,
default and most mining equipment supply is now done by large global corporations
default, notwithstanding that, the engineering design for these products is maintained in the UK but some of the manu
defaultfacturing has moved to China and USA.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultCdefaultoalpro has no relevant information to enable it to make comment on this question.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe the level of engagement with NGOs and communities in the UK is excellent at both a local and national level. Examples of the engagement are set out below:
default&#xa0;
defaultNational Engagement - The UK Minerals Forumdefault.
defaultThe UK Minerals Forum was set 
defaultup 
defaultby the CBI Minerals Group in 2006 
default(of which Coalpro is a member) 
defaultbecause there was 
defaulta perceived n
defaulteed to draw together all key stak
defaulteholders, to debate and inform G
defaultovernment and the public on the prudent use, sustainable management and supply of UK minerals. The UKMF has a broad membership drawn from 
defaultindustry, regulators, NGOs and G
defaultovernment
default who sit as observers
default. It holds regular meetings and convenes working groups 
defaultto research and report on critical issues. We believe the Forum is a good example of best practice in engagement between 
defaultall stakeholders who
default have an interest in the UK based extractive industry
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultForum is submitting its own evidence to the Committee a

default              
defaultLocal EdefaultngagementdefaultEngagement with local communities is enshrined within the land use planning legis
defaultlation and the coal industry 
defaulthas for
default many years worked hard to be part or the local community rather
default than
default apart from it.
default In all cases the surface mined coal sites set up a Community Fund of which the local liaison group and the Parish Council decide the most appropriate use for the co
defaultmmunity adjacent to or affected by the mining operation.
default 
defaultSite specific liaison groups normally include representatives of local residents, local elected officials and locally based NGOs. Further details on the statutory obligation to engage with local comm
defaultunities can be viewed at:

defaulthttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/giving-communities-more-power-in-planning-local-developmentdefault&#xa0;defaultDuring any p
defaultlanning application and during site operations the mining companies work with bodies such as English Nature, English Heritage, RSPB, SEPA and Natural Resources Wales.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter recent changes in both the deep mine and surface mine portfolio in England and Scotland, UK
default listed extractive companies 
defaultwith
default operations in 
defaultthe 
defaultUK 
defaultdo not have coal mining interests outside these shores. The large London listed mining companies have no operations in the UK 
defaultand thus have limited 
defaultincentive to support the
default UK skills base. In its heyday
default,
default the UK underground coal industry was a key driver in
default providing the skills base for the extractive industries
default,
default but with its now virtual demise the number of mining and related
default training
default course
defaults
default has dwindled to very few. 
defaultUndergraduate degrees in Mining Engineering were offered at a number of Universities as re
defaultcently as 20 years ago and graduates found employment worldwide.  
defaultThe l
defaultack of a large
default indigenous industry
default also
default means there is reduced opportunity for students to gain practical experience or interest 
defaultin 
defaultmining operations. 
default The  recruitment of new Managers 
defaultinto the UK coal industry is difficult, and the path that formerly existed of gaining practical experience in the UK and then using those skills worldwide has disappeared. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main mining relate
defaultd courses are now restricted to 
defaultvery few universities, such
default as Camborne School of Mines, part of the Exeter University and course
defaults
default provided by 
defaultD
defaulterby and Northumbria Universities  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSo far as Coalpro is aware there has been no contact to involve coal mining companies in discussion of the possibility of signing up to the EITI.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe regulatory framework in the UK currently ensures that all payments made to local and central movement in the form of fees, 
defaultbusiness rates and other 
defaulttaxes and contributions to 
defaultlocal infrastructure is
default done so in a fully transparent way
default,
default and the Group bel
defaultieves that there is no requirement
default for
default further regulation.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is noted from the press release dated 10
defaultth
default July 2013 posted on the EITI website that Business Minister Jo Swinson said 
default…..“Under the EITI, extractives companies operating in the UK would report
default material payments to the UK government, totalling billions of pounds, who will also report the receipts it received. The payments of tax, licence fees and other receipts will be disclosed in reports conforming to the EITI standards
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe seek urgent dialo
defaultgue on the status of UK based extraction under EITI.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultGovernment should be aware that London listed extractive companies currently have global offices and operations, they might view any attempt by the UK to impose further regulation as restrictive and decide to centre their businesses elsewhere.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultIf we wish to keep the core skills in coal mining and maintain our reputation as some of the best Mini
defaultng Engineers at depth or the most efficient truck and shovel method surface miners then an Energy Policy has to be developed that allows coal-fired power stations to continue in operation until 2030. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe there is too much focus on the short term i
defaultn Government. There are long lead times, often 
defaultat least 
defaultten years, to bring new mineral extraction operation
defaults
default on stream. They cannot be switched on
default and off,
default and once 
defaultlost
default, the industry and its support infrastructure will be very difficult to get back.
default Ener
defaultgy minerals are vital to the UK’s energy intensive industries’ competitive position, the recent publicity around shale gas has led to the Government saying that indigenous resources help to insulate us from supply shortages and price volatility but the sam
defaulte thinking does not seem to apply to coal.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe know that all fossil fuels require Carbon Capture and Storage as soon as practicable and are frustrated by the fact that it is now seven years since the UK’s first CCS competition was launched and so far we ha
defaultve not commenced any physical construction works and have spent very little of the promised £1bn for full scale demonstration of CCS.
