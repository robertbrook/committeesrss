[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Novartis[bold] (AMR0003)[bold]Focus on Antibiotics[bold]1. [bold]How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?[bold]Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens represent one of the greatest 
[normal]challenges
[normal] to human health
[normal]. Antibiotic resistance is
[normal] now
[normal] a linked global problem, with the dissemination of successful clones of MDR bacteria 
[normal]often
[normal] associated with the movement of people
[normal]1
[normal]. The excessive and/or inappropriate use of antibiotics 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]major ca
[normal]usative factor for the local evolution of MDR bacteria that can be further exacerbated by horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants between different bacterial species
[normal]1
[normal]. 
[normal]The last decade has seen the emergence of antimicrobial resistance 
[normal]affecting entire classes of antibiotics including quinolones, t
[normal]etracyclines, glycopeptides, 
[normal]macrolides
[normal] and 
[normal]β
[normal]‐
[normal]lactams including carbapenems
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal]In the same time period 
[normal]only 
[normal]three new antibiotics were 
[normal]successfully 
[normal]introduced
[normal] to
[normal] market
[normal] (linezolid, daptomycin a 
[normal]ceftaroline)
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Of great concern is that for some MDR bacteria, no active antibiotic is available, with the fear that this problem will increase over time
[normal]1
[normal], 3
[normal]. In the USA it is estimated that &gt; 15% of hea
[normal]l
[normal]thcare-ass
[normal]o
[normal]ciated infections are caused by MDR bacteria, while in Europe in 2007, it was estimated that ca. 25,000 patients died with an infection caused by and infection due to MDR 
[normal]bacteria
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]2[bold]. [bold]What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?[bold]H
[normal]os
[normal]pit
[normal]al based reporting of resistant
[normal] infections has
[normal] improved 
[normal]markedly
[normal] over the last decade
[normal]. 
[normal]However, such reporting is frequently limited to a small number of pathogens (e.g. 
[normal]Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli 
[normal]and
[normal] glycopeptide-
[normal]resistant enterococci) and 
[normal]indications (e.g. bacteraemia) as is exemplified by the mandatory surveillance program in England
[normal]4
[normal]. Information 
[normal]relating to complex
[normal] infections associated with a significant risk of antibiotic resistance, 
[normal](e.g. 
[normal]implant-associated infections
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] not generall
[normal]y collected.
[normal]In the wider community 
[normal]the 
[normal]picture of in
[normal]cidence, prevalence, mortality 
[normal]and cost of resistance
[normal] remains incomplete
[normal]. 
[normal]E
[normal]nhanced surveillance 
[normal]outside the
[normal] healthcare setting 
[normal]will
[normal] also 
[normal]be 
[normal]essential if we are to 
[normal]measure and 
[normal]understand 
[normal]the impact
[normal] of widespread antibiotic use in domestic, agricultural and industrial settings (e.g. sewage treatment). 
[normal]3. [bold]Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? [bold]If not, how could this be[bold] [bold]rectified?[bold]F
[normal]or pharmaceutical companies
[normal], 
[normal]the development of antibiotics does not represent a
[normal]n
[normal] attractive commercial
[normal] proposition
[normal] when compared to new chemical entities in other areas of medicine (e.g. cardiology, respiratory medici
[normal]ne, rheumatology
[normal],
[normal] cancer,
[normal] chronic diseases
[normal]). 
[normal]New approaches 
[normal]and incentives 
[normal]are required 
[normal]to 
[normal]ensure continued 
[normal]industry commitment to the 
[normal]development 
[normal]of
[normal] new antibiotics. These could include:

[normal]What measures (including [bold]behavioral[bold] change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?[bold] [bold]Infection control 
[normal]has played a critical role in
[normal] managing 
[normal]antibiotic resistance
[normal] in clinical settings
[normal]. 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment
[normal] targets 
[normal]have
[normal] increas
[normal]ed
[normal] accountability and awareness and redu
[normal]c
[normal]ed
[normal] cases of MRSA and 
[normal]C
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]difficile
[normal] across
[normal] NHS Trusts.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]However, 
[normal]while highly successful, 
[normal]the scope of the
[normal]se
[normal] targets has been limited to a small number of pathogens and indications. Therefore, it is essential that
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]ational performance measures 
[normal]should be reassessed to ensure that they are appropriately targeted
[normal] and take into account the changing environment in te
[normal]rms of causative pathogens and infections where there is a high risk of antibiotic resistance.   
[normal]While s
[normal]tewardship 
[normal]plays a central role
[normal] in 
[normal]reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance
[normal] and
[normal] superinfections, there are areas where stewardship can be improved to achieve the desired outcomes. 
[normal]While t
[normal]he current 
[normal]slogan
[normal] “the right drug, the right dose, at 
[normal]the right time and the right duration”
[normal] 
[normal]provides a helpful illustration of what stewardship pro
[normal]grams 
[normal]should look like, it does not include the measurement of outcomes. There is a clear need for all CCGs and hospital to have:
[normal]The measurement of outcomes needs to be undertaken by the clinical teams and 
[normal]through 
[normal]engagement with national clinical groups 
[normal]in specialties such as acute medicine, emergency medicine, orthopaedics, trauma and GPs.
[normal]Furthermore, t
[normal]he current stewardship initiatives 
[normal]do not
[normal] address many fundamental issues associated with antibiotic resistance. To effectively address antibiotic resistance
[normal] at a patient 
[normal]level requires
[normal]:
[normal]Antibiotics are not “wonder drugs” 
[normal]in the management of complex infections 
[normal]but can achieve
[normal] a remarkably high level of success
[normal], 
[normal]if the
[normal] most effective antibi
[normal]otics
[normal] are
[normal] combined with the correct surgery and
[normal]/or
[normal] source control of the infected site
[normal]7
[normal], 
[normal]8
[normal]. 
[normal]There have been significant advances in diagnostic 
[normal]techniques that should be employed to identify the causative pathogens and direct antibiotic treatment more 
[normal]effectively
[normal]9
[normal], 1
[normal]0
[normal]. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is increasingly being seen as best practice in the treatment of complex infections such as 
[normal]endocarditis, 
[normal]prosthetic joint and vascular graft infection
[normal]7
[normal]. 
[normal]The education and training of healthcare professionals is critical to success in addressing antibiotic resistance to ensure they have 
[normal]a good understanding of pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance 
[normal]and best practices in the use of antibacterial drugs.    
[normal]Ther
[normal]e are potential deleterious consequences of a simplistic view of antibiotic stewardship, namely
[normal],
[normal] restricting the newer and more expensive antibiotics in favour of 
[normal]“cheaper” and generic antibiotics
[normal] for “salvage” use. These consequences 
[normal]can include 
[normal]increasing the overall treatment course
[normal] and associated risks for
[normal], morbidity
[normal] and mortality
[normal] to the patient,
[normal] 
[normal]selecting resistant mutants
[normal] and increasing the overall healthcare associated costs.
[normal]International programs such as the Surv
[normal]iv
[normal]ing Sepsis Campaign
[normal]1
[normal]1
[normal] adv
[normal]ocate giving the most potent and broad spectrum agent(s) as initial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis and then 
[normal]d
[normal]e-escalating to 
[normal]antimicrobials
[normal] with a narrower spectrum
[normal] (if appropriate), once 
[normal]the underlying pathogen, resistance patterns, and the pat
[normal]ient’s res
[normal]ponse to treatment become clear.
[normal] This approach has been shown to deliver better outcomes in these circumstances.
[normal] 
[normal]5. [bold]What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross[bold]-border initiatives?[bold]Through the 
[normal]activities of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and its initiative Antibiotic Action
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]the UK is at the vanguard of initiatives to address antibiotic resistance.
[normal] This forum allows multiple stakeholders to identify, discuss and address key issues in the research, regulatory and 
[normal]market
[normal] environments, and 
[normal]is
[normal] regenerat
[normal]ing 
[normal]interest in the discovery and development of new antibiotic agents.  
[normal]U
[normal]nder the leadership and dir
[normal]ection of Professor Laura Piddock, 
[normal]Antibiotic Action 
[normal]has been highly proactive in reaching out to important
[normal] individuals and organisations
[normal] in the UK and internationally
[normal],
[normal] to address the serious problem of antibiotic resistance
[normal]. 
[normal]As a global pharmaceutical company, Novartis recognises the international dimension of the challenge of antibiotic resistance 
[normal]and is greatly encourage by 
[normal]the publication of the
[normal] Government’s AMR 
[normal]Strategy 
[normal]and the impetus provided by the C
[normal]MO
[normal]’s interest in the
[normal] subject. The UK 
[normal]is 
[normal]idea
[normal]l
[normal]l
[normal]y
[normal] position
[normal]ed
[normal] to assume a leading role in tackling the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. 
[normal]However, a
[normal]ny changes implemented in the UK will need to be adopted internationally to maximize their impact and for progress to be ma
[normal]de. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. [bold]What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?[bold]The Government’s five ye
[normal]ar
[normal] AMR
[normal] Strategy 
[normal]provides
[normal] a useful platform to start
[normal] addressing some key issues in the area of antimicrobial resistance
[normal] and 
[normal]is generally balanced in its assessment of
[normal] the challenge
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]If delivered, t
[normal]he three strategic aims would go a significant way to address
[normal]ing
[normal] the considerable c
[normal]hallenges presented by antibiotic resistance
[normal]. Novartis were pleased to note that antibiotic stewardship (subject to the caveats presented in the document above), the urgent need for the discovery and developments of new antibiotics, diagnostics and novel t
[normal]herapies and approaches are core themes within the strategy. 
[normal]The Strategy recognises the importance of improving knowledge amongst healthcare professionals and the 
[normal]general public to try and ensure that current treatment are preserved and used appropriately
[normal]. These statements and objectives need to go further to include the recognition that education and training of healthcare professionals 
[normal]to gain a far greater understanding of pathogenesis. Moreover, the importance of changes in current practice to enhance 
[normal]and 
[normal]develop the
[normal] role of multidisciplinary teams in managing complex infections needs to be included. 
[normal]T
[normal]he Strategy
[normal] 
[normal]places
[normal] s
[normal]ignificant obligations on industry to produce new treatments
[normal] but w
[normal]ithout offering re
[normal]ciprocal commitments
[normal] to improving the 
[normal]restrictive
[normal] 
[normal]commercial environment
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]T
[normal]he Government must make concrete commitments to how they plan to 
[normal]analyse
[normal] the challenges 
[normal]associated with AMR further and translate these, in collaboration with stakeholders, into initiatives that will drive real change.  In addre
[normal]ssing the commercial environment, 
[normal]the High Level Steering Group must outline how it plans to address some of the key challenges which it started to identify in the Strategy.
[normal] 
[normal]The Strategy recommends a substantial and extended research program to 
[normal]better und
[normal]erstand resistance, discover new therapies and improve surveillance of antibiotic resistance. This will clearly need new and substantial funding. With reference to the concerns about the significant obligation on 
[normal]industry inferred
[normal] in the Strategy, will new central (Government) funding be made available?
