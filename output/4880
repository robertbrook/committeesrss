[normal]DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JULY[bold] 2013[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the 
[normal]publication in July of 
[normal]the Government’s 
[normal]response to the public 
[normal]consultation o
[normal]n Schedule 7 which I had recommended in my 2011 report and which was conducted in
[normal] late 2012
[normal], attracting 395 responses
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the detention in August of David Miranda under Schedule 7 at Heathrow, giving rise to a storm of 
[normal]media 
[normal]controversy and a 
[normal]c
[normal]laim for judicial review
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]not yet decided, which raised a number of issues including 
[normal]the scope of the Schedule 7 power and its use in relation to 
[normal]what is said by Mr Miranda to be journalistic material
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the rejection in August by the Divisional C
[normal]ourt of a claim by a French national
[normal], examined at Heathrow, that 
[normal]the application of 
[normal]Schedule 7 contravened Articles 5, 6 and 8 of the ECHR
[normal] and EU free movement rules
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a Liberal Democrat conference motion 
[normal]in October, 
[normal]calling for further safeguards;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the publication in October of an “
[normal]illustrative
[normal]” draft revised Code of Practice
[normal] for examining officers
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]a report
[normal] in October by the Joint Committee of Human Rights, making a number of recommendations for the further reform of Schedule 7;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](g)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]Supreme Court 
[normal]dictum
[normal] in October
[normal], in a judgment written by its President and the recently-retired Lord Chief Justice
[normal] and concurred in by five other Justices
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]expressing concern 
[normal]about the breadth of the powers given to ports officers by Schedule 7;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](h)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the grant in November of a declaration that the refusal of police officers to await the arrival of a solicitor requested by a person detained under Schedule 7 before putting further questions to him was unlawful
[normal];
[normal] and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]a ministerial response of 11 November 2013 to the JCHR’s report on the Bill, pp.11-17 of which 
[normal]respond to the Committee’s
[normal] recommendations on Schedule 7.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]THRESHOLDS FOR THE USE OF SCHEDULE 7 POWERS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Legal background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Schedule 7 powers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The c[bold]urrent threshold[bold]s[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]P[bold]owers to stop, question and search[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]Schedule 7 powers are to be used solely for the pu
[normal]rpose of 
[normal]allowing for the determination of 
[normal]whether
[normal] the
[normal] person 
[normal]examined 
[normal]appears to be
[normal], or to have been, concerned in 
[normal]the commission,
[normal] 
[normal]preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.  
[normal]The powers must not be used to stop and question persons for any other purpose.”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The courts will no doubt continue, if necessary, to declare an examination unlawful on the basis that it was not used for the statutory purpose.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P[bold]ower[bold] to [bold]detain[bold]              [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The examining officer considering (or a senior officer being satisfied) that detention is 
[normal]necessary in order to assist in determining[bold] whether a person appears to be 
[normal]a person falling within section 40(1)(b) [i.e. a 
[normal]person who is or has been concern
[normal]ed in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism;]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The examining officer considering (or a senior officer being satisfied) that there are 
[normal]grounds for suspecting[bold] that the person appears to be 
[normal]a person falling within section 40(1)(b); or
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The examining officer considering (or a senior officer being satisfied) that there are 
[normal]reasonable grounds for suspecting[bold] that the person appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The first 
[normal](“
[normal]necessary in order to assist in 
[normal]determining
[normal]”) 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]little more than a statement of the obligation that rests upon any officer whose decision is liable to infringe the Article 8 (or Article 5) rights of another person.  It is based on the existing threshold for the taking of fingerprints or 
[normal]a 
[normal]DNA sample,
[normal] 
[normal]which the Government does not propose
[normal] to amend, 
[normal]and resembles the “
[normal]necessity
[normal]” threshold that the Bill proposes to introduce for 
[normal]authorisation by the review officer of 
[normal]continued 
[normal]detention after a so far unspecified period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The second (“
[normal]grounds for suspecting
[normal]”)
[normal] would echo the subjective belief standards already present in paragraphs 2(2)(b) and 2(4) of Schedule 7.  It would require the officer to have formed a suspicion
[normal], 
[normal]whether on the basis of information supplied by others, behavioural assessment or even just intuition
[normal].  It would however
[normal] 
[normal]ensure that (in the words of Lord Bingham, in the conte
[normal]xt of a stop and search power) a ports officer
[normal] is not deterred from 
[normal]detaining 
[normal]“
[normal]a person whom he does suspect as a potential terrorist by the fear that he could not show reasonable grounds for his 
[normal]suspicion
[normal]”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The third (“
[normal]reasonable grounds for suspecting
[normal]”)
[normal] 
[normal]is the default threshold for most stop and search powers, and 
[normal]was 
[normal]the solution favoured
[normal] by the JCHR
[normal] in relation to the detention power
[normal].
[normal]  It is related to (though not identical to) the proposal in the Bill that strip searches should be conducted 
[normal]only where the examining officer has “
[normal]reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is concealing something which may be evidence that the person falls within section 40(1)(b)
[normal]”.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](a)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Detention be permitted only when a senior officer is satisfied that [bold]there are grounds for suspecting that the[bold] person appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b)[bold] and that detention is necessary in order to assist in determining whether he is such a person[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold](b)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] On periodic review, a detention may be exten[bold]ded only when a senior officer remain[bold]s satisfied that there continue to b[bold]e grounds for suspecting that the person appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b)[bold], and that detention continues to be necessary in order to assist in determining whether he is such a person[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]FURTHER [bold]SAFEGUARDS[bold]&#xa0;
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Property may be detained for seven days, even in the absence of any belief that it may be needed for use as evidence in criminal proceedings or in connection with a deportation decision.  This contrasts with a period of 48 hours for the retention of documents obtained under reasonable suspicion powers such as section 43 of and Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000, subject to a single extension of up to a further 48 hours if an officer of at least the rank of chief inspector is satisfied that the examination is being carried out expeditiously, and that it is necessary to continue the examination to ascertain whether the document is one that may be seized.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Schedule 7 contain
[normal]s, as the JCHR has pointed out, no 
[normal]express 
[normal]system of safeguards for categories of material such as legally privileged material, excluded material and special procedure material
[normal] (including “
[normal]journalistic material
[normal]”).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The retention of electronic data is liable to be held for very long periods under the MOPI regime, which as I reported in July 2013 has been recently criticised in the courts.
[normal]  The system is in marked contrast to the rules and guidance that exist under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 concerning the retention and use of material (including biometric material gathered from Schedule 7 detainees) for the purposes of national security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]USE OF EVIDENCE GIVEN UNDER COMPULSION[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“It is one thing to conclude that the Schedule 7 powers of examination neither engage nor violate a defendant’s Art. 6 rights; it is another to conclude that there is no room for improvement.  For our part, we would urge those concerned to consider a legislative amendment, introducing a statutory bar to the introduction of Schedule 7 admissions in a subsequent criminal trial.  The terms of any such legislation would require careful reflection, having regard to the legitimate interests of all parties but, given the sensitivities to which the Schedule 7 powers give rise, there would be at least apparent attraction in clarifying legislation putting the matter beyond doubt.”

[normal]Gul
[normal] [2013] UKSC 64, (Lords Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Hope, Lord 
[normal]Mance
[normal], Lord Judge, Lord Kerr, Lord Reed), [63]-[64].  Having remarked on the broad prosecutorial discretion where terrorist offences are concerned, the Supreme Court continued: “
[normal]While the need to bestow wide, even intrusive powers on the police and other officers in connection with terrorism is understandable, the fact that the powers are so unrestricted and the definition of ‘terrorism’ is so wide means that such powers are probably of even more concern than the prosecutorial powers to which the Acts give rise.  Thus, under Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act, the power to stop, question and detain in port and at borders is left to the examining officer.  The power is not subject to any controls.  Indeed, the officer is not even required to have grounds for suspecting that the person concerned falls within section 40(1) of the 2000 Act (
[normal]ie
[normal] that he has ‘committed an offence’ or he ‘is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism’), or even that any offence has been or may be committed, before commencing an examination to see whether the person falls within that subsection.  On this appeal we are not, of course, directly concerned with that issue in this case.  But detention of the kind provided for in the Schedule represents the possibility of serious invasions of personal liberty.

[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]D. Anderson, 
[normal]The Terrorism Acts in 2012
[normal], 10.50-10.62.
[normal]  The reasons given at 10.58 include the need to preserve a deterrent against the use by terrorists of “
[normal]clean skins
[normal]”, the need not to alert a traveller to the fact that he is under surveillance and the need to question the unknown companion of a known terrorist.  I also gave (at 10.59) examples of positive results which have been derived from untargeted no-suspicion stops.
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Rules based targeting involves the “washing” of carrier data against intelligence-led indicators (or rules), so as to flag those passengers most closely matching the chosen rules. A rule might, for example, be used in the counter-terrorism context to identify
[normal] 
[normal]travellers with a profile similar to those of known terrorists travelling on routes of concern.
[normal] 
[normal] Such targeting will not be enough to engender suspicion of each individual who is targeted: but it provides an entirely rational and potentially very useful way of identifying persons whom it may be appropriate to question, and if necessary to search, in order to d
[normal]etermine whether they are concern
[normal]ed in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.  See further John Vine QPM, “

[normal]exercising a power under paragraph 2 or 3 of that Schedule
[normal]”: I prefer the more direct formulation suggested here.
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Gillan
[normal] and Quinton 
[normal][2006] UKHL 12, para 35.  It appears that a requirement of subjective suspicion in section 44 might have gone part of the way at least to satisfying the European Court of Human Rights which stated of section 44 in the same case, 
[normal]Gillan
[normal] and Quinton v UK  
[normal][2010] EHRR 45: “
[normal]Not only is it unnecessary for [the officer] to demonstrate the existence of any reasonable suspicion; he is not required even subjectively to suspect anything about the person stopped and searched
[normal]”.

[normal]Schedule 8 to the Bill, para 3(3) at 5(b).
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]I am conscious that the courts were historically “
[normal]loath to subject to any searching analysis the basis of police claims that they had reasonable suspicion
[normal]”: D. Feldman, 
[normal]Civil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales
[normal], 2
[normal]nd
[normal] 
[normal]edn
[normal]. 2002, p. 334.  But it would be unsatisfactory to rely on the courts adopting an over-permissive interpretation of the reasonable suspicion standard.  As the same author acknowledges, 
[normal]ECtHR
[normal] case law, given domestic effect by the Human Rights Act 1998, “
[normal]makes it clear that the reasonableness of a constable’s suspicion must be carefully assessed
[normal]”.
