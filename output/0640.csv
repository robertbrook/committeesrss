defaultAbout ADSdefault&#xa0;
defaultADS is the trade organisation advancing the UK Aerospace, Defence, and Security industries with Farnborough International Limited
default that runs the Farnborough International Airshow,
default a wholly-owned subsidiary. ADS encompasses the British Aviation Group (BAG) and jointly sponsors, with Intellect, UK
default 
defaultspace. ADS is also a member of the Sustainable Aviation coalition of airports, 
defaultairlines, aerospace
default manufacturers
default and NATS
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultADS
default 
defaultwas formed on 1 October 2009 from the merger of the Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC), the Defence Manufacturers Association (DMA) and the Association of Police and Public Security Suppliers (APPSS). ADS comprises around 900 member companies within the industries it represents. Together with its regional partners, ADS represents over 2,600 companies across the UK supply chain.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Aviation sector is vital to the UK economy bringing financial benefits to the UK and providing high skilled employment and connections to growing markets. The UK aerospace industry is one of the UK’s few world class manufacturing industries worth over £24bn to the UK of which 75% is exported world-wide. The sector is high value and highly skilled, employing directly and supporting a workforce of around 360,000 plus another 46,000 overseas. As the Prime Minister noted UK aerospace is “
defaulta powerhouse in the UK economy”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultADS welcomes the opportunity 
defaultto respond to the consultation from
default the House of Commons
default Science and Technology Select Committee
default.  Representing the aerospace supply chain, the ADS submission focuses 
defaulton how aerospace manufacturers can contribute to the public’s understanding of climate change.

defaultI
defaultndustry 
defaulttakes its environmental responsibilities seriously
default and
default over recent 
defaultyears,
default huge technological
default strides
default have been
default made 
defaultto reduce emissions. 
defaultAs a result
default of continuous technological advancement
default, a
defaultn aircraft today produces 70% less carbon dioxide compared to its equivalent from 50 years ago and 75% less noise tha
defaultn
default its equivalent from 30 years ago. The new Airbus A380 burns 17% less fuel per seat and produces around 10% less NOx than the previous largest aircraft model, whilst creating only about a quarter of the noise on arrival. Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner is 20% more fuel efficient than other 
defaultaero
defaultplanes of similar size 
defaultpartly as a result of
default being made from light carbon composite materials and having world-class Rolls-Royce engines.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith technological innovation playing such a crucial role in enhancing environmental efficiency,
default 
defaulti
defaultt is important industry has a voice within
default public discourse on climate change
default.
default 
defaultMany companies in the aerospace industry facilitate or are involved in 
defaultevents and initiatives 
defaultthat inform the
default public 
defaultof 
defaultthe new technologies and efficiencies that are reducing the environmental impact of flying.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is still more that the aerospace industry (in cooperation with Government) 
defaultcan do to 
defaultcommunicate with the public
default 
defaultso the discourse surrounding climate change is well informed
default.
default The industry is not complacent and always looks at ways to

defaultHow could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to play?default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important that the public understanding of the factors affecting
default climate change 
defaultare
default 
defaultinformed by scient
defaultific evidence

default and 
defaultthat Government

defaultmaximum

default 
defaultbenefits 
defaultwith

default impact 
defaulton 
defaultbusiness
default competitiveness
default. S
defaulttudies have demonstrated that the public understanding of the 
defaultenvironmental impact 
defaultof 
defaultaerospace
default 
defaultdoes
default not reflect reality
default. The graph below 
defaultusing information 
defaultfrom the 
defaultDfT’s report on “Public attitudes to climate change and the impact of transport” and the 
defaultNational Air Emissions Inventory, give
defaults evidence of this point, through
default a comparison between the real share of transport emissions and the perceived share.
default&#xa0;
defaultNB total transport emissions (100% in the chart below) represent only 27% of the UK total in 2007.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2007 comparison, taken even before the introduction of fuel efficient Long Range Aircraft such as the A380 that are dram
defaulta
defaulttically reducing fuel consumption per passenger mile
default,
default 
defaulthighlights each mode of transport’s share of emissions in reality and what the public perceive them to be. The largest divergence is in relation to air travel where the public perceive emissions to be higher than evidence would suggest. 
defaultThe graph notes that 
defaultthe public perceived that flights accounted for 40% of total transport 
defaultemissions
default 
defaultwhereas
default in r
defaulteality it was almost half this amount.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is clear from 
defaultthe above 
defaultgraph that more can be done to inform the public understanding of 
defaultthe 
defaultfactors affecting climate change.
default The government, industry and media 
defaultall have a role in 
defaultinfluenc
defaulting
default this understanding. Industry is working to improve public knowledge of climate change issues
default with events such as Future Days at Farnborough Airshow
default,
default but also with joint industry initiatives
default. Sustainable Aviation
default (SA)
default, for example is a proactive group of 
defaultUK 
defaultairlines, airports, engine and airframe manufacturers and 
defaultNATS,
default established specifically to address sustainability issues. Through studies such as the CO
default2
default Road-Map, 
defaultSA
default outlines an expert
default industry and scientific
default insight on how UK aviation can 
defaultpromote cleaner, 
defaultquieter
default, smarter flying
default. The group not only addresses carbon emissions but other areas of importance to the public such as noise
default, sustainable fuels
default and waste
default reduction
default, etc
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe media has the potential to play a positive role
default providing access to i
defaultnformed data and information
default, 
defaultas well as 
defaulthighlighting and raising
default climate change
default concerns in the public consciences
default.
default 
defaultIt can also help
default inform the public of 
defaulttechnological and operational improvements within industry that are reducing 
defaultthe
default environmental footprint
default of aviation
default.

defaultHow important is public understanding in developing effective climate changedefault policydefault?default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent report by Frontier Economics prepared for Heathrow
default noted that companies do 20 times the amount of business with countries connected by air, than those who are not. Supporting aviation will benefit the wider economy.  Ineffective climate change policy can result in hindering the aviation industry, general business
default and 
defaultinternational competitive
defaultness
default. Taxation such as the Air Passenger Duty has resulted in the UK ranking 134th out of 138 countries
default 
defaultin terms of competitive aviation
default by the World Economic Forum. This
default damages the industry and the UK as a place to do business.
default In a report published by PWC in February 2013 abolishing APD would boost UK GDP, create jobs, benefit consumers, tourists and business, and potentially pay for itself
default.  For these reasons it is crucial that climate change policy is effective and does not hinder the UK economy. 
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe public’s understanding of climate change, particularly 
defaultchannelled
default through environmental pressure groups undoubtedly has an effect 
defaulton
default the formulation of climate change policies. Good public understanding of the aerospace industry and how key technologies are reducing environmental impact of flying are important to influence views on the necessary climate change policies.
default As highlighted above,
default 
defaultp
defaultoorly targeted environmental policy risk
defaults
default the UK’s global competitiveness in the aerospace industry and the economy more widely.
default They also have the potential to divert funds away from industry hindering the ability to invest in innovative new technologies.
default It is therefore important that public knowledge of the factors affecting climate change is well informed. 
default4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDoes the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural defaultsciencesdefault to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policy policies?default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe public’s perception of environmental changes is complex and as a result 
defaultcan
defaultnot always translate into clear and feasible public policies. Although concerning noise, rather than climate change issues, the 
defaultimminent
default Noise Road Map 
defaultcommissioned by Sustainable Aviation, gives evidence to this point
default.
default It states that
default 
defaultd
defaultespite the reduction in aircraft noise achieved by the industry over the last half century, 
default‘
defaultperceptions of noise by local communities have not always improved in line with these improvements’. There are a number of variables to be considered and behaviour is not easily predicted
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe difficulty in 
defaultinterpreting
default the 
defaultpublic understanding
default of aviation and climate change is equally as difficult. As outlined earlier, perception does not match reality and opinions and actions a
defaultre
default often
default complex and unexpected.
default 
defaultEvidence of this
default point
default can be seen in 
defaultthe 2011 Office
default of National Statistics Opi
defaultnion Survey.
default 
defaultRespondents
default were asked whether they supported increased taxes/other charges to encourage reduction in air travel. Over half (54%) did not support this notion with only 19% supporting that premise. Even among those who classed themselves as very concerned about climate change there was net opposition to this measure
default. 
defaultThe public, wh
defaulto are often worried 
defaultabout 
defaultthe impact of climate change
default, are 
defaultfrequently
default not supporting of 
defaultcertain environmental 
defaultpolicies
default. It is a complex arrange
defaultment, Government must be aware
default of this when developing relevant public policy policies
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo aid public understanding on climate change, government messages should be consistent
default. Mixed messages enhance the complexity of the public perception of environmental issues. These mixed messages appear when industry is supported, while at the same time penalised. 
defaultThe Air Passenger Duty is a clear example of this. 
defaultWhile the government outwardly supports the 
defaultaviation
default industry and encourages innovation, they continue to increase the Air Passenger Tax
default 
defaultbeyond
default any rising environmental impact of flying. This exacerbates negative perception towards the industry and
default reduces the 
defaultamount of money
default available to reinvest in 
defaultthe new, more fuel efficient, types being developed through fleet replacement
default.
default It is crucial Government has a clear position 
defaultin order not to create confusion amongst the public
default and wrongly influence opinions and behaviour
default.
default&#xa0;
default5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCan lessons about public engagement with climate change policy be learned from other countries?default&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
defaultcting internationally and learning from successful and unsuccessful policy from other countries is crucial when addressing issues domestically. “Going it alone” risks international competitiveness and 
defaultwill put
default the UK at an economic disadvantage. 
defaultIn addition
default, effective climate change policy is enhanced greatly from the involvement of international partners. Aviation operates in a global market and as such, needs global solutions to avoid market distortions that would prejudice UK industry. 
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultActing internationally enhances en
defaultvironmental performance, and has
default a much greater impact 
defaultthan domestic
default 
defaultinitiative
default.
default For example,
default 
defaulti
defaultn the case of aircraft and aero-engine design, standards set at the international level have significantly enhanced environmental performance. The UK Government’s role in the negotiation and development of these at the International Civi
defaultl Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has been
default fundamental in ensuring that UK industry is not disadvantaged by other nation’
defaults interests. T
defaulthe aircraft CO2 certification scheme under development at ICAO and supported by industry gives a key indication of the importance of environmental action on an international level.
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLearning from the lead taken by other countries is important when formulating effective environmental policy
default.
default In the case of Air Passenger Duty, 
defaultother European countries, acted
default quickly when it was realised the tax was having a negative impact on the
defaultir respective economies
default. 
defaultThe Netherlands
default,
default Denmark and 
defaultEire 
defaulthave all reversed equivalent taxes in recent years, while the Irish government has reduced it significantly. The UK government
default has already
default recognised the negative impact A
defaultir 
defaultP
defaultassenger 
defaultD
defaultuty had
default in Northern Ireland and 
defaulthas 
defaultreduced it 
defaultthere 
defaultin order to compete
default with flights from the Irish 
defaultR
defaultepublic
default. Climate Change policies must support environmental goals 
defaulteffectively
default, not hinder the economy
default or industry.
default&#xa0;default6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConclusiondefault default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Aerospace industry sector is a successful, high value, high technology engineering, manufacturing and service industry that 
defaultgenerate
default significant returns to all its stakeholders. UK Aerospace is investing in new technologies to reduce its environmental impact whilst working with Government to secure the future of the industry. The industry does work to communicate its activities in reducing its environmental impact, but is not complacent and 
defaultis ready to 
defaultdo more. 
default 
defaultADS
default, and its members,
default 
defaultwould be pleased 
defaultto work with Government to enhance public knowledge of climate change
default.
