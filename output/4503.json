"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Boyd Johnston (CYS0100)\n&#xa0;\nKey to improving the safety of cyclists is to alter the \nmindset\n of the minority of drivers who cause the danger through inattention or aggressive driving. The introduction of strict liability combined with an education campaign aimed at both drivers and \ncyclists would go a long way in this regard.\n&#xa0;\nI am 63 years old and a very experienced cyclist and car driver. I have commuted by bike in Glasgow for the last 8 years. I that time I have been hit twice by cars in circumstances where the drivers just simply\n did not look properly. I have also had many close shaves, most due to carelessness on the part of drivers, but a small number due to deliberately aggressive driving.\n&#xa0;\nI have to say that in this part of the world, HGV's are not a significant problem for cy\nclists, but I recognise that this is not the case in other parts of the country.\n&#xa0;\nMy s\nuggestions for improvements are\n:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nstrict liability\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan education campaign aimed at drivers and cyclists\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nan ongoing, high-profile campaign by the police, targeting dangerou\ns, aggressive and distracted drivers in particular aimed at improving the overall standard of driving on our roads and reducing the level of casual law-breaking by motorists (speeding, hand-held mobiles etc.)\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsegregated\n facilities will in the longer term e\nncourage more cyclists to take to the roads.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
