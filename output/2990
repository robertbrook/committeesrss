[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]the Highways Term Maintenance Association (HTMA
[normal]) (SRN 013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am responding on behalf of the Highways Term Maintenance Association (HTMA) to your invitation to comment on your call for evidence on the strategic road network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The HTMA is the trade 
[normal]organisation which represents service providers who currently maintain around 80% of the highway network within the United Kingdom.  The Association aims to deliver high quality maintenance and asset management services, whilst seeking to drive positive ch
[normal]ange within the industry, for the communities within which we work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Association welcomes the acknowledgement in the government’s command paper, Action for Roads, of the importance of road maintenance to the economic and social growth of the United Kin
[normal]gdom.  It is for that reason that we would stress the importance of striking an appropriate balance between investment in new infrastructure and maintenance of the existing asset.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Association wishes to comment on Issue 4 of your call for evidence, 
[normal]“Ho[bold]w can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?”[bold]&#xa0;
