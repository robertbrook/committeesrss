[[[Bournemouth University (WSC096)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Like many universities, Bournemouth University (BU) faces significant challenges attracting and retaining women in academic careers, particularly in STEM subjects.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2009 we had only four female Professors, and we have been urgently working to address this. Between 2009 and 2012 the number of female Professors at BU increased from four to nine, or a fifth of all Professors. Although there is still a long way to go, with the help of initiatives like those outlined in this submission we have been able to make sustained progress. Overall BU now employs 309 female academics to 342 male academics, another positive sign that the ratio of female Professors will improve in the coming years as more junior academics’ careers progress.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; BU has learnt important lessons from this experience, which we believe can be applied to other institutions starting with low base numbers of female academics. The issues and challenges that we have encountered extend beyond STEM subjects and are directly applicable to many different subject areas. Interestingly, not all of the challenges are restricted to women either.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are no simple answers to the questions raised by this inquiry, rather many different issues that women in academia encounter, which when combined compound the problem of under representation of women in STEM. We have not attempted to provide an exhaustive summary of all the issues in this submission (which will vary by institution and according to different women’s experience). Instead we have noted the problems which were frequently raised in discussions with women in academia at BU. &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some of the problems and barriers encountered are practical whereas others are cultural, although there is frequent cross-over and often no clear distinction between the two. &#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is apparent that some of the evidence of cultural problems within academia is, by its very nature, more anecdotal and qualitative. However, given the frequency with which such points were raised we think it is important that it be taken into account.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Several women reported feeling that the academic culture is not conducive to raising a family. Women perceived that they were expected to dedicate their lives to academia in order to be successful, and that a decision to have children was seen as an admission that they were not serious about their careers.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A key issue underpinning this problem is the difficulty that STEM academics face when contemplating a longer period of leave – naturally needed for women starting a family. They believe that they run the risk of missing key developments in such rapidly changing research areas and institutions. In other careers it can be much easier to take maternity leave and time off to care for children, but for women in academia there is never a good time to be out of their field.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In practical terms, statutory rates of maternity pay in academia are relatively low, meaning women taking time off to have children face financial penalties. They also often feel that they have to continue working while off campus, since it is impossible to bring in a direct replacement in their area of research specialism and expertise. This can create a very frustrating compromise situation, where women typically continue working while on maternity leave, but still feel that their careers are set back by taking time off, as they inevitably publish less and risk missing key developments in their field.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Women in academia can also find the return to work and the year immediately following maternity leave particularly challenging. They may not receive any additional administrative support or reduction in teaching workload, but still have to catch up on research work after a year’s absence while, of course, continuing to care for their children.&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As one academic succinctly puts it, ‘The bottom-line is that academia does not currently&#xa0;make it easy in any way for women to retain their research careers when they have children.&#xa0;Academia is highly competitive, and it is very difficult for women to keep their careers on a par with men if they wish to have children.&#xa0;It's easier not to bother trying’.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As well as issues with caring for children, balancing academic careers with partners’ careers can also cause difficulties for women in academia. A partner’s non-academic career can often be prioritised, being more likely to provide a permanent rather than fixed term contract and therefore more stability. If the ‘non-academic partner’ moves to take up another role it can often be in an area where the woman cannot find a suitable academic position.&#xa0;2.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Women in relationships with other academics may not be immune to this. Although such a relationship could be thought to work well in terms of balancing a career, a woman with a partner who is at a more senior academic level to herself may find herself disadvantaged if they have to relocate to another university. The situation essentially becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&#xa0;2.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Another fundamental issue affecting retention of women in STEM subjects is the poor availability of permanent contracts in academia. Generally, it takes slightly longer in academia to reach the experience level appropriate for permanent posts, and unfortunately this tends to coincide with the time at which people are seeking to purchase houses and/or start a family. Consequently many women leave academia, or never enter it in the first place, in favour of more stable careers.&#xa0;2.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Due in part to these challenges, culturally there is a shortage of female role models in many universities, with few (or no) women visibly holding senior academic positions. This can in turn affect the confidence and ambition of other women as well as affecting the availability of female mentors.&#xa0;2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A lack of women in senior positions can also affect recruitment and lead to a solidifying of the status quo, as senior male academics (consciously or subconsciously) recruit colleagues and successors in their own image.&#xa0;2.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to recruitment panels potentially tending to recruit in their own likeness, research has shown that there can often be an ‘unconscious bias’ against women. For example, in terms of applications for jobs and promotion, when CVs are judged blindly women fare better on average, but when names are included, men have the advantage. &#xa0;2.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some women also describe encountering ‘anti-role models’ (one academic described them as ‘Margaret Thatcher’ characters), who after rising through the ranks themselves do not necessarily promote or encourage other women, and do not see the need for a wider gender balance other than themselves as a lone figure at the top.&#xa0;2.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One academic writes “There are also women that use their single or childless status to their advantage. For example one candidate seeking a Chair stating that ‘Well, I’m gay – so you don’t have to worry about me going off to have children’. Not strictly true, but she got the post.”&#xa0;2.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Female academics have also reported experiencing harassment or, more frequently, an underlying prejudice on account of their gender, which obviously has a negative effect on morale and the retention of female academics. Some women recount being viewed as automatically less capable than male colleagues, less interested in promotion, and potentially distracted from their careers by their decisions to have children.&#xa0;2.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One academic writes that while no-one would openly admit to holding or expressing such views, “Equally no-one wants to speak out about the daily issues they have encountered in the fear of having their name blackened or career slighted. Academia is a small world, dependent on your reputation and personal networks, so a small amount of negativity can have a huge impact on your personal career”.&#xa0;2.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At a cultural level many women also encounter ‘macho practices’ within male-dominated disciplines such as STEM, sometimes having to be highly assertive to ensure they receive credit for their work, such as inclusion of their names on research papers co-authored with male colleagues. One academic comments, ‘Quite simply, many women do not feel this is a modus operandi they can tolerate, let alone flourish in’.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The women that BU consulted for this inquiry were obviously all still within academia, and many still within STEM subjects. They were therefore unable to comment personally on reasons for leaving academia, but many reported friends and colleagues’ experiences. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Anecdotally, it appears that most women who leave STEM subjects do so in favour of working in business. This is partly attributed to companies in the private sector being able to offer more appealing maternity leave and childcare benefits than universities, along with more competitive salaries.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some women also move into management schemes for large private companies after completing PhDs in STEM subjects, which not only draws them away from academic careers, but can also be counterintuitive as these are often careers they could have followed after an undergraduate degree, without needing a Doctorate to qualify.&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Preparing this submission has been an interesting exercise for BU, and we are extremely grateful to everyone who gave up their time to put forward comments and experiences. We strongly believe in the value of diversity and the positive effect that it has on our ability to be creative and innovative. We also feel very strongly that it is completely unacceptable for anyone to feel harassed or subject to underlying prejudice. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a result of this submission, we will be recommending a review of BU’s maternity policy and the support we provide to colleagues on their return to work. We will also recommend that BU explores possible actions to bring about a cultural change in attitude towards women in academia, including how we can better celebrate those who successfully combine their career with family commitments.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, it is important to note that BU academics were recounting their experiences from across their entire career span, and that significant progress on supporting women in academia has been made over the last few years.&#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A university-wide Women’s Academic Network (WAN) has been established, with support from the highest level being provided as a key institutional priority. Such networks can serve multi-faceted purposes; raising the profile of existing women academics across the University, serving as networking forums allowing women in academia to meet regularly (including via social events), and arranging events with high-profile, inspirational speakers.&#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At BU the Network also provides a means by which the University can identify the important issues affecting women academics, crowd-source potential remedies, and maintain a direct dialogue with women over whether introduced measures are having a positive effect. We would highly recommend the establishment of such a network to all universities, preferably built into the institution’s formal structures.&#xa0;5.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As an institution we have also signed up to the Athena SWAN Charter - a national initiative which recognises and celebrates good practice in maintaining and promoting women academics in STEM subjects. Along with many other universities we are also taking part in the Athena Swan Awards, which are proving a rigorous, externally verified means of monitoring and celebrating our progress in this area. We strongly recommend that all universities sign up to the Athena SWAN initiative, and would suggest holding a week of events to promote the initiative internally.&#xa0;5.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; BU has also introduced an Associate Professor grade, a post in which holders are provided with considerable advice and development opportunities to support them in progressing to full Professorships within three to five years. There are currently eight women Associate Professors, which gives us confidence that we can further significantly increase the number of female Professors at BU over the next few years.&#xa0;5.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are also other general measures that women consulted at BU believe that universities across the UK could take to improve the retention of women in STEM. For example:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although many universities have been making progress on tackling the under-representation of women in STEM, there is clearly more that can be done, and given that they face a potential drain of talent from academia, universities need to be more proactive in combatting this - both for the sake of equality, and for their own institutional effectiveness.&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The initial onus to provide more sustainable, permanent contracts for academics is on universities. However, Government also has an important role in securing these by recognising the importance of protecting research and development funding for STEM, both through the UK Treasury and from international sources, particularly the European Commission. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One suggestion is that the Government should set national targets for the number of men in senior roles in Higher Education. A target of, for example, no more than 60% of roles in university leadership teams being held by men by 2020 would give a strong message, and could also be a less contentious approach than the introduction of quotas for women.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At a national level, the Government could also set targets to ensure that all funding bodies making decisions about awards have an equal number of men and women on their decision-making panels.&#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The next Research Excellence Framework process, scheduled for 2018, could also monitor gender equality amongst researchers, and potentially make the availability of schemes such as mentoring of women in STEM, and participation in national initiatives such as the Athena SWAN Awards, conditions of funding.&#xa0;6.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Government can also play a role in working with Universities UK and other scientific bodies to promote success stories of women in STEM nationally, ensuring Ministers frequently celebrate particular case studies and best practice.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This inquiry by the Science and Technology Select Committee into the issue of women in STEM subjects is to be welcomed as an initial step towards evaluating the extent of the problem, and concentrating minds nationally on possible solutions. We hope that the Government will seriously consider any collective recommendations made, and that the Committee will continue to return to the issue and monitor progress.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Bournemouth University would be delighted to give oral evidence on these issues as part of the Select Committee inquiry, if required.  &#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/why-are-there-so-few-female-vice-chancellors/2006576.article  Dr. Heather Savigny, Senior Lecturer in Politics at Bournemouth University has written a paper, ‘Women Know your Limits; Cultural Sexism in Academia’ currently under peer review prior to publication, examining this issue.
