"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Research Councils UK (WSC023)Research Councils UK (RCUK) believe that investment in attracting, training\n \nand managing the next generation \nof world-class researchers makes a major\n \ncontribution to the impact of research and benefits the economic and social\n \nwellbeing of the UK.\nWe will use our position and influence to lead cultural change in the HE sector,\n \nin particular through our support for\n the Vitae® Programme\n and the Concordat\n to Support the Career Development of Researchers\n, and the development of our recently published statement of expectations \n(see below) \nwhich describes how we expect those in receipt of our funding to promote and lead\n cultural change in relation to equality and diversity.\nOur vision is:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nto ensure that the best potential researchers from a diverse \npopulation\n are\n attracted into research careers\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nto enhance the quality of research training and the employability of early\n \nst\nage researchers\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nto enhance the impact of UK researchers by promoting improved career\n \ndevelopment and management of research staff by research organisations.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAn organization’s success and \ncompetitiveness depends on its ability to embrace diversity\nand draw on the skills, understanding and experience of its people. The potential rewards of\ndiversity are significant: recruiting staff from the widest possible pool will unlock talent and\nmake a\n major contribution to the impact of research and will benefit the economic and social\nwellbeing of the UK. RCUK expects that equality and diversity therefore is embedded at all\nlevels and in all aspects of normal research practice.\n&#xa0;\nRCUK expect those in r\neceipt of Research Council funding to:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npromote and lead cultural change in relation to equalities and diversity\n \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nengage staff at all levels with improving the promotion of equality and diversity\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nensure all members of the research workforce are trained and\n supported to address  disincentives and indirect obstacles to recruitment, retention and progression in research careers\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nprovide evidence of ways in which equality and diversity issues are managed at both\n \nan institutional and department level\n&#xa0;\nWhy do num\nbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What \nare the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?\nWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;\nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? \nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nwww.rcuk.ac.uk.\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/framework/RCDStrategylite.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/\n \n \nhttp://tisme-scienceandmaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TISME-Participation-Report.pdf\n \nhttp://tisme-scienceandmaths.org/blog/2011/04/06/post-16-participation-in-mathematics-and-physics/\n \n \nhttp://tisme-scienceandmaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Gender-Differences-in-15-Year-Olds-Perceptions-of-Physics-Physi\ncs-Lessons-and-Physics-teachers.pdf\n \n \nhttp://tisme-scienceandmaths.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TISME-Participation-Report.pdf\n Researching Cultures in Science, Engineering and Technology: An analysis of current and past literature Bagihole et al. 2008 \nhttp://www.wisecampa\nign.org.uk\n/\nfiles/userupl\no\na\nds/files/resources/report_7__bagilhole_1606_08.pdf\n \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Human-Geography-Benchmarking-Review-Report_\ntcm8-25257.pdf\n; \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Int_benchmarking_sociology_tcm8-4556.pdf\n; \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/International%20benchmarking%20review%20-%20Politics%20and%20International%20studies_tcm8-4554.pdf\n; \nhttp://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Int_benchmarking_economics_tcm8-4552.pdf\n \nhttp://www.iop.org/pol\ni\ncy/diversity\n/\ninitiatives/juno/index.html\n \n IoP Dive\nrsity and Inclusion Programme Strategy 2011-2015 \nhttp://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2010/page_44644.html\n \n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/researchcareers/SustainabilityoftheUKResearchWorkforce.pdf\n \n \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/research/science-\ns\nociety/document_library/pdf_06/structural-changes-final-report_en.pdf\n \nhttp://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/fi\nles/advice-papers/inquiry/women_in_stem/tapping_talents.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/researchcareers/EqualityStatement.pdf\n \nhttp://www.epsrc.ac.uk/SiteCollect\ni\nonDocuments/Publications/reports/InternationalReviewOfMathematicalSciences.pdf\n \nhttp://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/pubs/corporate/intrevs/2009ChemistryIR/Pages/chemistry.aspx\n \nhttp://www.blitzadv.co.uk/LMS-BTL\n-17Report.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/GoodPracticeinUCD.asp\n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/513201/What-do-researchers-do.html\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldselect/l\ndsctech/37/37.pdf\n \nhttp://www.stfc.ac.uk/resources/PDF/PhDcaree\nr\npathsummaryreport.pdf\n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/505181/Concordat-to-Support-the-Career-Development-of-Researchers.html\n \nhttp://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/\n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/353501/European-Commission-HR-Excellence-in-Rese\narch-Award-.html\n \n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/CMS/files/upload/Vitae-Concordat-three-year-review-report-April-2012.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/CMS/files/upload/1.PIRLS2011_Report_web.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.athenaforum.org.uk/pdf/DES2210_ASSE\nT_report_Athena.pdf\n \nhttp://www.daphnejackson.org/fellowships/\n \nhttp://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy-practice/462601/Every-Researcher-Counts-resources.html\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/researchcareers/EqualityStatement.pdf\n"
