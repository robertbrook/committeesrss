"LGP84\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Letter from Baroness Stowell of Beeston, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government&#xa0;16th December Select Committee Follow Up&#xa0;\nFollowing the Committee meeting on Monday \n16\nth\n December, \nI undertook to provide the Committee with some additional information as set out in your Clerk’s email of 17\nth\n December. I will take\n each of\n these points in \nthe \norder\n set out in your C\nlerk’s email\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe department’s views on the employment terms and conditions applicable to local government contract delivery by private or other sector organisations (Q439-442)&#xa0;\nThe d\nepartment notes that \ncouncils are locally elected bo\ndies and individual employers.\n&#xa0;\nAs such, \ncouncils\n are best placed\n&#xa0;\nto make decisions about the shape of their workforces, taking account of local circumstances and ensuring they deliver value for money for taxpayers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWe recognise that workforce costs\n&#xa0;\nmake\n up a significant proportion of\n&#xa0;\nlocal authority\n&#xa0;\nspending. Given this, councils will inevitably look to achieve savings in the way they manage their staff.\n&#xa0;\n This may include the outsourcing of jobs and services to the private sector. \nTransfer of Undertaking\ns (Protection of Employment\n) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) \nis an important part of the pr\notection of employees' rights.\n&#xa0;\nWhen it comes to outsourcing jobs and services, \ncouncils\n must, of course, abide by the law.\n&#xa0;\nThey should also\n&#xa0;\nensure\n&#xa0;\nthat employees transferrin\ng to private or voluntary sectors are treated fairly and equally.\n&#xa0;\n \nAll contracts with private sector firms for the delivery of public services routinely contain provisions which require the supplier to comply with all applicable laws and statutes. This is \nthe standard way of ensuring that there is a contractual requirement for suppliers to meet their legal obligations with regard to employment law.\n \nCouncils\n are\n&#xa0;\noften major employers and influencers in their local communities and can play a significant role\n&#xa0;\nin encouraging other employers in their communities to pay their workers\n&#xa0;\na proper wage e.g.\n&#xa0;\nLiving Wage or the local equivalent\n. \nLocal g\novernment should always award contracts on the basis of the best value for money for the taxpayer and whether to pay th\ne living wage must be a question for the employer. T\nhe g\novernment helps the low paid through the National Minimum Wage\n and indeed has cut income tax to help low paid people\n. \n However, i\nt is for workers and employers to decide the level of wages above the m\ninimum wage based on current cir\ncumstances.  This includes the g\novernment as a procurer and an employer.  \nOver 95%\n around 20 million\n&#xa0;\nemployees\n,\n across all sectors in the \nUK,\n earn above the minimum wage and the majority of public sector workers currently ea\nrn above the Living Wage.\nOn the matter of staff pension rights, s\ntaff employed by best value authorities\n are currently entitled to a broadly equivalent pension scheme if transferred and many contractors have elected to keep staff in the local government pension scheme by becoming admitted \nbodies within the scheme.  The g\novernment is currently considering how\n these arrangements might be reformed in the light of the new Fair Deal guidance \nproduced by Treasury\n, under which central government and school employees are entitled to remain in their current public service pension scheme if their work is transferred t\no a non-public provider.   \n&#xa0;\nAs regards zero hours contracts, we note that their use\n is not new, but since 2005, there has been an increase in their use\n and they are used by councils of all political colours, especially for part-time or casual employment r\noles\n. More recently government has been made aware of, and taken note of, anecdotal evidence that has illustrated instances of abuse.\n \nAs mentioned during the Committee \nmeeting of 16 December\n, the Business Secretary is looking into issues around zero hours \ncontracts and has \nasked officials \nfrom the department for Business, Innovation and Skills \nto undertake a fact finding exercise to explore how these contracts work and what the issues are\n. T\nhe g\novernment published a formal consultation on options to address\n these issues and improve how zero hours contracts are used in the economy\n on 19 December\n. The consultation will close\n on 13 March 2014 after which the Government will publish a response setting out any next steps we intend to make. The consultation \ndocume\nnt \nis available \nat\n \nwww.gov.uk/government/consultations/zero-hours-employment-contracts\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe proportion of local authority sector spend on services and goods delivered by non-UK companies (Q456) &#xa0;The d\nepartment does not have an estimate of the proportion of local go\nvernment spend delivered by non-\nUK companies. \nHowever \ns\npend data and details of contracts awarded would identify who the winning supplier\n was.\n  \nFor the purposes of the Regulations, a properly incorporated UK subsidiary of a firm is a UK firm. \nThis means that\n UK based subsidiaries or groups of multinational firms would count as being UK based.\n It is therefore\n \ndebateable as to the extent that money \nis flowing out of the UK economy.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nd\nepartment is encouraging \ncouncils\n to open up their procurement to\n local firms but g\novernment procurement is subject to Public Procurement Regulations \n2006 \nand these prohibit any form of discrimination against compani\nes solely on the basis of their nationality\n within the European Economic Area\n and those countries which are signatories to the Government Procurement Agreement. I\nt would therefore be unlawful to seek to restrict artificially the num\nber of contracts awarded\n to non-\nUK based firms. It is similarly unlawful to seek to reserve a proportion of spend for UK based firms. These regulations are designed to ensure fair cross border trade, and they of course work both ways. The benefit for UK firms is that they are abl\ne to compete effectively and without unfai\nr prejudice against them in non-\nUK markets, especially within the E\nuropean Union\n. Other European countries are subject to the same regulations and for the same reasons\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe government is continuing to support the involvement of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in public sector procurement; this includes measures to support the involvement of local \nsmall and medium enterprises \nin local government procurement.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Secr\netary of State strongly supports the abolition of \nPre-Qualification Questionnaires\n in order to open procurement to small businesses and, following from the recommendations made in Lord Young’s report ‘Growing Your Business’ 2013, new UK regulations are pla\nnned by summer 2014. These regulations concern the abolishing of \nPre-Qualification Questionnaires \nfor low value contracts (i.e. below E\nuropean Union\n threshold) and mandating the use of a standard core \nPre-Qualification Questionnaires \nfor high value contrac\nts; requiring public bodies to be more open about procurement and report their procurement spend with \nsmall and medium enterprises\n; and advertising of contract opportunities on a single online portal. Contracts Finder, the one stop shop for suppliers to ac\ncess live and future procurement opportunities, allows users to search for information about contracts worth over £10,000 with the government and its agencies and local government. The system takes feeds from a number of \nlocal\n procurement portals across th\ne country enabling UK business and \nsmall and medium enterprises \nto access local government procurement \nopportunities whether at local \nand national level. \n&#xa0;\nThe department’s views on the impact of the abolition of the Audit Commission on the ability of local authorities to detect and tackle fraud, including what the role of the National Audit Office should be in supporting whistleblowers and whether there are any uncertainties about the provision of an independent third party for whistleblowers to contact if they are aware of fraud related to local authority procurement exercises (Q463)&#xa0;\nIn response to the point raised by the Committee on the impact of the abolition of the Audit Commission on the ability of \ncouncils\n to detect and tackle fraud we would a\ngr\nee that the Audit Commission\n has made an important contribution, not least through the requirement for all public bodies subject to audit to participate in the biannual data matching exercise carried out by the Commission’s National Fraud Initiative. Durin\ng the passage of the Local Audi\nt and Accountability Bill, the g\novernment announced that the Initiative (which\n \nsince its inception in 1996, has helped to identify over £1 billion of fraud, error and overpayment) and its associated data-matching powers would\n transfer to the Cabinet Office. My officials are working with the Cabinet Office to ensure a smooth transition of that important function. We are also working with the Commission to determine the future of its other counter fraud tools that matter to loca\nl government. Furthermore, the wider scope of public audit means that the external auditor would need to be reassured that the body had suitable counter fraud measures in place to protect public funds.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, on 10 December we announced a £16.6 mill\nion of new investment which will not only protect local government from the impact of the Single Fraud Investigation Service on its non-welfare counter fraud capacity, it could enable around 200 more fraud investigators to be recruited in the fight to tack\nle this £2 billion a year problem. \n&#xa0;\nIn relation to \nwhistleblowing\n, we are mirroring the current arrangements. At present, the Audit Commission directs whistleblowers to the appointed auditor who is the person empowered to take any appropriate action in th\ne course of the audit. We will amend the order so that whistleblowers will continue to be able to go directly to their auditor and the \nNational Audit Office’s\n Comptroller and Auditor General to raise concerns, when the Commission is abolished. \n&#xa0;\nAny disclos\nures made to the \nNational Audit Office\n or the appointed auditor will continue to be protected under \nwhistleblowing\n legislation.\n&#xa0;\n20 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n A best value authority must make arrangements to secure \ncontinuous improvement\n in the way in which its func\ntions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness (LGA 1999, section 3[1]).  A list of best value authorities can be found at \nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/27/section/1\n .\n The Fair Deal is a non-statutory policy setting out how pension issues are dealt with when staff are compulsorily transferred from the public sector to inde\npendent providers delivering public services.  New Fair Deal guidance was issued by\n&#xa0;\nTreasury in October 2013\n&#xa0;\nand applies when staff who are members of a public service pension scheme move from the public sector to an independent contractor by way of a tran\nsfer to which TUPE applies, and when staff who are members of a public service pension scheme move by way of a non-voluntary transfer to a public service mutual or to other new models of public service delivery (regardless of whether or not TUPE applies).\n&#xa0;\n"
