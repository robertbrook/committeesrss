"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Ian Price (WRT 042)\n&#xa0;\nSir for many years I have been involved in Motorsport and I am an RAC MSA Technical Official so I do understand Tyres.\n&#xa0;\nThree Saturdays past I was driving near Tottington at 17-30 ish when we had a short sharp rain and hail shower. \n&#xa0;\nThe road became \ncovered in ice (hail) and I slowed my 3 month old car to around 15 mph.\n&#xa0;\nOn a very slight curve the car lost all traction and started to slide / spin , this with a driver who has bee involved with events such as The Monte Carlo and 1000 Lakes Rally's. Snow\n and ice driving is not an issue to \nme ,\n but even I could not stop it. Luckily no collision of any kind happened.\n&#xa0;\nWhat it did however was to lead me to investigate the O.E.M. tyres fitted to the car and others.\n&#xa0;\nIn the main manufacturers \n( car\n and tyre) s\neem to focus on mpg,noise,and good wear miles. Non of which gives good \ngrip !\n&#xa0;\nIndeed the tyres fitted to my car and almost all the others I looked at were described by the tyre makers as 'SUMMER' \ntyres !\n With many suggesting for 'Winter' you should fit 'W\ninter' or 'All Weather / Season' tyres as the 'Summer' tyres performance falls off so sharply to a dangerous extent ( as I had found) in 'Winter' weather !\n&#xa0;\nThere are many many graphs and tests that clearly demonstrate this on the internet. However in many\n European countries it is not an issue because '\nWinter\n ' tyres are a legal requirement so the issue never arises. \n&#xa0;\nHere we neither have that legislation or a real understanding of seasonal tyre construction, hence the very real danger all road users are i\nn from these totally inappropriate / dangerous \ntyres !\n&#xa0;\nI wonder how many people will die this winter in accidents that would not have happened had the car been fitted with the correct \ntyre ?\n&#xa0;\nHow do car manufacturers ( who all recognize the need for 'Wint\ner' tyres and try to sell them at around Â£1000 a set !) get away with selling cars on tyres that are in reality only 'safe' and 'fit for purpose' in the spring/summer/autumn months and in 'Winter' are as much use as a handbrake on a canoe ! \n&#xa0;\nShould they n\not fit 'All Weather' tyres that are safe 365 days of the \nyear ,whatever\n the weather !\n&#xa0;\nI do hope you will see and understand the need for strong urgent action to challenge this extremely serious safety issue.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
