[[[Ofsted’s findings relating to prison]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ ]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Training and education is not enough of a priority for prison governors and other senior staff. Accountability for the quality of provision is weak and must be addressed urgently(p.6).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The quality of learning and skills work in prisons

[[[ ]]]was poor. It had the largest proportion of inadequate provision across the whole of the FE and skills sector. In prisons, ‘leadership and management of learning and skills and work’ was judged to be inadequate or as requires improvement in 22 (58%) of the 38 prison reports published by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (p.10).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Prison regimes often disrupted learning and work related activities, resulting in poor attendance and punctuality. Furthermore, take-up of provision in English and maths was often very low compared with the level of need assessed at induction. Overall, far too few prisons were preparing prisoners adequately for resettlement and employment with good quality education and training. (p.11). -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite Ofsted’s negative findings, they also saw pockets of excellent practice in prisons (p.11). The most effective provision was vocational training where the prison worked in close partnership with employers.

[[[PLA evidence in response to Ofsted’s findings]]]Ofsted’s findings must be seen within the context of unprecedented change and reforms within the Criminal Justice System. These include; -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Significant cost savings as part of the ‘Fair and Sustainable’ agenda, making it harder to achieve rehabilitation outcomes-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changes to education contracts under OLASS 4 restricting the learning hours available and range of courses on offer-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Plans for secure colleges under Transforming Youth Custody (click here for our consultation response) -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Transforming Rehabilitation (click here for our consultation response)-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Plans to transform the management of young adults in custody (click here for our consultation response).Given the above context it is crucial that government departments (BIS, MoJ and DWP) whose policies all have an impact on prisoner learning, undertake a joined up approach; co-ordinating policies, aligning outcome targets and working together to achieve overall rehabilitation outcomes.January 2014&#xa0; Champion, N (2013) Smart Rehabilitation: Learning how to get better outcomes.
