[[[Introduction]]]The AA is the UK’s largest motoring organisation.  Its President, Edmund King, Visiting Professor of Transport of Newcastle University chairs the Department for Transport’s Motorists’ Forum.  The AA is very active stakeholder engaged in wide ranging policy and operational issues relating to UK roads.The AA keenly engages with its members.  AA members’ views and complaints are obtained directly via telephone calls, letters and e-mails.  The AA Populus panel is the largest motoring opinion panel in Europe and more than 20,000 respond to our monthly polls.  Questions on UK roads feature regularly in the polls.AA members have differing views on many key motoring issues.  Most say that roads are in a fairly poor state and have not kept pace with traffic growth. Congestion and unreliable journeys are a significant concern for motorists and business. A majority of AA/Populus panel members support the construction of new and improved roads. Motorists accept they must pay for their motoring but resent being seen as a ‘problem’ and oppose escalating costs such as fuel, road tax, parking charges and potential congestion charges. Private motoring is an essential part of 21st century life and is something people continue to aspire to and even enjoy. Motoring is the main form of transport for 86% of passenger journeys.  Many people are dependent on the car and the mobility of the car benefits society in many ways.

[[[lso improving the environment?]]]The scale of the task required to transform the quality, reliability and value to customers of strategic roads is enormous.  In our surveys people show concern for the lack of attention paid to roads our most valuable transport asset:&#xa0;

Much has been done to improve network quality and customer experience on road and rail and in cities but in many places transport remains a fragmented service.  This is perhaps unsurprising with most journeys being undertaken by road.  Cities and urban areas provide multi-faceted forms of transport with almost around the clock access whereas in rural areas cars and roads remain a lifeline and the mainstay for most.One problem in Britain is the lack of proper interchanges between the modes at the most opportune places.  The problem is compounded on roads where different authorities are responsible for national and local roads.  Problems on the Highways Agency network may well emanate from a local road which blocks access or egress to or from the national roads network.  Local authorities may also place a different priority on actions to resolve such issues.      

[[[&#xa0;]]]Traffic growth forecasts have in general helped predict likely future demand with sufficient accuracy to allow policy development.  Uncertainties will always exist but longer term trends have generally been reflected in the models. The problem is not so much the accuracy of the forecasts but the transformation of them into policies that lead to realistic capacity improvement.  Too many of our strategic roads run at or over design capacity – which suggests that for decades our predications may have been largely correct but our ability to provide for them in response has been inadequate. The models may place slightly too much faith in the success of interventions like demand management or public transport improvement.  It is also hard to build in the impact of real behaviour and response to political intervention and policy shifts.&#xa0;In reality we cannot ignore the capacity constraints which exist on the strategic road network or believe we can deal with them through unrealistic interventions or expectations.  It is likely that traffic growth will continue for many decades and yet there is belief that ‘making best use’ and behavioural change will prevent ‘overheating’ of traffic demand.  Reliability and efficiency can be improved by relatively soft measures like traffic information, better traffic and incident management and behavioural change.  However, this must go hand in hand with long term planning for upgrading capacity.The AA believes that managed motorways which utilise active traffic management techniques can play a major role in squeezing greater efficiency from key sections of English motorways.  However, we believe these techniques do not provide a long term solution to serious capacity weaknesses.  The AA is very disappointed that the latest managed motorways will require the permanent conversion of the hard shoulder into a running lane.  AA members are very dubious about this and the Sunday Times featured the results of an AA Populus poll (i) in an article on the 5 May 2013:&#xa0;Whilst hard economic times forced a review of capacity improvement costs which led to changes in managed motorway design there will be a need in the not too distant future for further capacity improvements on the sections of managed motorway implemented without hard shoulder.  The Highways Agency future congestion maps appear to confirm that some of these managed motorways will indeed be under stress again by 2025?           

[[[&#xa0;]]]The AA considers that road users are the investors in the strategic roads network and provide an adequate revenue stream through the tax they pay.  Whilst in the future fuel duties may decline because of improved fuel economy there will still be a significant surplus from fuel duty receipts.  Of course it is accepted that a significant proportion of motoring tax revenues are used for the general exchequer and so we understand the need for supporting investment in England’s strategic roads from other means.    This does not extend to accepting the need for further fiscal input from road users through direct charges on some roads.  The AA opposes the proposal to charge drivers to use the A14 once it is upgraded, an AA Populus poll in 2012 (iii) found:AA members also rejected the idea of creating a roads utility – an AA Populus poll (ii) found:

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Highways Agency has a relatively small strategic road network compared to others around the world. In fact it does not even operate roads in Scotland or Wales and yet those networks have a direct relationship with HA roads.  Whilst it is good to have ambitions for the HA to be the ‘worlds leading road operator’ it will take time under its new remit to achieve this.  The HA can learn much from road authorities around the world but the HA strategic roads are quite unique.  The UK is densely populated with very heavy road traffic flows and HA roads critically link with numerous local authority roads over which it has no control.  The HA strategic network has developed relatively piecemeal with past political intervention leading to stop-go policies and many unresolved capacity problems.  In recent times the public has also been less enthusiastic to support major capacity improvements.The redefined HA should seek to engage even better than at present and work to renew public interest in road development and improvement. &#xa0;(i)  21,510 responses to AA-Populus Poll 15-19 April 2013(ii) 20,161 responses to AA-Populus Poll 22-28 March 2012 (iii) 15,860 responses to AA-Populus Poll 20-27 July 2011&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
