default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence from defaultGrange-over-Sands Town defaultCouncil (TIC 013)default&#xa0;
defaultGrange over Sands is a small town in the south of Cumbria, situated on the Kent Estuary. 
default 
defaultWhile a thriving place to live, in the last census the inhabitants numbered four thousand plus and the figures showed that the local population was slanted 
defaulttowards an older demographic, though this group in no way reflects the total population of the town.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe town grew from a series of very small settlements as the railway brought tourists and those seeking a clean, healthy place to reside. 
default 
defaultGrange over San
defaultds still boasts a gentle climate, amazing local shops and a slower pace of life and this continues to encourage both tourists and retirees to the town. 
default 
defaultThese two groups mean that Grange over Sands has a particular need for reliable, regular and accessible
default local public transport on a year round basis.
default&#xa0;
defaultGrange over Sands, while not isolated, is surrounded by small villages which very much rely on the limited amount of public transport available. 
default 
defaultAt present
default,
default the town is quite well served by both rail and bus
default services during the week and on Saturdays, though a wider range of destinations might be desirable. 
default 
defaultThere is an (approximate) hourly service on both bus and rail services during the day, but a less frequent service in the evening. 
default 
defaultOn Sundays the service
default for both bus and rail travel is very limited, making it impossible, for example,
default to travel to and from entertainment in Kendal, Barrow or Lancaster, or indeed for any other purpose. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite some shortcomings, the X6 bus service (from Barrow to Kendal vi
defaulta Grange over Sands and Ulverston) could be described as a well-used lifeline for the people of the Furness peninsula. 
default 
defaultThis service however, would never have happened without quite considerable investment from Cumbria County Council to get the route up an
defaultd running and at the point it is today, where it is popular enough to continue without a subsidy. This really shows what both farsightedness and long term investment can achieve. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt present there is also a local ‘circular’ bus service on weekdays and Sat
defaulturdays which services the local villages and outlying settlements. 
default 
defaultThere is no evening service on this route and no Sunday or Bank Holiday service, despite this being a busy tourist destination. 
default 
defaultThere is also a very well-used, but intermittent, weekday s
defaultervice from Cartmel via some of the villages to Grange and ultimately to Kendal. 
default 
defaultThis bus links in with school services and also serves the village of Levens, between Grange over Sands and Kendal.
default 
default It would be very vulnerable to loss should the schools fr
defaultanchise change. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe bus
default is often very full and frequently is standing only when it reaches the village of Levens, not ideal when many of the users are older people.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAll settlements along the Furness peninsula, whether large or small, are concerned at t
defaulthe potential threat to through rail services to and from Manchester airport when electrification of the Preston to Manchester line begins. 
default 
defaultA series of passenger number and destination surveys have been, and are being, carried out by FLAG (Furness Line Act
defaultion Group) and FLCRP (Furness Line Community Rail Partnership) to ascertain current figures for through journeys beginning before or ending beyond Lancaster. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith the recent announcement of the proposed electrification of the Windermere Line, as a busy tourist destination and home of large companies such as BAE Systems and GlaxoSmithKline, any cut in through trains to the Furness Line could have a seriously sig
defaultnificant detrimental effect upon the financial wellbeing of many communities in the area as well as making the whole peninsula less attractive to inward investment. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is
default vital that not only are through trains not lost but that the Furness Line is elect
defaultrified along with other areas of the North West. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is sometimes the case that cyclists arriving at local stations find insufficient space for bicycles on the trains and due to the current lack of extra rolling stock
default.  T
defaulthis situation is unlikely to impro
defaultve in the near future when there is already a lack of passenger accommodation.
default 
default This seriously undermines any chance of sustainable (‘green’) tourism.
default&#xa0;
defaultThose members of our community who have a physical infirmity already find it difficult to travel by tra
defaultin due to the lack of facilities such as lifts and also a lack of staff at unmanned railway stations.
default 
default Travelling by bus is not much easier, although the Grange Circular (service 532) which services areas of Grange over Sands and outlying villages is a low
default floor vehicle with wheelchair access and space. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe X6 service, however, which gives access to the larger towns of Kendal, Ulverston and Barrow and the 530 service from Cartmel to Kendal are both run by Stagecoach and cannot be relied upon to always ha
defaultve easy access or space for a wheelchair. 
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung families with pushchairs also find difficulty in using these services. 
default 
defaultFor a tourist destination these services are also often lacking in adequate luggage space. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile there are a number of community transport schemes operating in Cumbria, should local public transport services deteriorate, these could be better developed locally and Grange over Sands should probably become a focus for such services in the Cartmel 
defaultpeninsula. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDuring the school summer holidays local visitor attractions have clubbed together to finance a free local bus linking a variety of places to visit which are difficult to access without a personal vehicle. 
default 
defaultThis is still in a trial period and p
defaultrobably needs to bed in and be further advertised before a decision could be taken as to whether it is a success and should be repeated in future years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile many local older residents in the hilly Cartmel peninsula already rely on taxis to take them fo
defaultr shopping and medical appointments, the distances between many of the smaller settlements make taxi use prohibitively expensive, especially over the long distances to Kendal, Barrow and Lancaster. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main challenges in retaining or even improving local
default public transport services to scattered communities are cost and usage numbers. 
default 
defaultWhen travelling locally by bus on weekdays it becomes obvious that the vast majority of passengers are older citizens, many of whom use a bus pass. 
default 
defaultShould the financing of th
defaultese passes ever be altered or the subsidy withdrawn altogether, then local services would be very badly hit financially.
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal students also use these services to access further education at Barrow and Kendal and there are various schemes available for yo
defaultung people to have reduced fares on buses at other times. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are many factors why all communities need good, affordable, regular public transport services which are accessible to all.
default 
default A worrying point in this issue is the fact that lack of local tran
defaultsport services limits the social options of residents without personal transport.
default 
default This can lead to isolation and depression, particularly in the elderly and or those living alone. 
default 
defaultA lack of local transport can also have a very detrimental effect on the l
defaultocal economy, particularly when potential customers from outlying areas are unable to access local shops and businesses. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultShould the potential number of new homes designated by Government for the area become reality, then keeping public transport viable 
defaultbecomes even more crucial if further vehicles are not to be added to the already inadequate road system. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith a dearth of convenient and affordable public transport services it is inevitable that people will be forced to use personal transport, whether it be car, motorbike or bicycle, thus exacerbating the already enormous problems on congested local roads. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis in itself will lead to increasing numbers of accidents involving both vehicles and pedestrians. 
default 
defaultIt also makes even worse the pedestrian experience for those 
defaultusing the already intimidating
default busy and fume filled pavements.
