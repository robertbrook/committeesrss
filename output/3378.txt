[[[The Insolvency Service – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Re: Evidence to the Joint Committee on the Deregulation Bill – 30 October 2013]]]&#xa0;I am writing to clarify the position on consultation in respect of Clause 9 of the Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;At the evidence session held on 30th October 2013, the committee heard evidence from R3, the trade body representing insolvency practitioners (IPs) on the proposal to allow IPs in future to specialise in either personal or corporate insolvency work.  The intention of the proposal is to enhance competition in the insolvency profession, following a report by the Office of Fair Trading in 2010 which demonstrated that the market in corporate insolvency did not always function effectively.   The measure is intended to lower barriers to entry to the profession, and thus encourage downward pressure on the fees charged.&#xa0;The Committee raised concerns at the hearing as to whether adequate consultation had taken place, and R3 said that they thought that there had been no formal consultation.  I was given the opportunity to respond to this, and whilst confirming that there had been consultation on a similar measure, I implied that there had been no formal consultation on this specific measure.  I would now like to clarify the comments I made, as a review of the history of this proposal demonstrates that there was indeed a proper consultation process.&#xa0;In March 2010 the Insolvency Service sent a

[[[ consultation letter to all key stakeholders]]] inviting views on the specialised authorisation proposals.&#xa0; The letter was sent to R3 along with the industry regulators and other interested parties.  In April 2010 a 

[[[stakeholder meeting was held ]]]

[[[to which R3 and others were invited]]]. There was broad support for the measure across a range of stakeholder participants. In April 2010 we commenced work on  working out potential costs and benefits of the proposal, to which the two main regulatory bodies, the Institute of Chartered Accountants England and Wales and the Insolvency Practitioners Association, contributed.&#xa0;In June 2010 R3 responded in writing to the March 2010 consultation raising their concerns about the idea.  Other stakeholders however, including some practitioners themselves, were broadly in favour of the proposal.  &#xa0;Having taken all views into account, including the concerns raised by R3, Ministers decided that the measure should be taken forward, as providing a small but useful enhancement to competition in this area.  &#xa0;It has always been recognised that not all regulatory bodies would wish to offer specialised authorisation procedures, and that amongst insolvency practitioners, only a minority would be likely to wish to take advantage of the change.  For some practitioners however, there would be clear benefits in doing so in terms of lower costs.  Our estimate, which was developed after discussion with the main Recognised Professional Bodies, was that in future between 10% and 30% of new applicants might wish to take advantage of specialised authorisation. &#xa0;I note that there was continuing mention of the intention to bring forward this measure, for example in the 

[[[letter s]]]

[[[ent by the Insolvency Service to all IPs in December 2012.]]]  By this time the measure was an integral part of the insolvency Red Tape Challenge measures, and this letter specifically stated that “The Insolvency Service will now produce deregulatory proposals which will be considered by Ministers in early 2013.”&#xa0;Finally, in August 2013 we 

[[[publicised the Joint Committee’s call for evidence]]] by sending a link to a large number of our stakeholders.&#xa0;I hope this helps clarify the consultation that has taken place on this proposal.&#xa0;&#xa0;Nick HowardHead of Insolvency Practitioner Regulation&#xa0;&#xa0;4 November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
