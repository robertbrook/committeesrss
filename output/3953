default1. 
defaultI am 
defaultStephen Hockman QC
default. I am in practice at 
default6 Pump Court
default where I am Head of Chambers. I chaired the Bar Council in 2006. I have a long-standing interest in constitutional affairs, and am 
defaultaware of and supportive of the Committee’s 
defaultcurrent
default work on 
default“Mapping the path to codifying
default 
defaultor not codifying the constitution of the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default”
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultAmong the important reasons why this is potentially 
defaultvaluable work
default are that there is currently a lack of clarity as to the exact provisions of our constitution. It follows from this that there is also a lack of clarity as to when and how it is possible to 
defaultchange
default the provisions of that constitution, and indeed (even more surprisingly) a lack of clarity as to when and how it has actually 
defaultbeen changed
default. Many may think that in a modern democracy there should be clear answers to these questions, and that in the absence of such answers it is inevitable that, to a greater or lesser extent, constitutional and political power will remain the preserve of a relatively small elite.  
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThe Constitution at present is a mi
defaultxture of statute law, case law 
defaultand ‘
defaultconventions
default’. Only 
defaultscholars
default know where it is all to 
defaultbe
default found. They do not necessarily agree on what the current Constitution provides. 
defaultThis is undemocratic and elitist. British citizens, and not 
defaultmerely
default experts, should be able to know what the Constitution says. Codification would 
defaultsimply
default hold up to the light what is 
defaultpresently
default obscure.  Codification does not change the Constitution; it simply reveals 
defaultwhat
default it is. 
defaultInsofar
default as the current situation is 
defaultunclear
default or vague, codification will reveal that as well.
default However, that is not a product of 
defaultcodification
default. It is the result of the present unsatisfactory and undemocratic 
defaultarrangements
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultThe aim of codification, then, very much fits with these times of (party-) political disengagement and lack of public trust in most branches of those who officiate over us, 
default(
defaultwhether it be Parliament, the Police, the Banks or the Media
default)
default, as one modest (in effect, though perhaps not in terms of 
defaultdrafting 
defaultwork!) measure towards increasing public 
defaultunderstanding
default of
default, 
defaultand 
defaultparticipation 
defaultand trust in our state institutions.  
defaultThis can be seen through a partisan lens as giving those without power ‘a leg up’
default against the elite
default, however, it is an aim that 
defaultis capable of being cast in many different lights and 
defaultI
default would hope 
defaultit 
defaultwould have cross-Party support.  
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultIt is 
defaultimportant
default to note that the one institution 
defaultof the state 
defaultthat has remained free of 
defaultclaims of corruption and scandal 
defaultis the jud
defaulticiary.  
defaultWhile 
defaultI
default 
defaultwould 
defaultpersonally 
defaultwelcome t
defaulthe involvement of 
defaultj
defaultudges in 
defaultconsultation on the practical details of 
defaultcodification 
defaultand the working of a Constitution, 
defaultand 
defaultI
default think their involvement in this 
default(insofar as they consider proper) 
defaultwould give additional authority to the exercise, 
defaultI
default also 
defaultstress that
default 
defaultcodification 
defaultneed
default not of itself enhance the role of the judiciary in 
defaultinterpreting
default the 
defaultConstitution
default. Nor will it require special constitutional courts, or allow unelected judges to usurp the role of 
defaultparliament
default. The judges, at present, have to construe and apply a body of constitutional law. Codification would sim
defaultp
defaultly mean that the sources of that law were all to be found in one place and were clear to everyone, subject, of course, to interpretation by
default the courts. 
defaultHowever, the relationship between the courts and politicians would not need to change and one would expect that the judiciary would remain keen to avoid trespassing into areas of political controversy.
default  
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultIt is often assumed that a fully codified constitution (in which citizens would find answers to the above questions) would have supra-legislative status. In other words, its provisions would like ordinary legislation have the force of law, but a constitution would have an even stronger status in the sense that (as in the US, Germany and some other countries) the constitutionality of ordinary legislation would fall to be assessed by reference to the constitution, and there would be a body (presumably a court and perhaps the Supreme Court) tasked with ruling upon the constitutionality of legislation, and the consequences in individual cases of non-compliance of the terms of a statute with such constitutional provisions.
default&#xa0;
default7
default. 
default              
defaultIt is, however, worth stressing quite strongly that although possible it is not necessary for a codified constitution to enjoy supra-legislative status. Under our current arrangements, although there is no comprehensive constitutional code, we do have at least two types of legislation which can be described in some sense as “constitutional” (and which according to some statements of the law in decided cases cannot therefore be subject to 
defaultimplied
default repeal). 
default&#xa0;
default8
default. 
default              
defaultFirst, there are many ordinary statutes which deal with constitutional issues and which have the same status, no greater and no less, than all other parts of the statute book. An example of this is the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 which is the current basis of the constitutional role of the judiciary and (following the reform of the role of the Lord Chancellor by the Blair government) constitutes the Lord Chief Justice as the head of the judiciary. 
default&#xa0;
default9
default.  
default              
defaultSecond, there are of course a number of individual statutes which already have in some sense a degree of added status, although none other than the Parliament Acts are subject to any restriction whatsoever as regards express repeal. One example is the European Communities Act 1972, which had the effect of making the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default subject to EU law, and hence subject to the relevant rulings on the interpretation of EU law by the European Court of Justice in 
defaultLuxembourg
default. In practice, Parliament would not repeal these legislative provisions without at the same time deciding to rescind our membership of the EU by withdrawing from our European Treaty obligations, these being a matter of international rather than domestic legal obligation.
default&#xa0;
default10
default. 
default              
defaultAnother important example, however, is the Human Rights Act 1998 which had the effect of incorporating into our law the European Human Rights Convention, the interpretation of which is subject to the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in 
defaultStrasbourg
default.
default What is important for present purposes about the Human Rights Act is that not only does it require public bodies generally including courts to act in a manner which is compatible with the Convention, but in addition it confers power on the courts to grant a “declaration of incompatibility” in respect of any statute which is incompatible with the Convention. These arrangements, which were widely regarded as a classic British compromise and were on introduction the subject of consensus across the political spectrum, have generally worked well, in that although a number of such declarations have been granted, in almost every case so far, Parliament has amended the law to address the issue. What is politically controversial about the Human Rights Act is not the constitutional mechanism it contains enabling the courts to issue such declarations, but the necessary constraints upon the practical freedom of Parliament to pass whatever laws appear to the majority in Parliament to be in the best interest of the country.

defaultAgainst this background 
defaultI
default would answer the Committee’s six questions as follows:
default&#xa0;
default(i) See above. If a codified constitution were to be accorded the same status as the Human Rights Act (which Act the constitution would almost certainly 
defaultneed
default to incorporate as one of its constituent parts), then there would be no change.
default&#xa0;
default(ii) The judiciary might well be hesitant to engage in consultation on political questions, but they have in recent times produced detailed written responses on various issues affecting the administration of justice, and the Lord Chief Justice
default, in particular,
default and 
defaultother 
defaultsenior judges do give evidence in Parliament
default on a fairly regular basis
default.
default  On practical matters, as to how a Constitution would work, 
defaultI
default consider they 
defaultmay
default be willing to assist especially if circumstances arise such that the codification 
defaultprocess 
defaulthas cross- Party support.
default&#xa0;
default(iii) On the basis set out above the powers of the courts would change relatively little. 
default&#xa0;
default(iv) No
default. 
default&#xa0;
default(v) There would be no need for a separate constitutional court.
default&#xa0;
default(vi) 
defaultI am
default not aware of any other jurisdiction in which our “British compromise” has been adopted. 
defaultI
default know that there are wide variations in constitutional structures within different countries, and even within countries elsewhere in the common law world. Experience, however, in countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa and Israel shows that the judiciary by their very nature do contribute towards public confidence in our constitutional arrangements, but also (a) add to the rationality of the political process, since unlike those in Parliament they are required to provide detailed reasons for their decisions, and (b) have shown themselves to be vigilant in the protection of individual liberty and in the protection of sometimes unpopular minorities.

default Note that rulings by that court are as a matter of domestic law non-binding, since the Human Rights Act provides only that such rulings must be “taken into account”; compliance with decisions of the European Court of Human Rights is instead a matter of the United Kingdom’s international legal obligations)
