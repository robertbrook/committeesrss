defaultENQUIRY INTO UNDERACHIEVEMENT IN EDUCATION OF WHITE WORKING CLASS CHILDRENdefault&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefaultCity Year is a leading youth and education charity and a beacon for a year of voluntary service. We tackle under attainment and the employability skills gap, while empowering young people to ‘be the change’ they wish to see in their communities. 
defaultThrough a 
defaultyear of volunteering in schools in deprived areas, City Year develops 18-to-25-year-olds as value-led leaders, near peer role models, mentors and tutors focused on addressing educational underachievement in communities across London and Birmingham.
defaultDuring 
defaulttheir volunteer service year, these young people (known as corps members) are not only an invaluable extra adult resource, but their energy, enthusiasm, commitment and example affects the climate of the whole school, helping to create an environment in whi
defaultch children from disadvantaged backgrounds can excel. Corps members help schools deliver a holistic approach to educational underachievement which reaches out beyond the school into local 
defaultcommunities.
default To
default date, and in addition to the 160 corps members currently serving, more than 250 City Year corps members have already served in schools in disadvantaged communities by giving 325,000 hours of service, which includes supporting around 2,500 focus children, 
defaultoften on a one-to-one basis.
defaultCity Year welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation. 
defaultEducational underachievement is a significant public policy issue that the UK has long been seeking to tackle. The long tail of underachievement has been widel
defaulty debated and successive Governments have sought to tackle it. Forty years on from National Children’s Bureau ‘Born to Fail’ report, education underachievement remains a serious public policy issue. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSince City Year began in London it has developed stron
defaultg partnerships with schools. Together 
defaulthead teachers
default and City Year volunteers have a joint mission to tackle educational underachievement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough this on the ground experience and discussion with professionals, City Year has a number of reflections on the
default issues white working class pupils face and the solutions to overcoming their problems. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhite working class children often have a significant aspiration deficitdefault&#xa0;
defaultMany white working class children think the "establishment" is against them, of which school
default is a part. This is often as a result of poor parental experience at school and current poor employment prospects.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultChildren have commented to corps members that "Mum said I should not read because no one read to her". Parents have also commented that 
defaulttheir child "doesn't do education”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis aspiration deficit can also be seen by white working class children rarely moving from the area their family have lived in for generations and considering "what if
default”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHarriet Owusu-Ansah, Head of Programme, City Year London: default"The corps members help children who never think what if, to start answering the question positively. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis then helps the pupil approach their learning with purpose.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is in contrast to other
default ethnicities who are far more aware of the importance of education and the consequences of not focusing on their school work. Often other ethnicities have also already faced a challenge by moving to this country. For these children their grandparents, who 
defaultmay have been the first to come over the UK, are viewed as an inspiration. Positive young role models that the children ca
defaultn relate to and that can tackle
default&#xa0;
defaulta lack of aspiration at home is very important to addressing the aspiration deficit of white working c
defaultlass children.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSuppordefaultting children with their ‘ABCs’default- attendance, behaviour and curriculum achievement - is key to overcoming underachievement default&#xa0;
defaultCity Year helps schools to tackle three of these key areas through intervention on:
default&#xa0;
defaulta) Attendance and punctuality - defaultBy encouraging children to look forward to school and enjoy their learning, following up on absence or lateness and sometimes making calls home or undertaking specific work with families as part of the school’s attendance st
defaultrategy. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultb) Behaviour - defaultBy modelling good behaviour in classrooms, corridors and outside areas, and through structured break time activities, corps members reduce disruptive behaviour and reinforce safe, no bullying-cultures. Teaching staff felt that cor
defaultps members had a positive impact on pupils’ behaviour in and out of the classroom, reporting they made a difference to the discipline of the class. Two in three pupils (65%) said that City Year corps members helped their class to behave ‘a lot’ better.
default&#xa0;
defaultc)default Curriculum achievement and levels of progress - defaultCity Year’s method of engaging children intensively over long periods of time and in all aspects of their school life makes a City Year team a valuable part of the school’s strategy for raising attainment an
defaultd closing achievement gaps. Corps members committed 90,000 hours of school-based voluntary service during 2011/12 (around 9,000 hours of which were in small groups or one-to-one settings intensively supporting 450 children). 
default&#xa0;
defaultPupils in receipt of fifteen o
defaultr more hours of one-to-one support from corps members during the school year had higher levels of progress compared to those receiving less support. For those from working class backgrounds this extra one-to-one support helps address areas of potential dis
defaultadvantage such as when parents or carers with low aspirations or who are unable to provide extra help with school work at home. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDr Jane Keeley, Headteacher of Haggerston School, Hackneydefault: 
default“Haggerston school has been delighted to welcome City Year to 
defaultour learning community.
default&#xa0;
default Corps members have supported transition for our new students in year 7, are running literacy and numeracy focussed competitions at lunch time alongside supporting homework, GCSE study club and EAL phonics groups at the end of the s
defaultchool day.
default&#xa0;
default Corps members model our ethos of developing creative, confident and capable young people and we are excited about seeing the impact on our students over the course of this year.”
default&#xa0;
defaultMichelle Thomas, Headteacher of Shacklewell Primary School, Hadefaultckneydefault: 
default"We have been fortunate to work in partnership with City Year for the last two academic years at Shacklewell. During this time, they have been an instrumental part of our drive for whole school improvement. The academic progress of the children has 
defaultaccelerated due to the targeted support they have provided in KS2."
default&#xa0;
defaultYoung role models are much needed in tackling this aspiration deficit default&#xa0;
defaultTo tackle this aspiration deficit, role models from outside the family home, such as teachers and support staff in
default school, are vital. They help create a culture of high expectations in terms of behaviour, learning and future ambitions. This is particularly important as external support, such as from high quality careers advisers, is currently lacking. Many schools use
default their pupil premium funds to support focus groups of underachieving children. As highlighted in their recent Ofsted report, City Year’s focus group intervention has been very effective for the white working class boys at William Ellis School.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOfdefaultsted report of William Ellis Schooldefault"...the pupil premium for 2012-2013 is funding eleven full-time, ‘City Year’ volunteers. These enthusiastic young adults are working with low achievers, particularly White working class boys. Several low attaining student
defaults’ attitudes to school are already much better."
default&#xa0;
defaultSam White, Headteacher of William Ellis School, Camdendefault: 
default“We are very excited about our new partnership with City Year. As boys come back to school for the new term they will be welcomed by a team of 
defaultenthusiastic and idealistic young role models that want to help, which is great. At William Ellis School we develop teamwork, creativity and encourage our pupils to have a high self-worth. City Year corps members demonstrate all of these qualities and they
default will provide valuable support as we help each boy achieve their ambitions.”
default&#xa0;
defaultOften young people relate well to corps members due to their near-peer nature, similar experiences and City Year’s culture of encouraging empathy. City Year actively recruits a 
defaulttruly diverse corps, ensuring that many members can directly relate to challenges being experienced by the pupils they are serving and help them to overcome those challenges which are, or can become, barriers to learning. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultCharacter is a key ingredientdefault in raising achievement and children being ready to learndefault&#xa0;
defaultA child's character traits and attitude to his or her learning is the main determining factor of academic results. In Demos’ 
defaultex-curricula report it was 
defaulthighlighted that one in 10 children begin sch
defaultool without the behaviour needed to be ready to learn. Character is embedded in the expectation of schools but more can be done to develop it more systemically at every stage and age. 
default&#xa0;
defaultBy building character children understand the personal and social beha
defaultviours needed to succeed at school, in work and life. The volunteering and modelling of the ABC’s by corps members help pupils develop these characteristics themselves over time. They also are inspired by seeing young adults choosing to volunteer for a yea
defaultr and undertake practical action in the service of others. The corps members are vital additional young, positive adults who have the time to support children not only in their attainment but also in developing these key characteristics that they will need
default to make a successful transition to adulthood and to become engaged citizens themselves. 
default&#xa0;
defaultGordon Higginson, Deputy Head Teacher at Holte School, Lozells: default“We are delighted to become partners with City Year for 2013-14 and will take the unique stance of de
defaultploying the corps members between a primary and secondary school that share one building to ensure the Key Stage 2-3 transition is smooth. 
default“Challenge, social skills and personal development are our focus to assist young people to gain high quality 
defaultlearning experiences, facilitating bright futures for all. We will use the City Year ethos and the skills, qualities and attributes of the corps members to add value to our year on year school improvement and our on-going mission to improve the life chance
defaults of all our young people.”
default&#xa0;
defaultCity Year is currently working on developing its dual impact on corps members and children with funders and has a visit to the US planned to develop this further. This will provide interesting data which can focus in on the jo
defaulturney and key turning points a child makes to be ready to learn, engage and succeed.
default&#xa0;
defaultNurturing pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development as a whole school approach is key to overcoming the aspiration deficit of the white working class childefaultddefault&#xa0;
defaultCity Year plays a key part in helping a school create a positive and high expectations culture. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCity 
defaultYear’s "whole school, whole child" is a package which allows corps members to boost pupil confidence and learning, improve their academic progress as w
defaultell as help children feel safe, empowered and happy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultJanice Thomas, Executive Headteacher of Sebright Primary School, Hackneydefault: 
default“City Year corps members have been serving at Sebright for three years now. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThey make a massive difference to children’s 
defaultconfidence and enjoyment of school and they do an excellent job supporting teachers to raise standards in English and maths. Heads should be forming an orderly queue to bring City Year into their schools. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThey are certainly helping me deliver the commitme
defaultnts in our school improvement plan.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe package is responsive to the local area, pupil need and head teacher’s preference. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSchools use City Year provision in a range of ways as highlighted by recent school Ofsted reports. For example, City Year was m
defaultentioned in the outstanding Ofsted reports of King Solomon Secondary Academy and Whitmore Prima
defaultry School and as part of their 
defaultSMSC development.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultOfsted, Whitmore Primary School: default&#xa0;default“City Year provides enthusiastic and appropriately trained young volunteers 
defaultto act as mentors and role models for the pupils. Together with teachers, they help establish and maintain very good relationships between pupils and staff.”
default&#xa0;
defaultOfsted, King Solomon Secondary Academy:default  default“The academy’s significant links with other 
defaultOrganisations (for example, City Year) have a highly positive impact on the academy”.
default&#xa0;
defaultCity Year’s “whole school, whole child” approach has impact across the school community. School staff, parents and pupils are highly positive about the involvement of C
defaultity Year in their schools; two in three members of staff said the experience of City Year was ‘excellent’. 95% of teaching professionals indicated they would recommend City Year to someone else in their position in another school. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNearly 90% of all school
defaults renew their agreements with City Year after seeing its impact on their school’s overall performance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPenny Smith, Headteacher of Whitmore Primary School, Hackneydefault: 
default“City Year corps members are making an invaluable contribution and their energy and drive
default is being felt across the entire
default&#xa0;
defaultschool. City Year start the day with the children in breakfast club, followed by vigorous PT in the playground. Once the school days starts, City Year can be found supporting children in class, running games at playtime, de
defaultveloping sports and tutoring children.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll the staff, parents and children have warmly welcomed City Year to the school.”
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCity Year would urge the committee to recognise the importance of the aspiration deficit in explaining the underachievement of white working class children. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe 
defaulthope in its recommendations the Committee will reflect on how holistic, whole school, communit
defaulty level support can be harnessed. For example, strengthening SMSC requirements as part of Ofsted would help schools focus effort and at
defaulttention on helping children develop
default the academic behaviours needed to learn throughout their school years. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough mor
defaulte focus on this by schools,
default we will learn to far
default more about the journey a young person take
defaults
default to be ready to learn and achieve.
