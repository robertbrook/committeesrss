[normal]Written evidence from Dr Roger Sexton (TIC 001)[bold]1
[normal]              
[normal]I am only dealing with your third question, ‘What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities?’
[normal]A
[normal]              
[normal]Bus Deregulation
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]Buses are the
[normal] main form of rural public transport
[normal].  
[normal]  
[normal]The 
[normal]biggest  
[normal]‘
[normal]challenge
[normal]’
[normal](I woul
[normal]d use the word ‘problem’
[normal]) 
[normal]is the lack of public control over bus services.   Unlike in the rest of Europe, 
[normal]most 
[normal]British 
[normal]bus
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] outside London 
[normal]are provided commercially; these ser
[normal]vices are 
[normal]not[bold] planned by public bodies such as a German/Swiss
[normal]/
[normal] Austrian Verkehrsverbund
[normal] or a Swedish Lanstrafiken.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]In very rural 
[normal]parts of Britain
[normal] there may be no commercial 
[normal]bus 
[normal]services, and the L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]Authority 
[normal]can 
[normal]then 
[normal]plan the system.  
[normal] But that
[normal] situa
[normal]tion is
[normal] rather
[normal] rare.  Usually
[normal] in rural areas
[normal] (eg in North Derbys
[normal]hire
[normal] and Nor
[normal]t
[normal]h Nott
[normal]ingham
[normal]s
[normal]hire
[normal]) there are some commercial registration
[normal]s
[normal] which make a 
[normal]planned
[normal] 
[normal]network[bold] impossible
[normal].[bold]   [bold]Bus deregulation
[normal] [bold]also 
[normal]makes integration of 
[normal]rail, bus and ferry services impossible.  This point is even more important in 
[normal]rural areas than it is in cities.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]As I have said before, we need regional  PTA-type bodies covering the whole country, with control over all 
[normal]local 
[normal]rail, bus and ferry services
[normal].  See e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal].
[normal] your 2012 report on 
[normal]competition
[normal] in the bus industry, 
[normal]my oral 
[normal]evidence at
[normal] Ev
[normal] page 14
[normal] Q93
[normal].  I would add that in the Netherlands, there are PTA
[normal]-like
[normal] bodies controlling all local public transport
[normal], urban and rural.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]In the context of cycling, w
[normal]e a
[normal]re constantly being exhorted to 
[normal]‘go Dutch’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]  The same should be true of public transport.  And what do
[normal] D
[normal]utch cyclists do when it rains?  Or they have heavy luggage
[normal],
[normal] or they want to go a long distance, perhaps to rural Friesland, or the islands off the nor
[normal]th coast?  They use their excellent integrated  
[normal]regulated[bold]  [bold]public transport 
[normal]network.    And to pay for their
[normal] journeys, 
[normal]they get out their nationwide ‘O
[normal]ystercard’,  the  
[normal]‘OV Chipkaart’
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]Yes, 
[normal]one[bold] smartcard for the whole country, both urban and rural
[normal] and 
[normal]valid on all forms of public tr
[normal]a
[normal]nsport
[normal]!  
[normal]Contrast the situation here in urban Nottingham where there are now 
[normal]three[bold] incompatible smartcard systems in one city
[normal] – and that is just for buses
[normal]!
[normal]  (Trams and trains are not covered.)
[normal]B 
[normal]              
[normal]Senior Bus Passes
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] second major
[normal] problem is the distorting effect of Senior bus passes.  Seniors living in rural areas insist on bus services 
[normal](timetabled to leave their village after 09 30) 
[normal]so they can use their free passes.  They reject rail, ferry or
[normal] shared taxis.  That is
[normal] nonsensical
[normal].
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]I would not extend the free bus pass to other forms of 
[normal]public 
[normal]transport. 
[normal]  Rather I would replace it with a smart card ‘purse’ valid on all forms of public transport 
[normal].
[normal]  I would suggest an annual value of £520, (£10 per week.).  There would,
[normal] of course, have to be legislation imposing a uniform smart card system on all operators of public transport.  
[normal]See
[normal] my written evidence to the 2012 enquiry, page 
[normal]Ev 
[normal]75 para
[normal]graph
[normal] 15
[normal], but note paragraph 6 above.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]There might be a case for the smart card 
[normal]‘pur
[normal]se’ to be larger for
[normal] Seniors living in rural 
[normal]areas
[normal] 
[normal]a long way from the nearest 
[normal]large 
[normal]town
[normal].  
[normal]However
[normal],
[normal] another advantage of public transport being  controlled by a PTA is that the PTA sets the fares.  We must put an end to the absurd situation 
[normal]where one sect
[normal]or of the rural
[normal] population
[normal] can make unlimited journeys ‘to town’ for nothing, while other sectors (particularly the young and the unemployed) have to pay very high fares.
[normal]  We can only do that by (both) ending bus deregulation and putting some upper limit o
[normal]n the use of Senior bus passes.
