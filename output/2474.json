"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by The Riverside Group Ltd.&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRiverside is one of the largest housing association groups in the country, owning and managing over 53,000 properties across England and Scotland. The Riverside Group Limited is the main asset-owning association in the group. In addition to providing gener\nal needs accommodation, Riverside delivers supported housing through a sheltered and supported arm of the business, Riverside ECHG (RECHG), which provides services to more than 11,500 \nvulnerable \nclients with a diverse range of housing needs.\n&#xa0;1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRiverside\n wel\ncomes the opportunity to \nsubmit views\n to the\n Work and Pensions Select C\nommittee \nas part of\n the inquiry\n \ninto support for housing costs in the \nr\neformed welfare system. \nOur evid\nence is presented in three sections\n:\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ncommentary\n on\n the\n early\n operational\n impact of welfare reform for \nour customers and \nRiverside as a\n social business\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nn\new evidence derived from recent research under\ntaken by Riverside and partners;\n \nand in the light of this\n experience\n and evidence:\n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nr\necommendations for \npractical changes which \ncould\n reduce the negative impact of a number of welfare reform measures, whilst helping the Government meet its broader objectives.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough it is still \nrelatively \nearly to gauge\n the \nfull \nimpact of welfare reform\n on the livelihoods of tenants\n,\n a number of clear trends are beginning to emerge following the introduction of the under-occupation penalty\n. The NHF’s\n report;\n “\nThe Bedroom Tax in Merseyside\n, 100 Days On” gives an\n account of the situation in \nthe region\n, and\n much of this can be extrapolated to the north of England as a whole.\n More recently, the NH\nF have revealed results of a\n survey\n \nof 51 housing associations around England, finding that more than half (32,432) of residents affected by the bedroom tax have bee\nn unable to pay their rent between April and June. A quarter of those affected are in rent arrears for the \nfirst time\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is reflected in Riverside’s\n direct\n experience\n. \nOver 6,000 Riverside tenants are affected by the under-occupation penalty, or over a\n third of working age claimants\n, with the overwhelming majority\n (98%)\n of those affected living in general needs properties\n. Tenants \nacross the country\n are\n facing the penalty\n, includ\ning London and the South East, with o\nver 45s and disabled tenants \nbeing\n ove\nr-represented. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo years ago – as part of \nHousing Futures Network\n – we undertook a survey of tenants likely to be affected by the under-occupation penalty. It suggeste\nd that 25\n% wer\ne likely to seek to downsize,\n \n83\n% were concerned about meeting\n the shortfall in their rent\n, with 35% considering it likely or very likely that they would go into rent arrears\n. Two\n years on\n,\n \nthe real \nexperience\n of tenants\n is \nechoing\n these early indicators of behavioural response.\n \n&#xa0;\nHousing Futures Network Survey, 20\n11\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\nent arrears\n are increasing and this is largely driven by tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty not meeting the shortfall in their rent. Nearly half (47%) of tenants affected by the under-occupation penalty are in arrears, around double the \npercentage of those unaffected. Whilst the majority of affected tenants have met some of the shortfall in their rent (77%), arrears are have risen by an average of £150,000 each month since April.\n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndespite Riverside having a general shortage of housing to \nhelp tenants who want to downsize, many are moving – 370 since the beginning of April. Whilst over half are moving to other affordable homes\n&#xa0;\n– either Riverside’s or other social landlords\n’\n – at least a third may be moving into the high-rent private rented \nsector, far more than the Government has assumed in its forecasts. If this continues, by the end of the year over 1,100 tenants could have moved, close to 20% of those affected. And it is fea\nred that it may be more, as some\n tenants find that they simply ca\nnnot afford to stay, particularly as energy costs rise with the advent of winter. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nin the year to the\n end of August\n (2013)\n, \nthere has\n been a \n50% + \nrise in the number of\n empty properties\n, an increase of over 200. \nThis has been\n fuelled by \nincreased turnover \nand \ngrowing re-\nlet times, which by the end of August had\n increased by 8\n.3 days or 28% compared to the full year figure for 2012/13.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nt\nhere \nis \nlittle evidence of significant number\ns\n of affected tenants moving into work. \nThe rate of\n worklessness amongst River\ns\nide’s working age tenants is high\n \nat around 60%, and qualitative research indic\nates that even where tenants have been\n successful in moving into work, it is often temporary and insecure.\n&#xa0;2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll of these have factors have a combined\n impact on\n the association’\ns bottom line, and ultimately our capacity to do other things. We have built a financial model to forecast the impact of welfare reform (including under-occupation penalty and the roll out of Universal Credit) on ou\nr income and expenditure\n, primarily throu\ngh \nlost income (expressed as\n void rent loss and bad debt\n)\n and\n increased\n cash col\nlection costs. Given the evidenc\ne we have\n to date\n, we forecast that \nin the worst case, \nthe annual bottom line i\nmpact is likely to be £22m over 5 years\n. This will have a \nsignificant impact on our capacity to invest in other\n priority\n activities\n, such as the provision of new homes\n.\n Expressed in lost development capacity, we estimate that the forecast annual net loss of around £4.3m, translates into over 500 new homes foregone. &#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are doing what we can to support\n tenants\n,\n \nand\n our 12-strong money advice tea\nm is bringing some benefits. On the basis of current experience, we project that o\nver the year we may help tenants affected by the u\nnder-occupation penalty secure\n a\nround \n£500,000 of extra income through discretionary housing payments and the maximisation of other benefits. From the beginning of March 2013 to the end of July we had successfully helped just under 300 tenants secure D\niscretionary Housing Payments, totalling\n n\nearly £49,000.\n However the majo\nrity of payments are short term,\n and will not necessarily be repeated. In addition\n Riverside’s employment \nsupport and \naffordable warmth programme\ns\n are\n helping \nboost the earning potential and disposable income of our tenants a\nnd residents. \nHowever\n, despite\n this positi\nve activity\n,\n the net benefit to customers\n are\n dwarfed by the massive £4.53m our tenants will lo\nse in housing benefit as a result of the under-occupation penalty alone.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst landlord support \nis a really important\n element in\n helping tenants make the transition in the wake of welfare reform, in itself it is not the answer.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn addition to monitoring\n the operation\nal\n i\nmpact of welfare reform, we are undertaking\n a number of \nrelated \nresearch projects. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n \nhave conducted a sample\n survey\n of tenants\n, \nto explore\n mon\ney management, \nfinancial skills and \nspending habits in the lead up to the introduction of\n \nUC\n. \nThe findings are alarming, \nand \nsuggest that many\n of our\n tenants \nwill\n not have the capacity to handle a\n welfare\n system based on on-line claims \nand monthly direct payments \nwithout significant support\n. \nIn particular:\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlmost half \nof Riverside tenants have \nno access to the in\nternet\n, however \n49% of tenant\ns currently in receipt of housing benefit would\n not feel \ncomfortable making \nan on-line\n \nclaim\n,\n even with support –\n including 31% of those who already have access to the internet via their own\n computer\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nlthough most\n tenants (84%)\n have bank accounts\n,\n t\nhe\n majority (74\n%)\n still like to manage their money through cash\n,\n \nwith only 25% paying their rent through direct debit or a stand\ning order, and nearly 50% retaining\n pre-paid utility meters, despite higher tariffs.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nIn this context the Government’s ambition to roll out a successful ‘digital by default’ approach\n to UC\n, wi\nthout the need for \nunsustainable\n levels of support and\n arrangements for\n exceptions, seems extremely ambitious.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn a separate piece of research, we are \ncurrently \nassessing \nthe likely level of savings\n (to Government)\n generated \nby the under-occupation \npenalty, working with 3 other\n social\n landlords - \n Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and\n Wigan and Leigh\n Housing\n -\n \nwith support from\n the\n Centre for Housing Policy (University of York)\n. \nUsing the DWP’s own savings\n impact\n model, and \nre-\nrunning it with data drawn from ‘\nreal’ experience\n across the four organisations\n since April,\n our\n i\nnitial findings indicate\n that the level of \nsavings\n projected by DWP\n are l\nikely to have been overstated to a significant extent, and\n possibly by as much as a third\n. Despite\n savings\n generation\n \nbeing one of the Government’s key objectives for the policy, and central to Parliamentary debates during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, our study\n confirms\n the DWP’s own assessment that\n \n“uncertainty about likely claimant and landlord responses to t\nhe introduction of the social sector size criteria [which] creates uncertainty about the benefit saving likely to be realised” \n(DWP 2012 p13).\n \nOur\n work\n also\n highlights significant deficiencies in the design of the model which are likely to have further ove\nrstated the level of savings generated through the implementation of the under-occupation penalty.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTh\nis research compliments \nwork being undertaken by the National Housing Federation\n, \nconsidering\n the\n indirect \ncosts \nwhich \nshould be taken into account in an overall assessment of the \nfinancial impact of the \npolicy. These include potential extra net costs to tenants, landlords, local author\nities and the voluntary sector\n, \nincluding:\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe £65\nm increase in\n the\n Discretionary Housi\nng Payment\ns budget \nalrea\ndy set aside for 2013/14 – these \nshould be netted off ‘claimed’ savings immediately\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe additional costs of fitting aids and adaptations for disabled tenants who chose to move\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe significant additional costs to housing associatio\nns facing rising rent arrears, re-let times, rent collection and tenant support costs, and in particular the impact on lost development capacity at a time when Government is trying to drive increased \nhousing \nsupply\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditional indirect costs to other publi\nc services coping with the knock-on consequences of tenants moving or accumulating debt, for example homelessness, health and social services and advisory services.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nWhilst it is difficult to quantify these \nadditional \ncosts with\n \naccuracy, taken together with the reduced savings \ndiscussed \nin 3.4 \nabove, we believe there is a powerful case for \nfurther\n scrutiny of the \nDWP’s \n£93\n0\nm two year savings\n estimate, which has\n b\neen presented as \none of the central objectives of this policy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe \nsupport the overall\n need to \nreform\n the welfare benefit system to be fairer, encour\nage more people into work and take\n responsibility\n for\n managing\n their money.\n&#xa0;However we bel\nieve that\n significant challenges are emerging which will mean\n that it is difficult for the Government to meet its wider\n welfare and housing objectives. We\n urge \nthe Select Committee\n to consider the following \npractical \nchanges\n:\n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChange the size criteria for social housing, allowing one extra bedroom –We recognise t\nhere is a need to free up properties to tackle the urgent issue of overcrowding\n in social housing\n. H\nowever\n,\n the response needs to be proportionate, and\n Government figures on overcrowding and under-occupation \n(through \nDCLG’s \nlatest English Housing Survey) \ns\nhow\n that this objective could be met by\n changing the definition of under-occupation\n (for the purpose of calculating housing benefit/UC)\n to allow\n one extra bedroom.\n \nThis would br\ning the DWP definition close to \nthe definition used by DCLG and the \nsocial housing \nsector for many years. It would help claimants living in social housing to thrive, supporting payment for modest additional space to allow separate bedrooms for teenage children to study, couples who face illness and disability and separated\n parents with access to children. It would reduce the numbers facin\ng reduced benefi\nt by 75%, and focus\n on dealing with ‘problematic’ levels of under-occupation. It would also give landlords the capacity to deal with the significant numbers of elderly tenan\nts (exempt from the penalty) who are under-occupying their homes and wish to move. A \nrevised definition \nwo\nuld \nreduce the need to rely on inconsistently delivered discretionary assistance (DHP)\n, reduce the risk of tribunal challenge\n and \nend the need for an \never growing list of \nexemptions. It would introduce a standard which reflects the way low income households live in the 21\nst\n century.\n Furthermore, our research suggests that such a change may not result in the loss of savings an\nticipated by Government, and\n that\n the basis \nfor the savings already claimed\n requires urgent re-examination\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGive tenants choice about how to manage their benefit by developing an on-line portal, empowering claimants to manage their UC payments ‘at source’ similar to on-line banking. Given the results of our recent \ntenant \nsu\nr\nvey, and evidence emerging from\n the direct payment demonstration projects, \nwe are very concerned abo\nut the extent\n of support that will be required to enable tenants to manage\n UC\n, and in particular the direct \npayment of the housing cost element\n.\n We fear that the sheer volume of claimants seeking payment exceptions, or being forced into ‘switchback’ arrangements because of accumulating arrears, will overwhelm the administration of UC.\n \nWe recommend that\n tenants\n a\nre given\n real choice \nand appropriate tools \nto\n manage their housing payments under UC\n, which reflect the way in which low income households manage money\n. W\ne\n \nstrongly\n commend the ‘Budgeting Portal’ \nproposal \nmade\n by the Social Market Foundation\n, which would \nsit alongs\nide the normal claims process under\n Universal Credit.\n The portal \nwould enable claimants to manage their Universal Credit ‘at source’\n through an online tool\n, and direct regular electronic payments to their landlord, child-care provider etc. withou\nt the need for the development of\n new, expensive banking products.\n It \nwould enable financial ownership and responsibility by claimants, whilst giving landlords increased rent certainty\n and a real incentive to support tenants develop their financial capacit\ny and digital skills.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGive clarity about the position of vulnerable tenants living in supported housing under Universal Credit. Despite encouraging\n comments from Ministers, there is still uncertainty\n about the way in which housing cost support\n for vulnerable tenants living in supported housing will be dealt with following the introduction of UC. In particular urgent \nclarity\n is required\n on the definition of ‘exempt accommodation’ to ensure that\n support for\n all legitimate suppor\nted housing tenanc\nies can be\n dealt with outside UC (for not-for-profit providers)\n, including \ncases where \nsupport \nservices are delivered by a third party\n. \nThere also needs to be consultation on the detail\ns\n of any\n proposed options\n for\n the\n \nlocalisation of \nsupport for housing c\nosts\n, ensuring it is based on a system of entitlement, rathe\nr than subject to\n the whim of local political priorities.\n \nThis would provide greater protection for vulnerable households, and certainty for providers seeking to invest in much needed existing and\n new \nhousing support \nservices.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n In the report: \nSink or Swim?
