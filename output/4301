defaultWritten defaultSubmission defaultfrom GM Freezedefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default1. GM Freeze is submitting the following to the discussion on “
defaultThe potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to
default UK food security”.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault2. 
defaultGM Freeze believes that the bias in UK policy towards GM technology is actuall
defaulty dangerous to UK food security
default because it is leading the UK to neglec
defaultt the fundamental issues that underpin robust 
defaultfood security
default including
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. 
defaultEmpha
defaultsising knowledge-based systems, 
defaultthe application of appropriate technologies
default and the enforcement of strong regulations are the answer to these weaknesses.
default&#xa0;
defaultGM Freezedefault4. 
defaultGM Freeze is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee originally established as the Five Year Freeze in 1999 to achieve and maintain a national moratorium on:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default5. The alliance of organisations that forms 
defaultGM Freeze seeks to give expression to the public’s deep concern about the pressure to introduce genetic modification in food and farming. The aim is to inform
default the public, media and politicians accurately about GM organisms, especially crops, their impacts and to encourage public participation in making decisions about them.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultThe GM Freeze has produced many briefings and reports on issues connected with GM, f
defaultor example most recently:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7. 
defaultIt has also 
defaultresponded to 
defaultmany consultations
default in the US and EU, 
defaultand
default has produced 
defaultmany news releases
default on a wide variety of subjects.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe failure of GM defaulttechnology to contribute to food securitydefault8. 
defaultGM Freeze has particularly highlighted the failure of GM research to produce viable answers
default or 
defaultuseful products after many years of promising them. 
defaultWe note, however, that we and many other progressive organisatio
defaultns around the world have moved beyond the limitations of the “food security” concept and instead work with a food sovereignty model. We urge the EFRA committee to do the same.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9. The
default endless promises
default of the GM industry
default have helped to draw the UK down the
default path of GM technologies and have at the same time led the UK to neg
defaultlect the many alternatives to GM, suc
defaulth as strategies to deal with pests through border planting to a
defaultttract predators, intercropping
default and working with farmers to conventionally breed or reco
defaultver old varieties of seed that is drought and salt tolerant. 
default&#xa0;
default10. Furthermore
default current GM crops are now beginning to fail, with 
defaultthe emergence of 
defaultserious problems 
defaultincluding
default resistant weeds
default and insects
default and massively i
defaultncreased use of pesticides. GM crops
default reveal a clear pattern: initially they seem to save work and reduce applications of toxins
default, but this does not last. GM crops
default 
defaultlead
default to worse problems than 
defaultthe ones they claim to alleviate
default, whereas many of the alternatives are already tried and tested over m
defaultany years. 
default&#xa0;
default11. 
defaultFinally
default, and perhaps most importantly, emerging scientific
default evidence 
defaultshow
defaults that European GM-free farming performs better than GM farming in United States.
default&#xa0;
default12. GM Freeze therefore does not believe that GM can or will contribute positively to UK food security. 
defaultWe 
defaultnote that the President of the European Natural Soyfood Manufacturers Association recently called for better consumer information on GM foods, potent
defaultially using GM-free labels across the food industry, saying, “Current EU policy does not sufficiently support the cultivation of GMO-free soy products, despite a clear demand for GMO-free food by the consumer.” This move acknowledges the considerable publi
defaultc resistance to 
defaultGM food, which is a clear
default barrier to GM playing any meaningful role in UK food security.
default&#xa0;
defaultEFRAdefault appears to conflate science with GMdefault13. The GM issue as stated by
default th
defaultis
default EFRA consultation itself appears to conflate science with GM technology. 
defaultGM Freeze believes that this is problematic. There are plenty of essential areas for the application of science for UK food security that do not involve GM. These include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1
default4. 
defaultWe have suffered for years from declining nutrient levels in our soils and our food. UK food security needs to be built up from the base of healthy soils
default, through healthy seeds, plants and animals in order to help ensure
default a healthy population. 
defaultHowever it
default appears that the UK G
defaultovernment does not believe that agroecological approaches to food security are worth pursuing
default,
default and we wonder if this is because they are less likely to attract patents and are therefore less interesting to business.
default&#xa0;
default“Potential” value of GM defaulttechnology to UK food securitydefault15. 
defaultWe have been told since the 1990s that GM technology was the future for agriculture. We are constantly promised new GM crops for drought resista
defaultnce and salt tolerance. However
default these are still promi
defaultses unfulfilled
default,
default and this does not surprise us because drought resistance and salt tolerance are complex issues involving multiple genes whose functions and interactions we do not yet fully understand. 
default&#xa0;
default16. We believe t
defaulthese 
defaultunfulfilled 
defaultpromises for future
default 
defaultGM “solutions”
default are used to draw research down the costly
default, risky path of GM, so neglect
default other approaches that are far more likely to yield results. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) default1
default7. Fifty-seven
default government
defaults approved the summaries of the IAASTD
default report in a final plenary in Johannesburg on 12
default 
defaultApril 2008, with the UK approving them two months later on 9
default 
defaultJune 2008
default1
default. 
defaultWe are glad to note that DFID contributed over £500,000 to the 
defaultAssessment. Immediately before the Plenary, DFID and DEFRA issued a joint press statement which endorsed the IAASTD process:
default&#xa0;
default“The IAASTD is a unique assessment involving governments, civil society and academics. The IAASTD reports are a very valuable and 
defaultimportant contribution to the debate and understanding on agricultural knowledge, science and technology and its potential to reduce poverty and hunger around the world.”
default&#xa0;
default18. However the UK G
defaultovernment has since neglected the recommendations of this landma
defaultrk report, which states:
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe purpose of IAASTD is to assess agricultural knowledge, science and technology (AKST) in order to use AKST more effectively to reduce hunger and poverty, improve rural livelihoods, and facilitate equitable, environmentally, 
defaultsocially and economically sustainable development.
default”
default&#xa0;
default19. 
defaultThe 
defaultIAASTD 
defaultGlobal Synthesis for decision makers
default 
defaultsets out 22 key findings, which w
defaulte recommend highly to the EFRA C
defaultommittee as a sound basis for deliberations. Important here is that IAASTD did not end
defaultorse GM crops as a solution
default to food insecurity
default: 
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe application of modern biotechnology outside containment, such as the use of genetically modified (GM) crops is muc
defaulth more contentious. For example
default data based on some years and some GM crops indicate hig
defaulthly variable 10-33% yield gains in some places and yield declines in 
defaultothers.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThese are not the only problems emerging from GM cultivation.
default&#xa0;
defaultExisting problems with GM cropsdefault20. 
defaultIn addition
default to the yield variability noted in the IAASTD report
default, we now see 
defaultgrowing
default problems with current GM crops. Commercialised GM crops
default basically consist of herbicide tolerant 
default(HT) 
defaultcrops in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and the US and insecticide expressing crops such as GM cotton
default planted in India, 
defaultChina
default and parts of Af
defaultrica
default. 
default&#xa0;
default21. 
defaultInstead of reducing levels of herbicide applied
default as promised
default,
default chemical
default 
defaultusage is
default increasing
default in GM HT crops
default,
default and more recently
default even with the insecticide expressing crops.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultindustry 
defaultresponse
default is
default to offer 
defaultnew GM 
defaultcrops that are 
default“
defaultstacked
default”
default with gene
defaults supposedly conferring tolerance to multiple herbicides or expressing different versions of insecticidal Bt genes. This is a pesticide treadmill that should be avoided at all costs. 
default&#xa0;
default22. 
defaultThere are also 
defaultwell-documented 
defaultnegative social and environmental im
defaultpacts 
defaultof GM cultivation,
default which include impacts on the health of local populations 
defaulti
defaultn countries where local people are exposed to spraying
default (eg, in
default Argentina
default, Brazil and Paraguay
default).
default 
default&#xa0;
default23. 
defaultNow we are being promised GM crops with increased nutritional elements, the most famous of which is 
default“
defaultgolden
default”
default rice. Here again a little investigation reveals that there are many sound alternatives to the use of genetic modification to produce crops with inc
defaultreased levels of nutrients
default, many of which could contribute significantly to local food sovereignty
default.
default&#xa0;
default24. 
defaultWe therefore do not believe that GM technology has anything to contribute to UK food security. We are weary of the constant claims 
defaultmade 
defaultfor GM technolo
defaultgy
default,
default and would request that those making them are challenge
defaultd to justify them. For example Secretary of State 
defaultOwen Paterson said on 20 June 2013:
default&#xa0;
default“Used properly
default the advanced plant-breeding technique of GM promises effective ways to protect or increase crop yields. It can also combat the damaging effects of unpredictable weather and disease on crops. It has the potential to reduce fertiliser and chemical use, impr
defaultove the efficiency of agricultural production 
defaultand reduce post-harvest losses.”
default&#xa0;
default25. GM Freeze asks where the evidence is that
default 
defaultGM increases yields.
default No GM crop has been bred for that purpose
default. Instead GM Freeze notes:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe rest of this consultation responsedefault26. 
defaultBelow we set out some of our previous work that relates to this consultation. 
defaultWe begin with the UK Agri-tech S
defaulttrategy, which demonstrates the sa
defaultme 
defaulttechno-fix 
defaultbias towards GM crops and foods that we
default note
default above. We then discuss the Red Tape Challenge and finish with issues around animal feed.
default&#xa0;
defaultTdefaulthe defaultGovernment’s Agri-tech strategydefault27. GM Freeze was clear that i
defaultn
default our
default 
defaultview the success of any UK Agri-tec
defaulth Strategy depends on how it meets the real needs of people and the environment, rather than how well it just serves i
defaultndustry
default.default&#xa0;
default28. 
defaultModern intensive farming systems have failed to produce a balanced diet for everyone but have polluted our air and water, 
defaultdegraded soils and produced huge losses of biodiversity. The strategy needs to improve on this and come up with the best, most sustainable approaches drawing on knowledge-based systems, the application of appropriate technologies and the socio-economic and
default political reforms needed to get food to hungry people without excessive wastage or food miles.
default&#xa0;
default29. 
defaultGM crops fail to meet these basic requirements because their existence is based on an attempt to patent and 
defaultcontrol seeds. This meets the “need”
default of compani
defaultes to achieve repeat seed sales, but it does not further the cause of sustainable food production – as is shown by the rapid rise in weeds resistant to the chemicals used on GM crops and the subsequent rise in herbicide use and damage to species like the M
defaultonarch butterfly
default.
default&#xa0;
default30. In our response to the BIS consultation “
defaultShaping a UK Agri-tech Strategy
default”
default 
defaultGM Freeze r
defaultecommended re-issuing the Agri-t
defaultech consultation because
default:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default31. 
defaultWe fear that this consultation may be flawed in the same way, as the questions
default and topics
default do not address what we consider to be the fundamental issues around food security in the UK. These relate, for example, to
default:
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default32. W
defaulte are confining ourselves here to
default addressing the issue of
default GM
default,
default and 
defaultwill leave it to others to elaborate on
default these other vital issues.
default33. 
defaultGM Freeze responded
default to the Cabinet Office
default consultation on its
default 
default“
defaultRed Tape Challenge
default”
default, 
defaultfocusing on GMOs.
default We
default emphasized that regulation is
default 
defaultnot
default re
defaultd tape
default,
default and that defining it as such must not be used as a pretext to water down essential regulation.
default 
defaultRegulation, with associated “red tape”, plays a key role in protecting health, the environment and making society fairer. It could also be argued that the state
default of the econom
defaulty is, in part, due to the under
defaultregulation and the unregulated behaviour of companies and individuals within the financial sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe Red Tape Cha
defaultllenge ignores the crucial role
default regulation plays in protecting the health and welfare of future generations and the planet. Lack of regulation causes huge problems for future generations (and other species) who derived no benefit from the past use of poorly regulated technology, product
defaults or practices (eg, the impacts halocarbons on the ozone layer, the role of asbestos in lung disease, the BSE crisis and long-term ecological damage due to commercial activity such as the decline of fish stocks).
default&#xa0;
default34. 
defaultGM Freeze believes “red tape” is an un
defaulthelpful term
default,
default which is poorly defined and can mean different things to different audiences. What are required are procedures to enforce regulations correctly, effectively and efficiently in order to achieve their objectives.
default&#xa0;
default35. 
defaultGM Freeze is concerned tha
defaultt the attempt to conflate regulation with red tape will be used to confuse the public and facilitate bad practice. Fundamental to this is the precautionary principle,
default 
defaultwhich applies to all EU environmental legislation. Failure to apply the Precautionary Pri
defaultnciple can transfer the burden of the risk of a new technology, technique or product from the developer/permit holder to the citizens and environment. The potential harm caused by authorising a harmful product or technology could result in costs that far o
defaultutweigh any economic benefits derived from the product or technique. In such situations the costs would be borne by people affected, the environment and taxpayers (eg, the National Health Service treating illness caused by the technology or the loss or sev
defaultere reductions in populations of affected species). Gaps in data and scientific uncertainty should trigger the use of the Precautionary Principle
default,
default and no approval should be made until these deficiencies have been satisfactorily resolved. The use of Post Ma
defaultrket Monitoring conducted by consent holders should not be used as a way to avoid thorough risk assessment before approval is made.
default&#xa0;
default36. Finally
default it is clear that attempts to denigrate regulation as red tape serves the interests of the companies that have b
defaulteen trying to introduce GM
default crops to the EU for many years
default but have found their progress blocked. Now we see that these crops are failing where they have been grown. This is all the more reason not to adopt them, but rather to be thankful for the clear demo
defaultnstration that 
defaultthese are short-term “solutions”
default with negative long-term impacts.
default&#xa0;
defaultNo evidence that public consultations have ever influenced policy in this areadefault37. 
defaultGM Freeze
default noted in its response to the Agri-tech strategy consultation, as we believe it still holds,
default that:
