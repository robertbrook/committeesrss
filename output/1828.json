"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from UNISON (LPG 27)&#xa0;About UNISON&#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUNISON is the UK’s largest public services union representing over three quarters of a million members working in local government – both directly for councils and for private, community and voluntary sector service providers. We have extensive experience of dealing with local government procurement practice, including the contracting out of our members’ jobs to external providers. We also have a long track record of championing high quality, accountable services for local citizens. We therefore welcome the opportunity to respond to this inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission focuses in particular on the following questions:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOur policy recommendations are set out in Appendix 1.&#xa0;Transparency, accountability and audit&#xa0;Statutory requirements&#xa0;3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the most basic conditions for transparency is that the statutory requirements governing procurement decisions are adhered to. UNISON is therefore increasingly concerned about councils failing to comply and/or circumventing procurement regulations – as the following examples illustrate:  \n&#xa0;Barnet Council \nAuditors for Barnet Council revealed in June 2011 that the Council had paid more than £1m to a private security contractor without undertaking a procurement exercise and without any form of written contract, or record of contract approval. \n&#xa0;Lancashire County CouncilThe Leader of the Council alone took a decision to award fleet services worth £4.6m, without a procurement exercise, to a joint venture company the council had set up with BT. This was despite a report advising that this decision risked a legal challenge because the procurement notice that covered the establishment of the joint venture did not include fleet services.\n&#xa0;\nThe decision was subsequently reversed following a challenge and a procurement exercise conducted.\n&#xa0;Further details on both these examples can be found in Appendix 2. &#xa0;Transparency&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll too often multi-year contracts involving millions of pounds of public money are agreed by local authorities without any public examination of the commitments that are being entered into and the implications for the local taxpayer. The use of ‘exempt information’ provisions ensures that critical information is often kept hidden from the public gaze. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the case of Somerset Council and the ill-fated South West One strategic partnership no meaningful information was shared with UNISON and other relevant trade unions despite our clear stakeholder interest as representatives of the affected employees, and despite the fact that we signed a confidentiality agreement. There was little meaningful opportunity for public scrutiny of key documents despite the scale and complexity of the proposed partnership. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven when councils have been more open and given access to key documents to stakeholders, UNISON is concerned that this does not ensure that the decision-making process is capable of being influenced and altered.  In Bournemouth key documents were shared with the local trade unions – a level of disclosure that is the exception rather than the rule in our experience. However it soon became clear that there was a pre-determined outcome:\n&#xa0;\nBournemouth Borough CouncilThe full business case and associated documents for the strategic partnership with \nMouchel\n were shared with the local trade unions to allow them to obtain expert advice and because a transfer of staff to the company was proposed. The council undertook to report the trade unions’ comments to Council members. \n&#xa0;\nIn October 2011 the Chief Accountant and Deputy S151 officer, Stephen Parker, emailed all Councillors before a crucial meeting to warn them of his concerns about the risks of expanding the council’s links with \nMouchel\n.\n&#xa0;\nAccording to press reports he told Councillors he had been unable to communicate his concerns as part of the report and accompanying papers going before cabinet, saying \n“I have been placed in a very difficult position – I have a professional duty to ensure my concerns are considered prior to a formal council decision.”\n&#xa0;\nHe was also reported to have said:\n “The cabinet report does not provide an adequate assessment of risks or deliver an independent and robust evaluation of the two options considered.”\n \n&#xa0;\nFollowing the email he was immediately suspended. According to a local UNISON representative this was reflective of a culture in which decisions were not open to challenge: \n“Basically I was told (off the record) that even if you fervently disagreed with a decision, if the Executive Management Team make it you've got to go along with it even if it may be wrong.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Council governance and democratic accountability&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe introduction of Elected Mayors, Cabinet and Leader models and the delegation of decision making now also mean that these decisions are often made by a single councillor or a small handful of councillors.  Other councillors who may have had no training in the examination of procurement decisions or experience of examining proposals are often only provided with very limited information and, as a consequence, may find it difficult to establish whether the proposals are in the fiduciary interests of local taxpayers – a duty placed on them by Parliament.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOften, the scrutiny function is either too weak, too under resourced, or provided with insufficient information to adequately ensure that these major procurement decisions are properly examined. \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEven when Overview and Scrutiny committees examine proposed arrangements, raise concerns, call for a change of direction and have those views endorsed by the full Council, the current arrangements allow for those decisions to be overridden as the following example from Cornwall illustrates:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCornwall County Council&#xa0;\nA ‘Support Services Single Issue Panel’ was established to examine the proposed Strategic Partnership with BT, however:\n&#xa0;\n“In previous reports the frustration of the Panel in having insufficient time to deal with these aspects of the proposals has been adequately voiced, but it must be said again that the distinctiveness of the negotiations via the competitive dialogue and the subsequent withdrawal of one of the bidders has put us in a situation where both information and decisions have been made (or not made) which have prevented us from being in possession of important information at the time of writing this report.”\n&#xa0;\nA motion to Cornwall Council on 4 September 2012 resulted in a resolution that:\n&#xa0;\n“In view of its far reaching consequences, including its potential impact on Council governance and elected Member accountability, this Council believes that it is not in the best interests of the people of Cornwall for the Council to enter into the proposed Strategic Partnership for Support Services and procurement”\n&#xa0;\nMembers were advised that although the motion was valid and the Council could express its view, entering into the Strategic Partnership was ultimately a Cabinet decision. And despite the Council resolution the Cabinet decided to proceed to  issue invitations for final tenders, to be approved on a date to be determined by the Chief Executive in consultation with the Leader and relevant Portfolio Holders.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Weakness of external audit&#xa0;\n10.\n \nUNISON is concerned that external audit of council procurement decisions and expenditure is weak and that there is an absence of effective mechanisms to review external audit inadequacies. \n&#xa0;\n11.\n \nIn this submission we highlight some of the growing number of ‘procurement failures’. However there do not appear to be any examples where external audit has prevented a procurement failure. External audit only appears to identify a problem ‘after the event’ and even then a ‘light touch’ approach appears to be the modus operandi. \n&#xa0;12.\n \nThe Audit Commission is being disbanded and external audit for councils in England now rests in the hands of ‘self-regulating’ accountancy firms – many of the same firms which have been \ncriticised\n by the Public Accounts Committee for their activities in helping corporate clients dodge taxes. Furthermore, many of these companies have ‘arms’ which also bid for council contracts and it is not clear how impermeable the wall\ns between them are. \n&#xa0;\nValue for money&#xa0;Major contract failure and procurement models that create additional risk&#xa0;\n13.\n \nRecent trends in public sector procurement place reliance on bidders to work out the detail of service design and delivery and calculate the costs – variously referred to as ‘outcomes-based commissioning’, ‘enabling’, ‘thin client’, ‘intelligent client’ and ‘light client’.  Andy \nMudd\n from the Association of Public Service Excellence (APSE) has highlighted how the risks and complexity of working out the necessary ‘inputs’ are increasingly being left to the bidders.\n  In theory this is supposed to ensure that failure risks are transferred to the bidders and client side costs are reduced to a minimum. It is supposed to free providers from detailed input specifications so that they can identify for themselves the most cost- effective way of delivering the required end result.  On the other hand contracting authorities are supposed to no longer need to employ their own experts and can therefore reduce the cost of both letting and managing contracts.   \n&#xa0;\n14.\n \nHowever, the assumption that the more decisions about how to deliver a contract are left up to the contractor, the more likely they are to be able to optimise cost and deliver savings, is flawed. Recent examples West Coast Main Line (Department for Transport), G4S (LOCOG) and allegations of fraud by the Ministry of Justice against SERCO and G4S cast serious doubt on the likelihood that this form of commissioning can deliver best value or transfer risk. Risk transfer is frequently illusory. And it relies on the assumption that bidders will always make commercially sensible judgements that will not over-expose them to demand and other risks.  \n&#xa0;\n15.\n \nMultiple failures amongst local government contractors, such as Connaught, Southern Cross, Transform Sandwell, Impact (Rochdale and \nMouchel\n) and Southwest One, demonstrate how the commercial failings of contractors rebounds very quickly and expensively, on public bodies.  \n&#xa0;\n16.\n \nThe Institute for Government recently concluded that private contractors are prone to ‘gaming’, that is responding in undesirable ways to the reward structures commissioners have created. It also found: “\nreluctance to force underperforming public, private and voluntary sector providers out of these markets in service provision – partly as a result of a lack of confidence that government can manage transitions between different service providers without causing excessive disruptions to service users.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The costs of procurement&#xa0;\n17.\n \nThe costs associated with complex procurement are very significant. UNISON is concerned that they often involve substantial expenditure on ‘consultants’ rather than using the expertise of councils’ own staff, unions and service users. For example three district councils in Lincolnshire spent almost a quarter of a million pounds on consultants advising on the privatisation of ‘back office’ services. A report commissioned by UNISON for approximately 1% of the cost exposed the weaknesses in the consultants’ report and enabled the local authorities to pursue a better course of action. \n&#xa0;\nPower imbalance&#xa0;\n18.\n \n UNISON is concerned about the number of instances where the balance of power within complex arrangements is inappropriately weighted towards the private sector and against the public interest. During the last two years there have been several instances where the difficulties local authorities can experience in exiting or amending complex contracting arrangements have become apparent. A combination of factors – including loss of in-house capacity, the development of ‘company towns’ (where the local economy becomes excessively reliant on the contractor’s presence), and the threat of legal action by contractors – has created the sense that some local authority contracts have become ‘too big to fail.’\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLiverpool City Council and BTLiverpool City Council entered into a strategic partnership with BT called Liverpool Direct Limited. The contract included a ‘break clause’ that had to be activated by March 2011. In 2010 an internal audit report identified significant concerns about the operation of the joint venture including the claim that BT were overcharging the council by £10m a year on the contract. The report also identified a ‘complete lack of transparency’ around promised BT investment into the company; excessive mark up on the cost of equipment; concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of governance arrangements; and activities  within the scope of the contract being charged as ‘extras’. The report triggered active consideration of the break clause. BT responded by suggesting that legal action might be pursued. \n&#xa0;\nFollowing negotiations the final outcome was that Liverpool City Council did not exercise the right to give notice of termination available to it in the contract thereby allowing the contract to continue until 2017. The package of proposals agreed to address the audit report findings included: \n“the ‘write off’ by BT of potential legal claims against Liverpool City Council (estimated by BT at £56m) - the writing off of these claims removes an element of financial uncertainty and the possibility of litigation from the City Council.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n19.\n \nThe spectacle of public funds being used by councils in litigation and/or settlement costs over contract performance wrangles rightly causes public dismay – especially at a time of drastic cuts to local services\n. \n&#xa0;\nSouth West One and Somerset CouncilIn 2012, Southwest One (in which IBM holds a 70% equity stake and Somerset County Council holds a 15% equity stake) initiated a £25m legal action against Somerset County Council. In March 2013 Somerset County Council was reported to have settled the case out of court at a cost to it of £5.9m. The council is reported to have paid £3m for Southwest One services and a further £2m in legal fees. £800,000 was spent on bringing staff who were out-sourced back in-house. The decision to settle has to be seen in the context of Council Leader John \nOsman’s\n view that the council could have been faced with a £40m bill if they lost the court battle.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nValue for money through insourcing&#xa0;20.\n \nThe contract failings outlined in this submission have led a growing number of local authorities to take the decision to bring privatised services back in-house.\n&#xa0;\n21.\n \nA study\n for UNISON carried out by APSE found that o\nut of 140 survey respondents, 57% had either brought a service back in-house, were in the\nprocess of \ninsourcing\n or were considering doing so. A need to improve efficiency and reduce service costs was the most frequent key reason for \ninsourcing\n with almost 60% of respondents citing it. After cost, 44% of respondents said a need to improve service quality was critical to the decision to \ninsource\n. The research found that councils of all sizes, locations and political complexions were represented among those deciding to \ninsource\n. \nInsourcing\n was regarded as a means of delivering efficiency savings in the face of mounting budgetary pressure. \n&#xa0;\n22.\n \nAusterity cuts have served to shine a spotlight on long term contracts which up tie large amounts of council spending – forcing cuts to be focused elsewhere. One of the issues identified with the Somerset Council  South West One contract was that council funding cuts had fundamentally undermined the rationale for the contract. Cabinet Member for resources, David \nHuxtable\n, said: \"\nIt was a very complex contract and lots of the savings were predicated on an ever-increasing amount of money being put into public services and we know in the last four years that has gone into reverse.\"\n&#xa0;\n23.\n \nA more recent example of \ninsourcing\n on a large scale looks set to take place following the termination of Sandwell Council’s partnership with BT. The Sandwell case raises questions as to what extent other councils are able to learn from such experiences before entering into similar contracts with BT and other large players in the local government market.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSandwell Council and BTFollowing the early termination of their 15-year £300m ‘partnership’, Sandwell Council and BT are  working on an exit plan under which services are expected to transfer back to the council in March 2014. The contract which was signed in 2007 includes\n&#xa0;\nICT, HR, project management, finance, procurement, and customer service. The council’s ruling cabinet decision to begin the process to end the BT partnership reflected concerns about the impact of spending cuts on the volume of work involved under the contract and the contract fees the council was having to pay. Council Leader Darren Cooper said: “\nThe world of local government has moved on significantly since 2007. We now need a different plan\n.” It is unclear what compensation Sandwell may have to pay to BT but the council appears to have concluded that it can no longer afford the contract.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe importance of contract monitoring and open reporting&#xa0;24.\n \nDecisions to terminate contracts and/or \ninsource\n rely on the council having robust, detailed and sustained contract monitoring which is capable of delivering a comprehensive picture of costs and performance on contracts. This highlights the importance of having the right key performance indicators (KPIs) – not those which contractors can ‘game’ – and ensuring they are properly monitored. It also points to the importance of detailed data, all of which reinforces the dangers of the ‘thin’ or ‘light tough’ client model that we discussed earlier in this submission.\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 3 considers some examples of the pitfalls surrounding KPIs&#xa0;\nCut-price procurement and the effect on quality: the damage in social care &#xa0;\n25.\n \nIt is clear that in some areas of local authority expenditure the twin pressures of rising demand for services and funding cuts have created a drive by councils to secure cost-cutting at the expense of service quality. Nowhere is this more prominent than in social care. UNISON has been at the forefront of campaigning to highlight the \nalarming decline in the quality of care that users receive.\n&#xa0;\n26.\n \nUNISON research based on \nFoI\n data from councils in England, Wales and Scotland found that 81% of councils commission from homecare providers where they do not guarantee providers specific hours from one week to the next. This enables councils to drive down the costs they incur as a result of fluctuations in care need. But it fuels the use of zero hours contracts for homecare workers. As the Minister for Care Norman Lamb has stated: \n“\nThe idea of a zero hours contract is in most circumstances completely incompatible with a model of high quality care in which the individual really gets to know their care worker\n.”\n&#xa0;\n27.\n \nAn increase in the outsourcing of homecare services at ever lower costs has meant that an estimated 150-200,000 care workers are routinely paid less than the National Minimum Wage largely because they are not paid for their travel time.  Providers claim that this is because councils’ commissioning models are based on contact time only and do not cover the full costs of care.  \n&#xa0;\n28.\n \nThe consequences of this cut-price approach by councils in the homecare sector were encapsulated in the recent Government-commissioned Cavendish Review which stated that:\n&#xa0;\n“\nIt will not be possible to build a sustainable, caring, integrated health and social care system on the backs of domiciliary care workers who have to travel long distances on zero hours contracts, to reach people who have to see multiple different faces each week... The advent of zero hours contracts, fee cuts and no payment for travel time is making it financially prohibitive for some domiciliary care workers to struggle on. Attrition rates are already dangerously high: and they will only increase when carers feel that they can no longer even give good care.”\n&#xa0;\n29.\n \nThese developments in homecare have led UNISON to establish our T\nime to Care \ncampaign which asks councils to sign up to an ‘ethical care charter’ to commission homecare in line with a core set of baseline standards including non-use of 15-minute visits, ensuring payment of travel time, non-use of zero hours contracts and proper training and support for staff to raise concerns about care standards.\n \n&#xa0;\n30.\n \n A growing number of councils are recognising that the quality and reliability of privatised homecare has become unacceptable. In this and in other sectors of care such as learning disability and independent living, UNISON has identified a trend of councils attempting to establish social care companies as an alternative means of service delivery. In a number of instances these companies have struggled to maintain quality and deliver cost reductions, and have been either forced into liquidation or wound up.\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 4 provides further details on the ethical care charter and examples of difficulties with arms-length social care companies.\n&#xa0;\nProcurement from the community and voluntary sector&#xa0;31.\n \nUNISON represents more than 60,000 members working in the community and voluntary sector – a large proportion of whom work in services commissioned by local government.\n&#xa0;\n32.\n \nUNISON is seeing a rise in consortia bidding for contracts instead of just individual charities. However, these are large and expensive exercises to engage in, and often a large private contractor will be the principle bidder while work flowing to the charities will be sub-contracted.\n&#xa0;\n This has led to the phenomenon of the profitable work being creamed off by the contractor and charities left to deliver  services at bargain basement prices, which are sometimes loss making.\n&#xa0;\n It also means charities having to squeeze down even further on the pay and terms and conditions of staff, and increasingly using zero-hour contracts.\n&#xa0;\n33.\n \nContracts with voluntary sector providers sometimes do not include ‘full cost recovery’ and there is insufficient allowance for the costs of back office support services – with an often tacit assumption that these can be borne by the organisation’s fund-raising activities.\n&#xa0;\n In some cases, commissioners have cut the price of a contract mid-contract, causing huge disruption.\n&#xa0;\n The private sector would walk away, but charities tend to work in just one area and commissioners can take advantage of the reputational damage they would suffer if they did this. \n&#xa0;\n34.\n \nGenerally, funding is getting so tight that additional services that charities provided from any surplus are being cut back or abolished, which has a knock-on effect on local communities.\n&#xa0;\n Grant funding for community and voluntary organisations needs to be revisited as a viable alternative to procurement.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 1: UNISON recommendations&#xa0;35.\n \nBased on UNISON’s experiences of local government procurement we have identified a number of reforms which we believe are necessary to improve accountability and value for money.\n&#xa0;\na)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to strengthen transparency&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nb)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to strengthen audit and scrutiny functions&#xa0;c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWider scope to challenge procurement decisions &#xa0;d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to strengthen accountability: a right to recall&#xa0;e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to ensure Best Value &#xa0;f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to share lessons learned from failed contracts in local government&#xa0;g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to consider insourcing&#xa0;h)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need to maximise employee and user involvement&#xa0;i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSafeguarding quality and social responsibility in procurement&#xa0;Appendix 2: Non-compliance with procurement obligations&#xa0;Barnet Council/MetPro &#xa0;\nBarnet Council’s Audit Committee produced a report on \n£1,361,000 worth of payments to private security contractor \nMetPro\n Rapid Response which highlighted much wider failings in the council’s processes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe committee concluded that:\n&#xa0;\n“\nIn the absence of a formal procurement exercise, we could not locate the following documents/confirmation for \nMetPro\n, which the CPR require:\n&#xa0;\nThe report concluded:  \n“More importantly, Officers cannot, on the basis of existing procedures, give assurance that this will not happen again, due to the lack of an accurate and complete corporate contract register, and effective monitoring arrangements for contracts during their respective terms.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBarnet Council: Audit Committee 16 June 2011&#xa0;\nLancashire County Council/One Connect Limited&#xa0;\nA report dated 2 August 2012 on Fleet Maintenance submitted to the Leader of Lancashire County Council was classified as ‘exempt information’\n: It was \n“considered that in all the circumstances of the case the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighed the public interest in disclosing the information”\n \n&#xa0;\nLancashire County Council had previously carried out a procurement exercise and appointed BT plc as its strategic partner. This led to the creation of the One Connect Limited joint venture company to provide a range of services to the County Council. The OJEU Notice did not specify Fleet Services as one of the range of services included in the procurement exercise.\n&#xa0;\nThe report advised the Leader:\n“Therefore adding fleet services to the Service Provision Agreement with OCL (One Connect Limited) without undertaking any procurement could if challenged by a third party(s) amount to a direct award of a contract in breach of the regulations.’\n&#xa0;\nThe report then proceeded to discuss the process of a challenge by a third party and the steps that the council might take to remedy the situation and limit damages that it might become liable for.\n&#xa0;\nThe decision to award fleet services work worth £4.61m per annum without a procurement exercise was taken solely by the Leader of the Council. \n&#xa0;The decision was subsequently reversed following a challenge and a procurement exercise conducted.\nAppendix 3: The importance of key performance indicators &#xa0;\nA high level review of the contract published in late 2012 uncovered a number of issues including that SB was effectively able to ‘stop the clock’ when there was a problem with a piece of software. This meant that they were able to remain within their response / fix times for KPIs, even when they were not meeting them. Furthermore, the report found that SB had ‘misreported at least one of the KPIs around call handling in the contact centre’. This could have two significant impacts – first, it may mean that there were additional unforeseen costs incurred as the call volumes were adjusted to accommodate the data. Secondly, it may have meant that ‘erroneous data’ was being used at the time the council was re-negotiating the contract. Depending upon the size of the error in the data, the report suggests that this knowledge may have led ‘the Council may have acted differently in the negotiations and secured a different outcome’.\n&#xa0;\nIn 2010 the Scrutiny Committee decided to investigate the housing repairs service, which was \nrun by two organisations: Southwark Building Services (SBS) (in-house arms length management model) and Morrison Facilities Services (private contractor). \nThe Scrutiny Committee wanted to understand how the Council had been measuring its performance, as anecdotal evidence suggested that problems with the service were not being picked up by its performance data. The KPIs consistently showed a very strong performance for housing repairs with very high levels of satisfaction and almost perfect performance in appointment keeping by repairs staff. As part of the scrutiny inquiry, members of the committee listened to fifty randomly selected recordings of telephone calls from residents to the repairs hotline. They found that many of the calls related to previously reported problems and missed appointments. They discovered that operatives would usually give a new reference number, even if the call was about an existing, uncompleted job. This meant the KPI would often record multiple repairs, even if only one had actually been carried out, and many would be recorded as completed within the target timescales, even if they took longer in reality. Under the contract, this also meant the council was often paying for multiple repairs when it should only have paid for one. The final scrutiny committee report observed “\nso extensive and apparent is the evidence that Southwark’s KPIs are unreliable and inaccurate, it is very surprising that the system has been allowed to continue in its current form for so long\n”\n. \n              \nThe contract with \nMorrisons\n has been cancelled and SBS is now directly managed instead of being at \narms\n length.\n  \n&#xa0;\nIn\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2010 North Somerset Council embarked on a £100m contract with private contractor \nAgilisys\n to run the Council's support services. A year into the contract UNISON surveyed a cross section of members employed by \nAgilisys\n and the Council to obtain their views and experiences on how the contract was working. Not a single member employed by the Council who was surveyed thought the contract had fulfilled the promise that services would be ‘quicker, better or cheaper’. Almost half of contracted out staff (46%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that services had improved since being outsourced, with only 21% saying they had got better. Increased workload and pressure, low morale, office environment and poor communications were identified as particular issues of concern\n.\nIn December 2011 the Council agreed to carry out a review. A report prepared by KPMG report was presented to Council officers\n&#xa0;\nin April 2012 but a summary of it was only made public eight months later in response to a Freedom of Information Act (\nFoI\n) request. \n \nThe summary report\n revealed that over a year into the contract 16 of the 38 agreed performance indicators in the contract were not being reported on. The report also revealed savings from procurement significantly lower than promised - £740,000 predicted by the end of 2012/13, instead of the promised £2.4m. \nKPMG also reported issues with quality, delivery and inflexibility.  Although the Council adopted a number of recommendations designed to improve the performance of the contract the local UNISON branch is worried that some targets may be reduced to make it easier for \nAgilisys\n to hit them. Concerns also remain about the council’s failure to release a full report from KPMG upon which the summary is based, with the council denying its existence. This matter is the subject of an appeal to the Information Commissioner.\n&#xa0;Appendix 4: cut price procurement and the effect on quality – the damage in social care&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUNISON’s ethical care charter for the commissioning of homecare services&#xa0;UNISON’s \nTime to care \nreport\n highlighted acute problems in the delivery of homecare directly related to how the services are commissioned, with problems including call-cramming, non-payment of the National Minimum wage and zero hours contracts leading to rushed and undignified care.\n&#xa0;\nThe over-riding objective behind the Charter is to establish a minimum baseline for the safety, quality and dignity of care by ensuring employment conditions which a) do not routinely short-change clients and b) ensure the recruitment and retention of a\nmore stable workforce through more sustainable pay, conditions and training levels.\n&#xa0;\nThe Charter\n&#xa0;\nStage 1\n››The starting point for commissioning of visits will be client need and not minutes or tasks. Workers will have the freedom to provide appropriate care and will be given time to talk to their clients\n&#xa0;\n››The time allocated to visits will match the needs of the clients. In general, 15-minute visits will not be used as they undermine the dignity of the clients\n&#xa0;\n››Homecare workers will be paid for their travel time, their travel costs and other necessary expenses such as mobile phones\n&#xa0;\n››Visits will be scheduled so that homecare workers are not forced to rush their time with clients or leave their clients early to get to the next one on time\n&#xa0;\n››Those homecare workers who are eligible must be paid statutory sick pay\n&#xa0;\nStage 2\n››Clients will be allocated the same homecare worker(s) wherever possible\n&#xa0;\n››Zero hour contracts will not be used in place of permanent contracts\n&#xa0;\n››Providers will have a clear and accountable procedure for following up staff concerns about their clients’ wellbeing\n&#xa0;\n››All homecare workers will be regularly trained to the necessary standard to provide a good service (at no cost to themselves and in work time)\n&#xa0;\n››Homecare workers will be given the opportunity to regularly meet co-workers to share best practice and limit their isolation\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nStage 3\n››All homecare workers will be paid at least the Living Wage. If Council employed homecare workers paid above this rate are outsourced it should be on the basis that the provider is required, and is funded, to maintain these pay levels throughout the contract\n&#xa0;\n››All homecare workers will be covered by an occupational sick pay scheme to ensure that staff do not feel pressurised to work when they are ill in order to protect the welfare of their vulnerable clients\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Examples of arms-length care companies getting into difficulties&#xa0;Some councils and NHS Trusts have created their own companies to try to provide social care more cheaply and generate additional revenue by securing ‘business’ from elsewhere. However there have been severe difficulties in coming up with business models that work as the following examples highlight:\n&#xa0;\nChelsea CareChelsea Care was set up by Kensington and Chelsea Council (RBKC) in 2008 as a wholly owned trading company to provide homecare and brokerage services in the borough. The plan was to earn additional income by creating ‘innovative’ services that went beyond the council’s core offer, namely practical care services and brokerage services for people with personal budgets. \n&#xa0;\nIt was established with £150,000 of equity and contracted to provide care services to the Council operational from February 2009. Within thirty months it had gone into liquidation and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea had spent £1,100,000 on £800,000 of care.\n&#xa0;\nUpon creation RBKC awarded Chelsea Care two three-year contracts – one for 350 hours of practical care services per week and one for brokerage services , providing 330 hours of support per month. \n&#xa0;\nAn ambitious operating income and expenditure forecast estimated that the first year would see an operating loss, before moving to a profit of nearly £123,000 within three years up to 2012. In order to achieve this it was forecast that the total income of the company would rise from just over £68,000 in the first year of trading to over £1.1 million by 2012. \n&#xa0;\nAfter running into significant financial problems, Chelsea Care was put into liquidation in May 2011, when the council decided not to inject further capital into the business to enable it to keep trading. \n&#xa0;\nThe forecasts made for the company turned out to be over-estimated, particularly around the growth in its private client base, which was one of the main reasons for setting up Chelsea Care. The number of new clients signing up was low, due to the level of competition in the market. Profit margins had been estimated to be 15-16% but were in reality closer to 3-4%. \n&#xa0;\nWhilst staffing costs made up the bulk of Chelsea Care’s costs, one of the biggest sources of predicted savings was through an ‘employment model’ which saw all staff on zero hours contracts, with home carers paid £6.15 per hour, and supervisors £7.50. \n&#xa0;\nThe Council’s scrutiny board subsequently set up a working group to investigate what had gone wrong and what lessons could be learnt. The working group produced a damning report cataloguing a series of failures in the way the company was set up and run\n. They found that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBy April 2011 the Council took the view that no improvement in the company’s performance was likely. The report concluded that:\n&#xa0;\n“Whilst [scrutiny committee] accepted the Council’s deliberate wish to experiment and not to exercise direct control, they felt that insufficient vetting of the business plan at the start had been a fundamental mistake”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nYour Choice Ltd (Barnet LATC)The Your Choice Ltd trading company was set up by Barnet council to run adult care services and began trading in 2012. At the time the council said that the company would return a small surplus in its first year rising rapidly in subsequent years. \n&#xa0;\nIn March 2013 the council announced that the company was in fact due to make a loss in its first year and that it had a £1m funding gap caused by a planned change from a  block contract to one based on actual use, with payment in arrears. The company proposed to take a 3 year loan from Barnet Homes, a sister company along with redundancies and cuts to pay, terms and conditions in order to recover its shortfall. The local UNISON branch has always challenged the evidence for the Business Case and the very optimistic profit forecasts claimed for the LATC.\n The branch’s warnings now appear to be coming true with workers expected to pay for the mistakes made by the council and company directors. \n&#xa0;Rochdale Council, Calderstones Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Future Directions CIC  Rochdale Council re-tendered a contract to provide supported living to some 80 people and sought substantial reductions in the contract price. The contract was previously held by \nMacIntyre\n Care. \nMacIntyre\n Care (and other care providers) decided not to bid. \nMacIntyre\n Care say in their 2012 Annual Report: \n“We were unable to negotiate a continuation of this contract at a reasonable outcome from our perspective, as that would have involved service quality cuts and significant cost reductions”\n&#xa0;\nLate in the bidding process, \nCalderstones\n Partnership NHS Trust tendered and were awarded the contract. The contract started on 1 October 2012 and all staff TUPE transferred to \nCalderstones\n Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. \nCalderstones\n established Future Directions CIC (Community Interest Company)\n. \nCalderstones\n Partnership NHS Foundation Trust is the sole shareholder with a £1 share. \n&#xa0;\nThe objective of establishing a subsidiary social enterprise in order to cut rates of pay is explicitly set out in the 2012 Annual Report:\n&#xa0;\n“Set up of a subsidiary social enterprise for delivery of new community-based business. \nWorking in partnership with a social enterprise will enable more competitive delivery of services in markets where NHS pay rates are not sustainable.” \n&#xa0;\nCalderstones\n transferred the Rochdale contract to Future Directions CIC and staff TUPE transferred again to Future Directions. It has also transferred other community services contracts from other commissioners and more will follow. \nCalderstones\n’ Annual Plan 2013/14 sets out the Trust’s strategy. \nThe plan identifies the following as key objectives:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFuture Directions CIC proceeded to impose very significant cuts to the pay, terms and conditions of staff employed on the Rochdale contract:\n&#xa0;\nThese pay cuts result in a loss to the Treasury of £108,356.78: £80,070.42 in reduced Income Tax; £13,194.35 in lower employee NI contributions; £15,092 in lower employer NI contributions. There is also a loss of \n£12,091.94 \nin indirect tax take based on 15% of disposable income to take account of VAT exempt items.\n&#xa0;\nThere are significant concerns about the financial viability of Future Directions CIC.\nFirst, it appears that \nCalderstones\n Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has spent in excess of £250,000 establishing Future Directions CIC as it provided a loan of £600,000 but the opening cash balance was just £343,000. Whether this loan has been provided from within \nCalderstones\n’ resources through the use of reserves is unclear. In the first year of operation a further loan of £400,000 is being provided and at the end of the three year business plan period it is envisaged that none of the ‘loan’ will have been repaid. Future Directions is being charged an interest rate of 10% by \nCalderstones\n.\n&#xa0;\nSecondly Future Directions CIC built into its annual plan an EBITDA of -£736,000 on its Community/Future Directions function. Future Directions is projected to make an operating loss of £301,020 in 2013/14, followed by a further operating loss of £164,766 in 2014/15.\n&#xa0;\nThirdly there are concerns about the level of overheads that are being charged to Future Directions CIC by the Trust. It appears that an inter-company account has been established to which overheads from \nCalderstones\n are charged. The inter-company deficit (the amount Future Directions owes \nCalderstones\n) rises from £432,464 at 31 March 2013 to £654,454 at 31 March 2016.\nFourthly Directors of the Trust and Future Directions CIC appeared to be unaware that the income that was being assumed in the second year of a contract with Rochdale Council appears to be around £250,000 less than actually provided for in the contract.\n&#xa0;\nFifthly \nCalderstones\n and Future Directions CIC may have created additional financial risks, including potential claims for breach of contract and potential equal pay claims following the imposition of significantly worse terms and conditions. \n&#xa0;\nUNISON understands that the governance risk rating from Monitor for the \nCalderstones\n Partnership NHS Foundation Trust was amended from GREEN to AMBER-RED in December 2012 due to a breach of condition 5(1) – requirement to ensure representative and comprehensive governance, and a breach of condition 4(1) – requirement to comply with the constitution and the Act (in line with the terms of its authorisation).\n&#xa0;Individual Solutions SK (ISSK) – Stockport ISSK was set up as a trading company owned by Stockport Council in 2009, with a view to making adult social care and support services more cost effective.\n&#xa0;\nHowever by 2012 the council had serious concerns about both the value for money and quality of care of the company. It stated that the costs of the service were higher than expected and that the company was not performing in line with the projections made for it. Redundancies affecting around half the workforce were proposed. \n&#xa0;\nFollowing a campaign by the local UNISON branch a period of consultation by the council led to the decision to take back in-house some of the key services that had gone out to the company - re-\nablement\n, intermediate care and night support teams.  The council cited significant changes in the focus of services which meant that the trading company was no longer appropriate: \n&#xa0;\n“The direction of the Council’s services within adult social care is moving towards a locality based integrated approach aimed at joining up council and health care to improve outcomes for older people...By focusing care around older people with the aim of maintaining them in their own homes for as long as possible there is a tremendous opportunity to align the high quality home support offered \nalongside the multi-disciplinary teams that are being created. It makes sense for the service to be a key part of the new integrated approach sitting alongside front-line social workers, district nurses and occupational therapists. This means that the current arrangement of having a separate company to deliver this aspect of care is not productive and there is more sense in ensuring all social care staff are part of one team and one system of referral and assessment.”\n&#xa0;\nThe council also decided to review the potential for other services to return in-house and run alongside other in-house provider services, particularly the Learning Disability tenancies. \n&#xa0;\nA joint project board comprising trade unions and managers from the council and ISSK was set up to oversee the transfer back in-house.\n10\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/9639636.Accountant_Stephen_Parker_reinstated_at_Bournemouth_Council_after_Mouchel_dispute/\n \n \nhttp://watford.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s3979/Appendix%206.1.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/making-public-service-markets-work\n \n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-23339493\n UNISON: \nInsourcing\n update: The value of returning local authority services in-house in an era of budget constraints - \nhttps://www.unison.org.uk/upload/sharepoint/On%20line%20Catalogue/20122.pdf\n \n ibid\n \nhttp://ukcampaign4change.com/2013/08/28/sandwell-council-and-bt-agree-exit-plan-on-outsourcing-contract/\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-healthcare-assistants-and-support-workers-in-nhs-and-social-care\n \nhttps://www.unison.org.uk/at-work/local-government/key-issues/homecare/the-facts/\n \n&#xa0;\n \nIn 2010 the Prime Minister told the TED conference: “We’re going to make every contract... available on the internet so anyone can see what the terms are, what the conditions are...”\n The commitment was included in the draft Conservative 2010 Manifesto which said: “A Conservative government will publish government contracts for goods and services worth over £25,000 in full, including all performance indicators, break clauses and penalty measures...”\n&#xa0;\n \nas defined in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Schedule 12A to the Local Government Act 1972\n Independent review of Service Birmingham \nhttp://birminghamnewsroom.com/2012/12/independent-review-of-service-birmingham/\n \n&#xa0;\n \nReview of key performance indicators in the housing repairs service\n (Southwark Council, Feb 2011) \nhttp://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s17684/Appendix%20Review%20of%20Key%20Performance%20Indicators%20in%20the%20Housing%20Repairs%20Service.pdf\n \n \nhttp://northsomersetunison.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/unison-members-support-services-survey.html\n \nhttps://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5j2lWfRXcIfTS1kQzFrLXhCRzg/edit\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.unison.org.uk/upload/sharepoint/On%20line%20Catalogue/21049.pdf\n Cabinet &amp; Corporate Services Scrutiny Committee: \nLiquidation of Chelsea Care\n (17\nth\n October 2011) \nhttp://www.rbkc.gov.uk/committees/Meetings/tabid/73/ctl/ViewMeetingPublic/mid/410/Meeting/5777/Committee/1415/Default.aspx\n  \n \nAn example of this was a contract with PC World for computer support which had been terminated, resulting in a final notice of £17,000.\n&#xa0;\n See: \nhttp://www.european-services-strategy.org.uk/news/2012/local-authority-trading-company-latc-for-adult/latc-analysis-2012.pdf\n&#xa0;\n \nCompany registration no 08041420, registered 23 April 2012\n.\n"
