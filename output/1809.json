"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT (WSC084)&#xa0;\nThere is \na wealth of research demonstrating the value of diversity to \nUK\n businesses, especially increasing the number of women operating on boards.  However, progress increasing the participation of women (particularly in IT) is slow.\n&#xa0;\nOur recommendations cover:\n&#xa0;\nW\ne\n know\n that women choose IT as a profession less often than men\n, and that women \nleave the profession for other careers\n. We would like to see this change, as there are \nexceptionally\n good opportunities \nfor\n women\n to\n flourish in IT environments\n.\n \nBCS\n \nbelieve\ns\n that the UK IT \ns\nector would be strengthened by innovation and pr\nofit benefits which diversity in the workplace brings.\n&#xa0;\nToday’s job market is very competitive\n;\n IT is both the enabler of savings and the engine of growth, and people with skills and experience in IT are likely to be more in demand than people with other s\nkill sets\n.\n IT is integral to every business process, and IT teams interact with business teams, working together in exciting and dynamic environments to transform companies. Careers in IT can be varied, stimulating\n and\n flexible\n.\n \n&#xa0;However, it seems that fo\nr many women IT isn’t regarded as a great place to \nwork\n.\n  WISE, formerly the UKRC\n for Women in SET\n,\n \nhas published the following\n \n&#xa0;\nThe IT industry directly contributes 8% (£75 billion) to the U\nK’s total GVA\n.\nThe scope of the value of IT to the UK economy transcends the IT sector alone, with around 40% of the IT workforce employed in other industries\n, \nbenefiting business through increased efficiency provided by new technology. \nT\nhe McKinsey \nReports; Women Matter\n (2007)\n, and Women Matter 2\n \n(2010)\n, outline the benefits in \nRO\nI\n, \nprofit\n and share-price\n when boards and senior management teams include diverse members.\n  W\nork by \nCedric Herring, University of Illinois, in a paper\n \ntitled\n;\n \n‘\nDoes Diversit\ny Pay? Race, Gender, and\n \nthe Business Case for Diversity\n’\n, \nexamines the impact of racial and\n \ngender diversity on business performance\n. He makes a business case for diversity\n,\n arguing that a diverse workforce produce\ns\n better results and offers a direct ROI.  His research, as with that of McKinsey\n,\n promises larger profit and greater earnings.\n \nAdditionally\n, \nthe law firm Reed Smith launched a report in partnership with Winmark showing how global companies could get the be\nst ROI from gender diversity. The \"\nGender Balancing: It's Good Business\n\" report\n \nsurveyed a range of FTSE100, FTSE250 and leading firms to determine UK businesses’ level of commitment to gender diversity and practical initiatives.\n  \nThe report\n found\n, as with the others cited here, \nthat\n overall business effectiveness and profit \nwas\n enhanced when women \nwere\n included in every level of enterprise\n.\n&#xa0;We have consulted with a number of industry stakeholders who all testify to the value of diversity in the i\nndustry:\nCreating a diverse workforce at Thomson Reuters is a critical component of our vision and advances the focus on collaboration and innovation by bringing more women onto our technology teams. We are currently working on a program that we are callin\ng, “from college to career”, which will build bridges from colleges to active careers at Thomson Reuters. Part of this initiative is the commitment to recruit and develop future female technology leaders. By creating more diverse teams we add another innov\nation dimension advancing future solutions and adding new perspectives and ideas.\nJane Moran, CIO, Thomson Reuters&#xa0;\nThe leak of women into STEM starts in school and we see girls are not encouraged or properly advised of the richness of a career in IT, and \nthe industry needs a style makeover to move on from the “geeky” back office image it still has. We tend to describe our roles in a very technical way expecting use of “cyber security” will be a major draw – and it is a turn off instead. The use of gaming, \nfun technology and more retail linked brands is much more \nhelpful. Google, Amazon and e-bay don’t have the same problems the more traditional B to B service companies experience in attracting girls.\nAnn Brown, Senior Vice President HR, Capgemini UK&#xa0;There \naren’t any simple problems or challenges left.\n&#xa0;\n Almost everything we do is beyond the capacity and capabilities of the individual.\n&#xa0;\n We depend entirely on the expanse of talent we can muster by bringing teams together, and like it or not, there are some thi\nngs that men and women do equally well, and there are a set of things that one does better than the other.\n&#xa0;\n If you don’t build teams with a balance of men and women, you’re building teams with unnecessary limitations.\n&#xa0;\nIn Visa Europe we try and create these\n balanced teams.\n&#xa0;\n Starting in our Visa Apprentice programme and lasting as long as necessary, we provide accelerated development and support programmes and specifically for or female members of staff, to try and accelerate the slow but inevitable rebalanci\nng of men and women in all roles in business and technology. \nSteve Chambers, CIO, VISA&#xa0;Women are an integral and important part of our Global IT team at BG Group. BG Group believes that we will deliver better and more sustainable results if we have a cul\nture where different perspectives are encouraged and considered. To achieve this, we aim to build a workforce that is diverse – in ethnicity, gender, background and approach.\nAngus McCallum, CIO, BG Group&#xa0;Women are leading key areas of our business from \ncentral technology services to strategy to content and are instrumental in our progress as an organisation. We believe that businesses which better reflect society, in all its diversity, will\n \nbe more successful in the long-term.\nSelwyn Castleden, IS Director Sky Network Services, BskyB&#xa0;Creating an inclusive workplace is something that IBM has always set out to achieve. Diverse teams energise and challenge each other to deliver strong business results and innovative ideas which is why IBM in the UK and Irel\nand continues to employee people from all lifestyles and backgrounds. It makes perfect business sense and is essential to the way we work and the way we operate our business.\nDavid Stokes, IBM UK and Ireland General Manager&#xa0;\nAt Deloitte our business thrive\ns on the many and varied talents of our people. The ability to attract, retain and advance talented women is an important part of this. We have set objectives to improve the representation of women in senior roles to ensure women have every opportunity to \ndevelop and progress. We recognise and highly value the qualities female leaders can bring to the business and are working within firm and the wider market to foster these strengths.\nRebecca George OBE, Partner Public Sector Health, Deloitte LLP&#xa0;4              Causes for the Absence of Women in IT and Best Practice Research\n shows several themes which inhibit girls and younger women to \npursue\n careers in the IT industry and cause them to migrate away from \ntechnology \nroles\n:\n  \n4.1 Cultures in the IT Sector Workforce4.1.1 \n              \nA \n2005 \nstudy conducted for Intellect and the DTI concluded that women were leaving the industry because they felt undervalued, found their management unsupportive, did not feel included in the male dominated industry, and felt the long hours culture\n was \nun\ncomfortable for them\n;\n4.1.2 \n              \nWomen act differently from men in the workplace. \nWomen sell themselves differently in interviews and performance appraisals.  In predominantly male environments, if men are not aware of these differences, women miss out \non networking, mentoring and promotion opportunities\n. Everywoman (\nwww.everywoman.com\n) is an excellent example of an organisation providing advice, networking resources and connections to help women address the \nissues often faced by women in traditionally male dominated environments\n;\n  \n4.1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nany women report that the\nre is an\n 'old boys\n’\n network' \nculture \ncreat\ning\n a\nn \nimpenetrable\n glass ceiling\n.\n One recent statistic states that 58% of \nUS \nmale CEOs \nin the 500 largest compa\nnies \nare over \n6f\nt tall, whilst only 14% of the population are over that height\n, \nsuggest\ning\n deep rooted \nbias in the \nselection\n of top executives\n;\n4.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany \nwords and phrases\n \ncrop up in research and interviews, including \nglass ceiling, glass cliff, \nmacho/aggressive and bullying culture, lack of recognition, having to work extra hard to prove themselves, long hours culture, old-boys club.  If these\n reflect\n \nindustry \nnorms \nwhich \nimpact the retention of women, they need to be addressed in order \nto \nstem t\nhe decline in women in the industry\n;\n \n4.1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWomen\n will be discriminated against even when the employer has policies which aim to do the right thing\n.  Gender Schemas\n, also known as \nu\nnconscious \nb\nias\n, \nare \nsocialised into the\n \npopulace from birth, \nand \ndefine the \nassumptions\n by which individuals are judged.  This is particularly important when recruitment, promotion and \nperformance \nassessment\n \ndecisions are made\n.  \n4.2 Image of Women in IT in the Media 4.2.1\n              \nThe UK\n Government has invested in research into the roles that TV and the media play \nin gender stereotyping\n and the\nir\n effect on STEM career decisions\n;\n \n4.2.2\n              \n‘Media coverage of science, particularly television programmes, is a key \nplace\n \nwhere young peoples’ perc\neptions of STEM and its relationship with society are formed…the images young people see presented on television are generally thought to have some influence on the choices some students \nmake about their future careers;\n’\n \n‘\n4.2.3\n              \nIn the UK\n the numbers of women opting \nfor\n IT studies at university continues to fall\n.  W\ne believe that without adequate positive representation in the \nm\nedia young women will not choose careers in our industry\n,\n despite the good work done by earlier programmes such \nas Computer Clubs for Girls\n (CC4G)\n;\n4.2.4\n              \nA relatively recent example of the power of media representations is the upswing in the take-up of Forensic Science courses by young women (women now represent two thirds\n of\n UK students on Forensic Science courses)\n.  This has been largely attributed to the portrayal of a female forensic pathologist in the BBC TV production \nSilent Witness\n.\n4.3 Lack of Role Models 4.3.1\n              \nThe lack of visible role models allow\ns\n gender and industry stereotypes to persist, to reinforce the ‘nerdy’ image of the IT or technical professional\ns\n. That these perceptions persist sustains the lack of attraction of the IT sector for young \nfemales\n. It is simply not a career default choice. S\nchools and HEIs find it difficult to challenge the stereotypes and offer girls an image of an exciting career in IT and technology.  Equally, \nif \nwomen already embarked on IT careers cannot see equality of opportunity and subsequent equality of reward in fe\nmale role models, they will opt for other industries where opportunities for advancement \nare visible.\n4.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany organisations have built education outreach programmes, selecting and training women to go into schools to present on the benefits of women in IT. BC\nS has been involved with a programme started by Deloitte and Atos and we are aware of other industry based schemes w\nith\n the same motivations.  However, these schemes are voluntary, not \nincentivised\n or rewarded, and funding is usually time bounded\n;\n4.3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOther \nAmbassador s\nchemes have had some success.  \nResearch cites prominent scientists, media personalities and teachers among the people who influence career choice, beyond members of the immediate family. The government funded scheme, science and engineering amb\nassadors (SEAs) was established in 2000.  It increases the number of individuals in early \ncareer \nstages coming into contact with young\nsters\n \nthrough\n schools science clubs, to talk about their work.  SEAs were established in recognition of the fact that few \nteachers have experience of working in industry, research or higher education.  Of those that do have relevant experience, by definition it will be limited and will date quickly, especially in fast moving areas such as IT\n;\n4.3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Everywoman organisation is he\nlping to address this through Leadership Academies; one day seminars for women in disciplines such as Technology, Engineering, Manufacturing, or Transport to boost their knowledge and be inspired by leading female figures as role models.\n4.4 Recruitment Policies  4.4.1\n              \nWhere gendered names are removed from CVs in repeated trials and research, employers select males and females equally, based on the merits of skills\n;\n4.4.2\n              \nResearch suggests that \nusing\n female appropriate\n recruitment\n advertising will benefit targets for employing women and conversely that where advertising is not positively constructed to be attractive to women, \nfewer women apply\n;\n4.4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere employers do not sufficiently train managers in techniques for advertising and int\nerviewing women, gender imbalances proliferate\n;\n4.4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of \nu\nnconscious \nb\nias training for hiring managers sets opinion in favour of the controlling group, which at this time in \nour\n sector is \noverwhelmingly \nmale. \nHowever, uptake and implementation \nof this type \nof education is sporadic\n and inconsistent\n;\n  \n4.4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe IT industry requires many \nbusiness \nskills, and recruit\ning\n graduates with business skills and MBA qualifications can be benefi\ncial\n where there are declining numbers of graduates from pure ICT courses.  Anecdotally many individuals come to IT roles from different starting points\n.  Th\ne appeal of technology\n and the opportunities available may not \nbe apparent\n \nwhen \nstudying\n, but i\ns greate\nr when experienced in the workplace\n.\n4.4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDissemination of best practice on recruitment policies to make IT employers the companies of choice for women \nis\n essential to ensure that the industry acquires the skills at both graduate and skilled practitioner levels\n.  Guides are available from the UK Resource \nC\nentre for \nW\nomen in \nSET\n to encourage good \nrecruitment \npractice\n; h\nowever, incentive, uptake and implementation are sporadic, unmonitored, and inconsistent\n;\n    \n4.4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdvertising a company’s WLB and Flexibility options \ncan make a difference and it is known that CISCO, IBM UK and others regularly do so\n;\n4.4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTraining in \nu\nnconscious \nb\nias has been undertaken \nby all BCS\n Boards and Committees\n.\n  This training is available from organisations such as WISE and is being rolled out in s\nome of the large technology companies.  IBM UK was one of the first to include this training for senior management\n.\n4.5 Career Paths, Retention and Lack of Opportunities for Flexible Working4.5.1\n              \n              \n‘Women are likely to be underrepresented within higher level (skilled/paid) ITEC occupations both compared to males and in terms of overall female \nemployment in ITEC.’  \nFemale \nrepresentation appears more focussed towards lower level ITEC occupations in the\n UK than in other EU states\n’\n;\n \n4.5.2\n              \n              \nThis is also reflected by the 22% IT Gender Pay Gap, where fewer women \nare \nearning in higher salary bands and th\nerefore a greater gap overall. \nC\norporate \nculture and \npractice may offer more challenging opportunities to\n males\n.  There is a\nn\n assumption that women are \nless\n ambitio\nu\ns \nthan\n men\n, and\n a belief that where salaries are used as a\n success\n indicator\n,\n \nwomen are disadvantaged because of the gender pay gap in the IT sector\n;\n   \n4.5.3\n              \n              \nA Gender Pay Audit was created durin\ng the last administration and some private sector companies completed it, although the take-up was very limited.  One company which was willing to me\nntion this practice was HSBC;\n4.5.4\n              \nWomen \nwho experience \nblocked opportunities at senior levels, and perceive unfair selection criteria for executive and senior posts may act on their perceptions and leave the industry, which \nappears \nanecdotally to be the case\n;\n4.5.\n5\n              \nDifferent modes of working are appropriate fo\nr different life stages for both men and women.  This has been recognised by successive administrations and is not just related to \nSTEM \nroles.  We know that there are issues within the IT industry but believe that these will be beneficially impacted by cur\nrent programmes to enhance flexible working across all industries and we will\n therefore not detail them here;\n4.5.\n6\n              \nThe UKRC for SET held a very large repository of documentation and training on recruitment, mentoring and retention for women in STEM career\ns.  This might still be available from the WISE CIC. WISE also has a broad curriculum and series of materials for supporting organisations \nwishing\n to do more with women in STEM careers and supports females 'from classroom to boardroom'.\n4.6 Cultures in Education and TrainingWe are aware that other respondents to this \ninquiry\n \nwill cover this in detail and we believe that the issues are sufficiently known for us to not repeat them here. \n&#xa0;BCS aspires to \ndeliver\n best practice for diversity in the IT sector.  \nWe\n recommend the following \nactions \nbe undertaken to boost the number of women entering and staying in the STEM sector\ns, and in particular, within IT:\n  \n5.1 QuotasThe argument against \nq\nuotas has been fierce, \nand resides around the desire for a meritocracy, and a desire that women succeed by right of their ability.  However, this pre-supposes that the current state of affairs represents a meritocracy\n, and that the industry will make progress through voluntary a\nctions.  Progress, however, continues to be slow and we therefore recommend that:\n&#xa0;5.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe debate should be reopened on setting q\nuota\ns for women in STEM in academia and industry sectors.  \nThis would include i\nmplementation of monitoring and targets in all organi\nsations on the uptake of women into senior management and executive \nand non-executive \npositions\n;\n5.1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis debate should includ\ne\n consultation on legislation regarding t\nhe percentage of women on company boards\n, like \ncountries, compelling state owned and listed \nprivate companies to appoint women to at least 30% of boardroom positions with severe penalties for those who do\n not\n conform;\n5.2 Use Current Resources5.2.1\n              \nToo often we \nre-invent the wheel.  There are existing organisations, with good understa\nnding and relevant skill sets, \nwhich can undertake key tasks associated with \nincreasing the number of women \nin the STEM workforce.  These organisations could be \nsupported \nwith relatively minimal government funding to \nimplement these recommendations\n.  \nOrgan\nisations such as\n UKRC \n(\nwhich became WISE, and which was one of the founders of the Athena Swan initiative\n) and Everywoman\n \nare\n excellent \nexample\ns\n.  \nThey\n covers \nall \nof STEM\n and the business world as well as academia\n, not just \nthe \nengineering\n discipline\n which \nthe current government \nappears to favour\n. \nTheir missions are\n \nto support \nwomen and girls 'from the classroom to the boardroom' and \nto offer end to end solutions for aspiring female leaders and these \nassets can \nundoubtedly \nsupport this renewed interes\nt in driving gender diversity for the \nbenefit\n of UK PLC\n;\n5.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNo further research is required.  There is a\nn\n array of research from the UK and globally which \narticulates \nthe issues and \nmakes appropriate \nrecommendations.\n  \nWe need to get on and take the most pragm\natic approaches to fixing the problem.\n5.3 Media and ImageSupport \nshould \nbe given to tackle the media issues and could \ninclude:\n5.3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA campaign to feature articles and stories on women in IT\n;\n5.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nampaign\ns\n to enhance the number of high profile women in IT in the media\n to provide role models\n;\n   \n5.3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWork with TV production organisations on the inclus\nion of positive female IT role \nmodels in TV drama.  \n5.4 Role ModelsWe make the following recommendations:\n5.4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImplement a \nconsistent programme to help teachers and other influential adults provide \nrealistic and appropriate \ninformation and \ndetails of \nIT \nrole models \nin order to take young people beyond being users of IT\n;\n5.4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoll\ning\n out p\nrogrammes to help develop an und\nerstanding of the skills and attributes that make a good IT practitioner\ns\n and tools to nurture those skills is important\n.  \nE.g.\n the \ncampaign of “a girl like me” \nportray\ns \ndifferent IT roles\n at differing levels of seniority\n, \nensur\ning\n that girls can envisage \nbecoming an IT practitioner\n;\n5.4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvide s\nupport for liaison between industry and schools/colleges to reinforce positive role models of women in IT, with provision of a \ntraining\n course for role models who go into schools.\n5.5 Funding Across Administrations5.5\n.1\n              \nAny support which is offered must be established and funded for the long term.  \nS\nuccessive administrations \ncreate \ngood and valuable initiatives\n, which are \nthen quashed \nby subsequent ones\n.  \nS\nupport for the long term should transcend the party political s\nystem and \nbe\n establish\ned\n for 15 years minimum with contingencies for changes in government.\n&#xa0;\n5.6 Recruitment and Gender Pay GapWe believe the following recommendations should be implemented:\n5.6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nR\nemov\nal of\n gender specific items \nby r\necruiters and all STEM and \nnon-STEM employers before oversight by hiring managers\n;\n CVs should have the names removed\n;\n \n5.6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nU\nse \nof \nbest practice \nby industry, \nincluding\n annual monitoring of industry figures for graduate and experienced hire\ns\n. Capgemini is a good example of monitoring and \nhave told us that they recruit around 400 people each year with less than 2 years experience in work (entry talent grades). Around 180 of these are apprentices and women make up\n&#xa0;\naround 20% of this population, but only 17% of applicants\n;\n5.6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncouraging e\nducati\non modules on \nu\nnconscious \nb\nias and its implications for recruitment \nand retention \nin all STEM industries\n;\n5.6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMandated g\nender based pay audits\n \nin all private sector companies. The public sector \nis \ncovered in this respect by the Gender Duty legislation.\n  \n5.7 Careers and Retention5.7.1\n              \nPermanent links should be encouraged between employers and careers advice provide\nrs\n;\n5.7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment should offer employers m\nentoring support to show the value of mentoring to women and \nshowcase best practice\n;\n5.7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nB\nest practice on \nrecruitment, retention and \nu\nnconscious \nb\nias should be collected and disseminated\n;\n5.7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegular annual monitoring is required t\no \ntrack \nprogress in the take-up of executive\n, non-executive \nand senior management positions for women in the industry. Th\nis should also\n \ntrack leavers \nfrom\n senior positions.\n  WISE undertakes to produce\n such \nstatistics on girls and women in STEM on an annual basis\n.
