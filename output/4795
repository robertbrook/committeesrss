defaultHow should climate scientists communicate their findings? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe media relies on scientists putting themselves forward and the research they publish. More could always be done to bring their views to the public’s attention, but scientists in turn need to find ways to make their work and what they say about it accessible to a lay audience.
default&#xa0;
defaultScientists usually come top of professions that are most trusted by the general public in surveys. Why is that different in the climate debate? 
default&#xa0;
defaultI don’t know as I have not seen any data to substantiate the premise of the question. I am wary about the value judgment implied in the term ‘trusted information source’. We report information, and rely on our commentators to interpret it.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is your opinion of mass media coverage of climate? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe climate debate is covered exhaustively in the Telegraph and elsewhere. Again, I’m not sure about the word trust. Media have a duty to report all facets of a debate, even if it means pointing out that the balance of facts favours one side.
default&#xa0;
defaultJames Painter’s research has found that press coverage in the UK has become increasingly polarised – why is this? 
default&#xa0;
defaultI am not familiar with Mr Painter’s research. I can only speak for the Telegraph’s coverage. We try to bring a range of voices and views to the debate, in addition to covering developments in the news story. Our readers are informed and have a clear understanding of the difference between news and opolemic.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat is your publication’s working definition of climate change? 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe don’t have a working definition of climate change. We report on it rather than define it. In terms of our editorial policy, it is broadly that we believe that the climate is changing, that the reason for that change includes human activity, but that human ingenuity and adaptability should not be ignored in favour of economically damaging prescriptions.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultDo you agree that there are core facts that everyone might agree upon? Where should these facts be promulgated? 
default&#xa0;
defaultYour question suggests that we are participants in the debate. We are not. Our sole responsibility is to our readers, and that involves presenting them with a compelling daily package of news and features that they are happy to pay for. As part of that, we try to provide them with reliable information that they can engage with: Too often we are faced with impenetrable gobbledygook from scientists who appear to have no inkling that their case is incomprehensible to most members of the public.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a publisher of news, you communicate with the public on climate issues. Do you think you attract a broad spectrum of opinion or are you only speaking to like-minded people? 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultYou will see if you study the Telegraph over the past, say, five years that we cover a broad spectrum of views and

default&#xa0;
defaultDiscussions and dissent on climate change policy often focus on uncertainties in the science. Should policy not be driven by mitigating the risks of climate change rather than hesitate due to uncertainties in aspects of the science? 
default&#xa0;
defaultOf course, efforts should be focused on mitigating the effects of climate change. We regularly urge government in our leaders to consider how it does so. We are concerned that the identified risks of climate change are well covered, but do not take sufficient account of human adaptability and ingenuity How best to mitigate those risks is a debate worth having. The US, for example, has seen its carbon emissions plummet by switching from coal to shale.
