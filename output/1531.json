Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?\nQ3 \nAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?     \nQ4 \nWhat are the mai\nn barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome?\nQ5 Are there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe?\n&#xa0;\nQ6 \nHow have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have\n they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts?\nQ7 Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?\nQ8 \nCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this?  \nQ9 What are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation \nif CCS fails?\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/researchareas/Pages/ccs.aspx\n http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOChooseTTS.aspx?Mode=ResearchArea&amp;ItemDesc=Carbon+Capture+and+Storage\n \nhttp://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_short.asp?searchterm=ccs&amp;Submit=Search\n http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPanelROL.aspx?PanelId=1-77063172&amp;RankingListId=1-19VTLF\n Harper, RJ &amp; Tibbett, M Plant Soil (2013)\n Kell, DB Ann Bot (2011)\n Kell, DB Phil Trans R Soc B (2012)\n \nhttp://www.theccc.org.uk/sectors/non-co2-gases/agriculture\n \nhttp://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/2013/2013-gfs-sarisa.aspx\n \n \nhtt\np://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/science/energy/capturing-a-cleaner-future13465.html\n \nhttp://dbkgroup.org/carbonsequestration/rootsystem.html\n \n \nhttp\n://www.bgs.ac.uk/qics/\n \n \nhttp://www.eco2-project.eu/\n \nhttp://www.ukccsrc.ac.uk/\n"
