[normal]Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Avon and Somerset [CST0053][bold]&#xa0;[bold]I write to provide information in support of the Public Administration Select Committee’s inquiry into the accuracy of 
[normal]crime statistics[bold]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The issue of crime recording and data integrity remains a
[normal]n important focus for Avon and Somerset Constabulary, and I very much welcome the review that is underway.

[normal]1.1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of my Police and Crime Plan, I have set the ambition of becomin
[normal]g a top performing force across all of my priority areas by 2017.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is underpinned by nine measures that provide an indication of our position and direction of travel. The measures are sourced from a mix of police recorded crime statistics, national an
[normal]d local perception surveys and criminal justice outcome data – as shown in the table below:

[normal]1.1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In setting this framework, I have aimed to 
[normal]foster an intelligent approach to performance management whereby:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The terminology contained within my plan is important as it reflects my desire to move away from a primarily target-driven culture in favour of a more balanced approach that considers the wider objectives and the behaviours they drive. I have not, for exam
[normal]ple used the term ‘target’ in my Police and Crime Plan, but instead made reference to ‘indicators’ and ‘ambitions’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I do not believe that the nine Police and Crime measures alone can tell us whether we are achieving the aspirations of the plan, but I do
[normal] recognise their importance in helping us to understand and communicate progress against a complex area of business to a wide variety of audiences. I also feel that there is a public and organisational desire for clear tangible outcomes against my overall 
[normal]ambition which I have aimed to balance proportionately within my Police and Crime Plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold] What impact do you think these targets have on police recording crime practices?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of the nine ambitions set as part of my Police and Crime Plan, four r
[normal]ely upon police recorded crime data.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I have engaged with officers and staff at a various levels of the organisation to develop an understanding of the impact of my priorities and the small number of numerical indicators that support them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This will culmi
[normal]nate in a meeting with performance and priority leads in January ahead of the annual refresh of my Police and Crime Plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]1.2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to this oversight, the Constabulary has reviewed attitudes, perceptions and behaviours with regard to performance cultu
[normal]re through its performance review process as part of a programme of work to drive improvements in crime recording standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Active oversight of this work has helped to inform my view.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have concluded that there is evidence to suggest that a historic or
[normal]ganisational target-driven culture has, at times, led to pressure on staff to behave in a way that 
[normal]puts performance ahead of the victim when recording crime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This was supported by a recent internal poll of officers and staff in Avon and Somerset.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I feel 
[normal]confident, however, that the organisation has undergone a significant cultural shift over recent years, which has resulted in a more analytical and less target-driven approach to driving performance improvement. While this is clearly evident at senior leve
[normal]ls within the organisation, I share a desire to ensure that this is effectively communicated and fully recognised at all levels within the organisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I believe that the safeguards to ensuring an accurate, ethical and reliable approach to crime recordin
[normal]g lie in the organisation’s approach to 
[normal]performance culture[bold] more generally as opposed to the concept of measurable aspirations as part of the Police and Crime Plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I do however recognise that I have a role to play in shaping this culture both through the
[normal] plan and in my interactions with officers and staff, and will continue to review my approach in light of new and emerging findings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are, however, a number of areas where my 
[normal]strategic priorities[bold] have had a direct impact upon crime recording practice
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In 2013, for example, the Constabulary introduced a flag for commercial burglary which enabled the organisation to improve analysis and interventions in response to my burglary reduction priority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Similarly, a focus on improving crime recording standa
[normal]rds with regard to domestic violence resulted in earlier and more accurate identification of domestic violence victims.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] While this has not been driven by an increase in victim reporting it is clearly a positive outcome in enabling greater identification, 
[normal]support and safeguarding amongst victims of these crimes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I actively seek assurance with regard to the accuracy of crime data through a variety of mechanisms and recognise that our intelligence, analysis, operational effectiveness and service provision are all dependent upon the information we record and process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There has been a dedicated programme of work in Avon and Somerset to improve crime recording standards prompted by HMIC Crime and Incident Recording Inspections and key findings from HMIC’s work in Kent in February 2013. This led to a Gold and Silver G
[normal]roup being established and I am represented on both.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As part of this process, I maintain ongoing oversight of crime recording compliance and progress against a dedicated improvement plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I also directly oversee issues relating to crime recording and dat
[normal]a integrity through my regular 1:1 meetings with respective Chief Officer Portfolio holders for crime recording and performance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]While these internal oversight arrangements provide some level of assurance, I also place great value on external and indepen
[normal]dent sources of assurance, including the HMIC inspection which offers broader comparisons against other police forces nationally.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]My trust in the recorded crime statistics for Avon and Som
[normal]erset is borne out of a realistic understanding of the limitations of this data and what the crime statistics represent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I understand, for example, that they can only ever be a reflection of what is reported to or pro-actively identified by the police, an
[normal]d for a variety of reasons, would not rely on police recorded crime statistics to give an indication of overall levels or trends in crime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In my view, the important question is whether we and our partner organisations can trust the recorded crime data t
[normal]o accurately identify the nature of victimisation, risk and vulnerability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is critical to ensuring appropriate and effective victim focussed service responses and safeguarding our most vulnerable people from harm.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] While I understand that volume crim
[normal]e data is always likely to contain some margin of error, I believe that further work can still be done to mitigate these risks. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I recognise that Avon and Somerset has been consistently identified as having one of the lowest levels of compliance nationall
[normal]y across areas such as incident to crime conversion - while also having one of the highest rates of no crime decisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] These 
[normal]findings are a source of shared concern, however, I am now confident that the Constabulary is working hard to drive sustained imp
[normal]rovements in the accuracy of the data they record and retain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have been particularly encouraged by the Constabulary’s approach in seeking to understand the drivers of poor quality recording and tailor their solutions accordingly – be they training, system and process improvement, supervision and leadership, culture
[normal] or capacity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Recent developments have included:- 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In October 2013, the force volunteered to be a pilot area for HMIC’s upcoming Crime Recording Inspection.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This offered valuable 
[normal]learning and opportunities to independently identify important areas for improvement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Through my oversight of internal quality audits and activity of the Crime Recording Gold Group, I feel confident that crime recording standards in Avon and Somerset ar
[normal]e improving and improving at a considerable pace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] I will continue to support the Constabulary in instilling an intelligent, ethical, open and transparent performance culture while continuing to drive improvements in crime recording standards and public se
[normal]rvice standards more generally.
