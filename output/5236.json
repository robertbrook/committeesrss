"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Medical Research Council (BTO0027)&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nResponses to the questions of the Science and Technology Committee\n \n&#xa0;\nAre UK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs sufficiently evidence-based? Is NHS Blood and Transplant overly restrictive about who can donate, or should greater precautions be taken to further reduce risk?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the health of individuals who carry abnormal prion proteins but have no symptoms, the lifetime risk of development of clinical vCJD in these people is unknown\n.\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor the recipients of donated blood or blood products or organs who may be\n at risk of\n infect\nion\n if they receive blood or tissue from infected, but asymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt remains the case that the risk of transmission by blood or blood products or organs from infected but asymptomatic donors is unknown and there are, as yet, no effective treatments to remove prion infection from the blood or indeed for prion disease itself.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of NHS Blood and Transplant’s strategy, “Taking Organ Transplantation to 2020”? What further changes could be made to safely increase the supply of blood and blood products, tissues and organs?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/Creutzfeldt.pdf\n vCJD and transfusion of blood components: an updated risk assessment: Bennett P and Daraktchiev M, DH Health Protection Analytical team, February 14\nth\n 2013\n PHE UK National Screening Committee Screening Portal: \nhttp://www.screening.nhs.uk/criteria\n EC Guideline for the CE marking of blood based in vitro diagnostic medical devices for vCJD based on detection of abnormal PrP – January 2012\n MHRA Guidance on the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC – August 2013\n \nThe board is chaired by the Chief Executive.
