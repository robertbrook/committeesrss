[[[Paul A Dowling â€“ Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I understand  that a bill on the subject of deregulation is currently under consideration and am writing to request that you seriously consider adding rights of way provisions  to the bill with the primary  aim of protecting our green lanes, ancient by-ways and National  Parks.&#xa0;The nature of the problem is that the use of motorised vehicles for accessing remote  areas of the countryside  has escalated significantly during recent times.  A new "sport" of off-reading has been created, and convoys of 4-wheel  drive vehicles and motor  cycles ("trail bikes") are now regularly driving on green lanes which were never constructed for the purpose.  These lanes have been used for centuries by walkers and horse riders, but within a few years the pounding and erosion caused by heavy motorised vehicles has reduced some of them to muddy, impassable quagmires or has worn them down until the bedrock  is exposed.&#xa0;The problem  is particularly severe in the Peak District National Park due to ease of access from cities like Sheffield, but we have also seen vehicles from as far away as Poland and Russia, attracted by organised rallies and events.  In some cases they drive over areas of protected heath land, they intimidate and endanger walkers or horse riders, and make the lanes impassable for anyone other than themselves.  Efforts at encouraging  the National Park authority and local Councils to limit or control  access have met with  limited success. The Councils, who have a duty to repair and maintain the lanes, are fighting a losing battle  with  their inadequate  funding and resources, the lanes are being destroyed  as fast as they can be repaired, and when the National Park Authority try to impose Traffic Regulation Orders on the worst  affected  lanes they are vigorously  opposed by the very large and very well organised off-reader organisations.&#xa0;This is a very serious and escalating situation whereby selfish behaviour by a minority user group threatens  to destroy some of our most magnificent countryside  and is significantly impacting the ability of a large majority of people to enjoy our National Parks as they were intended.&#xa0;I would urge you to seriously consider adding rights of way considerations to the Bill to protect  the national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from the damaging effects of off reading.&#xa0;Many thanks for your kind attention.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
