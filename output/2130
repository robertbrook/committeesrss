defaultSupport for EDF and NAT submissionsdefaultInclusion London supports the submission made by the Equality and Diversity Forum (EDF) and the National Aids Trust (NAT) submission, both of which raise concerns with 
defaultClause 2 – Employment Tribunal’s power to make recommendations and Clause 58 - new 
defaultduty for regulators to have regard to promoting economic growth when they reach decisions.  NAT also raises concerns 
defaultregarding, Clause

default2. Inclusion London evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultInclusion London is providing a very brief submission to raise an additional issue to EDF’s and NAT’s submission, regarding Schedule 8 Part 6 of the Draft Deregulation Bill, because we are concerned that it will further curtail disabled people’s access to rail travel.  
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultSummary of Inclusion London’s evidencedefaultInclusion London recommends that Schedule 8 Part 6, of the draft Deregulation Bill is removed altogether, because we believe that it will make it easier for rail operators to apply for exemptions to meeting accessibility requirements for disabled passengers. This will further inhibit disabled people’s access to rail travel, which will stop disabled people from taking up employment and volunteering opportunities and other opportunities in life, as well as preventing participation in cultural and social activities.

defaultAccessible transport    defaultAn accessible transport system is vital to enable disabled people to take up employment or volunteering opportunities and to participate in cultural and social activities. Yet, disabled people continue to face huge challenges with rail transport, as illustrated by 
defaultTanni
default Grey Thompson, who had to throw her wheelchair off the train and then crawl off because no one was on the platform to offer assistance
default. 
defaultEven the new line Cross rail, which is currently being built in London at the cost £14.8 of public money, will have 7 stations without step free access.  
default&#xa0;
defaultSchedule 8, Part 6defaultInclusion London is very concerned that Schedule 8 Part 6, of the draft Deregulation Bill will make it easier for rail operators to apply for exemptions to meeting accessibility requirements for disabled passengers. Inclusion London therefore recommends that Schedule 8, Part 6 is removed all together. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny changes in the regulations that weaken the responsibilities of rail operators to provide accessible rail travel is a move in the wrong direction. Inclusion London does not believe there is sufficient evidence to warrant this change, especially as it risks limiting disabled people’s access to rail travel even further.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposals in Draft Deregulation Bill 
defaultintend to reduce the burden of regulation on 
defaultbusiness,
default however, these changes should not be at the expense of disabled people’s access to rail travel.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThat concludes Inclusion London’s response.
