[[[&#xa0;]]]I welcome the opportunity to respond to this inquiry examining the condition of Britain’s food security based upon Defra’s objectives to support and develop British farming and encourage sustainable food production.I am currently an International Relations and Politics undergraduate at the University of Sheffield partaking in the Parliamentary Outreach Scheme. I am also the daughter of a small arable farmer in Herefordshire which means that I have experienced first-hand the impacts that governmental initiatives and policies have on British farmers. I will restrict my focus around the challenges facing arable farmers in the UK today in order to obtain British food security. &#xa0;

[[[The relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;machinery needed for modern food production. Contractors are commonly used across the UK by all sized estates because it is believed that there is more advantage in employing a seasonal contractor than employ full time workers. However, this balance is starting fall out of kilter where the increased costs of very costly endeavour, than accept the increasing costs surrounding the contractor’s bill. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
