defaultThe Additional Written Evidence is a submission by the author in his personal capacity. The Additional 
defaultEvidence presents examination of the 
defaultWorst Case Accident Scenario of bus full of school children being struck by a
default high speed train at an Automatic Half Barrier Crossing
default.  
defaultThe Case study shows that the societal risk resulting from a hazardous event of a train crash into bus carrying passenger
default(s) or workers at Automatic Half Barrier or Full Barrier Crossings or Unmanned Private Crossings are real and fall into intolerable zone.

defaultAuthor was employed at RSSB from 2004 till 2010 as a System Engineer and deployed the System for Railway Investigations Methodology at RSSB

defaultThis paper presents

defaultusing 
defaultthe System for Railway Investigations Methodology (SIRI)
default. An unpublished paper by author explored the risks of a bus-train 
defaultcollision and established the fact operating in knowledge based behaviour using the widely accepted Skill-Rules-Knowledge Framework will lead to a 
defaultfata
default bus and train collision due to the lack of effective measures to prevent such an occurrence
default (Appicharla,
default 2009)
default. 
defaultIn this 
defaultlatest 
defaultapplication, the
default SIRI Methodology explores two
default kinds of in
defaultterfaces. First, 
defaultinterfaces between the hazard (release event of uncontrolled energy), the victims and the system of barriers and controls to prevent the uncontrolled energy
default f
defaultrom harming the victims. Second, interfaces between information item available from historical accident data and using Bayesian approach to risk assessment for updating the information item to verify biases inherent in subject matter experts risk analysis
default.
default Examination of these interfaces 
defaultby the analyst 
defaultpresents a complete picture of human latent and active errors. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe aim of the study is to produce a
default comprehensive 
defaultdiscussion of factors that can contribute to a 
defaultpotential sever
defaulte
default accident as 
defaultusing the public
defaultly available data. The study results are submitted to the Transport Select Committee to inform their decision making
default process 
defaulton the theme of Safety at Level Crossings. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe study assumes that the actions

defaultin the aftermath of accident 
defaultare good and are not studied in this paper
default (Regulator, 2008)
default. 
defaultFurther, author has noted that the en
defaultvironments in which these professionals practice their skills are not regular, and not conducive to experimental observations. 
defaultAuthor has noted that BBC News has reported about certain NHS trust

defaultHowever, 
defaultthese human errors 
defaultthat occur

defaultIllusion of understanding is a term borrowed from Nobel Laureate, Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. The illusion of understanding is graphically illustrated in the enigmatic picture shown on the next page. 
defaultOur perceptions are not stable can be learnt from the double perception resulting from viewing the picture of a woman in the Figure
default 1. This can be treated as a case in epistemic blindness. 
defaultThe case of double perception is an active subjective of research for psychologists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAn
defaultother
default example of epistemic blindness is the legal case of Essex Level crossing Accident. Judge Turner accuse
defaultd Network Rail of "corporate blindness". He said: "The Company unreservedly apologises for its failures which contributed to the deaths of these young girls." Network Rail, in part by itself and in part through its predecessor 
defaultRailtrack
default, failed to ensure t
defaulthat the risks were properly assessed, controlled or managed." 
default 
defaultThe company concedes that the procedures or standards in place for conducting level crossing risk assessments before 2005 were deficient." (BBC News 2012)

defaultThere is a lack of awareness on the part of professionals working in the railway world-wide that accident and 
defaultrisk analysis form two parts of the same coin: successful 
defaultS
defaultystem 
defaultSafety M
defaultanagement. This lack of awareness is reflected in the way the formal requirements for accident and incident investigation are specified
default (RSSB, 2008)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe information structure 
defaultin th
defaulte RSSB mandated Railway Group Standard 
defaultimposed on the Infrastructure managers and railway undertakings to investigate accidents or incidents to establish
default the causes leading to the adverse or unwanted outcome are as under
default: 
defaulta) The events leading up to the a
defaultccident or incident 
defaultb) The immediate cause(s) 
defaultc) The underlying cause(s)
default&#xa0;

default) 
default drawn based upon the qualitative data provided by
default the RAIB Investigation Process reveals several 
defaulterrors that cannot be categorised
default into
default the
default aforementioned three categories. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe location o
defaultf stop signal ML 42 is an action taking by project personnel in 2003 when fitting the Train Protection Warning Signal at the Stop Signal 42. This latent event does not appear in the RAIB Report. Further, all organisations like RAIB/ORR/RSSB/Network Rail/AT
defaultOC/TOC/IRSE/BTP maintain studied silence over this aspect. Is TPWS required to be fitted to all stop signals at the level crossings? If yes, then why was it fitted to a signal that was not provided with adequate stop-distance? If TPWS is required to be fit
defaultted at all stop signals then why it is not fitted at stop signals to prevent trains crashing into vehicles with barriers raised? 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor does not have access to data which RAIB/RSSB/N
defaultetwork Rail/ TOC possess 
defaultand therefore is not in a position to answer th
defaultese questions. However, this igno
defaultrance does not prevent author

defaultIt is a world- wide phenomenon that in the case of level crossings, system of signalling rules and operational rules for front-line staff and their users constitute active safety (barriers) system in the eyes

defaultTwo accident cases of bus being trapped on the level crossings have come to author’s attenti
defaulton. The case of

default level crossing in 2000 where the bus driver managed to avert the accident by emptying the bus before it was struck. In 2003, a mini-bus carrying three workers was stuck. In 2012
default,

default bus got trapped. In another incident, the double

defaultThis data has been sourced from the data presented by RSSB to the UK Law Commission and can be found in the

default (Young, Septmeber 2013)
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor
default has assumed that RSSB’s aggregate risk estimate with

default the
default risk from a single collision event from risk manager’s perspective. However, socia
defaultl and political 
defaultperspective, a single

defaultof 25 fatalities 
defaulthas different meaning as shown by public response to Ladbroke Grove 
defaultaccident
default (Wolff, 2002)

defaultRRUKA industry co-chair Colin Dennis (Director of Policy, Research and Risk, R
defaultSSB), and George 
defaultBearfield
default (Head of Safety Knowledge and Planning, RSSB)
default have discussed the difficulty in predicting risk. In their address to the 
defaultRRUK 
defaultaudience in 2012, they 
defaultnoted that there is a lot of good data and information on past events, but that i
defaultt is not predictive and that the sheer length of processing time required means that it is at best giving an indication of the level of risk 6 months ago. The rail industry wants to have a better understanding of how risk might change in the future, so tha
defaultt we can plan for it and mitigate its effects, rather than just react to it with little time for thinking
default (RRUK, 2013)
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the foregoing self confession, author is unable to accept the claim that RSSB Safety Risk Model is the most advanced in the worl
defaultd and its justification for the support it gives to the safety assurance when it cannot identify accident pre-cursors involving local and wider human factors
default (RSSB, 2013)
default.   
defaultMoreover,  author drew reader’s attention 
defaultin October 2013 
defaultto the fact that ex Brit
defaultish Railway Boa
defaultrd members 
defaultthought that mean time between failures of the Solid State Interlocking System is 1,000 times the age of the Universe at the time of Newton Junction Accident in 1991. The Newton Junction Accident Report is freely available on the 
defaultRailway Archives website. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNobel Laurea
defaultte Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default cautioned 
defaultagainst blaming experts for their failing to forecast accurately in an unpredictable world (pp241)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default.  As per Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default claims for correct intuitions in an unpredicta
defaultble situation are self-delusional at best, sometimes worse. In the absence of valid- cues, intuitive “hits” are due to either luck or to lies. The rule to remember is that intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment
default. Author notes that this rule applies to author as well as 
defaulta 
defaultrailway firm’s executives.  
default&#xa0;
defaultArthur Schopenhauer noted in the early 19
defaultth
default century, that firms have a tendency of issuing bank notes without making adequate capital provision(pp123)
default (Schopenhaeur,
default 1813/2006)
default. This tendency is still prevalent among firms in the 21
defaultst
default century has become public knowledge in 2008. Arthur Schopenhauer argued that both David Hume and Immanuel Kant did not comprehend the phenomena of cau
defaultsation correctly (pp106)
default (Schopenhae
defaultur, 1813/2006)
default. Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell argued
default 
defaultArthur Schopenhauer did not refute inductive hypothesis advanced by David Hume in his treatise of History of Western Philosophy
default (Russell, 1945)
default.  
defaultHowever, with the Bayesian approach to accident and risk analysis by advanced by 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel
default 
defaultKahneman
default, objection raised against Arthur Schopenhauer is no longer tenable. 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default draws our attention to the fact that an insti
defaulttutional risk manager acting as an agent on behalf of an organisation has to note the decision dilemma between intensely loss-averse moral attitudes and efficient risk management has no simple 
defaultand 
defaultcompelling solution (
defaultpp342).  However, GB Rail industry exe
defaultcutives behave as if 
defaultthey have a simple and compelling solution to the problem of harm arising at level crossings: educate 
defaultand enforce rules and regulations on 
defaultthe public. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRoger Ford echoes author’s sentiments. 
defaultRoger Ford writes in the latest issue of Modern Railways that the past president of IRSE, Francis How, explained 
defaultwhy concept of “safety” went missing 
default  
defaultfrom the Rail Technical Strategy Leadership’s document. Because Britain’s railways are among the safest 
defaultin Europe and while it I always important to look for ways of improving safety that it is not our most important priority in terms of achieving a major improvement
default (Ford, November, 2013)
default. 
defaultRoger Ford’s solution is to set up a new discipline called Transitio
defaultn Safety Management to deal with changes and how to maintain safety during those changes so that we do not lose safety on the way.  
default&#xa0;
defaultRisk assessor
defaults and electronic 
defaultengineers’
default constant refrain is that o
defaultf inherent uncertainty at the atomic level of matter.  
defaultLet us consider their objection. 
defaultAtomic physicists are aware of the striking feature of the unstable particles in the atomic world is their stability. No excited state of atom is truly discrete, stationary and permanent. For example, an electron orbiting B
defaultohr’s orbit during a time period of 10
default-15 
defaultseconds lives in that state for a period of 10
default-8 
defaultseconds. During this period 
defaultof 10
default-8 
defaultseconds, an electron goes through

default (pp46)
default (Merzbacher, 1961)
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, if we extend the 
defaultNobel Laureate’s 
defaultBohr’s model to the entire universe
default under the th
defaultesis that everything is produced 
defaultby chance occurrence
default 
defaultleads to 
defaultan absurd conclusion
default.  
defaultWe cannot be actors and observe all results of our actions at the same time. 
default 
defaultBut risk assessors and institutional risk ma
defaultnagers continue to operate in the GB Railways as if we were living in an atomic world full of changes without any measure of certainty and level crossing users possess either dull intellects or are risk takers.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLet us consider the proposition that n
defaulto one has experienced that a lotus flower can be produced by an apple tree and vice versa. 
defaultArthur Schopenhauer recognised this fact
default, like G.W 
defaultLibeniz
default, before him. 
default 
defaultArthur Schopenhauer drew attention to the fact that 
defaultapplication of 
defaultthe empirical principle o
defaultf causation 
defaultto anything apart from 
defaultchanges in the states of empirical given world is an abuse of the 
defaultprinciple (
defaultpp110)
default (Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)
default. 
defaultAuthor notes that analogous type 
defaultof reasoning led Nobel Laurea
defaultte, Erwin Schrodinger, to formulate 
defaulthis famous t
defaulthought
default experiment
default, Cat experiment. The consideration of Schrodinger Cat experiment can lead one to 
defaultlearn how Schrödinger to sought

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf we assume that the above data is po

defaulttendency then it is 
defaultpossible
default to work out 
defaultthe mea

defaultThe confidence interval is a range of values. Your sample mean, x, is at the centre

defaulty of obtaining a sample mean further from μ0 than x is greater than alpha; for any population mean, μ0, not in this range, the probability of obtaining a sample mean further from μ0 than x is less than alpha. In other words, assume that we use x, 
defaultstandard_
defaultdev
default, and size to construct a two-tailed test at significance level alpha of the hypothesis that the population mean is μ0. Then we will not
default 
defaultreject 
defaultthat
default hypothesis if μ0 is in the confidence interval and will reject that hypothesis if μ0 is not in the confidence interval. The confidence interval does not allow us to infer that there is probability 1 – alpha that our next package will take a delivery time 
defaultthat is in the confidence interval.
default 
defaultTherefore, based upon the alpha of .05 and a three sigma deviation, the confidence interval for the data set of fatalities is computed to 
defaulta mean value of 
default17.78 ± 1.75978
default. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultwe find that range of 
defaultfatalities
default o
defaultbserve
defaultd fall outside this range
default. Therefore, the thesis of 3 sigma deviation is not true. We must seek an alternate figure to satisfy the dispersion in the data. Based
default u
defaultpon the alpha of .05 and 
default80
default sigma deviation, the confidence interval for the data set of fatal
defaultities
default is worked out to a mean value of 
default17.78±

default. 
defaultAuthor is unable to comprehend how 
defaultany risk assessor 
defaultcan
default find any 
defaultmeaningful 
defaultpattern 
defaultof risk 
defaultfrom such widely dispersed data of fatalities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNow, let us consider how our intuitive explanations 
defaultmis
default-lead u
defaults into thinking 
defaultthat 
defaultwe comprehend the causal factors correctly. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe application of 
defaultBayes
default Rules is argued by Nobel Laureate, Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default is chapter 16 of his treatise
default on human thinking (pp166-167)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default.  The case 
defaultscenario
default involves a hit-r
defaultun accident in the night. First, information item is that there are 85% of the cabs operating in the city of Blue colour. The second information item is that eye witness identified the car as blue one. The third information item is that the witness reliabi
defaultlity in successfully identifying the two colours is 80% of the time. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Box 1 below is an application of 
defaultBayes’s
default rule to infer the changes in the 
defaultenvironment
default. This example is drawn from the medical science paper published in Nature magazine in 2009
default (The
defaultodore J Perkins, 2009)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe prior probability of an un-observed random variable X, based upon the another random variable say Y is observed
default can be computed using the Bayesian rule
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the case of hit and run scenario, the variable X takes a value of 0.15 
defaultbased upon the prior probability. Given the fact that an eye witness account has observed a blue colour, and the reliability of the eye witness to be 80%, we can update our prior pro
defaultbability information in the following way. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe visualisation of the above relation between two random variables X and Y is shown in Figure 
default3
default.
default This depicts the four –fold pattern suggested by 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel
default 
defaultKahneman
default(pp 310-333)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. Au
defaultthor 
defaultas noted the 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel
default 
defaultKahneman
default insight that decision weights that people assign to outcomes are not identical to the probabilities of these outcomes. This insight was revealed 
defaultin form of 
defaultthe subjective biases on the part of 
defaultmembers of 
defaultJap
defaultanese civil engineering society and executives of 
defaultnuclear
default plant operator, supplier and other agencies whose actions contributed to the Japanese Nuclear Accident studied by author
default (Appicharla, 2013)
default.

defaultP( Y = Not Green / X = Not Green)

default 
defaultP(X = Not Green)  
default = .15*.8 =.12
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, 
defaultP(X = Not Green / Given Y= Blue) = .12/.29 = .0041 = 41%. This 
defaultresult 
defaultis different 
defaultfrom 15% base rate information as well as 80% of the eye witness reliability
default available to us to form a risk judgement on the road accident. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSimilarly, in
default the 
defaultcase of level crossing accident, railway firm’s world-wide informs
default us that 90% of the times, the
default system of barriers and co
defaultntrols were ON
default 
defaultie
default they were closed
default. 
defaultBy this statement
default it
default is meant that the user of level crossing is presented with adequate audio-visual warning of impending danger in the form of a train. 
defaultThis may be called as the variable X. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEye witness accoun
defaultts inform us that bus driver 
defaultran past the closed barriers. Assuming that the eye witness reliability is 90%, we can update our prior information 
defaultin 
defaultfollowing
default way 
defaultusing the
default above examples. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultP( X = Barriers 
default 
defaultON
default) 
default/ Y= Barriers 
defaultON
default) 
default= P (Y= Barrier 
defaultON
default / X= Barrier OFF
default)*P (X= Barrier OFF
default) +
default P 
default(Y
default = Barriers ON /X = Barriers ON
default) *P (X = Barriers 
defaultON
default)
default 
default= .9*.9+.1*.1= 
default0.82. 
defaultNow, 
defaultP (Y= Barrier ON / X= Barrier ON)*P (X= Barrier ON) = .9*.9= .81
default&#xa0;
defaultTherefore, 
defaultP(X = Barriers ON) / Y= Barriers ON
default) = .81/.82= 98.7%.  Thus, our prior information Rate has been updated from 90% to 98.7%. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAt first sight, t
defaulthe above calculation seems to support the railway firms’ idea that railway firms are not responsible for the accidents conditioned on the fact
defaultual
default e
defaultye witness account attest to the idea that barriers were ON at the time of accident. However, 
defaultif 
defaultour information from eye witness 
defaultaccount 
defaultis
default not 
defaultreliable
default then railway 
defaultfirms’
default 
defaultclaim is 
defaultnot tenable. For example, in the a
defaultbove historical data, only four
default cases o
defaultf 
defaultthe 
defaultbus crashes have eye witness accounts. If we use this figure, then our prior informati
defaulton will get updated to = .9*.16/(.9*.16+..875)= 62%
default or 
defaultfrom 90% to 
default62
default%. 
defaultThis subtle point is overlooked by many railway authorities
default and executives and staff of railway firms
default. 
default An example of this
default lack of eye-witness account can be explained by the level crossing accident in 2001
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultMoulinearn
default level crossing near 
defaultBallinluig
default in Perth and Kinross
default has seen fatal accidents in 1953, 200
default1 and 2009. The 1953 and 2001 accidents were investigated and the gate operator and road user were blamed by railway firms British Railway Board and 
defaultRailtrack
default respectively. It is not clear to author as to why RAIB failed to investigate the 2009 accident. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe previous quantitative risk assessments by Prof Stott’s review showed that 1.62 parts in 10,000 were admitted in UK HSE 1998 document
default. The QRA conducted in 1987 did recommend a conversion of automatic level crossings. In comparison with the above figu
defaultre, the risk figure worked out earlier as 1.92 parts in 10,000 require an intervention to improve the protection afforded to 
defaultthe level
default crossing users. 
defaultNobel Laureate Daniel 
defaultKahneman
default insight that the structure of complex system involving many components wit
defaulth low failure rates may have overall high probability of failure due anchoring bias is relevant here(pp428)
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor has noted the fact researcher(s) in safety critical domain tend to disto
defaultrt risk communications. But author thinks that they are ready to consider the errors in reviewing published literature. 
defaultFour
default examples known to the author is discussed below
default in relation to the current risk regulating regime
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, 
defaultAuthor came across a pa
defaultper in 1998 that claims that unreliability (wrong side failures) of the Automatic Half barriers was less than 2
default% 
default(
defaultHessami, March 1998)
default. The same percep
defaulttion prevails on the part of ex-HMRI personnel like Stanley Hall 
defaultand train driving experts think that lev
defaultel crossing(s) never fail unsafely (Hall.S &amp; Mark, 2008). 
default&#xa0;
defaultSecond, i
defaultn a review of the author’s published paper in 2010, the research conducted by DNV for the European Railway Agency has drawn conclusions contradicting author’s own conclusions (DNV, June 2
default013). The report can be accessed from the ERA website. The exact review is reproduced on the next page. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor had raised the issue with the European Railway Agency and DNV. The corrections suggested by author to the DNV and ERA are as the following via 
defaultprivate communication on 29 October 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSynopsis of paper. The final sentence could be re-written to state that “This revealed situations in which a hazard arose for one 
defaultdutyholder
default and the mitigation was not controlled by a separate 
defaultdutyholder
default and hence
default in disaggregating the system level standards, measures such as these were lost”.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLearning points relevant to risk regulation regimes and implications for the EU rail risk regulation regime. It should be made clear that these are DNVs interpretation and no
defaultt the authors.
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLimitations. It should be made clear that the author’s experiences relate to the UK rail environment between 2006 and 2010.
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther references of note. SA requested that the reference to “Taking Safe Decisions” be removed as he had reference
defaultd it in the study in a negative sense (i.e. being critical of its findings) and by including it as a reference of interest it might be construed that the study supported it.
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor is waiting 
defaultfor 
defaultthe European Railway Agency’s 
defaultresponse to the above as DNV 
defaulthas
default expressed their readiness to amend their research. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSIRI 2010 paper had drawn attention to this fact stating that other statutory bodies like Highways Authority or Local Councils and private individuals are involved in the matter and these interfaces 
defaultneed to be included in the Risk Equation. The UK Law Commission have published their recommendations to the Ministry of Transport in September 2013 to amend the law to allow duty of co-operation to be extended beyond the Infrastructure Manager and Railway 
defaultUndertaking to other statutory authorities as well to facilitate faster closure of level crossings and bring all level crossings to be regulated by the UK Health and Safety at Work 1974 Act.
default&#xa0;
defaultThird, if the UK Law Commission has recommended that the law
default on level crossings be reformed in September 2013 to align with the UK HSE Best Practice for Risk Management, then how can the GB Industry claim that they were complaint with the law as the law as it applies t
defaulto the level crossings itself found to be incons
defaultistent and complex to apply? 
default&#xa0;
defaultFourth, t
defaulthe 
defaultaccident investigator 
defaultand train driver account of the safety critical incident are not reliable
default due to hindsight bias
default in operation
default. The observations of accident and train driver’s information 
defaultcannot be included in
default the Bayesian inference process as the random variable X is unobservable
default in the risk analysis
default (Kahneman, 2011)
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThus, from Bayesian application to risk assessment(s), it is impo
defaultrtant to recognise five
default facts. First
default, it is possible to use two information i
defaulttems through the Bayesian Rule to infer about the unobserved random variable. Two, reliability of the eye witness accounts must be known beforehand. 
default 
defaultThird, for truly random process, the probabilities
default from relative frequency interpretation
default cannot exceed 50
default%. 
default 
defaultFourth, we are not intuitive Bayesians. Fifth, we become 
defaultLaplacians
default due to operation of hindsight bias. 
default&#xa0;
defaultApart from the 
defaultpotential 
defaultaccident analysis, the study has shown that research in the molecular systems biology argue that Bayesian approach is relevant in the 
defaultdecision making area of risk analysis. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default 
defaultchances of
default a train-bus collision increase with the following conditions
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proximity of schools, farms, structure of roads leading to the AHB/ABCL and Unmanned Private Crossings afford chances of greater harm.  Apart from the long term measures of replacing lev
defaultel crossings with suitable replacement like bridges etc, intermediate measures to safe-guard against loss of protection can be made. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs reported by the Telegraph report in 2012
default, it is 
defaultclear,
default as ruled by the 
defaultMagistrate, it
default is better to mandate 
defaulta clear 
defaultvehicle 
defaultspace be afforded to the bus drivers
default ( and others as well)
default before they follow the traffic onto the crossing space. 
default 
defaultWith this measure specified for the bus drivers, it is also mandatory that TPWS be installed at the stop signal to prevent a train e
defaultntering the crossing space when the barriers are raised. Modifications to the signalling systems and Highway Agency’s Rules and Regulations may be necessary as a result. 
defaultUnwanted occurrences like increased costs of signalling projects, 
default costs of civil engi
defaultneering projects, 
defaultwaiting times at the level crossings, reduction in BTP police to monitor level crossings after a period 
defaultetc are tasks for economists and lawyers to argue over and is beyond the data available to the author. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe idea that a vehicle stopp
defaulting ahead behind the level crossing barriers 
defaultcan be treated as a barrier 
defaultadvanced by Professor Stott’s Review 
defaultdoes not accord
default with the UK HSE Best Practice for Risk Management. This practice calls for designing safety into the system. 
defaultImproving crash worth
defaultiness of train vehicle from the collision with a vehicle on the level crossings may be appealing to few engineers and organisations
default. But this method of 
defaultpassive barrier system is not so appealing if the crashing event can be prevented in first place by othe
defaultr engineering measures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn all the accident studies studied using the SIRI Methodology, author found that 
defaulta stakeholder
default in the form of s
defaultuppliers, operator, and /or a researcher 
defaulthad a premonition of danger and made efforts to stop the operations 
defaultor limit 
defaultthe damage
default. The examples of Fukushima 2011, Space Shuttle Challenger 1986 illustrate this point
default and refute the Charles Per rows Normal Accident Theory
default (Perrow, 1984)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Additional Written Submission examined the worst case accident scenario 
defaultof bus-train collision 
defaultusing the SIRI Methodology taking into account insights generated by Nobel Laureate Daniel 
defaultKahnman’s
default treatise on human thinking about rare events and risk as
defaultsessments. The case study showed that the potential accident has a high probability of failure of 1.92 parts in 10,000   and in comparison to the UK HSE 1987 study that revealed a risk of 1.6 parts in 10,000
default. The
default 
default1987 
defaultdocument called for improvement in the
default working of level crossings. 
defaultThis study complements other Submissions made already. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAuthor appeals to the members of Transport Select Committee to introduce reforms to improve protection afforded to road users keeping in view the various types of road us
defaulters.
