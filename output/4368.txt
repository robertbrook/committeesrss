&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (LTD0008)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Civil Engineering Contractors Association (CECA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the above named call for evidence. &#xa0;CECA provides the voice for those companies who create, improve and maintain the UK’s vital transport and utility networks. Our membership of more than 300 companies together delivers an estimated 70-80 per cent of all infrastructure construction work carried out nationwide. Our industry supports the employment of around 200,000 people with annual activity worth up to £25 billion.&#xa0;CECA cautiously welcomes the introduction of local decision making on transport expenditure. While there is a long way to go before the success of the policy can be measured, it is clear that greater integration between bodies operating at local and regional level is required to enable effective delivery.  &#xa0;CECA is concerned that there is a lack of clarity as to how the funding will be allocated and how local bodies are expected to work together to deliver major transport projects. We call on Government to work with all bodies involved in the future delivery of local transport projects to address this to ensure that any proposed developments are not burdened from the start by confusion.&#xa0;In our response, we have focused on the areas in which we believe we can add the most value. We trust that you find our comments helpful and that they will be taken into consideration.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Rationale]]]&#xa0;The 2010 Coalition Agreement clearly set out the current Government’s localist intentions and the Localism Act devolved decision making powers from central government to individuals, communities and councils.&#xa0;In 2010 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) were announced taking over the role of Regional Development Agencies in terms of promoting local economic growth.&#xa0;CECA believes that good transport is key to local economic growth and acknowledges the view that only local bodies can identify transport needs in their area and deliver appropriate solutions. &#xa0;Over the past few years responsibility for funding and decision making for local major transport schemes and the regional rail network have been devolved. Transport has played a key role in the City Deals and funding for transport majors is being devolved to Local Transport Bodies via LEPs.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Advantages and disadvantages]]]&#xa0;CECA believes that the introduction of Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) could play a key role in improving decision-making on local transport expenditure. LTBs remove the need for a centralised bidding process and monetary bidding thresholds and ensure decisions are made locally rather than introducing centralised and one-sized fits all solutions from Westminster.&#xa0;However, CECA remains concerned that the proposals to devolve funding for transport to local bodies may lead to a lack of strategic decision-making in local communities. CECA supports the proposal for local communities to be able to make decisions in relation to their area. However we remain concerned about a potential lack of collaborative working between LEPs and other local bodies to deliver significant projects across their geographical boundaries.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Are there better models?]]]&#xa0;Given that LTBs are not yet in full operation, it is hard to tell whether they will be effective solutions. However, CECA notes that there are already some examples of how local decision making on transport expenditure is proving to be a success. &#xa0;London transport is perhaps the best example of effective local decision making. In London all transport policy and funding is decided by the Mayor’s Office and put into place by Transport for London (TfL). Transport policies developed by TfL have improved services, reduced journey times and reduced congestion within Greater London. However, it is important to note that London is the only city in the UK to have developed such an integrated, locally focused and locally delivered transport system. &#xa0;Desk based research has suggested that the model adopted in Barcelona is a good international example of organisation and innovation. In this case governance takes the form of a joint management board and joint executive committee with equal membership between the Catalonian Government and local authorities. Notably the Barcelona model is funded by the state government, the Catalonian government and by local authorities. As a result of collaborative working, Barcelona has gained a reputation for transport innovation. Furthermore, there have been improvements in customer satisfaction and passenger growth.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]CECA believes that while the bodies referenced above will have excellent knowledge of their individual organisational challenges, they may need assistance in working together effectively as a delivery body. &#xa0;We believe that local bodies are best placed to decide what the transport priorities are in their area, although they should be supported in their decision-making process through the availability of robust evaluation models that have been developed by the Department of Transport. This will build confidence that any decisions taken are evidence-based rather than politically motiovated. &#xa0;When it comes to the delivery of schemes many local authorities face limitations on the resources available to them, with limited experience of the challeneges associated with the delivery of occasional large projects, CECA proposes the creation of a transport ‘Flying Squad’ to assist local bodies in the development of such major infrastructure projects. Such a group could include, for example, representatives from industry and central Government working in partnership with local bodies to ensure that the most effective and beneficial projects are developed. The flying squad could also provide expertise on procurement practice to minimise cost and delay.&#xa0;An example of collaborative working can also be found in the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Box 1: Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme]]]&#xa0;The Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme is a private-led partnership (comprising CECA, the Royal Town Planning Institute, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and local project co-ordinators). The partnership aims to progress stalled local infrastructure projects with potential to release economic growth by resolving barriers to progress.&#xa0;Multidisciplinary teams of experts (working on a pro-bono basis) nominated by the partnership have been invited by local authorities to assist a small number of local projects in the first wave.&#xa0;The partnership approach involves face-to-face interaction with local partners to uncover and understand barriers to progress. Typical barriers include local co-ordination and capacity issues as much as, or rather than, access to finance.&#xad;&#xad;&#xad;&#xad;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;CECA’s primary concern with regard to the devolution of transport decision-making to local bodies relates to how such organisations deal with opportunities to invest in infrastructure where doing so crossed boundaries. Effective long-term planning with cross-authority support and cooperation is essential to delivering projects to time and to budget. &#xa0;A case in point can be seen in the Atlantic Gateway redevelopment in North West England which highlights the need for greater integration at local and regional level. The redevelopment project crosses three LEP areas and over a dozen local authorities. A small steering group has been established, but CECA feels that its focus is more on promoting the project rather than programme management, funding, co-ordination, joining up employment and training. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In order to further ensure delivery of cross-boundary projects, CECA calls on Government to intervene when it becomes apparent that local bodies are not working together effectively. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]The effectiveness of collaborative working varies across the UK. To ensure that these variations do not continue after 2015, CECA calls on Government to ensure that LEPs in partnership with local bodies give and demonstrate real consideration as to what will be best for their local community. &#xa0;It is essential that the right evidence based approach is adopted for all local decision making. Transport solutions must come from solid, independent, research rather than tailoring evidence to develop a project. In this regard, CECA recommends that local communities continue to work closely with the Department for Transport (DfT) to develop an approved evidence collection and transport solution model. &#xa0;CECA would not wish to see a scenario where local bodies attempt to ensure that every areas gets its “share” of funding if this stands in the way of delivering the most economical and socially beneficial projects. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The way that Government funds major local transport projects will radically change from 2015 when major transport scheme funding is devolved to LEPs as part of the Single Local Growth Fund.&#xa0;The funding, taken from existing Whitehall funds will enable LEPs to bid for funding from a “single pot”. CECA believes that the funding, if used effectively, has the potential to rebalance the economy through the development of ambitious local transport schemes and will enable LEPs and Local Transport Bodies to show what real added value they can bring. CECA anticipates that if the devolution of funding is successful, more will follow for further projects. &#xa0;However, we remain concerned that money allocated through the Growth Fund for transport projects could be diverted to other, non-transport projects. CECA suggests that once funding is allocated to a particular project, it remains ring-fenced specifically for that project. We hope that clear guidance will be provided to those in receipt of Growth Deal funding. &#xa0;The provision of major project funding devolution and the Single Local Growth fund opens up the potential of improved visibility of future investment. &#xa0;Clear pipeline visibility is essential to ensure that cross boundary transport schemes are delivered effectively. Significant benefits and efficiencies will arise where greater forward visibility is available to the supply chain in terms of future investment. The key benefits associated with pipeline visibility are listed below, but CECA remains concerned that there is no pipeline visibility for local transport after 2015. &#xa0;&#xa0;For these reasons we believe that a condition should be placed on those receiving Single Local Growth Fund  that they publish and maintain a forward pipeline of the infrastructure investments that they anticipate supporting. In doing so they will ensure the best possible response from industry, securing efficient delivery and local job creation.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
