"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Mariela Ruiz [FBB0013]&#xa0;\nI disagree w\nith the idea of some actresses acting and dressing like men and some \nactors dressing\n and acting like women \nON CHILDREN PROGRAMES\n such us CBeebies\n. This \nswapping gender \nconfuses children. I strongly believe that \nchildren should\n be encouraged to have \na \nvery clear\n knowledge on\n the difference between men and woman.\nI am ta\nl\nking about \nAunt P\nolly on the programme \nS\nomething\n Special and Gail\n Force and Sue Keeper\n on Gigglebiz \nIn the same way,\n Sid who keep\ns\n dressing and acting like a wo\nmen and Rebecca who keep dressing and acting like men on the programme Lets Play.\nI donâ€™t understand the necessity on this. Therefore, I \nshare this view with other mums who agree with me. \nPlease, stop \nsuch performances.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
