[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1) 
[normal]In light of recent discussions in the Select Committee on the future of the BBC, I am writing to share my thoughts on its value to the WI as the largest women’s voluntary organization in the UK, and some of my own personal thoughts on
[normal] the role the BBC has played throughout my life.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2)
[normal]As a membership charity continually seeking to share and celebrate the range of opportunities and experiences open to members across the UK, BBC news programming has been vital in promoting the WI.  From discussing members’ essential work throughout the ye
[normal]ars of debate on farmgate milk prices on 
[normal]Farming Today
[normal], to the news that 350 women queued to join a new WI in Bristol on 
[normal]The Today Programme
[normal] that led to days of positive media interest of other sources, the BBC has always taken a keen – and very welcomed –
[normal] interest in what WI members get up to across the UK, and has been a very valued supporter of the organization.  I couldn’t list all of the items featured throughout the BBC relating to the WI; but from a small mention of a local event on a regional radio 
[normal]station leading to increased footfall and women interested in joining, to a discussion of how people’s perception of the WI is changing on 
[normal]The Archers
[normal] opening the eyes of those who thought the WI was not for them but then gave a local meeting a try; the BB
[normal]C has sought to share real people’s experiences to support the valued work done by members in their local communities, regional areas and on a national stage.  We sincerely believe that this has played a key role in promoting the organization to a much wid
[normal]er audience than would be possible otherwise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3)
[normal]Aside from news programming, anecdotally we are aware of how much members enjoy programmes such as 
[normal]Strictly Come Dancing
[normal], and 
[normal]The Great British Bake Off
[normal].  We were in close communications with the programme
[normal] makers from the beginning of 
[normal]The Great British
[normal] 
[normal]Bake Off
[normal] to promote it to members who were seen as a key target audience, and the resurgence of baking is often credited in print media to increasing interest in the WI coupled with the huge success of the sh
[normal]ow, which is a credit to these close working relationships.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4)
[normal]The most important aspect, however, is the educational role that the BBC plays with its impartial, well balanced and well researched programming.  The WI is an educational charity and WI mem
[normal]bers are keen to expand their horizons through informal learning processes.  The BBC is the most valuable source of informal learning the UK has and our members’ lives would be much poorer without it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5)
[normal]I hope you will allow me also to add some personal 
[normal]observations.  When I first came to the UK in late 1970s, the BBC was my lifeline.  With very little money, I listened to the radio all the time.  It was a source of education about the English language and about my new country, and amazingly, this rich so
[normal]urce of information and entertainment was free.  I know that my integration into British society was made possible with a generous contribution by BBC radio and I am grateful for it.  I have continued my happy listening relationship with Radio 4, the 
[normal]BBC W
[normal]orld Service, Radio 4 
[normal]Extra and Radio 3 ever since.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope the above is of some help, but please let me know if you would like any further information.
