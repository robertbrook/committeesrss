[[[Statement on Biodiversity Offsets]]]&#xa0;This is a short statement of the Aldersgate Group’s position on biodiversity offsets. The Group’s full response to the current Green Paper is being prepared for the 7th November response deadline.The Aldersgate Group believes that good environmental regulation can encourage innovation and resource efficiency, thereby aiding economic growth as well as enhancing the environment. As stated in our 2011 publication, Pricing the Priceless, this view applies to biodiversity and ecosystems. We believe that biodiversity offsets can be an appropriate tool to help with wildlife conservation objectives in England under certain conditions. However, current levels of understanding of biodiversity offsetting in our membership and wider society, while increasing, have a low starting point. Therefore Aldersgate Group members believe that if biodiversity offsetting is to be used then time is needed to design an effective system, and that such a system should be based on a mandatory requirement to offset residual impacts on biodiversity to achieve no net loss. We see the need for further work on the right conditions for biodiversity offsets to work well. At present, and in line with Aldersgate Group principles, we think that the right conditions for an offsets market that helps wildlife and business include:There is an issue for our members to be able to trust any offsets policy to improve the status of biodiversity in England given the Government’s prioritisation of growth of GDP as its overriding objective. However, actions can be taken to build that trust, such as ensuring there is an independent regulator of offsets activity with a duty (rather than just relevant powers) to carry out its functions. Further details of the biodiversity offsets system that need to be worked out include how it would treat species of concern, how it would deliver objectives for habitat connectivity (in line with the Lawton Review), and stronger links to existing policy objectives and tools for biodiversity (eg how to complement existing protected areas) and in the planning system (eg local area plans). There is a business case for biodiversity offsets that needs to be better articulated than is presently the case in the green paper and accompanying impact assessment. In particular, more efficient use can be made of resources currently used for biodiversity protection during the planning process. Aldersgate Group members have relevant evidence in this area that Government should investigate in more detail. Our long-term view is that net gain of biodiversity, as part of restoration of ecosystems, is an appropriate objective in the UK. The long-term aim of a biodiversity offsets system in England should be net positive impact on biodiversity, in line with the principles of the Lawton Review, rather than no net loss. As well as increasing the condition of ecosystems, offsetting should also aim to allow developers to use existing land more effectively. It can potentially create a large market. We recognise that biodiversity offsets can conflict with local levels of other ecosystem services (such as recreation or regulating surface water drainage). Offsets can be designed to take these services into account, but doing so requires more complexity. At present, retaining the value of these ecosystem services should be remain the responsibility of existing functions in the planning system. &#xa0;23 October 2013&#xa0; Aldersgate Group (November 2011) Pricing the Priceless: the business case for action on biodiversity.
