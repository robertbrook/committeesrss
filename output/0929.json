"Written evidence from the Royal College of General Practitioners (LTC 93)&#xa0;The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is the largest membership organisation in\n&#xa0;\nthe United Kingdom solely for GPs. Founded in 1952, it has over 46,000 members who are committed to improving patient care, developing their own skills and promoting general practice as a discipline. We are an independent professional body with enormous expertise in patient–centred generalist clinical care. \n&#xa0;Executive Summary &#xa0;\nWe welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Inquiry. Caring for patients with long term conditions is at the core of day-to-day practice for GPs, with such patients representing over 50% of GP appointments\n.\n \nGPs have a vital role to play in supporting those living with long term conditions because:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe increasing prevalence of long term conditions is one of the biggest challenges currently facing our health and social care systems. We need a shared vision for how we adapt to meet this challenge at a time when the UK's population is ageing and funding is predicted to remain flat.\n \nT\nhe following will be vital to delivering a successful strategy on long term conditions:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n              \nShifting resources into primary care: The primary care team\n will be vital to any successful future model of support for patients with long term condi\ntions. H\nowever, the system of funding for NHS services remains skewed towards hospitals care. Over 2010/11 and 2011/12 spending on general practice fell in real terms (compared to real terms increases for hospital care, mental health and community health services). If we are serious about anticipating the \ncare needs of those with long term conditions and putting them in control of their care, we must look at how we can provide primary care – where 90% of patient contact with the NHS takes place – with better resources.\n&#xa0;\nResponse to specific issues highlighted by the Select Committee &#xa0;1. Defining 'long-term conditions'&#xa0;\nGiven the Committee's stated aim to review the definition of long-term conditions, RCGP offers the following proposed wording:\n&#xa0;\nA long term condition is any medical condition\n that cannot currently be cured but can be managed with the use of medication and/or other therapies. This is in contrast to acute \nc\nonditions which typically have a finite duration such as a respiratory infection, an inguinal hernia or a mild episode of depression.\n&#xa0;\nAs with many concepts in healthcare, there are likely to be many different interpretation\ns\n of what constitutes a long term condition. Ultimately, the best means of defining what is an\nd\n isn't a long term condition, and making decisions about \ncare requirements\n, is as part of a conversation between an individual and their doctor (usually a GP). \n&#xa0;\n2. Moving care out of hospitals and into the community – are we ready?&#xa0;\nI\nt is vital that in the coming years we see a major shift towards managing and planning 'whole person' patient care in the community, moving away from the focus on treating individual \nepisodes\n of illness in secondary care. The \nincreasing\n prevalence of long term conditions and multiple morbidity mean that the ‘status quo’ is not an option\n.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, \nwe \nabsolutely must avoid moving care out of hospitals without \nfirst establishing\n a clear plan for how services in the community \nshould\n to be organised and resourced to accommodate this\n change\n. In RCGP's view we need to effect change in three key areas:\n&#xa0;\n(i) Service redesign, care planning and ‘communities of practice’&#xa0;\nWe need to establish new models of generalist-led care in the community in order to meet the changing needs of patients with long term conditions. Currently \nit is s\nt\nill the norm\n that different professionals work within their own organisational silos, funding systems and cultures. We need to redesign services in a way that encourages shared ownership and responsibility for ensuring that those with long term conditions are supported to manage and plan their own care.\n&#xa0;\nOn\ne potential model is to create multi-disciplinary teams\n \nbased with\nin primary care\n.\n This consists of different health care professionals, drawn from the wider primary care team, working together to deliver routine care, health advice and case management to high-risk patients. The model ensures such patients have access to longer appointment times, and health professionals are trained in skills such as chronic dise\nase management, shared decision\n making and prevention. \n&#xa0;\nAnother\n powerful \ntool\n is care planning\n, an approach pioneered by the diabetes ‘Year of Care’ initiative (se\ne section 5 below)\n. This involves agreeing\n a plan to improve an individual’s health and well-being, and co-ordinating across a range of health, social care and other professionals to ensure the provision of support and services to address the patient’s needs.\n \nThere is strong evidence that care planning c\na\nn improve outcomes for patients, reduced \nunnecessary\n hospital admissions and save money\n.\n \nWe\n now need\n to\n embed care planning into the 'core business' of general practice and other parts of the system.\n \nRCGP \nis hosting\n a consortium of charities and primary care organisations \nto develop \na set of 'communities \nof\n practice'\n in \na number of \npilot locations\n in the UK\n.\n These \nwill work together to break \ndown \nbarriers to change,\n agreeing the redesign of \nservices\n,\n developing\n \nshared \nrisk stratification metrics, determining how to share resources and agreeing u\nse of IT to support the process\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nFinally, Under the right circumstances, pooled budgets can help to drive integration between health and social care, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients and reduced hospital admissions.\n \nHowever, safeguards are needed to prevent cost shifting between service areas, by using means such as tying the use of funds to the delivery of jointly agreed outcomes based on shared needs analysis, and the application of open book accounting procedures.\n \nPersonal health budgets potentially offer the opportunity to meet individuals’ health and social care needs in a more integrated way, but pose various practical challenges and risks.\n&#xa0;\n(ii) Investment in primary care&#xa0;\nDelivering on the aspiration of moving more care out of hospitals, and at the same time integrating care more effectively around patients with long term conditions, will require a change in the balance of resources within the NHS. At the moment, the systems through which NHS care is funded continue to encourage activity in hospitals. In cont\nr\nast there has been \nmarked \nunderinvestment in general practice, as indicated in the following chart from the Nuffield Trust\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBalancing resources towards primary care would enable general practice to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition\n, an urgent review of Payment by R\nesults \nis needed. It \nacts as a barrier to integrated care, because:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(iii) Workforce planning and training&#xa0;\nContinuing to move care out of hospitals and into the community has significant implications for the primary care workforce. The Centre for Workforce Intelligence has highlighted that the GP workforce is not growing quickly enough to meet predicted increases in demand\n.\n \nThe \nCfWI\n has recommended a 17% increase in recruitment into GP speciality training, which will necessitate a reduction in recruitment into training in hospital-based specialties. We need a robust long term approach to workforce planning, led by Health Education England, to ensure that patients with long term conditions are supported by an adequate GP workforce.\nAs the needs of patients change \n–\n and as the rise of multiple morbidities \ncontinues to lead to \nincreases \nin \nthe complexity of care \n–\n we also need to ensure that GP training reflects this. The RCGP's proposals for extending the length of GP training from 3 (currently the shortest of any medical specialty) to 4 years\n \nare in the process of being considered by the Government, with a decision by health Ministers across all four nations of the UK expected in late 2013. Extending and enhancing GP training will mean that GPs of the future are better equipped to provide care and support to those with long term conditions.\n&#xa0;\n3. Can we deliver 'whole person' care for people with long term conditions?&#xa0;\nPersonalisation is strongly associated with\n \nbetter patient outcomes and experience and is rooted in the same values of holism\n \nand patient \ncentredness\n as general practice.\n \nThe NHS and social care still focus too m\nuch on individual disease areas, and a\n shift in focus is needed towards supporting patients with two or more multiple morbidities. Potential solutions include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5. Current examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditions &#xa0;\nWe would point to \ntwo\n examples that the Committee \ncould\n consider\n in this context\n:\n&#xa0;\nThe diabetes ‘Year of care’ and care planning &#xa0;\nThe ‘Year of Care’ programme\n \ndemonstrated the potential for\n care planning \nto deliver improved health outcomes for people living with long term conditions, using \ndiabetes \nas an exemplar. \nPilots were undertaken in \nthree diverse pilot sites (Calderdale &amp; Kirklees, North of Tyne and Tower Hamlets)\n. Key outcomes include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJoint working between GPs and care homes in Sheffield&#xa0;Patients living with long term conditions who live in c\nare homes may suffer from poorer access to support tools such as care planning. In some areas, GPs are working collaboratively with local care homes to better meet the needs of their residents.\n \nIn Sheffield\n,\n local GPs have been leading on the delivery of proactive, coordinated healthcare to care home residents through a Locally Enhanced Service (LES) first set up by NHS Sheffield in 2008. The initiative focuses on developing clear lines of communication between care homes and GPs and establishing effective access to community health services\n.\n \nThe scheme has contributed to a reduction in hospital admissions in the area and has been popular with \nboth residents and GPs, with 94% \nof surveyed residents saying the se\nrvice provides for their needs.\n \n&#xa0;6. How can the new commissioning system deliver more integrated care for people with long term conditions?&#xa0;\nThe introduction of clinically-led commissioning is an opportunity to deliver new ways of working that benefit people with long term conditions, but there are both risks and opportunities associated with the new NHS structure as it comes into force. Key factors include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7. As a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease, how can we address obesity?&#xa0;Obesity is well known to be a fundamental risk factor for a series of conditions, such as diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease\n. \nIts impact on psychological problems, low self esteem and even suicide risk should also not be forgotten. The impact on health budgets, workload and service development is immense.\n \nPotential solutions include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n Department of Health, Improving the health and well-being of people with long term conditions: World class services for people with long term conditions - Information tool for commissioners, January 2010. \n Department of Health Commissioning Analysis and Intelligence Team.
