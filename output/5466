defaultSubmission from John Peckhamdefault (BRC82)default&#xa0;defaultSELECT COMMITTEE MEETING MONDAY 20defaultTHdefault JANUARY 2014default&#xa0;
defaultI saw the select committee interview on Monday 20
defaultth
default January
default 
defaultof the minister Stephen Williams MP and Bob Ledsome his senior civil servant.
default&#xa0;
defaultI heard the minister say that where work is carried out by less 
defaultthan skilled people the Qualified Supervisor (QS) goes along at the end of the job and inspects and test the work and “signs it off”. It would appear that Mr Blackman thinks this also
default 
defaultfrom what he said
default,
default along with other members of the select committee.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultF
defaultor the information of the committee and for the avoidance of doubt I can say with absolute certainty that is NOT CORRECT. There is no requirement for the QS to visit the premises and inspect and test the work regardless of who the work was done by. The onl
defaulty requirement is for the QS to review the paperwork (the Electrical Installation Certificate) and to countersign it.
default&#xa0;
default The QS in medium and large companies often sits in an office and rarely goes to site. In addition the QS only has to have a minimal techni
defaultcal qualification to do this. I cannot understand why the committee has not already been told this. At best I think the minister was badly briefed and based his answer on an assumption.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe lack of a specific requirement for the installation to be inspect
defaulted and tested by a 
defaultqualifieddefault competent person before being put in to service is a fundamental flaw in the Part P scheme. The QS scheme has no merit
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe committee has also heard an awful lot about the requirement for the QS to meet the requirements of the Minimum Technical Competence in the EAS document. This is only for new QSs and the EAS document has built in loop holes for persons lacking a Level 3
default qualification to Inspect and Test to be exempted. In addition there is no requirement for all those persons who are already QSs, a lot of who are “5 day wonders”, to upgrade to the new technical standards.
default Perhaps Certshure and NAPIT could be asked how ma
defaultny of their approved companies have QSs with a Level 3 qualification in Inspecting and Testing out of the total number of QSs they have 
defaultregistered.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Electrical S
defaultafety Council say on their web site, “
defaultThe ESC strongly recommends that, wherever you live, 
defaultyou use a registered electrician to do any electrical installation work that you need
default&#xa0;
default“.Perhaps they could be asked when are they going to put those fine words in to action and deliver a scheme to the public through the companies they own
default,
default or are in partne
defaultrship with. 
default&#xa0;
defaultYou already have written evidence from me so you will already have my brief CV.
