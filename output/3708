defaultToday I had two very encouraging encounters with 
defaultlorries
default a couple of minutes apart.  These incidents illustrate that well equipped lorries with well trained and considerate drivers can make a real difference to cycle safety.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI was holding back on the 
defaultinside of a lorry in a stream of traffic on the Archway Road.  The driver saw me, and I saw him, in his nearside mirror.  He waved to indicate that he had seen me and that I could proceed to pass him on the inside, which I did.  In this case the mirrors we
defaultre larger and better positioned than most on commercial vehicles.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the bottom of Archway I was waiting to join the traffic going round the roundabout.  The driver of a Waitrose lorry saw me, paused his vehicle which created space for me to join the traff
defaultic on the roundabout and waved to me to show he was waiting for me.  I joined the traffic on the roundabout easily and safely.
defaultKey to both incidents was the driver’s 
defaultpositive 
defaultawareness of me as a cyclist and their readiness to communicate with me.
