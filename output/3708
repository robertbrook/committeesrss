[normal]Written evidence from

[normal]Today I had two very encouraging encounters with 
[normal]lorries
[normal] a couple of minutes apart.  These incidents illustrate that well equipped lorries with well trained and considerate drivers can make a real difference to cycle safety.

[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I was holding back on the 
[normal]inside of a lorry in a stream of traffic on the Archway Road.  The driver saw me, and I saw him, in his nearside mirror.  He waved to indicate that he had seen me and that I could proceed to pass him on the inside, which I did.  In this case the mirrors we
[normal]re larger and better positioned than most on commercial vehicles.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the bottom of Archway I was waiting to join the traffic going round the roundabout.  The driver of a Waitrose lorry saw me, paused his vehicle which created space for me to join the traff
[normal]ic on the roundabout and waved to me to show he was waiting for me.  I joined the traffic on the roundabout easily and safely.
[normal]Key to both incidents was the driver’s 
[normal]positive 
[normal]awareness of me as a cyclist and their readiness to communicate with me.
