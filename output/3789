defaultI have cycled as a long-distance tourist for 30 years, and now have a family who love cycling if only they could find safe places to ride their bikes. We try to use bicycles as much as
default possible for local trips, but often are forced to use the car to stay safe.

defaultWhether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and cities.default 1.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultQuick answer: No, cycling is not safe in the UK.default 1.1.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycling is statistically safe, in that relatively few people get killeddefault or seriously injured riding their bikes. BUT cycling in the UK is subjectively extremely dangerous: it's an activity that apparently needs specialist clothing, protective equipment, and detailed training.default 1.1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe apparent danger is not helped by regular near-defaultmisses, and default“defaultpunishment passesdefault”default defaultfrom impatient motorists who think cyclists should be banned from our roads. Cyclists are a minority out-group, and as such are demonised in the press at every opportunity: default“defaultcyclists should get off the roadsdefault”default defaultgoes hand-in-hadefaultnd with default“defaultcyclists should get off the pavementsdefault”default.default 1.1.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a keen cyclist, I take my children to school on a trailer bicycle behind my bike. We are now the only family in a school of 400 pupils to use bicycles to get to school. The school actively discourage peopdefaultle from cycling, and we too would not dream of encouraging others to follow our example. The local roads are just too frightening to cycle along, even for experts like me.default 2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat central and local Government could do to improve cycling defaultsafety.default 2.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultQuick answer: defaultprovide well-designed defaultcyclewaysdefault in addition to footways and carriageways on our roads, just as the Dutch do.default 2.1.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBack in the late 1800's when bicycles were deemed to be more like carriages than pedestrians, cyclists were required to ride in the carriageway. Indefault modern times, cyclists put themselves are risk of serious injury and death by riding in the carriageway amongst cars and defaultlorriesdefault. defaultWhich is why many flout the law, making themselves criminals, by riding on the footway.default Of course the footways are not designdefaulted for cycling, and this annoys pedestrians. We need an in-between way: defaultcyclewaysdefault. Such defaultcyclewaysdefault can be used by people on bicycles, people in faster mobility scooters, people on defaultSegwaysdefault, and other forms of personal transport that aren't safe on carriagewadefaultys.default 2.1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Government need to plan strategically for cycling. Here in West Sussex they have abolished the post of Cycling Officer, have dropped any pretence that they have a Cycling Strategy, and have devolved highways decision-making to such a low level thdefaultat it's now impossible for defaultcyclewaysdefault between adjacent towns to be even considered.default 2.1.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCyclewaysdefault should be designed as if they were half-scale roads for motor vehicles. They should be direct, coherent, safe, and should not have obstructions in the middle of thdefaultem!default 2.1.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo have any chance at all of gaining the benefits in safety and community that the Dutch enjoy, we need to be investing default£default40 per person per year, over a decade or more, specifically in building defaultcyclewaysdefault. Long-term leadership and long-term investment ardefaulte crucial if any change is to be made. If we don't invest, then the inevitable result will be more people cycling (as fuel costs rise) and more people being killed and seriously injured in collisions with motor vehicles.default 3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhether it would be desirable and fdefaulteasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.default 3.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultQuick answer: Yes, both desirable and feasible. Segregate cyclists from motor vehicles both in space and time, just adefaults the Dutch do.default 3.1.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycling is a mode of transport that has the potential to solve many of our urban problems: pollution, congestion, road danger, lack of exercise, lack of community. Cycling should therefore be prioritised in planning and funding over less-efdefaultficient modes of transport such as private motor vehicles.default 3.1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHGVs have no place in busy city streets. Unless they really are essential, they should be replaced by smaller vehicles delivering locally from out-of-town distribution centres.default 3.1.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe need to decide whdefaultat our roads and streets are for, and design them to meet their chosen functions. Major roads should allow HGV defaultlorriesdefault, but should have completely segregated defaultcyclewaysdefault. Local streets should be blocked to through motor traffic, have 20mph speed limits, and defaulton-street cycle lanes as needed. We should stop trying to have roads that simultaneously try to be cycle routes, motorways, shopping streets and residential streets all at the same time.default 4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOther ideas for improving cycling safety would also be welcomed.default 4.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultQuicdefaultk answer: don't try to increase safety, work to reduce or remove the danger.default 4.1.1default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCycling is intrinsically safe. What is not safe is being forced to cycle in amongst heavy and fast-moving motor vehicles. Stop blaming cyclists, stop asking them to wear high-defaultvizdefault defaultand helmets, stop victim-blaming. Focus efforts on reducing road danger from motor vehicles, rather than trying to increase safety of vulnerable road users in the face of ever-increasing road danger.default 4.1.2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultForget about adding mirrors and sensors to some defaultlorriesdefault.default There will always be lorry drivers who accidentally fail to look in their mirrors, and sensors that will fail to detect cyclists about to be killed. Instead focus on sustainable safety, but keeping cyclists and defaultlorriesdefault apart from each other at all times. defaultThen the inevitable human failings will be much less likely to result in death or serious injury.default 4.1.3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultReal-world research has already been carried out into all these aspects of cycling safety, and well-developed and proven solutions are already available. You defaultonly need to travel to a country that's nearer London than Scotland is, and where the people speak pretty good English, to see these solutions in action. Safety is when people aged 8 to 80 are free and happy to use bicycles for local transport in towns anddefault cities.default 4.1.4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSign up for a Study Tour in the Netherlands from David defaultHembrowdefault (an English expatriate who knows all there is about cycle provision) and it will all become very clear what needs to be done, and how to do it.default&#xa0;
