defaultThe inquiry into the future of the BBC is of profound importance to all thinking
default 
defaulttax payers. However, BBC staff as commentators of events are not more
default 
defaultimportant than legislators. Legislators have to take responsibility for their
default 
defaultactions. BBC staff should not therefore be paid at grossly higher rates than
default 
defaultlegislators or civil servants. 
defaultIt
default 
defaultis a scandal that the BBC is able to persist in
default 
defaultconcealing the main facts abo
defaultu
defaultt their pay scales from the public which pays for
default 
defaultthem through taxation.
default&#xa0;
defaultMany other scandals have come to light in recent years but 
defaultit 
defaultseems to me that
default 
defaultthe power to form and 
defaultguide public opinion, which the BBC possesses in
default 
defaultabundance, may be being abused. 
defaultIt 
defaultmight, for example, be being used, by
default 
defaultrestricting publicity about it, to downgrade the importance of this inquiry into
default 
defaultthe future of the Corporation. The BBC is extremely 
defaultskilled in the task of
default 
defaultguiding public opinion. This tendency needs to be brought under public control
default 
defaultif some acceptable formula for this can be devised.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe method of choosing public figures to express views on radio and television
default 
defaultabout current question
defaults of public interest is not clear. 
defaultI 
defaultsuspect that people
default 
defaultexpressing views critical of the BBC 
defaultmay
default find themselves overlooked when
default 
defaultchoices are made about whom to invite onto political programmes of public
default 
defaultinterest. 
defaultIf 
defaultso, it is improper use of public funds 
defaultby a supposedly impartial
default 
defaultpublicly funded corporation.
default&#xa0;
defaultI 
defaultam particularly incensed by the way the BBC has glossed over the question of the excessive pay and allowances paid to senior staff of the Corporation. 
defaultIt 
defaultseems clear that the BBC employs specialist 
defaultadvisers to recommend the taking of measures to evade or reduce income taxes by staff or favoured contributors.  If
default 
defaultmore modest emoluments are recommended by Parliament, the BBC will need to be examined critically to ensure it does not devise further craft
defaulty ways of finessing any reductions that may be attempted by Parliament or the Government in future. The Committee needs to be particularly alert to this and to the ability of the BBC to deny or curtail the publicity it gives to its critics.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe scope of 
defaultthe BBC to enlarge its activities beyond the key duty of spreading
default 
defaultfactual and truthful information about Britain and the world should be
default 
defaultconsiderably reduced, Too many news bulletins are taken up with idle chatter and speculation about future events.  The
default “Today” programme, for example, too frequently tells us what is going to be announced later that day before it has happened.  There are too many instances of vulgarity, bad language, gratuitous sexual scenes, violence etc in entertainment programmes.  The
defaultre seems to be a definite attempt by the BBC to dumb down a population that seems to have been cowed into accepting a general lowering of moral standards.
