LG[bold]P[bold] 08[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Written submission from the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (LG[bold]P[bold] 08)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy? To what extend are local authorities able to develop long-term relationships with contractors?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Local authorities commonly use framework agreements which set out the terms under which works can be awarded throughout the period of the agreement. Framework agreements are generally used for repair and maintenance services, some capital works, and enable local authorities to develop long-term relationships with contractors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Framework agreements have their advantages and disadvantages. One significant advantage is that the purchasing authority does not have to undertake the full OJEU process each time services or goods are required. Having to go through the tender procedure once rather than several times reduces tendering cost and shortens the time between identifying and fulfilling need. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The reduction to tendering costs stems down to suppliers, reducing their costs and time taken to bid for work. An advantage to suppliers of being part of a framework agreement is the opportunity for repeat business. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore, 
[normal]frameworking
[normal] creates long-term partnerships enabling a working environment which supports continuous improvement and fills gaps in specialist expertise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CECA draws the Committee’s attention to the March 2012 report by the Government Construction Strategy Task Group on the effectiveness of frameworks. The working group found that benefits can accrue from the use of effective frameworks in procuring construction and they include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The working group found that effective framework agreements do exist in the public sector and these have already delivered substantial benefits both cashable and non-cashable to public sector clients.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The group also identified that many public organisations believe they could not deliver their programmes of construction procurement without the use of framework agreements. CECA continues to support the working group’s recommendations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite this, there are also disadvantages to framework contracts. Most frameworks do not guarantee that suppliers will get any business from them. Furthermore, they ignore the potential for new suppliers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CECA remains concerned that through their use SME contractors can be excluded from acting as a Tier One contractor. Implications for the local supply chain will be adverse if local SMEs are excluded in favour of larger firms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CECA also notes that the models of procurement sometimes used at local authority level can be out of date in terms of best practice. CECA suggests that Government and industry routinely share procurement expertise to ensure that the most appropriate method is used and has expanded upon this further below.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many local contractors are keen to employ and train the local workforce and play their part in reducing unemployment in their region. However, EU public procurement rules have acted as a barrier to efforts to ensure local workers benefit from projects in their area. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint procurement opportunities, including those available from central government? In addition, the Committee would welcome information on PFI contracts and their operation with local government.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Joint procurement means that there should be only one tender published on behalf of all participating authorities. Benefits include lower prices, administrative cost savings, the sharing of expertise between authorities and can lead to more sustainable procurement and innovation. However, as with local authority frameworks, collaborative procurement between authorities has its pros and cons. Clearly by assessing demand across a number of clients, the scale of the opportunity increases. As such, the problems of SME companies can be exacerbated if they find themselves unable to compete for contracts of such scale. Careful consideration should be given to the structuring of such proposals to allow a tiered approach, allowing SMEs to bid for lower value opportunities.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money and social and economic objectives? More specifically, does local government have sufficient understanding of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services to deliver quality procurement strategies—locally and regionally. If not, how can deficiencies be addressed?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As we have indicated above, CECA members have said that the models of procurement sometimes used at local authority level can be out of date in terms of best practice. Given that many local authorities are restricted by time and resources, CECA proposes the creation of a procurement ‘Flying Squad’ to assist local authorities on the procurement of major infrastructure projects. Such a group could include, for example, representatives from industry and central Government working in partnership with the local authority or agency to ensure that the most effective and efficient procurement model is put into place to deliver the project.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An example of similar collaborative working is the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme (see Box 1 below).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Box 1: Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme is a private-led partnership (comprising CECA, the Royal Town Planning Institute, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and local project co-ordinators). The partnership aims to progress stalled local infrastructure projects with potential to release economic growth by resolving barriers to progress.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Multidisciplinary teams of experts (working on a pro-bono basis) nominated by the partnership have been invited by local authorities to assist a small number of local projects in the first wave.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The partnership approach involves face-to-face interaction with local partners to uncover and understand barriers to progress. Typical barriers include local co-ordination and capacity issues as much as, or rather than, access to finance.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are tailored to product and supplier market places? More specifically, do local authorities maintain and operate effective client management functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The issue of risk is extremely important in the procurement process. In many cases contractors have found public sector procurers to be risk averse and instead they are putting the bulk of the risk onto the contractor. This immediately discourages many contractors from tendering for work and has implications for the viability of schemes. More progressive 
[normal]approaches to procurement, including the early engagement of suppliers, will help to mitigate this risk. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore, CECA members have said that they would welcome the establishment of a pipeline of local authority schemes, which would work in the same way as the Infrastructure Investment Pipeline (see Box 2).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Box 2: Infrastructure Investment Pipeline[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Infrastructure Investment Pipeline is updated alongside the National Infrastructure Plan, and contains detailed data on infrastructure investment.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]By publishing this data Government aims to provide industry with a greater understanding of the future pipeline of Government funded construction projects, as well as private sector infrastructure.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There are currently more than 550 projects and programmes in the infrastructure pipeline, worth over £310 billion. A lot of this investment is contained in programmes within the road, rail, nuclear, offshore wind and broadband sectors.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The plan is regularly updated and monitored upon delivery.[bold]&#xa0;
