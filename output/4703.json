"&#xa0;\nAFS0100Written evidence submitted by FASNAFASNA supports the movement towards school autonomy within a rigorous accountability framework&#xa0;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#xa0;\n1.\n              \nConverter academies are being undermined and undervalued. \n&#xa0;\nTo encourage sponsorship there needs to be some financial incentive in order to release capacity.\n&#xa0;\nAnother encouragement would be to make working with other schools part of the accountability framework.\n&#xa0;\nTo secure progress of disadvantaged pupils it should be more rigotously looked at by OFSTED.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nLocal Authorities hamper the process of academy conversion and this needs \naddressing.\n&#xa0;\nThe DfE needs better internal communication as well as better \ncommunication with OFSTED to inform its decisions.\n&#xa0;\nFree Schools should be a response to demographic need and/or local underperformance. In the latter case action also needs to be taken to address that underperformance.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nThe role of the Regional Schools Commissioners needs to be clarified and linked to \nthe OFSTED Regional Directors. Together, sharing information and with effective communication, they should provide the system for identifying schools needing support and sc\nhools with capacity to support.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nLocal Authorities should not have a role in school monitoring and improvement. \n&#xa0;\nThe regional structures of OFSTED and the Schools Commissioners could provide what is required. However, light-touch and leave successful s\nchools to be autonomous.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nChains need to be limited in size and geographical spread.\n&#xa0;\nGovernance is an issue throughout the system. There needs to be a move from the stakeholder \nmodel to a skills based model.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nIt is appropriate for a primary school to become an academy. However:\n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nAlternatives to sponsorship for failing primary schools would be:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;FASNA’s Report&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe debate about the academisation of our schools is marred by ill-founded judgements with no basis in evidence and often with expectations of academies whi\nch have been changed mid-stream.\n&#xa0;1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe early sponsor academies were specifically\n established to\n address under-performance in mainly urban areas with high levels of deprivation. \nWith a hard-edged arrangement with a sponsor, extra funding and a clear brief to raise standards and address social disadvantage, their purpose was well articu\nlated. Obvious\nly, as they have been in\n \nexistence for up to ten years \nthere is good evidence to assess their impact and i\nn poor performing schools large gains in pupil outcomes are possible.\n&#xa0;1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the other hand, converter academies have only come into existe\nnce over the last three years. There is not \nyet \nthe \nlongitudinal\n evidence base to make sweeping judgements about the “system”. \nIt is misjudged or even willful\n to compare the impact of \nsponsor and converter academies at this stage.\n&#xa0;1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlso, \nconverter academie\ns \nwere, initially ‘Outstanding’ Schools and therefore any gains in pupil performance were likely to be incremental and therefore appear less \nsignificant\n. \nThis is a factor to be taken into consideration.\n&#xa0;1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe criteria set for \nconverter academies \nwas that th\ney should ‘support’ other schools. \nThe recent expectation that this should translate into ensuring that other schools have their outcomes improved is a sleight of hand. Firstly, it was not made an explicit expectation. Secondly, \nno\n-one has monitored what s\nchools are doing in this regard and the impact therefore cannot be known.\n \nThirdly, s\nupport being given \nis likely to be discreet so as not to undermine the voluntary recipient.\n&#xa0;1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvidence would seem to indicate that leaders of converter academies have been \nsuccessful in maintaining and improving outcomes\n of all pupils \nand of disadvantaged pupils \nin their own schools.\n&#xa0;1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order for academies to have a transformational impact beyond their own schools there needs to be an explicit demand made of them to do so. \nThe current sponsorship programme is a means to achieve this\n. One means of securing this is by providing \nthe incentive of extra-funding to \nsecure capacity. \nWithout this, academies will shy away from \nvolunteering to sponsor for fear\n that capacity issues wil\nl lead negatively impact on their own performance.\n \nOFSTED need to take into account the impact of working with other schools when reaching a judgement on the supporting school.\n&#xa0;1.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnother mechanism would be to make working with other schools part of the \naccountability framework.\n&#xa0;1.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo secure the progress of \ndisadvantaged pupils OFSTED could beef up \nthe Inspection Framework looking at the measurement of the progress of groups – such as FSM, and the spending of the Pupil Premium.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nToo often the process is hampered by Local Authorities standing in the way.  For example Redcar &amp; Cleveland currently want to charge legal fees for schools converting\n, even if they already buy in to the LA service. They also insist a school must become a cheque-book school for a ‘few months’ before they can become a\nn academy. However, they say that\n it takes a year to make the change to become a cheque-book school! Such\n disputes are intended to deter schools from the process.\n&#xa0;2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe DfE\n needs to \nhave better data to identify schools which meet the criteria for being granted academy status, or being compelled\n \nto become an academy by being sponsored, or for being a sponsor. C\nurrently it appears that different parts of the DfE, and other arms of the Education Service such as OFSTED, do not \nadequately \nshare information or communicate \neffectively \nwith each other. \n&#xa0;2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor Free Schools it is not adequate that there is a demand, there\n must also be a need demonstrated by either by demographics (too few places) or by failure to provide adequate quality in other schools in the locality. \nThe DfE needs to have the data to substantiate the case. If not, it appears purely an ideological decis\nion which undermines schools in the area – thus having the unintended consequence of \nreducing morale and performance in those schools.\n \nIf the latter, there also needs to be a plan to address this – by improving quality to acceptable levels and/or reducing \nplaces at poor quality schools. Establishing a Free School and leaving it to the market condemns a generation of pupils caught in change.\n&#xa0;2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere needs to be a route by which \nOFSTED can\n inform the DfE where they identify capacity in high performing schools \n(perhaps through their HMI Good Practise Guides?). It is clear from the HMCI Annual Report released last week that OFSTED have such performance data – LA by LA – thus the DfE could begin to trawl for capacity by starting with OFSTED data.\n&#xa0;2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur experience \nshows that the DfE academy sponsor unit has no systematic or routine knowledge of where there is capacity in the system. Thus, it is incumbent upon high performing schools to contact them to offer support – it should be the other way round.\n&#xa0;2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe DfE, should be \nable \nto identify those schools requiring sponsorship and those who may provide the necessary expertise to be sponsors. This is best done in a local area\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis will surely be via the new Regional Schools Com\nmissioner\ns? They should be the layer scrutinising \nschool performance data, \nOFSTED \nreports\n etc \nThey would track\n performance \nand then broker\n suppor\nt \nwhere required\n.\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever,\n there MUST be better communication – indeed some communication – between the OFSTED Regional Directors and the new Regional Schools Com\nmissioner\ns\n. Is this a role for HMI?\n&#xa0;3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn short – its easy:\n OFSTED Inspect, pronounce, \nshare data \nand refer for support or identified capacity; Regional Commissioners scrutinize performance data and OFSTED referrals and reports. Together the \nRegional Schools Com\nmissioners and OFSTED Regional \nDirectors work together to identify capacity and t\nhen broker the support.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal Authorities no longer have the skills, capacity or confidence to provide \nschool monitoring and school improvement.\n&#xa0;4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThey should retain all of the current statutory duties in re\nlation to planning places\n, \nHigh Needs, Education Other Than At School, SEN, School \nTransport\n \netc.\n; but it is the Regional Schools Commissioners who will monitor, intervene and broker support when needed. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen there is \na robust N\national \nF\nunding \nF\normula\n \nthe need for Local Authorities to run a Schools Forum disappears. The LA receive\n \nsome\n ESG to support their limited statutory duties.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe regional structure of OFSTED and Schools Commissioners may provide the structure between schools and the Secretary of \nState. However, it is imperative that this is light-touch and not bureaucratic, working in a transparent and cost-effective way and leaving successful schools to get on with it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a place for chains but\n there should be a limit on the size and \ntheir \ngeographical spread.\n&#xa0;5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSmall local chains are the best model as the ability \nto work\n across schools, to share a common ethos and to move staff around is enhanced by proximity.\n&#xa0;5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFSTED MUST inspect chains as well as individual schools. They must look at what being in a chain adds in terms of performance and take action if a chain is underp\nerforming or failing to address weaknesses in a member school.\n&#xa0;5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernance is an issue across the system and not just in chains. The move from a stakeholder model to a skills-based form of Governance needs to be hastened. Better training for Governors and \na more robust selection of the chair needs to be implemented.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is \nentirely\n appropriate for Pri\nmary\n schools to become \nan \nacadem\ny\n. \nHowever,\n it \nwould \nalso \nbe appropriate\n for the DfE to \ninsist that primary academies are \nof a certain size (in terms of school roll and budget) or are \nin \na group\n of schools in o\nrder to achieve maximum benefit.\n This could be a group of primary schools or a grouping with a secondary school.\n&#xa0;6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThus it is\n important that \nthe DfE pushes this as the p\nreferred model with financial incentives to achieve it. The current incentives need to be retained.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA failing primary school clearly needs intervention and support. This is best done by working with a successful school or schools. Being sponsored is one approach. \n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere could also be a r\nequireme\nnt \nto join an established M\nulti-Academy Trust.\n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere \nshould be a r\nequirement to work with HMI –\n \nprob\nably\n via the Regional \nSchools Com\nmissioner\ns\n.\n This could be an additional requirement.\n&#xa0;\n7.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere could be a closure and an amalgamation with another school – either as one school or in a hard Federation (one Head \none Governing Body \netc.\n).\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
