defaultWritten evidence submitted by Prof. William C. McGrewdefault&#xa0;
defaultI have no new evidence to offer on the extent of trade in primates as pets in the 
defaultUK
default, nor do I have useful current knowledge of the adequacy of current protection for such pets. I have never kept a primate as a pet, but I have known persons who did.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, I have informed opinions on primates in captivity, having published scientific articles on monkeys and apes kept in zoological gardens, laboratories, and refuges. (See examples below.) I have directed research groups on primates in nature and in a variety of captive settings. I served for 5 years on the Board of Directors of Chimp Haven, Inc. and for two terms on the Council of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (Edinburgh Zoo).
default&#xa0;
defaultOn the basis of this experience, which stretches back over 40+ years, I am totally opposed to the keeping of these intelligent and sensitive animals as pets. No matter how well-intentioned and conscientious the pet-owners, they are in no position to provide the physical, social and behavioural stimulation needed to keep the large-brained animals mentally and emotionally healthy. The 
defaultUK
default should ban the keeping of all non-human primates as pets, effective as soon as possible. This should be implemented by banning new acquisitions, importation, trafficking, transport, sale or purchase, etc., across the board.
default&#xa0;
defaultIndividual primates already kept as pets should be liberated and removed to appropriate sanctuaries or refuges, as soon as possible.
