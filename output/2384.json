"Written evidence submitted by CARE (Christian Action Research and Education) (LAI 012)&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCARE is a well-established mainstream Christian charity providing resources and helping to bring Christian insight and experience to matters of public policy and practical caring initiatives.  This submission is informed by \nour relationship\n with \nseveral \nfr\nontline organisations\n that provide care and assistance to those who have experienced exploitation and trafficking \nin addition to our work with MPs and Peers on this subject.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposals will have serious consequences for the human rights of vic\ntims of human trafficking.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposals will contravene international obligations under the EU Anti-Trafficking Directive 2011/36/EU and will prevent victims of trafficking accessing support they are entitled to under the Directive.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe proposals will \ndisproportionately affect victims of trafficking and will amount to discrimination on the grounds of race or national origin.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission is made in relation to the specific effects the proposals in the Transforming Legal Aid paper will\n have on victims of human trafficking.  Although these proposals may have similarly adverse effects on other vulnerable groups or on principles of rule of law in general, CARE’s response is focussed on the impact on one particularly marginalised group with\nin our society.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis proposal will obstruct access to legal assistance for victims of human trafficking\n which they are entitled to under EU Directive 2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings.  Article 12(2) of the Directive states:\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“Member States shall ensure that victims of trafficking in human beings have access without delay to\n legal counselling, and, in accordance with the role of victims in the relevant justice system, to legal representation, including for the purpose of claiming compensation. Legal counselling and legal representation shall be free of charge where the victim\n does not have sufficient financial resources.”\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe residence test will completely prevent some victims accessing legal counselling from a trained lawyer and for other victims it will mean a delay of up to 12 months before they can receive this \nassistance.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe majority of victims of human trafficking identified in the UK come from countries outside the EEA/EU, 64.8 per cent of all victims referred to the National Referral Mechanism in \n2012.\n  \nMany of these victims will fail the residence test be\ncause they will not have been legally resident in the UK prior to being identified as a victim.  Most traffickers will not have gone to the expense of obtaining visas and genuine travel documents for their victims.\n \nAlthough an individual receives permissio\nn to r\neside in the UK\n once they are identified as a victim\n, they would need to wait 12 months before becoming eligible for legal aid under the proposed changes.  \n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe residence test will also affect v\nictims of trafficking who are nationals of the EEA/EU o\nr who have otherwise obtained legal residency in the UK\n.\n Hope for Justice, a charity which works directly with victims of trafficking has told CARE that 70 per cent of the victims they supported between April 2012 and March 2013 were EU citizens who had re\nsided in the UK for less than 12 months.\n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe residence test will not only fail the “without delay” aspect of the EU Directive but will in some cases prevent access to justice completely.  Certain types of claim must be brought within strict time limits, w\nhich would expire before a victim has achieved the 12 month\ns\n legal residence.  Victims of exploitative labour practices will be prevented from bringing claims to employment tribunals and victims \nwill not be able to apply for\n judicial review of a decision r\nelating to their care (for example\n a decision of whether or not they are a victim of trafficking under the National Referral Mechanism).\n  \n \n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to civil legal aid is important for victims of trafficking as it \nprovides a way for them to challenge incor\nrect decisions made by state authorities through judicial review, but it also enables victims to seek compensation from their traffickers.  \nCriminal prosecutions of\n those who traffic and exploit others\n \nare\n vital, but ensuring victims can pursue their abusers for financial compensation is also key to providing them with justice. \n These potential financial penalties are part of creating strong deterrents \nagainst traffickers operating in this country.\n&#xa0;\n4.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nVictims\n of human trafficking do not have the resources to pay for a lawyer without legal aid, but also do not have the capacity to represent themselves in a foreign language, in an unfamiliar legal system.\n&#xa0;\n4.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCARE welcomes the proposal to create an exception to the\n residence test for asylum seekers which will apply to some victims of human trafficking.  However, not all victims of trafficking need or wish to apply for asylum.  Some are EEA citizens and others wish to return home to their own country.  This exception\n will not be available to them\n.  We believe that\n the description of asylum seekers as\n \n“\nby virtue of their circumstances [...] amongst the most vulnerable in society\n,”\n could apply equally to \nvictims of human trafficking\n.  Indeed, \nit could be\n argue\nd\n that \nmany are more vulnerable since \nthe UK has not been a place of safety for them, rather the location of their exploitation\n.\n \n \nBy not extending an automatic exception to all individuals who are reasonably believed to be victims (having received an affirmative \n“reasonable grounds” decision under the NRM) this proposal unjustly discriminates between victims\n who apply\n and are eligible\n for asylum and those who do not.\n&#xa0;\n4.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough the Government claims that the residence test will not contravene obligations under the \nEU Anti-\nT\nrafficking Directive\n because it will make sure legal aid will be available via an “exceptional circumstances” process \n“where necessary to comply with obligations \nunder EU or national law”\n we do not believe this will be sufficient. \nW\nithout the adv\nice and assistance of a legal professional, victims of human trafficking will find it extremely difficult to comprehend and make an application for legal aid under this “exceptional circumstances” rule.  \nT\nhe proposed residence test\n even with the EU law obl\nigations exception\n will in \neffect\n discriminate against victims on the basis of their native language\n and nationality\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTherefore, CARE is not satisfied by these assurances and recommends instead as a minimum the proposal be amended to exempt victims of \ntrafficking from the residence test.\n&#xa0;\n4.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCase Study:  Magdalene\nMagdalene is from Eastern Europe, she came to the UK determined to work her way out of backbreaking poverty. She and her children had fallen into homelessness and she was desperately searching \nfor a better future for her little ones when she was approached by a man offering a better life in the UK. However, when the family arrived things were very different. Magdalene and her family were exploited for fraud and labour.  At the time of rescue Mag\ndalene and her family had been lawfully resident in the country for less than 12 months. Magdalene is still having problems with housing as a result of her identity documents being taken by the trafficker.  Magdalene is cooperating with a police investigat\nion.  If the new proposals were enacted, Magdalene and her family:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHuman trafficking cases \npresent many challenges.  Sometimes due to language, psychological trauma or fear\n,\n victims can be reticent in sharing their stories.  For lawyers providing \nthem with \nassistance\n,\n determining the \nfacts\n and finer legal points of an individual’s case can be a complicated and time-consuming process.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven that\n mistakes are made by public bodies in the decisions they take in relation to victims of trafficking, the proposal to limit payment for work on judi\ncial review applications is likely to result in many victims being unable to bring such cases for judicial review\n and justice not being done\n. \nThe \nLaw Society and the Young Legal Aid Practitioners Association have both indicated that there will be a reducti\non in the willingness of solicitors to take legal aid cases due to the financial risk created by the proposal.\n  \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndividuals who have experienced trafficking and exploitation are unlikely to have the capacity to make these applications themselves due to \nlimited English language and a lack of understanding of English law\n.  It is unfair that these victims should be denied access to \npursue a complaint against the state by the financial considerations imposed on a legal aid solicitor by the state\n itself\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current merits test already protects the court and the legal aid budget from expending resources on cases which have little prospect of \nsuccess.  Removing funding from borderline cases could have a detrimental effect on victims of human trafficking.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs has already been mentioned above, the cases of trafficking victims can be complex and the facts can be\n \nunclear\n at the start\n.  This is ofte\nn a result of the psychological or physical d\nistress a victim is suffering or due to a limited grasp of English.  Under these circumstances initial assessment of the chances of success can be difficult and may mean a case is considered to be “borderline” d\nespite the fact that as further examination takes place the strengths of the case may emerge.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOften these complicated cases which \ndraw on \nintricate elements of international and domestic law \ngo \non to \nform precedent for subsequent cases.  It is clearly in \nthe public interest for these cases to come to court in order for judges to set guidance for similar future cases.  If legal aid is removed for borderline cases, some of these \nimportant cases may be excluded from court which will be detrimental to the deve\nlopment of judicial opinion.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs has been previously stated, victims of trafficking who have been through the terrible ordeal of trafficking and exploitation are extremely unlikely to be able to present their own case without legal understanding and in a f\noreign language.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese\n proposed changes will have very serious consequences\n for the protection of the human rights of victims of trafficking specifically the right of access to justice (European Convention on Human Rights Article 6) and the ri\nght not to be discriminated against (ECHR Article 14).  \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, the proposals will \ncontravene key \nspecific rights to which victims of trafficking are entitled under \nArticle 12 of \nthe EU Directive on combating trafficking in human beings.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCARE has \nwelcomed the announcement by the Home Secretary that the Government plans to introduce a Modern Slavery Bill to improve the UK’s response to slavery and human trafficking.  We feel it would be a backwards step to continue to press ahead with changes to leg\nal aid that would so detrimentally affect those a Modern Slavery Bill would be seeking to protect.\n&#xa0;\n25 September 2013\n UK National Referral Mechanism Provisional Statistics 2012. \n The ten most prevalent nationalities/countries of origin in 2012 were Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania, China, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania, UK, and Pakistan, five of which are outside the EAA/EU.\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal\n;
