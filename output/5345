[normal]Further written evidence submitted by[bold] [bold]Professor Richard Thompson[bold]Further to the oral evidence I gave to the Environmental Audit Committee on 8
[normal]th
[normal] January two
[normal] issues remained in my mind that were not fully discussed
[normal] (Q131 and Q151)
[normal].
[normal]Q131[bold] 
[normal]Zac Goldsmith[bold]:[bold] What I am struggling with is that this ought to be an issue that is relatively black and white. They either biodegrade or they don’t. It is not a mystery. How can we have such discrepancy of views on this?
[normal]Thompson additional response: [bold] The problem is that the standard EN 13432 that is being used as a loose definition for biodegradability actually only refers to degradation in industrial conditions such as pre-shredded plastic, at high temperatures (58 ºC) and specific conditions of pH and humidity. Unless we create a specific waste stream for plastic bags it is unlikely that many will end up in a composter. More importantly my understanding about part of the motivation for an exemption was to reduce the impact  / duration of litter in the natural environment. There are tests that could be run in the natural environment, but to date the focus has been on meeting EN 13432 which has little bearing on degradation in the natural environment. A fuller discussion of standards for composting such as EN 13432 can be found in

[normal]In relation to degradation I have a selection of bags of various ages collected mainly out of curiosity and stored rather than used. I brought examples with me to show the Committee but there was not time to do so.  
[normal]Example 1) I collected from a major UK retailer exactly 10 years ago. On the bag it claimed to be 100% degradable and said that the process would start in 18 months and be complete after 36 months. After ten years at room temperature (office / home conditions) I am left with literally thousands of tiny pieces of plastic  - microplastic. 
[normal]The bag appears to have degraded physically by fragmentation, but biodegradation is not apparent. 
[normal]It is not clear how long these 
[normal]fragments
[normal] will persist. It is quite possible that such deterioration might have been faster if the bag had been dropped as litter in the natural environment, but 
[normal]further tests would be needed 
[normal]to
[normal] establish
[normal] this. If a bag is to be exempt from
[normal] the L
[normal]evy on the grounds of its degradability then it would need to biodegrade completely into carbon dioxide, methane and water or be incorporated by micro-organisms. This would need to occur without any pre-treatment, would need to occur in a range of natural habitats and would need to be sufficiently rapid so as to have meaningful benefits in terms of a reduction of litter (aesthetic problems and problems to wildlife). It is this evidence about the biodegradation of plastic bags in the natural environment that is lacking. As an aside I would be concerned
[normal] if an 
[normal]exemption
[normal] from the Levy effectively promoted increased usage of 
[normal]bags that fragment into powder in the home / office environment, as has occurred with my sample.
[normal]Example 2) is approximately 25 years old, it is still intact and functional. It is a conventional bag, of similar thickness to the bags currently described as bags for life, and my understanding is that it would be fully compatible with recycling. Were the bag to be kept for long enough I suspect it would eventually deteriorate into fragments
[normal],
[normal] as is the case for Example 1
[normal], but this would be physical deterioration rather than biodegradation
[normal].
[normal]So to resolve the discrepancies in viewpoints regarding biodegradation one has to define the conditions under which the item needs to biodegrade. In this case in order to merit an exemption from the Levy. If such a bag were developed it is important to ensure that new problems, such as incompatibility with recycling or deterioration in service, did not arise as a consequence of meeting any newly specified conditions of biodegradation. 
[normal]Q151[bold] 
[normal]Caroline Lucas[bold]:[bold] On a completely different matter—others have said this as well—plastic bags are important, but not the only environmental problem or the biggest problem. What really interests me is how we use a campaign around plastic bags to stimulate and catalyse greater behaviour change among the public. Is there any evidence that you are aware of what will do that—whether in Italy or anywhere else where this has happened—which has been enough to stimulate a bigger chain reaction of actions? To bring it back to the focus of this particular inquiry, if we have all found it confusing to understand why this is or is not being exempted, do you think there is a risk that, in terms of any public information campaign, it could muddy the waters for that? 
[normal]Thompson additional response: [bold]This is a key question. I am not aware of published research on how a levy on bags will have a broader effect (see also comments from Matthew Quinn about ‘
[normal]positive social impact
[normal]’ in an earlier evidence session). This kind of broader picture it is something I am currently working on with colleagues at Plymouth University.  Logically one would hope that raising awareness about the plastic carrier bag itself, via a levy, will help to stimulate interest in the contents of the bag
[normal],
[normal] i.e. the disposable packaging 
[normal]used 
[normal]on the goods carried home in those bags. At present around 30% of all the plastics produced are disposable items, mainly packaging. These items are designed to get goods safely to the consumer and also for marketing. To date less emphasis seems to have been placed on designing for end-of-life. The discussion on plastic bags has been complex, but actually I think it is more 
[normal]clear
[normal] cut than the decisions that will likely need to be made on packaging in the near future. The principles however are the same: 1) do the job effectively with the minimum material possible
[normal], taking account of potential re-usage
[normal], 2) use recycled content and 3) design for end-of-life, for example via designing for recyclability. Perha
[normal]ps some of the income from the L
[normal]evy could be directed back toward industrial innovation of packaging design to better achi
[normal]eve these objectives. Then as these 
[normal]products 
[normal]evolved,
[normal] perhaps bags for life could be used to carry educational messages that would help inform about ma
[normal]terial reduction and recycling?
[normal] In short I believe a considerable number of consumers are keen to do the right thing, but are confused as to what the right thing is. So, 1, 2 and 3 need to be coupled with accurate information to help guide consumer choice. These issues are discussed more fully elsewhere
