"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr. Anna Stavrianakis, Senior Lecturer in International Relations, University of Sussex.Introduction and SummaryI am a scholar researching the international arms trade and UK arms export policy. This submission seeks clarification on three issues discussed in the Government’s response (Cm 8707, October 2013) to the Committees on Arms Export Controls Scrutiny of Arms Exports and Arms Control (2013) report (HC 205, 1 July 2013). \n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReview of the UK’s Consolidated Criteria. The Committees on Arms Export Controls (CAEC) asked the Government whether it would consult publicly on its updating of the Consolidated Criteria (Scrutiny of Arms Exports and Arms Control (2013), paragraph 46). In its response, the Government stated that “We are now studying the impact of the ATT on the EU Common Position and in light of that will be updating the Criteria”. The Government did not answer the CAEC’s question about public consultation. Is the Government going to consult publicly on its updating of the UK Consolidated Criteria? If so, what is the timescale and format for this? \n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArms export licence suspension mechanism. In its response to the \nCAEC\n Scrutiny of Arms Exports and Arms Control (2013) report, the Government states that the suspension mechanism “applies only to licence applications that are still being processed and to any new applications that may subsequently be submitted. Once an item has left the UK suspending or revoking the licence will not result in the return of that item. For extant licences, i.e. those that are wholly or partially unused, we have the option of revocation or suspension should that be deemed necessary”\n (\nparagraph \n124). \n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThree claims about suspension are made in the above paragraph. First, licence applications that are still being processed can be suspended. Second, new licence applications can be suspended. The Government initially claims that suspension applies “only” to these two scenarios. Later in the same paragraph, however, it makes a third claim: that extant licences (licences that have been issued but are wholly or partially unused) can be revoked or suspended. \nThis mix of claims \nmakes it unclear whether it is possible to prevent equipment being shipped once a licence has been granted. \n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan the Government clarify its policy and practice in relation to the suspension of: new licence applications; applications that are still being processed; \nand \nlicences that have been granted and are still valid, but are partially or wholly unused. \n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn particular, c\nan the Government confirm whether\n extant licences – licences that have been granted and are still valid, but are wholly or partially unused i.e. the equipment has not yet been shipped – can be suspended\n? If so, on how many occasions have such licences been suspended, of what equipment, to what end-user? \n&#xa0;\n6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan the Government explain what happens in practice if an ext\nant licence is suspended, and what happens in practice if an extant licence is revoked?\n&#xa0;7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nArms export licence suspensions: Egypt. The suspension mechanism “has been considered on several occasions but pursued in only one instance, in respect of Egypt” (Government response to CAEC report, paragraph 94). EU Member States agreed to “suspend all export licensing for equipment which might be used for internal repression.” Can the Government clarify whether, in the UK case, this involved the suspension of acceptance of new licence applications; the suspension of the processing licence applications already submitted; and/or the suspension of extant licences already granted but wholly or partially unused? \n&#xa0;\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEU Member States also agreed “to reassess export licences of equipment covered by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP” (Government response to CAEC report, paragraph 94). Can the Government clarify what this process involved in the UK case? Did this involve reassessing licences that had already been granted? \n&#xa0;\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Business Secretary announced on 28 August “that the UK had suspended 48 extant licences as a result of this agreement” (Government response to CAEC report, paragraph 94). Similarly, in its Notice to Exporters 2013/23 published on the same date, ECO that “\nsuspension will apply to extant licences and new licence applications.”\n \nThis wording suggests that \nboth \nextant licences that have been granted but are wholly or partially unused, \nand\n licence applications that are still in process can be suspended. Can the Government confirm this, and clarify what happened in the case of extant licences in respect of Egypt that were suspended?\n&#xa0;\n10)\n \n \nOn 25 October 2013, in Notice to Exporters 2013/27, ECO stated that \n“\n24 licences will have the suspension lifted because we do not judge the goods might be used for internal repression. \n7 will be revoked as there is a clear risk that the goods might be used for internal repression. T\nhe balance of 16 will remain suspended because the goods might be used for internal repression.\n”\n W\nere these extant licences i.e. licences that had been granted but we\nre partially or wholly unused?\n&#xa0;\n \n \nhttp://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/uncategorized/notice-to-exporters-201324-suspension-of-extant-licences-for-egypt-and-changes-to-ogels/\n \nhttp://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/uncategorized/notice-to-exporters-201327-egypt-results-of-the-review-of-licences/\n"
