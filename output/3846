[normal]Written Evidence from Michael Ford[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Point 2: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the factors which can influence police [bold]mis[bold]-recording of crime ?[bold]Answer: I reported a crime (perjury) which I believed had been committed during evidence given in a High Court case by two named individuals. The High Court judges also stated in court that they required an investigation into the honesty of the same individuals. I reported the Judge’s concerns to the Police.  The Court of Appeal judges who raised questions 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in the judgment about witness 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“dishonesty” were Lord Justice Hughes, Lord Justice 
[normal]Toulson
[normal] and Lord Justice Sullivan in Case No. A2/2009/0206, dated 19 May 2009. It was their comments that justified my later crime complaint to the City of London Police. The Judges’ names and the 2009 High Court case details are matters of public record.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The City of London Police 
[normal]recorded
[normal] the crime that I suspected had been committed and it was entered in Police Records as 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“ criminality by the senior partners of a named legal firm.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]But within months, junior Law Society officials, persuaded the same Police to 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]de-record
[normal] the “criminality” offence entered in the Police Record and no criminal investigation took place.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Point 5:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Policy-makers cannot have confidence in the statistics of crime-reporting [bold]i
[normal]f civilian persons can shield 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]individuals from prosecution by demanding that Police halt a criminal investigation.
