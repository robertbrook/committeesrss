default In 2012-13 we carried 30 million passengers.
default&#xa0;defaultSdefaultUMMARYdefault&#xa0;defaultOur core aim is to maintain services as close to the advertised services as possible, rather than making an early switch to emergency timetables. This may have an adverse impact on our performance

default However, we firmly believe our approach gives our 
defaultcustomers
default confidence about making journeys and reduces conflicting information appearing in different channels.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultVirgin Trains is a learning organisation, and our plans for snow and icy condit
defaultions are re-visited regularly to take account of experience. Our winterisation plan for trains and stations is reviewed annually and re briefed to front line teams (usually in late summer as we start to stock up on our de icing supplies).

defaultys an increasing part in keeping customers up-to-date during disruption and we will shortly be able to provide social media coverage for the entire period of train operation.

defaultMaintaining the advertised timetdefaultabledefault&#xa0;
defaultAs a long-distance operator 
defaultwe have a distinct customer profile, with over half in possession of a seat reservation for a specific train 
defaultfor their journey. These reservations are either made automatically 
defaultthough purchase of an Advance ticket or through making 
defaulta seat reservation to 
defaultaccompany
default a flexible ticket. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTh
defaulte high proportion of reservations 
defaultis a key factor on operational decisions taken during periods of severe weather.
default Our approach is to maintain as 
defaultfar as possible 
defaultour advertised services so that customers know that their reservations will remain in place. Maintaining advertised services is also important as many local services run by 
defaultTransPennine

default There is therefore an incentive to introduce emergency timetables earlier than op
defaulterational conditions would demand. 
defaultFor the reasons outlined above w

default Twitter tends to be the favoured option for customers to receive updates during disruption. As well as providing factual journey information Twitter can have a profound effect on custo
