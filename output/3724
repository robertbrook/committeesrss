[normal]Cycling in Sheffield 
[normal]I am a 41 year old GP who has enjoyed cycling for many years. Mainly this has been for recreation with friends or family. I have
[normal] also
[normal] use
[normal]d 
[normal]cycling as a method of transp
[normal]ortation to get around Sheffield.
[normal]  
[normal]However I do this with the 
[normal]knowledge that
[normal] I
[normal] must do so with a degree of risk.
[normal] I
[normal] accept that my journey must be shared with other road users, cars, busses and 
[normal]lorries
[normal]. Cycle lanes though they exist serve little practical purpose. 
[normal]They frequently do not join up, full of parked cars an
[normal]d seem to go nowhere useful. The offer no protection to cyclists. 
[normal] I hear of accidents when cyclists are seriously injured or killed on a regular basis. 
[normal]In my occupation I frequently encourage my patients to become more active. Cycling often is great way 
[normal]for people to gain fitness being low impact and relatively inexpensive. Plus it is environmentally friendly and eases congestion on our busy roads.  But many of my patients are put off by the dangers.
[normal]A few years ago I enjoyed a holiday with my family in H
[normal]olland.
[normal] It stuck me just how many people use the bike there as a method of transportation. 
[normal] Our 
[normal]children aged
[normal] 10, 5 and 2 at the time
[normal],
[normal] cycled for miles on well thought out cycle lanes which actually got you somewhere. 
[normal]They were
[normal] largely traffic free and whe
[normal]n traffic was around the lanes were 
[normal]separate
[normal] from the traffic.  Now we must load the bikes onto our car and drive somewhere first before we feel it is safe for the children to cycle. 
[normal]Increased cycling within our community would be hugely beneficial
[normal] both i
[normal]n
[normal] health
[normal] terms
[normal] and 
[normal]for the
[normal] environment. I fear for every cyclist I pass in my vehicle as they battle home against the traffic. When that cyclist is me then I must do the same. Cycle lanes in order to work must go somewhere and 
[normal]offer 
[normal]protection to their use
[normal]rs. At the moment they do neither.
