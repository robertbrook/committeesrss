[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Letter from Baroness [bold]Stowell[bold] of Beeston, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government[bold]&#xa0;[bold]16[bold]th[bold] December Select Committee[bold] Follow Up[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Following the Committee meeting on Monday 
[normal]16
[normal]th
[normal] December, 
[normal]I undertook to provide the Committee with some additional information as set out in your Clerk’s email of 17
[normal]th
[normal] December. I will take
[normal] each of
[normal] these points in 
[normal]the 
[normal]order
[normal] set out in your C
[normal]lerk’s email
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The d[bold]epartment’s views on the employment terms and conditions applicable to local government contract delivery by private or othe[bold]r sector organisations (Q439-442[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The d
[normal]epartment notes that 
[normal]councils are locally elected bo
[normal]dies and individual employers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As such, 
[normal]councils
[normal] are best placed
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]to make decisions about the shape of their workforces, taking account of local circumstances and ensuring they deliver value for money for taxpayers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]We recognise that workforce costs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]make
[normal] up a significant proportion of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]local authority
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]spending. Given this, councils will inevitably look to achieve savings in the way they manage their staff.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This may include the outsourcing of jobs and services to the private sector. 
[normal]Transfer of Undertaking
[normal]s (Protection of Employment
[normal]) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) 
[normal]is an important part of the pr
[normal]otection of employees' rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When it comes to outsourcing jobs and services, 
[normal]councils
[normal] must, of course, abide by the law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They should also
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ensure
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]that employees transferrin
[normal]g to private or voluntary sectors are treated fairly and equally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]All contracts with private sector firms for the delivery of public services routinely contain provisions which require the supplier to comply with all applicable laws and statutes. This is 
[normal]the standard way of ensuring that there is a contractual requirement for suppliers to meet their legal obligations with regard to employment law.
[normal] 
[normal]Councils
[normal] are
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]often major employers and influencers in their local communities and can play a significant role
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]in encouraging other employers in their communities to pay their workers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a proper wage e.g.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Living Wage or the local equivalent
[normal]. 
[normal]Local g
[normal]overnment should always award contracts on the basis of the best value for money for the taxpayer and whether to pay th
[normal]e living wage must be a question for the employer. T
[normal]he g
[normal]overnment helps the low paid through the National Minimum Wage
[normal] and indeed has cut income tax to help low paid people
[normal]. 
[normal] However, i
[normal]t is for workers and employers to decide the level of wages above the m
[normal]inimum wage based on current cir
[normal]cumstances.  This includes the g
[normal]overnment as a procurer and an employer.  
[normal]Over 95%
[normal] around 20 million
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]employees
[normal],
[normal] across all sectors in the 
[normal]UK,
[normal] earn above the minimum wage and the majority of public sector workers currently ea
[normal]rn above the Living Wage.
[normal]On the matter of staff pension rights, s
[normal]taff employed by best value authorities
[normal] are currently entitled to a broadly equivalent pension scheme if transferred and many contractors have elected to keep staff in the local government pension scheme by becoming admitted 
[normal]bodies within the scheme.  The g
[normal]overnment is currently considering how
[normal] these arrangements might be reformed in the light of the new Fair Deal guidance 
[normal]produced by Treasury
[normal], under which central government and school employees are entitled to remain in their current public service pension scheme if their work is transferred t
[normal]o a non-public provider.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As regards zero hours contracts, we note that their use
[normal] is not new, but since 2005, there has been an increase in their use
[normal] and they are used by councils of all political colours, especially for part-time or casual employment r
[normal]oles
[normal]. More recently government has been made aware of, and taken note of, anecdotal evidence that has illustrated instances of abuse.
[normal] 
[normal]As mentioned during the Committee 
[normal]meeting of 16 December
[normal], the Business Secretary is looking into issues around zero hours 
[normal]contracts and has 
[normal]asked officials 
[normal]from the department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
[normal]to undertake a fact finding exercise to explore how these contracts work and what the issues are
[normal]. T
[normal]he g
[normal]overnment published a formal consultation on options to address
[normal] these issues and improve how zero hours contracts are used in the economy
[normal] on 19 December
[normal]. The consultation will close
[normal] on 13 March 2014 after which the Government will publish a response setting out any next steps we intend to make. The consultation 
[normal]docume
[normal]nt 
[normal]is available 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]www.gov.uk/government/consultations/zero-hours-employment-contracts
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The proportion of local authority sector spend on services and goods [bold]delivered by non-UK companies (Q456)[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The d
[normal]epartment does not have an estimate of the proportion of local go
[normal]vernment spend delivered by non-
[normal]UK companies. 
[normal]However 
[normal]s
[normal]pend data and details of contracts awarded would identify who the winning supplier
[normal] was.
[normal]  
[normal]For the purposes of the Regulations, a properly incorporated UK subsidiary of a firm is a UK firm. 
[normal]This means that
[normal] UK based subsidiaries or groups of multinational firms would count as being UK based.
[normal] It is therefore
[normal] 
[normal]debateable as to the extent that money 
[normal]is flowing out of the UK economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]d
[normal]epartment is encouraging 
[normal]councils
[normal] to open up their procurement to
[normal] local firms but g
[normal]overnment procurement is subject to Public Procurement Regulations 
[normal]2006 
[normal]and these prohibit any form of discrimination against compani
[normal]es solely on the basis of their nationality
[normal] within the European Economic Area
[normal] and those countries which are signatories to the Government Procurement Agreement. I
[normal]t would therefore be unlawful to seek to restrict artificially the num
[normal]ber of contracts awarded
[normal] to non-
[normal]UK based firms. It is similarly unlawful to seek to reserve a proportion of spend for UK based firms. These regulations are designed to ensure fair cross border trade, and they of course work both ways. The benefit for UK firms is that they are abl
[normal]e to compete effectively and without unfai
[normal]r prejudice against them in non-
[normal]UK markets, especially within the E
[normal]uropean Union
[normal]. Other European countries are subject to the same regulations and for the same reasons
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government is continuing to support the involvement of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in public sector procurement; this includes measures to support the involvement of local 
[normal]small and medium enterprises 
[normal]in local government procurement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Secr
[normal]etary of State strongly supports the abolition of 
[normal]Pre-Qualification Questionnaires
[normal] in order to open procurement to small businesses and, following from the recommendations made in Lord Young’s report ‘Growing Your Business’ 2013, new UK regulations are pla
[normal]nned by summer 2014. These regulations concern the abolishing of 
[normal]Pre-Qualification Questionnaires 
[normal]for low value contracts (i.e. below E
[normal]uropean Union
[normal] threshold) and mandating the use of a standard core 
[normal]Pre-Qualification Questionnaires 
[normal]for high value contrac
[normal]ts; requiring public bodies to be more open about procurement and report their procurement spend with 
[normal]small and medium enterprises
[normal]; and advertising of contract opportunities on a single online portal. Contracts Finder, the one stop shop for suppliers to ac
[normal]cess live and future procurement opportunities, allows users to search for information about contracts worth over £10,000 with the government and its agencies and local government. The system takes feeds from a number of 
[normal]local
[normal] procurement portals across th
[normal]e country enabling UK business and 
[normal]small and medium enterprises 
[normal]to access local government procurement 
[normal]opportunities whether at local 
[normal]and national level. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The d[bold]epartment’s views on the impact of the abolition of the Audit Commission on the ability of [bold]local authorities to detect and tackle fraud, including what the role of the National Audit Office should be in supporting whistleblowers and whether there are any uncertainties about the provision of an independent third party for whistleblowers to contac[bold]t if they are aware of fraud related to local authority procurement exercises (Q463)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In response to the point raised by the Committee on the impact of the abolition of the Audit Commission on the ability of 
[normal]councils
[normal] to detect and tackle fraud we would a
[normal]gr
[normal]ee that the Audit Commission
[normal] has made an important contribution, not least through the requirement for all public bodies subject to audit to participate in the biannual data matching exercise carried out by the Commission’s National Fraud Initiative. Durin
[normal]g the passage of the Local Audi
[normal]t and Accountability Bill, the g
[normal]overnment announced that the Initiative (which
[normal] 
[normal]since its inception in 1996, has helped to identify over £1 billion of fraud, error and overpayment) and its associated data-matching powers would
[normal] transfer to the Cabinet Office. My officials are working with the Cabinet Office to ensure a smooth transition of that important function. We are also working with the Commission to determine the future of its other counter fraud tools that matter to loca
[normal]l government. Furthermore, the wider scope of public audit means that the external auditor would need to be reassured that the body had suitable counter fraud measures in place to protect public funds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, on 10 December we announced a £16.6 mill
[normal]ion of new investment which will not only protect local government from the impact of the Single Fraud Investigation Service on its non-welfare counter fraud capacity, it could enable around 200 more fraud investigators to be recruited in the fight to tack
[normal]le this £2 billion a year problem. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In relation to 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal], we are mirroring the current arrangements. At present, the Audit Commission directs whistleblowers to the appointed auditor who is the person empowered to take any appropriate action in th
[normal]e course of the audit. We will amend the order so that whistleblowers will continue to be able to go directly to their auditor and the 
[normal]National Audit Office’s
[normal] Comptroller and Auditor General to raise concerns, when the Commission is abolished. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any disclos
[normal]ures made to the 
[normal]National Audit Office
[normal] or the appointed auditor will continue to be protected under 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] legislation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20 January 2014
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] A best value authority must make arrangements to secure 
[normal]continuous improvement
[normal] in the way in which its func
[normal]tions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness (LGA 1999, section 3[1]).  A list of best value authorities can be found at 
[normal]http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/27/section/1
[normal] .
[normal] The Fair Deal is a non-statutory policy setting out how pension issues are dealt with when staff are compulsorily transferred from the public sector to inde
[normal]pendent providers delivering public services.  New Fair Deal guidance was issued by
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Treasury in October 2013
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and applies when staff who are members of a public service pension scheme move from the public sector to an independent contractor by way of a tran
[normal]sfer to which TUPE applies, and when staff who are members of a public service pension scheme move by way of a non-voluntary transfer to a public service mutual or to other new models of public service delivery (regardless of whether or not TUPE applies).
