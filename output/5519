defaultI undertook to provide the Committee with some additional information as set out in your Clerk’s email of 17

defaultThe ddefaultepartment’s views on the employment terms and conditions applicable to local government contract delivery by private or othedefaultr sector organisations (Q439-442default)default&#xa0;
defaultThe d
defaultepartment notes that 
defaultcouncils are locally elected bo
defaultdies and individual employers.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs such, 
defaultcouncils
default are best placed
default&#xa0;
defaultto make decisions about the shape of their workforces, taking account of local circumstances and ensuring they deliver value for money for taxpayers.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWe recognise that workforce costs
default&#xa0;
defaultmake
default up a significant proportion of
default&#xa0;
defaultlocal authority
default&#xa0;
defaultspending. Given this, councils will inevitably look to achieve savings in the way they manage their staff.
default&#xa0;
default This may include the outsourcing of jobs and services to the private sector. 
defaultTransfer of Undertaking
defaults (Protection of Employment
default) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) 
defaultis an important part of the pr
defaultotection of employees' rights.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen it comes to outsourcing jobs and services, 
defaultcouncils
default must, of course, abide by the law.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey should also
default&#xa0;
defaultensure
default&#xa0;
defaultthat employees transferrin
defaultg to private or voluntary sectors are treated fairly and equally.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultAll contracts with private sector firms for the delivery of public services routinely contain provisions which require the supplier to comply with all applicable laws and statutes. This is 
defaultthe standard way of ensuring that there is a contractual requirement for suppliers to meet their legal obligations with regard to employment law.
default 
defaultCouncils
default are
default&#xa0;
defaultoften major employers and influencers in their local communities and can play a significant role
default&#xa0;
defaultin encouraging other employers in their communities to pay their workers
default&#xa0;
defaulta proper wage e.g.
default&#xa0;
defaultLiving Wage or the local equivalent
default. 
defaultLocal g
defaultovernment should always award contracts on the basis of the best value for money for the taxpayer and whether to pay th
defaulte living wage must be a question for the employer. T
defaulthe g
defaultovernment helps the low paid through the National Minimum Wage
default and indeed has cut income tax to help low paid people
default. 
default However, i
defaultt is for workers and employers to decide the level of wages above the m
defaultinimum wage based on current cir
defaultcumstances.  This includes the g
defaultovernment as a procurer and an employer.  
defaultOver 95%
default around 20 million
default&#xa0;
defaultemployees
default,
default across all sectors in the 
defaultUK,
default earn above the minimum wage and the majority of public sector workers currently ea
defaultrn above the Living Wage.
defaultOn the matter of staff pension rights, s
defaulttaff employed by best value authorities
default are currently entitled to a broadly equivalent pension scheme if transferred and many contractors have elected to keep staff in the local government pension scheme by becoming admitted 
defaultbodies within the scheme.  The g
defaultovernment is currently considering how
default these arrangements might be reformed in the light of the new Fair Deal guidance 
defaultproduced by Treasury
default, under which central government and school employees are entitled to remain in their current public service pension scheme if their work is transferred t
defaulto a non-public provider.   
default&#xa0;
defaultAs regards zero hours contracts, we note that their use
default is not new, but since 2005, there has been an increase in their use
default and they are used by councils of all political colours, especially for part-time or casual employment r
defaultoles
default. More recently government has been made aware of, and taken note of, anecdotal evidence that has illustrated instances of abuse.
default 
defaultAs mentioned during the Committee 
defaultmeeting of 16 December
default, the Business Secretary is looking into issues around zero hours 
defaultcontracts and has 
defaultasked officials 
defaultfrom the department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
defaultto undertake a fact finding exercise to explore how these contracts work and what the issues are
default. T
defaulthe g
defaultovernment published a formal consultation on options to address
default these issues and improve how zero hours contracts are used in the economy
default on 19 December
default. The consultation will close
default on 13 March 2014 after which the Government will publish a response setting out any next steps we intend to make. The consultation

default&#xa0;
defaultThe proportion of local authority sector spend on services and goods defaultdelivered by non-UK companies (Q456)default default&#xa0;defaultThe d
defaultepartment does not have an estimate of the proportion of local go
defaultvernment spend delivered by non-
defaultUK companies. 
defaultHowever 
defaults
defaultpend data and details of contracts awarded would identify who the winning supplier
default was.
default  
defaultFor the purposes of the Regulations, a properly incorporated UK subsidiary of a firm is a UK firm. 
defaultThis means that
default UK based subsidiaries or groups of multinational firms would count as being UK based.
default It is therefore
default 
defaultdebateable as to the extent that money 
defaultis flowing out of the UK economy.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultd
defaultepartment is encouraging 
defaultcouncils
default to open up their procurement to
default local firms but g
defaultovernment procurement is subject to Public Procurement Regulations 
default2006 
defaultand these prohibit any form of discrimination against compani
defaultes solely on the basis of their nationality
default within the European Economic Area
default and those countries which are signatories to the Government Procurement Agreement. I
defaultt would therefore be unlawful to seek to restrict artificially the num
defaultber of contracts awarded
default to non-
defaultUK based firms. It is similarly unlawful to seek to reserve a proportion of spend for UK based firms. These regulations are designed to ensure fair cross border trade, and they of course work both ways. The benefit for UK firms is that they are abl
defaulte to compete effectively and without unfai
defaultr prejudice against them in non-
defaultUK markets, especially within the E
defaulturopean Union
default. Other European countries are subject to the same regulations and for the same reasons
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government is continuing to support the involvement of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in public sector procurement; this includes measures to support the involvement of local 
defaultsmall and medium enterprises 
defaultin local government procurement.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Secr
defaultetary of State strongly supports the abolition of 
defaultPre-Qualification Questionnaires
default in order to open procurement to small businesses and, following from the recommendations made in Lord Young’s report ‘Growing Your Business’ 2013, new UK regulations are pla
defaultnned by summer 2014. These regulations concern the abolishing of 
defaultPre-Qualification Questionnaires 
defaultfor low value contracts (i.e. below E
defaulturopean Union
default threshold) and mandating the use of a standard core 
defaultPre-Qualification Questionnaires 
defaultfor high value contrac
defaultts; requiring public bodies to be more open about procurement and report their procurement spend with 
defaultsmall and medium enterprises
default; and advertising of contract opportunities on a single online portal. Contracts Finder, the one stop shop for suppliers to ac
defaultcess live and future procurement opportunities, allows users to search for information about contracts worth over £10,000 with the government and its agencies and local government. The system takes feeds from a number of 
defaultlocal
default procurement portals across th
defaulte country enabling UK business and 
defaultsmall and medium enterprises 
defaultto access local government procurement 
defaultopportunities whether at local 
defaultand national level. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ddefaultepartment’s views on the impact of the abolition of the Audit Commission on the ability of defaultlocal authorities to detect and tackle fraud, including what the role of the National Audit Office should be in supporting whistleblowers and whether there are any uncertainties about the provision of an independent third party for whistleblowers to contacdefaultt if they are aware of fraud related to local authority procurement exercises (Q463)default&#xa0;
defaultIn response to the point raised by the Committee on the impact of the abolition of the Audit Commission on the ability of 
defaultcouncils
default to detect and tackle fraud we would a
defaultgr
defaultee that the Audit Commission
default has made an important contribution, not least through the requirement for all public bodies subject to audit to participate in the biannual data matching exercise carried out by the Commission’s National Fraud Initiative. Durin
defaultg the passage of the Local Audi
defaultt and Accountability Bill, the g
defaultovernment announced that the Initiative (which
default 
defaultsince its inception in 1996, has helped to identify over £1 billion of fraud, error and overpayment) and its associated data-matching powers would
default transfer to the Cabinet Office. My officials are working with the Cabinet Office to ensure a smooth transition of that important function. We are also working with the Commission to determine the future of its other counter fraud tools that matter to loca
defaultl government. Furthermore, the wider scope of public audit means that the external auditor would need to be reassured that the body had suitable counter fraud measures in place to protect public funds.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, on 10 December we announced a £16.6 mill
defaultion of new investment which will not only protect local government from the impact of the Single Fraud Investigation Service on its non-welfare counter fraud capacity, it could enable around 200 more fraud investigators to be recruited in the fight to tack
defaultle this £2 billion a year problem. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to 
defaultwhistleblowing
default, we are mirroring the current arrangements. At present, the Audit Commission directs whistleblowers to the appointed auditor who is the person empowered to take any appropriate action in th
defaulte course of the audit. We will amend the order so that whistleblowers will continue to be able to go directly to their auditor and the 
defaultNational Audit Office’s
default Comptroller and Auditor General to raise concerns, when the Commission is abolished. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny disclos
defaultures made to the 
defaultNational Audit Office
default or the appointed auditor will continue to be protected under 
defaultwhistleblowing
default legislation.

default A best value authority must make arrangements to secure 
defaultcontinuous improvement
default in the way in which its func
defaulttions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness (LGA 1999, section 3[1]).  A list of best value authorities can be found at 
defaulthttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/27/section/1
default .
default The Fair Deal is a non-statutory policy setting out how pension issues are dealt with when staff are compulsorily transferred from the public sector to inde
defaultpendent providers delivering public services.  New Fair Deal guidance was issued by
default&#xa0;
defaultTreasury in October 2013
default&#xa0;
defaultand applies when staff who are members of a public service pension scheme move from the public sector to an independent contractor by way of a tran
defaultsfer to which TUPE applies, and when staff who are members of a public service pension scheme move by way of a non-voluntary transfer to a public service mutual or to other new models of public service delivery (regardless of whether or not TUPE applies).
