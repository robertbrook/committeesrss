Written evidence submitted by Community Law Partnership (JRR 0002)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We make this submission further to our previous general submission and previous evidence submission to the Inquiry and in respons
[normal]e to the further call for evidence with regard to the Ministry of Justice consultation paper 
[normal]Judicial Review: proposals for further reform
[normal]. As explained in our submission to Lord McNally ( see annex to this paper), we are very concerned at the sudden appea
[normal]rance in the latest consultation paper of a proposal to refer all planning appeals to tribunal and to remove legal aid from appeals under sections 288 &amp; 289 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.We are concerned that this proposal may ‘go under the rad
[normal]ar’ especially because many people may not realise that virtually the only (if not 
[normal]the only[bold]) groups that will be adversely affected will be Gypsies and Travellers. We give details here of three cases that show the importance of 
[normal]ss
[normal] 288 &amp; 289 cases for Gypsi
[normal]es and Travellers and the importance of the availability of legal aid in such cases.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Before Ms Moore moved to the appeal site in July 2010 she and her children lived for some 12 years in a caravan situated on the front drive of a rented Ho
[normal]using Association property in Orpington.  This was due to the fact that she had an aversion to living in bricks and mortar accommodation.  The Housing Association in March 2010 gave Ms 
[normal]M
[normal]oore a 28 days’ Notice to remove the vehicles from her drive and later
[normal] a further Notice was sent regarding the Association seeking legal advice on the matter.  Ms Moore had submitted an application for planning permission for her site which already had the benefit of permission for equestrian use.  In July 2010 Ms Moore, tog
[normal]ether with her children, moved onto the site with her mobile home and her tenancy with the Housing Association was terminated.  The local planning authority (LPA) refused her application for change of use and they then commenced injunction proceedings in l
[normal]ate 2010 which have been stayed pending the outcome of her appeal.  The refusal of planning permission was appealed to the Planning Inspectorate and the Inspector went on to dismiss her planning appeal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Had legal aid not been available for a Section 288 T
[normal]own &amp; Country Planning Act (T&amp;CPA) 1990 application to the high court, then that would have brought the matter to an end.  The LPA would have proceeded with its application for an injunction under Section 187B of the T&amp;CPA 1990 and by now Ms Moore would be
[normal] off the land.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ms Moore then lodged her challenge to the Inspector’s dismissal of her appeal and counsel was then instructed on the matter.  Judgment was handed down by Mrs Justice Cox on 16 November 2012.  Mrs Justice Cox allowed the appeal and gave a ve
[normal]ry lengthy and reasoned judgment.  She found that the Inspector failed to make relevant findings, as required, and that his decision to refuse a temporary planning permission to Ms Moore was irrational and could not stand.  Alternatively, she considered th
[normal]at the Inspector’s decision on the issue of temporary permission was inadequately reasoned and that, for that reason in addition, his decision could not stand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Secretary of State then appealed to the Court of Appeal who upheld the decision of Mrs Just
[normal]ice Cox. Lord Justice Richards emphasised the importance of taking into account 
[normal]the fact that the family would have had to resort to roadside camping if they did not receive temporary planning permission. This is an important decision not just for Ms Moore
[normal] but for all Gypsies and Travellers who are seeking at least temporary permission while they wait for local planning authorities to produce their five year deliverable supply of sites (which they should already have done under the DCLG’s new planning polic
[normal]y 
[normal]Planning policy for traveller sites
[normal]). Once again this important decision (not only for our client but for other Gypsies and Travellers) would not have been achieved without the availability of legal aid.     
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]This is now the leading authority on the approach to Gypsy and Traveller sites in the context of Green Belt policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In
[normal] this case the Appellants, Kathleen and Leonard Butler, were Romani Gypsies who lived on their own land in the Green Belt with their two young children. 
[normal]Wychavon
[normal] District Council refused their application for planning permission since they said it constitu
[normal]ted inappropriate development within the Green Belt. That decision was then appealed by way of a Section 78 Appeal to the Planning Inspectorate and on appeal the Planning Inspector granted Mr and Mrs Butler a temporary planning permission of five years. Pl
[normal]anning permission was granted for a number of reasons and these related to the family’s educational and health needs, and the current lack of alternative sites which all constituted ‘very special circumstances’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The LPA appealed that decision to the high
[normal] court and the judge hearing the Council’s appeal allowed it, holding that the factors which were identified by the Inspector were commonplace and could not amount to very special circumstances. This meant that the five year temporary planning permission w
[normal]hich had been granted to Mr and Mrs Butler was taken away from them and then the matter would need to be remitted back to the Inspectorate for a fresh determination. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fortunately for Mr and Mrs Butler, with the benefit of public funding, an appeal was lod
[normal]ged with the Court of Appeal challenging the high court decision. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government consented to a judgment and was not represented at the final hearing in June 2008. The Secretary of State had not resisted the app
[normal]lication to quash the decision. Although she was not a party to the appeal she had submitted a written statement in which she had only taken issue with a small part of the judge’s reasoning. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Court of Appeal handed down its decision on 23 June 2008. The Court of Appeal allowed the Appeal. The court held that the Judge below (and also Sullivan J in 
[normal]R (Chelmsford BC) –v- The First Secretary of State 
[normal][2004] 2 P &amp; CR 677) had been wrong to appl
[normal]y a two stage test, requiring both that there must be circumstances which can reasonably be described as very special and that the various types of harm had been clearly outweighed by other considerations. There was no such ‘rigid division’ and the word ‘s
[normal]pecial’ in the guidance meant ‘not a quantitative test, but a qualitative Judgment as to weight to be given to the particular factor for planning purposes’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In this case the judge in the high court had been wrong to quash as perverse the Inspector’s deci
[normal]sion that there were very special circumstances such as to justify a temporary five year permission. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]This 
[normal]case was an application under Section 288 of T&amp;CPA 1990. The Inspector appointed by the Secretary of State had dismissed our client’s appeal against the refusal of planning permission. The site in question was in the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beau
[normal]ty (AONB). The Inspector dismissed the appeal following a Public Inquiry and with the benefit of public funding an application under Section 288 was lodged with the high court. The Inspector’s decision was criticised on two main grounds: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]The way in wh
[normal]ich the Inspector addressed the rights of Langton and McGill under Article 8;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]              
[normal]The Inspector’s treatment of the balance to be struck between the ‘need for sites’ which supported the grant of permission and the harm done to the AONB. 
[normal]The judge hearing t
[normal]his case rejected the first ground but upheld the second. The outcome of the case was that our appeal was upheld and the Inspector’s decision was quashed. When that decision was remitted back to the Planning Inspectorate, Langton and McGill were granted a 
[normal]temporary planning permission.

[normal]Annex[bold]&#xa0;[bold]JUDICIAL REVIEW: PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER REFORM[bold]&#xa0;[bold]SUBMISSIONS OF LORD AVEBURY, BARONESS WHITAKER AND CHRIS JOHNSON ON THE IMPLICATIONS FOR GYPSIES AND TRAVELLERS[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We are grateful to Lord McNally for giving us the 
[normal]opportunity to meet him and put these submissions to him on 30
[normal]th
[normal] October 2013. At his request we have provided this summary of the submissions we put forward and we also mention certain other matters that were raised in the meeting.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We started with a quot
[normal]e from former Lord Justice of Appeal, Stephen 
[normal]Sedley
[normal]:
[normal]In the round, judicial review is an economic and effective branch of litigation performing a constitutionally critical role in keeping the exercise of public power within the law, and legal aid for it i
[normal]s for the most part money well spent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Planning[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Under the proposals there are two ways in which Gypsies and Travellers who are trying to get planning permission for their own land might be stopped from receiving legal aid for a planning appeal to the 
[normal]High Court.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specialist property chamber of the Upper Tribunal[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The rationale behind this proposal is to cut down on delays caused to large developments. This is perfectly acceptable but individuals who need to take appeals should be excluded from this tra
[normal]nsfer since there is no legal aid for tribunal representation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It might be said that the ‘safety net’ of exceptional funding under LASPOA 2012 s10 is available to such individuals. However figures from the Legal Aid Practitioners Group show that, at the b
[normal]eginning of September 2013 ( the new scheme having commenced in April 2013), out of 635 applications across England and covering all areas of law, only 11 had been granted. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Community Law Partnership (CLP) reve
[normal]aled that only one grant was for a Housing Law case (Gypsy and Traveller cases come under this umbrella). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The simple fact is that the vast majority of our clients will not be able to represent themselves: the literacy problems in the Gypsy and Traveller 
[normal]community are well known; many have not had a formal education or very little formal education; the law and procedures are extremely complex even if you have had a formal education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Town and Country Planning Act 1990 sections 288 &amp; 289[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The bald proposal 
[normal]to remove legal aid from such cases seems to target Romani Gypsies and Irish Travellers since it is very difficult to imagine which other individuals might receive legal aid for such appeals. CLP have put in a FOIA request on this issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lord McNally info
[normal]rmed us at the meeting that the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) feel that the processes in place ( involving planning inspectors and sometimes the Secretary of State himself) are sufficient to guarantee good decisions without the nec
[normal]essity of an appeal process. We responded as follows:
[normal](i)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are many successful appeals (see the 
[normal]Moore 
[normal]case as just one good example)  – so the process cannot be quite so sufficient as is stated;
[normal](ii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]No doubt county court judges, high court judges and others c
[normal]arry out careful and detailed processes – yet there is an appeal mechanism against their decisions – why should Gypsies and Travellers yet again be singled out as not being entitled to have an appeal process?
[normal](iii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] What if the local authority appeals to the hig
[normal]h court against the inspector’s decision in favour of the Gypsy or Traveller concerned – if the Gypsy or Traveller is not represented, the local authority are much more likely to succeed in their appeal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the Gypsy and Traveller concerned are successful
[normal], then their accommodation problems are resolved. This will have significant knock on implications on education, healthcare, job opportunities etc. On the other hand, if they are not successful they will end up on roadside encampments which involve expense
[normal] for taxpayers in terms of eviction actions by local authorities. So, at the end of the day, there are not really any costs savings if legal aid is removed for such cases. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Judicial review[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The fact is that most cases settle before permission is dealt 
[normal]with and that settlement is usually favourable to the claimant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any such settlement does not mean that the claimant will get his/her costs. The public authority concerned might say they will settle but without conceding that the grounds of claim were just
[normal]ified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This has led to the proposal that the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) should have a discretion to pay the costs when the case settles before permission is dealt with but without a costs award in favour of the claimant. Due to the way the LAA have dealt with
[normal] exceptional funding applications and other matters, legal aid practitioners have absolutely no confidence that the LAA will grant costs in such cases. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Judicial review holds public authorities to account, leads to better decision making and leads to the 
[normal]removal of unlawful policies and practices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Removal of legal aid in these cases (either directly or because legal aid lawyers will not be able to take the risk of running a case) will inevitably mean that many individuals in dire circumstances
[normal] will be denied the right to a fair hearing and that unlawful actions and decisions by local authorities will go unchecked. These proposals will have a disproportionate impact on Gypsies and Travellers.
