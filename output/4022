[normal]2.   Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.  What should the BBC be for and what[bold] 
[normal]should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Public service broadcasting refers to TV programmes that are
[normal] broadcast for the public benefit rather than for purely commercial purposes.
[normal] (Ofcom)
[normal]Ofcom measures delivery of programming by public service broadcasters
[normal] against four objectives, or "public service purposes": 
[normal](a) informing our understanding of the world
[normal]; 
[normal](b) stimulating knowledge and learning
[normal](c) reflecting UK cultural identity; and 
[normal](d) representing diversity and alternative viewpoints.
[normal] 
[normal]VLV supports these criteria of measurement and believes they are still fit for purpose. 
[normal]4.  What is the BBC for?[bold]While commercial broadcasters aim to return value to their shareholders or owners, the BBC exists to create public value. In other words, it aims to serve its audiences not just as consumers, but as members of a wider society,
[normal] with programmes and services which, while seeking to inform, 
[normal]educate and entertain audiences, also serve wider public purposes. Public value is a measure of the BBC’s contribution to the quality of life in the UK. 
[normal]5.  How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.  Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.  What scope, scale and remit [bold]should the BBC have? [bold]8.  Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.  What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?[bold]10.  How have the BBC’s commercial activit[bold]ies during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?[bold]11.  What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new w[bold]ays of distributing content?[bold]12.  How should [bold]the BBC be funded beyond 2016? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]13.  Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?[bold]14[bold].[bold]  What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]15.  [bold]How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]16.  In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional frame work for the BBC?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]December 2013
