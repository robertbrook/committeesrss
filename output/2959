&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Submission from [bold]Sheffield City Council [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The following responses are in respect of the fi
[normal]ve topics to be covered by the i
[normal]nquiry:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1a) [bold]              [bold]To what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver [bold]              [bold]value for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, [bold]              [bold]including stimulating the local economy?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Within Sheffield City Council procurement has been centralised and has clear objectives in terms of value for money financial objectives and over the last 5 years has delivered nearly £100 million of savings but with the required service and other objectives covering social, economic and environmental areas. 
[normal] 
[normal]A robust and auditable benefit realisation process is in place. 
[normal] 
[normal]For 'people' related contracts we include objectives in terms of apprenticeships and skills development programmes. For 5 years we have operated our Buy Local programme (Buy4Sheffield) which has delivered over £500 million of extra Local Authority business to local firms and we are proud that this resulted in us being awarded the first of the Government's
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]'Best Local Authority to do business with' awards earlier this year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1b) [bold]              [bold]To what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local [bold]              [bold]residents in delivering value for money?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Where local residents are directly impacted by procurement they will be involved as stakeholders in the up front Commissioning process to identify needs and potential delivery options. 
[normal] 
[normal]They may also be involved in the supplier tendering/selection process, a current example being tenant representatives being involved in the tender evaluation for social housing repairs and maintenance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1c) [bold]              [bold]To what extent are local authorities able to develop long term [bold]              [bold]relationships with contractors?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This will vary depending on the service being contracted but in all cases an appropriate supplier relationship plan is put in place.
[normal] 
[normal] Where there is a highly competitive, price sensitive market contract durations tend to be shorter. 
[normal] 
[normal]However we do have a number of long term strategic supplier relationships and have in place very comprehensive arrangements. 
[normal] 
[normal]The council is seen as leading the way in the public sector via its Intelligent Client approach and Contract Management Toolkit which has been implemented in councils across the country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]              [bold]Do authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint [bold]              [bold]procurement opportunities, including those available from central [bold]              [bold]government? [bold] [bold]In addition the committee would welcome information on [bold]              [bold]PFI contracts and their operation within local government.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In Sheffield other available collaborative arrangements, for example from GPS (Government Procurement service), PRO5 group purchasing organisations etc. are 
[normal]always considered as procurement delivery options. 
[normal] 
[normal]However only about 12% of our spend is currently through these arrangements, but this % is growing,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]as Sheffield is able to obtain better deals. 
[normal] 
[normal]We support these collaborative arrangements in principle but believe that the current public sector group purchasing organisations are not sufficiently commercial and are not achieving best value. 
[normal] 
[normal]We have considerable experience in managing long term PFI contracts and would be delighted to provide the Select Committee with any information it requires.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3a). [bold]              [bold]How can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to [bold]              [bold]implement effective procurement strategies, including value for money [bold]              [bold]and social and economic objectives?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Sheffield has shown that this can be achieved. It relies on recruiting top class procurement leadership, having Chief Executive sponsorship and support for the transformation of procurement and being prepared to invest in recruiting and professionally training the required staff. 
[normal] 
[normal]In Sheffield we have run the CIPS professional development programme for some 5 years and 75% of procurement staff are professionally qualified. 
[normal] 
[normal]This is a simple return on investment decision and each procurement person delivers 11 times their salary in financial savings delivered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3b). [bold]              [bold]More specifically does local government have sufficient understanding [bold]              [bold]of its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services [bold]              [bold]to deliver quality procurement strategies locally and regionally. [bold] [bold]If not [bold]              [bold]how can deficiencies be addressed?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The answer is absolutely yes. Sheffield has led the Region in implementing a 'state of the art' online spend analysis system which will be operating in all 22 local authorities in the Region by the end of the year, already some £4 billion per annum of expenditure is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]covered by this system which provides
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]total spend transparency. 
[normal] 
[normal]In addition the best practice Category Management approach implemented is all about fully understanding all aspects of specific spend, market analysis and market development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. [bold]              [bold]To what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting [bold]              [bold]understood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are [bold]              [bold]tailored to product and supplier market places?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal] [bold] [bold]More specifically do [bold]              [bold]local authorities maintain and operate effective client management [bold]              [bold]functions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow [bold]              [bold]the flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget [bold]              [bold]reductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Risk identification and management is a fundamental part of procurement and contract management and is built into our best practice processes, toolkits etc. The majority of local authorities probably do not have robust client and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] contract management functions in place and that is why our Intelligent Client approach and Contract Management Toolkit is recognised best practice across both the public and private
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]sector and has already been implemented or is in the process of being implemented
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]by some 20 other local authorities. 
[normal] 
[normal]Sheffield has a very long history of outsourced service contracts
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and builds the necessary flexibility, incentives etc. into 
[normal]its contracts to change and develop over time. 
[normal] 
[normal]This is essential in that some two thirds of Sheffield’s revenue is spent via third parties and recently experience has shown that our approach works as suppliers have worked with us to make the necessary expenditure cuts. 
[normal] 
[normal]The fact that all procurement and contract management is within one commercial function, which we believe is unique in the public sector, is critical to drive these strategies and procurement transformations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]              [bold]How is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are [bold]              [bold]arrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud [bold]              [bold]effective?[bold]              
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All procurement is in one place within the Commercial Services function and covered by one set of best practice procurement standards, processes etc. In addition a single procurement workflow system manages the process and provides full auditability at all stages. There is therefore full transparency and control over procurement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition Commercial Services is responsible for all the controls built into Council standing orders that prevent any improper activities, for example there is only one way to pay suppliers so that this can easily be monitored, only Commercial Services can approve suppliers that we will trade with and only after full due diligence etc. Commercial Services has an independent
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]compliance and control function which oversees these controls and their operation, closely supported by Internal Audit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. [bold]              [bold]Is local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and [bold]              [bold]does it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically are [bold]              [bold]the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services [bold]              [bold]and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and [bold]              [bold]effective? More specifically to what extent are local authorities able to [bold]              [bold]provide assurance to central government that value for money is [bold]              [bold]delivered?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]All procurement spend is transparent via published detailed contract registers and all spend over £250 being published each month. Suppliers have considerable powers to challenge via the EU Regulations when they wish to question procurement processes and outcomes which they do, this provides both a control but also assurance in that our best practice procurement approach has not been found at fault via these challenges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]More proactively we actively encourage feedback to unsuccessful bidders so that they can understand how they failed and to improve in the future. Sheffield has the most robust benefit realisation process, which is fully auditable to prove the value it has delivered through procurement.
[normal]  
[normal]In addition we utilise the CIPFA benchmarking service to assess our performance against others, including central government and have recently implemented
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a procurement performance management and benchmarking framework
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]across all 22 Local authorities in the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Region which we believe is a first in the UK.
