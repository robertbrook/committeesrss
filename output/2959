default&#xa0;defaultSubmission from defaultSheffield City Council default&#xa0;
defaultThe following responses are in respect of the fi
defaultve topics to be covered by the i
defaultnquiry:
default&#xa0;
default1a) default              defaultTo what extent is local government procurement organised to deliver default              defaultvalue for money and social, economic and environmental objectives, default              defaultincluding stimulating the local economy?default&#xa0;
defaultWithin Sheffield City Council procurement has been centralised and has clear objectives in terms of value for money financial objectives and over the last 5 years has delivered nearly £100 million of savings but with the required service and other objectives covering social, economic and environmental areas. 
default 
defaultA robust and auditable benefit realisation process is in place. 
default 
defaultFor 'people' related contracts we include objectives in terms of apprenticeships and skills development programmes. For 5 years we have operated our Buy Local programme (Buy4Sheffield) which has delivered over £500 million of extra Local Authority business to local firms and we are proud that this resulted in us being awarded the first of the Government's
default&#xa0;
default'Best Local Authority to do business with' awards earlier this year.
default&#xa0;
default1b) default              defaultTo what extent are local authorities achieving the involvement of local default              defaultresidents in delivering value for money?default&#xa0;
defaultWhere local residents are directly impacted by procurement they will be involved as stakeholders in the up front Commissioning process to identify needs and potential delivery options. 
default 
defaultThey may also be involved in the supplier tendering/selection process, a current example being tenant representatives being involved in the tender evaluation for social housing repairs and maintenance.
default&#xa0;
default1c) default              defaultTo what extent are local authorities able to develop long term default              defaultrelationships with contractors?default&#xa0;
defaultThis will vary depending on the service being contracted but in all cases an appropriate supplier relationship plan is put in place.
default 
default Where there is a highly competitive, price sensitive market contract durations tend to be shorter. 
default 
defaultHowever we do have a number of long term strategic supplier relationships and have in place very comprehensive arrangements. 
default 
defaultThe council is seen as leading the way in the public sector via its Intelligent Client approach and Contract Management Toolkit which has been implemented in councils across the country.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2. default              defaultDo authorities take sufficient advantage of collaborative and joint default              defaultprocurement opportunities, including those available from central default              defaultgovernment? default defaultIn addition the committee would welcome information on default              defaultPFI contracts and their operation within local government.default&#xa0;
defaultIn Sheffield other available collaborative arrangements, for example from GPS (Government Procurement service), PRO5 group purchasing organisations etc. are 
defaultalways considered as procurement delivery options. 
default 
defaultHowever only about 12% of our spend is currently through these arrangements, but this % is growing,
default&#xa0;
defaultas Sheffield is able to obtain better deals. 
default 
defaultWe support these collaborative arrangements in principle but believe that the current public sector group purchasing organisations are not sufficiently commercial and are not achieving best value. 
default 
defaultWe have considerable experience in managing long term PFI contracts and would be delighted to provide the Select Committee with any information it requires.
default&#xa0;
default3a). default              defaultHow can local authorities access the skills, expertise and capabilities to default              defaultimplement effective procurement strategies, including value for money default              defaultand social and economic objectives?default&#xa0;
defaultSheffield has shown that this can be achieved. It relies on recruiting top class procurement leadership, having Chief Executive sponsorship and support for the transformation of procurement and being prepared to invest in recruiting and professionally training the required staff. 
default 
defaultIn Sheffield we have run the CIPS professional development programme for some 5 years and 75% of procurement staff are professionally qualified. 
default 
defaultThis is a simple return on investment decision and each procurement person delivers 11 times their salary in financial savings delivered.
default&#xa0;
default3b). default              defaultMore specifically does local government have sufficient understanding default              defaultof its procurement expenditure and the markets for goods and services default              defaultto deliver quality procurement strategies locally and regionally. default defaultIf not default              defaulthow can deficiencies be addressed?default&#xa0;
defaultThe answer is absolutely yes. Sheffield has led the Region in implementing a 'state of the art' online spend analysis system which will be operating in all 22 local authorities in the Region by the end of the year, already some £4 billion per annum of expenditure is
default&#xa0;
defaultcovered by this system which provides
default&#xa0;
defaulttotal spend transparency. 
default 
defaultIn addition the best practice Category Management approach implemented is all about fully understanding all aspects of specific spend, market analysis and market development.
default&#xa0;
default4. default              defaultTo what extent is risk in local government procurement and contracting default              defaultunderstood and managed and contracting strategies adopted, which are default              defaulttailored to product and supplier market places?default&#xa0;
default default defaultMore specifically do default              defaultlocal authorities maintain and operate effective client management default              defaultfunctions and have they entered contractual arrangements which allow default              defaultthe flexibility to meet changing circumstances such as budget default              defaultreductions or changes in the way a service has to be delivered?default&#xa0;
defaultRisk identification and management is a fundamental part of procurement and contract management and is built into our best practice processes, toolkits etc. The majority of local authorities probably do not have robust client and
default&#xa0;
default contract management functions in place and that is why our Intelligent Client approach and Contract Management Toolkit is recognised best practice across both the public and private
default&#xa0;
defaultsector and has already been implemented or is in the process of being implemented
default&#xa0;
defaultby some 20 other local authorities. 
default 
defaultSheffield has a very long history of outsourced service contracts
default&#xa0;
defaultand builds the necessary flexibility, incentives etc. into 
defaultits contracts to change and develop over time. 
default 
defaultThis is essential in that some two thirds of Sheffield’s revenue is spent via third parties and recently experience has shown that our approach works as suppliers have worked with us to make the necessary expenditure cuts. 
default 
defaultThe fact that all procurement and contract management is within one commercial function, which we believe is unique in the public sector, is critical to drive these strategies and procurement transformations.
default&#xa0;
default5. default              defaultHow is regularity and propriety of procurement secured and are default              defaultarrangements for detecting and addressing impropriety and fraud default              defaulteffective?default              
default&#xa0;
defaultAll procurement is in one place within the Commercial Services function and covered by one set of best practice procurement standards, processes etc. In addition a single procurement workflow system manages the process and provides full auditability at all stages. There is therefore full transparency and control over procurement.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition Commercial Services is responsible for all the controls built into Council standing orders that prevent any improper activities, for example there is only one way to pay suppliers so that this can easily be monitored, only Commercial Services can approve suppliers that we will trade with and only after full due diligence etc. Commercial Services has an independent
default&#xa0;
defaultcompliance and control function which oversees these controls and their operation, closely supported by Internal Audit.
default&#xa0;
default6. default              defaultIs local authority procurement fully transparent, audited effectively and default              defaultdoes it provide appropriate mechanisms for redress? Specifically are default              defaultthe arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services default              defaultand goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and default              defaulteffective? More specifically to what extent are local authorities able to default              defaultprovide assurance to central government that value for money is default              defaultdelivered?default&#xa0;
defaultAll procurement spend is transparent via published detailed contract registers and all spend over £250 being published each month. Suppliers have considerable powers to challenge via the EU Regulations when they wish to question procurement processes and outcomes which they do, this provides both a control but also assurance in that our best practice procurement approach has not been found at fault via these challenges.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultMore proactively we actively encourage feedback to unsuccessful bidders so that they can understand how they failed and to improve in the future. Sheffield has the most robust benefit realisation process, which is fully auditable to prove the value it has delivered through procurement.
default  
defaultIn addition we utilise the CIPFA benchmarking service to assess our performance against others, including central government and have recently implemented
default&#xa0;
defaulta procurement performance management and benchmarking framework
default&#xa0;
defaultacross all 22 Local authorities in the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Region which we believe is a first in the UK.
