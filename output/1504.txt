[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[1. Is the UK glo]]]

[[[bally competitive and attractive to potential investors?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; The current success of UK industry is largely based on significant previous investments in innovation. Throughout the past century, ground-breaking research has been exploited by UK industry: pulled through from early development phases to manufacturing.. This has enabled UK industry to compete as one of the leading players in a global technology race.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Over the past two decades, however, ADS believes that the UK’s competitive advantage in innovation has been gradually eroded. Although the recent industrial strategies are helping to close this competitiveness gap, the UK still lags behind the strategic focus and efficiency of others innovation policies.&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Research by Nesta suggests that the UK has been under-investing in innovation by over £38bn each year. In addition, business investment remains 25% below pre-recession levels. Part of the problem is that the recent, and indeed needed, focus on industrial strategies is not being supported by the UK’s tax, skills and immigration regimes that are globally uncompetitive for investment in R&amp;D and technology. &#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0; On support for innovation, the UK is currently 14th in the OECD and G20 for tax support for R&amp;D, 28th for tax support for innovative machinery and 41st for support for new manufacturing facilities, which as discussed later, are an inseparable part of the high-value manufacturing innovation process. &#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of engineering skills, the UK ranks 24th in the OECD for engineers as a percentage of all graduates. This leaves the UK facing shortage of almost 60,000 graduate engineers each year. &#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0; Nor have successive governments’ policies on immigration recognised the importance of highly-skilled immigration to the UK and the negative-impact of excluding skilled workers from our economy. Currently, almost 30% of all engineering graduates are from outside the UK, and current policies and rhetoric on immigration make it difficult for these much needed skills to remain in the UK after graduation.&#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK’s existing funding for R&amp;D, in particular in the science and research base, is also fragmented, reducing the impact of otherwise high-quality research. For example, both UK industry and other researchers have limited visibility of research taking place at UK universities and certainly no overall picture of research taking place within industry, valuable to their own technological aims. This lack of visibility also prevents industry from accessing and exploiting the world-class research taking place on its doorstep.&#xa0;1.8&#xa0;&#xa0; Moreover, inaccessible research will cause valuable investment from UK businesses in the development stage to go abroad. Potential UK investment is instead often invested in research taking place at foreign research hubs, taking with it jobs (including highly-skilled, high gross value added (GVA) employment). This would weaken the UK’s skills base and, furthermore, reduce investment opportunities for further research in the UK. Lack of access to research has a knock-on effect, curtailing investment in UK capability and potentially damaging the next generation of research and skills.&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;&#xa0; Growth Partnerships between industry and government, such as the successful Aerospace Growth Partnership (AGP), are working to improve this situation. Long-term, focussed government commitments to research infrastructure funding will encourage industry co-investment. Industry business plans work to ten years ahead and it is vital that government funding can transcend electoral cycles and match these timescales to give industry the confidence to co-invest. Cross party support for industrial strategies and growth partnerships such as the AGP, Defence Growth Partnership (DGP) and Security and Resilience Growth Partnership (SRGP), is essential for industry to ensure its long-term investment decisions are safeguarded from changes in political priorities&#xa0;1.10 As Western countries place a greater emphasis on high-tech, advanced manufacturing, the UK will be at a disadvantage to countries whose research infrastructure is more integrated such as the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and the French ONERA. As centres of excellence at critical mass of research infrastructure, the DLR and ONERA are better able to attract global industrial investment and leverage additional EU funding.&#xa0;1.11 This focus on generating critical mass in existing R&amp;D funding must also be supported by step-change improvements in wider innovation policy landscape, including the corporate tax regime and an innovation friendly skills pipeline. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2. Does the UK’s innovation policy place sufficient focus on applied R&amp;D and exploitation?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0; UK innovation policy under successive Governments has not fully recognised the different R&amp;D models under which the UK’s high tech industries operate. This has led to funding streams generally following the R&amp;D model required by the pharmaceutical industry – one that has a proportionally large investment in research – over the model required by the engineering industries – with a proportionally large investment in development. The imbalance of annual funding between Research Councils – c.£3bn – and the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) – under £400m – demonstrates this.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0; As depicted in Figure 1 below, the focus on research in the pharmaceutical industry is far greater than the developmental stage. In contrast, the innovation model in industries such as aerospace or defence requires a much far greater investment in the design and development phases. Unlike the pharmaceutical R&amp;D model, the aerospace and defence industries rely on large scale demonstrators for the development of their products, taking laboratory research through costly technology development and manufacturing development phases. Likewise, as the equipment being produced through the engineering R&amp;D model is safety critical, demonstrators are vital in testing components both individually and connected, throughout the manufacturing process.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0; The 7-8 time greater Government funding for Research Councils relative to the TSB means that the UK government limited R&amp;D grants and funding are far more likely to support research-intensive innovation and provide insufficient support to industries with development-intensive innovation models.&#xa0;

[[[Figure 1 – R&amp;D models differ by sector]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0; This bias towards research-intensive R&amp;D processes is reinforced by the UK’s corporate tax regime. As noted above, the UK is not globally competitive in-terms of supporting R&amp;D and capital investment through the tax regime.  Incentives that do exist within the regime, in particular the new Patent Box, also have an in-built bias towards certain types of innovation models. By providing a discounted corporate tax rate on income generated from patents, the Patent Box provides benefits to products with low-technological complexity and shallow innovation supply-chains (albeit with high scientific and research complexity). &#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0; For example, once a drug has been proven, it is relatively easy to patent and produce, and so to identify income generated from a patent for tax purposes. It is far more complicated to identify the income generated from a patented technology embedded within an engine or aircraft. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3. Is there a sufficient level of funding for R&amp;D in the UK?]]]&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As highlighted in the NAO report ‘Research and Development funding for science and technology in the UK’, the UK has had a consistently low percentage of GDP spent on R&amp;D over the last 20 years, considerably lower than most rival nation competitors in the industries ADS represents.&#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As shown in Figure 2 below, since the recession, the UK has fallen behind key OECD competitors in terms of Government spending on all R&amp;D across the economy and has in fact reduced R&amp;D spending as a proportion of GDP since 2007.

Laboratory based teaching is far more expensive than the classroom-based equivalent and with falling capital spending; science infrastructure is an easy target for universities looking to save money.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; SMEs often face prohibitive costs to use test facilities for the purpose of trialling, experimenting and developing their innovative technology in real-life environments. The lack of funding spent on development in comparison to research further hinders progress in the engineering sectors ADS represents where the R&amp;D model they are operating under requires far greater funding for development than initial research.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 1.2% minimum spend on Science and Technology (S&amp;T) in the defence budget set by the Government in the National Security through Technology White Paper in February 2012 will halt the spiralling decrease in the defence S&amp;T budget over the past two decades. It is important that this figure is not treated as a target but is built upon to increase the spend on S&amp;T and ensure the UK is not left behind by other nations investing more in the development of future equipment. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4. Is there an efficient funding process for R&amp;D in the UK?]]]&#xa0;4.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite the advantages afforded to UK manufacturing in the past through the competitive research system under the Haldane Principle, the fragmented funding streams through which universities apply do not provide sufficient critical mass and are unaligned to the UK’s new Growth Partnerships. Due to such localised decision making, research is taking place at a sub-critical level across many universities, with many institutions’ research priorities overlapping.&#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0; Individual, localised research proposals from UK universities are often effective at attaining EU funding; however, further external investment into stovepiped research programmes reinforces the UK’s fragmented research capability. A failure to act with one voice through central research hubs leaves the UK unable to leverage and spend EU funding as effectively as possible. &#xa0;4.3&#xa0;&#xa0; As funding is spread too thinly, the UK risks duplicating funding on research and weakening research outcomes that could have been considerably strengthened through aggregated funding, from a large number of low-funded programmes to a select, well-funded development-focussed few. Duplicated research further serves to hamper exploitation and will miss opportunities to attract global investment.&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; NESTA (2012), Plan I: The case for innovation-led growth.
