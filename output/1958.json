"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by David Fogarty (CLC0062)The following is a submission to the UK Parliament\n’s Select Committee on “\nClimate: public understanding and its policy implications\n”. I am writing this in my personal capacity as \na \nspecialist science and e\nnvironment writer. I was the \nclimate change correspondent for Thomson Reuters \nin Asia \n(2008-13) and \nI’m \nnow a media consultant and writer fo\ncusing on environmental issues. I started writing about climate change in the late 1980s.\n The following \ncomments are for the public record.\nSummary\nQ: \nAre there particular difficulties when reporting\n complex science areas such as \nclimate science? \nA specialist climate science/climate change reporter \nshould have no more difficulty \ncovering their beat than other specialist correspondents. \nClima\nte science is complex but no more so than, f\nor instance, mergers and acquisitions, specialist criminal or business law \nor international trade. Reporters \nshould have a background that allows them to understand the technical details of the main issues\n of the\nir beat; \nbe able to quickly distinguish what is new and therefore news and what isn’t\n; \nhave credible contacts \nwho can \noffer insight on developments\n and offer contrasting opinions to help readers better understand any key developments.\n \nWhat makes climate stories interesting and publishable?\nQ: Has there been a loss of scientific and environmental expertise in newspapers and news agencies? What has been the impact of this for the coverage of c\nlimate science?\n&#xa0;\nQ: Has there be\nen a change in climate science \nand policy news coverage in the UK recent years? If so why do you thi\nnk this is?\n \n How effective is the press in the UK at distinguishing legitimate concerns about climate and energy policies and less accurate criticisms of the science?\nQ: Do you have\n a vi\new on the reasons James Painter\n found in his research that the UK and US press represent 80% of sceptical voices in the countries he included in his study?\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
