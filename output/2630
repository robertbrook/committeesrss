defaultI write in relation to your enquiry 
defaultinto
default On-line Safety.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is an issue that has always concerned me and I would like to strongly urge the committee to make a definitive stand 
defaultfor
default the need to implement 
defaultgreater 
defaulton-line safety 
defaultas a matter of urgency. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt
default is clear that this is a subject that government has been casual about in the past and as a result we now live in a society of young people whose minds are evidently polluted by the despicable material they are able to access on-line.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt 
defaultis distressing 
defaultthe number of
default times we read in the news
defaultpapers of young persons who have committed suicide after discovering something on
default-
defaultline they didn’t know about before, or when they have been bullied on social media.  Many times, violent activity is attributed to some
defaultthing a young person has been able to access on the internet.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is before they reach adulthood that a child’s mind is at its most fertile and very easily influenced, therefore perhaps giving us a clue as to why we live in
default a
default world where the next generation is becoming more and more extremist in its views due to the vast amount of literature they can access on-line.
default&#xa0;
defaultI believe this is a trend 
defaultthat we can change 
defaultif measures
default are implemented quickly to prevent a
defaultccess of adult mat
defaulterial by children under 16 years of age and I would encourage members of the Committee to be bold in their stand 
defaultand grasp
default this opportunity to make the world a better and safer place to live in
default.
