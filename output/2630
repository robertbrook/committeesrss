[normal]I write in relation to your enquiry 
[normal]into
[normal] On-line Safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is an issue that has always concerned me and I would like to strongly urge the committee to make a definitive stand 
[normal]for
[normal] the need to implement 
[normal]greater 
[normal]on-line safety 
[normal]as a matter of urgency. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It
[normal] is clear that this is a subject that government has been casual about in the past and as a result we now live in a society of young people whose minds are evidently polluted by the despicable material they are able to access on-line.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It 
[normal]is distressing 
[normal]the number of
[normal] times we read in the news
[normal]papers of young persons who have committed suicide after discovering something on
[normal]-
[normal]line they didn’t know about before, or when they have been bullied on social media.  Many times, violent activity is attributed to some
[normal]thing a young person has been able to access on the internet.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is before they reach adulthood that a child’s mind is at its most fertile and very easily influenced, therefore perhaps giving us a clue as to why we live in
[normal] a
[normal] world where the next generation is becoming more and more extremist in its views due to the vast amount of literature they can access on-line.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe this is a trend 
[normal]that we can change 
[normal]if measures
[normal] are implemented quickly to prevent a
[normal]ccess of adult mat
[normal]erial by children under 16 years of age and I would encourage members of the Committee to be bold in their stand 
[normal]and grasp
[normal] this opportunity to make the world a better and safer place to live in
[normal].
