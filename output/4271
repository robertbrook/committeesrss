[normal]This submission has 
[normal]four underlying themes

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Detailed responses to the questions posed by the Committee are provided below.
[normal]1.[bold]              [bold]Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Broadly speaking the Government’s current approach 
[normal]will
[normal] help to achieve the
[normal] UK’s 
[normal]targets
[normal] [bold]but is unlikely to do so at lowest possible cost. Additionally
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he effort needed to achieve this goal has been 
[normal]significantly
[normal] 
[normal]underestimated by many politicians. The 2
[normal]050 target 
[normal]will only 
[normal]be realised
[normal] if there is a
[normal]n expanded
[normal] coherent strategy which combines 
[normal]cross-party 
[normal]political will 
[normal]with 
[normal]a platform on which social change can be built.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The creation of the Energy Technologies 
[normal]Institute
[normal] (ETI)
[normal] has enabled 52 low carbon pro
[normal]jects to be commissioned but this is a relatively small contribution to the Government’s targets
[normal],
[normal] and a significant 
[normal]amount
[normal] of work must be 
[normal]done
[normal] to 
[normal]achieve the ultimate goal. Whil
[normal]e
[normal] the ETI has begun working on transport projects 
[normal]the engineering challenge of
[normal] decarbonising 
[normal]both 
[normal]transport
[normal] and heating 
[normal]must be 
[normal]in 
[normal]the vanguard of the next decade
[normal]’
[normal]s programmes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Low carbon innovation will be important to the future prosperity of the UK, not least through enabling low-carbon energy cost reduction,
[normal] 
[normal]and it is easier po
[normal]litically to make progress in technological areas than in the social changes that also will be required. 
[normal]Controlling the impact of climate change by decarbonising human activity on a global basis requires a revolution in the behaviour of populations and go
[normal]vernments. The Stern report wrote that climate change risks “major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half o
[normal]f the 20th century.”
[normal] We recognise that the UK 
[normal]social and
[normal] [bold]political landscape does not yet reflect the urgency or significance of decarbonisation and many actions that are needed
[normal] 
[normal]for example in providing sustained R&amp;D for the development and demonstration 
[normal]of new technologies at scale,
[normal] are not yet politically possible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Businesses and the research community cannot on their own deliver the level of change necessary without much stronger 
[normal]incentives
[normal] or 
[normal]the direct control of 
[normal]Government. 
[normal]The current Government ap
[normal]proach to UK low-carbon technologies essentially anticipates cost reduction to come from "on the job" learning stimulated through subsidised deployment of an existing range of technologies. Such an approach is 
[normal]unlikely
[normal] to result in 
[normal]substantial innovation l
[normal]eading to significant cost reductions,
[normal] [bold]or significant innovation of new technologies, but rather minor steps forward to enable deployments that meet the UK's short-term targets for renewables uptake. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s current approach appears to be 
[normal]largel
[normal]y predicated on the notion 
[normal]that technological development will allow a continuation of current lifestyles but with a greatly reduced carbon impact. 
[normal]We do not 
[normal]however
[normal] [bold]have sight of an 
[normal]affordable
[normal] ‘technical fix’ that will allow a continuation of the UK’s ene
[normal]rgy-
[normal]hungry 
[normal]culture 
[normal]and
[normal] a reduction in 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions by 80%
[normal] relative to 1990 levels by 2050
[normal]. The task is made more difficult 
[normal]by predicted UK population growth and changing demographics. In this regard the Office of National Statistics (ONS) projects that th
[normal]e UK population will increase from 63.7 million to 73.3 million over the 
[normal]next 
[normal]25 year
[normal]s
[normal], alongside a long-term trend of a reduction in average household size combined with an
[normal] increase in the number of households.
[normal] 
[normal]Additionally
[normal], the UK’s aging population wil
[normal]l place more demands on the 
[normal]energy network through healthcare and heating requirement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Against the background identified above, it is unlikely that the Government will manage to 
[normal]achieve the targets at
[normal] the lowest possible cost.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold].[bold]              [bold]Does the Government have[bold] the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]A balance between energy efficiency, renewable
[normal] energy
[normal] and other low carbon technologies has yet to be achieved.
[normal] The Government’s main drive 
[normal]has 
[normal]been 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]produce more energy 
[normal]to cope with demand 
[normal]by 
[normal]introduc
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]more 
[normal]low carbon 
[normal]and 
[normal]renewable 
[normal]technologies
[normal], whil
[normal]e
[normal] relatively little 
[normal]effort
[normal] has been 
[normal]made
[normal] 
[normal]in 
[normal]deal
[normal]ing
[normal] with 
[normal]the 
[normal]fundamental
[normal] issue of domestic and commercial energy 
[normal]efficiency
[normal].
[normal] Subsidies for loft a
[normal]nd cavity wall insulation are not 
[normal]sufficient in themselves
[normal] to ensure a reduction in energy 
[normal]usage
[normal]; more effort is needed to encourage households and businesses
[normal] to reduce their energy consumption
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The UK 2050 target for decarbonisation focuses on the C
[normal]O
[normal]2 
[normal]equivalent 
[normal]emissions from the UK while g
[normal]enuine decarbonisation 
[normal]must
[normal] consider the 
[normal]UK’s global 
[normal]carbon footprint. Measuring 
[normal]national 
[normal]CO
[normal]2
[normal] results in driv
[normal]ing
[normal] up energy cost for local manufacturing 
[normal]and the export
[normal]ing
[normal] of jobs and
[normal] [bold]emissions to countries that may
[normal] have more carbon intensive processes. Over time
[normal],
[normal] global agreements
[normal] may emerge and these anomalies removed. 
[normal]The innovation agenda and priorities should reflect the global nature of the task and not be constrained by local targets 
[normal]that are
[normal] [bold]at the expense of
[normal] areas that will genuinely reduce the country’s global CO
[normal]2
[normal] footprint. 
[normal]Managing low carbon innovation with the resources and speed required, presents an opportunity to help rebalance the global economy but the UK cannot do this alone.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]A successful 
[normal]outc
[normal]ome
[normal] [bold]will require substantial effort on six fronts of the carbon reduction strategy – energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear power, energy storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and a smart grid to pull these together. The progress made on a new nuclear 
[normal]station at Hinkley Point is very welcome. 
[normal]However, to ensure that retired nuclear capacity is renewed and a significant proportion of the fossil fuel stations are replaced by nuclear power, the UK will need many more similar stations. In order to deliver o
[normal]n the Government's aspirations for future UK transport and heat energy demand to be met through electricity, then this requirement is enhanced and CCS must be included along with the maximum possible contribution from renewables, enabled through energy sto
[normal]rage and smart grid technologies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Without 
[normal]generous 
[normal]subsidies 
[normal]or draconian regulations, 
[normal]it is difficult (if not impossible) to meet all three objectives
[normal] at the same time
[normal]. The costs of 
[normal]renewable energy, 
[normal]low
[normal]-carbon technologies or energy-efficiency
[normal] measu
[normal]res, are 
[normal]in many instances
[normal] so high that, unless energy becomes far more expensive, there are not sufficient 
[normal]commercial
[normal] [bold]incentives to invest
[normal] [bold]or innovate for cost-reduction.
[normal]3[bold].[bold]              [bold]What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcom[bold]ing strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Although the changes to 
[normal]LCICG 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]be positive, they are unlikely to make a significant difference to the inadequate and piecemeal funding of R&amp;D in low-c
[normal]arbon energy systems. 
[normal]At the time the 2008 
[normal]Climate Change 
[normal]Act was published, few recognised the enormity of the challenge it contained. The Royal Academy of Engineering subsequently studied these targets and, in a report published in March 2010,
[normal] wrote 
[normal]“Turning the theoretical emissions reduction targets into reality will require more than political will: it will require nothing short of the biggest peacetime programme of change ever seen in the UK.
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]The decarbonisation of Britain is a project 
[normal]close
[normal]r in scale to the 1940s production of armaments 
[normal]but this has not been recognised by Government
[normal] in funding terms or regulatory regimes
[normal]. It is most unlikely that it will be achieved by the combination of funding mechanisms 
[normal]already in operation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Signific
[normal]ant spend has been incurred in economics resea
[normal]rch. Government often
[normal] place
[normal]s 
[normal]contract
[normal]s with economics consultancies
[normal] on subjects such as an evaluation of revised rules for the renewables obligation.
[normal] Although this may give the impres
[normal]sion of action, there has 
[normal]been little relative 
[normal]progress towards innovation in the development of 
[normal]affordable
[normal] [bold]low carbon technology or achieving low carbon energy targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Although DECC may have improved the situation by re-launching the LCICG, 
[normal]which 
[normal]is
[normal] welcome
[normal], they still have 
[normal]to work through the 16 bodies listed in the consultation 
[normal]as well as various Catapult organisations, 
[normal]EPSRC, 
[normal]ESRC, NERC, AHRC, IEA and many other bodies which all have some input to funding for research into 
[normal]low carbon
[normal], public attitudes to the technologies a
[normal]nd the use made of them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]M
[normal]ost
[normal] renewable energy research and innovation 
[normal]currently
[normal] [bold]takes place in the university sector. There are 13
[normal]2
[normal] members of Universities UK at least half of 
[normal]which
[normal] undertake energy research, usually 
[normal]as part of a consortium
[normal]. EU webs
[normal]ite
[normal]s
[normal] on renewable energy resea
[normal]rch list
[normal] 
[normal]many
[normal] bodies involved in distribution of funding and there are 
[normal]dozens of
[normal] organisations involved in promoting and coordinating research.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]As a result of this 
[normal]complex 
[normal]structure, research funding mechanisms spread resources very thinly and carry a huge administration overhead. Typically a research grant is worth £3m over 3 years and involves half a dozen institutions, allowing each to employ a couple of researchers. 
[normal]By w
[normal]ay of an example it is worth comparing
[normal] R&amp;D funding for renewa
[normal]ble energy with funding for 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]Trident successor. Investment in facilities at AWE is currently running at £1bn p.a.
[normal] In 
[normal]March 2013 the MOD confirmed assessment phase spending on new submarines 
[normal]o
[normal]f
[normal] £2.8bn
[normal].
[normal] In contrast a
[normal] recent press release from DECC
[normal] reported that “f
[normal]our offshore wind projects will receive a share of £2.5m Government investment under the Offshore Wind Component Technologies Scheme
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]If the importance of decarbonising the UK 
[normal]economy is as great as desc
[normal]ribed by Lord Stern and 
[normal]the Royal Academy of Engineering, it is surprising that there has been so little direct Government investment
[normal] in research
[normal]. This situation is quite different to that in many of our competitor 
[normal]countries
[normal], suc
[normal]h as China, 
[normal]who run large-scale national research facilities and appear to make progress that we seem unable to achieve.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he private sector
[normal] is unlikely to put significant resources into major 
[normal]R&amp;D activity
[normal], such as CCS
[normal], nuclear
[normal] or renewable energy, unl
[normal]ess there is a clear economic case
[normal] for their adoption
[normal] and e
[normal]vidence of long-term policy continuity. 
[normal]At pr
[normal]esent, for renewables, the only economic case for private sector investment is based on the continuation of the 
[normal]current
[normal] subsidy regime. Recent change
[normal]s i
[normal]n road fuel escalator duties,
[normal] reductions in PV feed-in tariffs,
[normal] active debate over cutting green taxes,
[normal] and proposals to freeze energy prices
[normal] do not instil confidence in a continuity of policy that could justify 
[normal]sustained 
[normal]R&amp;D investment with long 
[normal]payback times.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold].[bold]              [bold]Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]At present the Government and LCICG are not targeting the 
[normal]right stages 
[normal]of the innovation proc
[normal]ess. 
[normal]The escalation of costs as a project moves from TRL1 to TRL9 is particularly marked in 
[normal]low carbon
[normal] technologies. These are attempting to harvest energy from very diffuse sources and thus are inevitably physically large. By their nature, they operate in
[normal] aggressive environments – the windiest and most remote hillside, the fastest ocean currents, 
[normal]and the
[normal] most exposed coastlines – and so development 
[normal]and demonstration
[normal] [bold]at full scale becomes difficult and expensive. 
[normal]In the case of nuclear, prototype systems re
[normal]quire specialist facilities with exacting regulations. 
[normal]Many developments flounder at this 
[normal]full-scale demonstration phase, 
[normal]between lab-based research and full-scale commercial deployment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]The costs 
[normal]encountered between TRL3 and TRL7 
[normal]are particularly dif
[normal]ficult for SMEs. Even if research is grant-funded, no company wants to invest the time and effort of its employees in developments that do not result in long-term profitable manufacture. The complex structure of 
[normal]the privatised energy industry and its multi
[normal]-party supply chain can bring 
[normal]helpful market behaviours and independence of actions, but
[normal] it
[normal] also 
[normal]creates barriers to innovation and, coupled with a complex and 
[normal]changing
[normal] regulatory and subsidy framework, makes it 
[normal]difficult
[normal] for smaller companies to undertake
[normal] 
[normal]development in this area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is important that 
[normal]Government &amp; LCI
[normal]CG target investment towards th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]so-called 
[normal]“valley of death” and support demonstration of new technologies at scale. For many technologies, this is where investment of a few tens of milli
[normal]ons of pounds is 
[normal]most often
[normal] [bold]needed. By that stage the development 
[normal]typically
[normal] [bold]involves a committed research establishment, developer and manufacturing partner so competition is not appropriate. Not all funding need come from government but an underwriting scheme that leverages private investment could bring forward deployment of, fo
[normal]r example, marine turbines
[normal] and energy storage
[normal] 
[normal]technologies 
[normal]by years and show 
[normal]whether they are commercially
[normal] [bold]viable or not
[normal]. A public-private long-term funding model may be less costly in the long-term than serial rounds of 
[normal]piecemeal 
[normal]public funding. The latte
[normal]r are often subject
[normal] to political short-termism and
[normal] are potentially used inefficiently due to the distraction of bidding for the next tranche of funds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]A further problem with the current approach is the political assumption that energy prices can be he
[normal]ld at roughly current levels
[normal],
[normal] and the private sector can be persuaded
[normal] to
[normal] invest heavily in new low-carbon generation. Recent announcements of a 
[normal]long-term
[normal] [bold]“strike price” 
[normal]for Hinkley Point C of roughly twice the current wholesale price for electricity
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]o
[normal]nly slightly lower than
[normal] the target price for offshore wind generation
[normal] set
[normal] in a May 
[normal]2012 report by the Crown Estate
[normal] are indicative of decarbonised energy costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]Realistically, wholesale energy prices 
[normal]would
[normal] [bold]have to rise by a factor of at least two and 
[normal]possibly three for private sector investment in renewables, CCS, nuclear power and energy storage to become attractive propositions without subsidy. On the assumption that it is unrealistic to expect low-carbon generation to be heavily subsidised from gene
[normal]ral taxation far into the future, there are important 
[normal]welfare
[normal] [bold]questions around the
[normal] combination of increases to the minimum wage, personal tax allowances, social security payments, etc. 
[normal]that 
[normal]would allow energy prices to double or treble in real terms, witho
[normal]ut increasing the number of people in poverty or fomenting social unrest.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold].[bold]              [bold]What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Energy systems are, by their nature, long-term investments. A nuclear power station 
[normal]takes 10 years t
[normal]o plan and build, operates for 6
[normal]0 years and then takes several decades to decommission. The North Sea oil industry, the national gas grid and the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure were developed over decades. For the 
[normal]private sector to invest in developments and innovations
[normal] [bold]that, even if completely successful are unlikely to make more than modest returns on investment, 
[normal]confidence in long-term market conditions and policy arrangements is required
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]At present, it is
[normal] far from clear whether there is a coherent national strategy that will last 
[normal]three
[normal] years, let alone the 30 years necessary to ensure adequate returns on R&amp;D investment. 
[normal]As an example, 
[normal]some parties have
[normal] argued for the closure of the domestic gas grid and tr
[normal]ansfer of domesti
[normal]c heating loads to electricity whilst 
[normal]other 
[normal]parties 
[normal]are arguing for an expansion of “fracking” which would enshrine gas as the fuel of choice for domestic heating for many years to come.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]An
[normal] [bold]uncertain policy and market environment acts
[normal] to discourage
[normal] private sector investment. Government funding could play a role in underwriting such R&amp;D but present short-term timelines do not provide this incentive.
[normal]6[bold].[bold]              [bold]How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon [bold]innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The re-launch of the LCICG will go some way to refreshing the energy efficiency and low carbon technologies schemes, however care must be taken to ensure that apathy from society and indu
[normal]stry does not once more set in. 
[normal]As noted 
[normal]in question 1,
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]current Government approach to UK low-carbon technologies essentially anticipates cost reduction to come from "learning by doing" stimulated through subsidised deployment of an existing range of t
[normal]echnologies. Such an approach is 
[normal]unlikely
[normal] to result in any substantial innovating of the cost-out of these technologies, or significant innovation of new technologies, but rather minor steps forward to enable deployments that meet the UK's short-term targe
[normal]ts for renewables uptake.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]Given Government's long-term aspirations to stimulate an affordable, secure low-carbon supply of energy, with electricity as the energy carrier – there will have to be great improvements in cost-effective building efficiency and in energy storage, amongst 
[normal]other innovations. It is important that Government energy R&amp;D policy takes 
[normal]each of
[normal] [bold]these forward in parallel. I
[normal]f one area lags behind
[normal],
[normal] the overall system will be far from optimum
[normal]. The Government should
[normal] 
[normal]focus strongly on finding innovative ways to fund the 
[normal]capital costs associated with the development of demonstration plant at full scale. DECC should work closely with BIS and the Treasury to develop such innovative Government financing arrangements, which are the key to unlocking the technical innovation tha
[normal]t will lead to cost reduction for commercial deployment of low-carbon technologies.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]Simplification of and accessibility to the schemes for domestic users, with focus on energy efficiency in the home, should 
[normal]also 
[normal]be key. Attention should be given to th
[normal]e Green Deal, ensuring that a 
[normal]substantially increased number of households
[normal] [bold]can get easy access to funds to pay for energy efficient modifications to their homes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]Business would also benefit from the Green Deal but DECC should concentrate on assisting 
[normal]businesses to find ways to not just reduce their energy consumption but also store energy and even generate their own power using a combination of low carbon technology and energy recycling.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7[bold].[bold]              [bold]How is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from [bold]and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]The UK Government is partnering with several EU countries on Low Carbon initiatives, but it has been recognised by the International Energy Agency
[normal] that the UK is not participating in g
[normal]lobal initiatives at the same level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]The G
[normal]overnment could for example work with the World Bank on the Low-Carbon 
[normal]Liveable
[normal] Cities (LC2) Initiative, its goal to reach
[normal] 
[normal]300 of the world’s largest developing country cities with planning and financing suppo
[normal]rt over the next four years. However there are initiatives closer to home which the government could partner
[normal] with
[normal] that already have a global dimension. UK Universities have for many years been partnering with other 
[normal]i
[normal]nternational 
[normal]u
[normal]niversities to work on low
[normal] carbon innovation. Sussex University
[normal] h
[normal]as been working with the African Technology Policy Studies Network to look at the adopting of low carbon technology in Kenya
[normal]. 
[normal]Additionally, 
[normal]four UK universities have partnered with three Chinese universities to inves
[normal]tigate low carbon buildings and eco-cities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]The UK government should take greater interest in these 
[normal]types
[normal] of initiatives and 
[normal]utilise
[normal] their findings to help develop policy.
