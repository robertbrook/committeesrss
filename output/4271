defaultThis submission has

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDetailed responses to the questions posed by the Committee are provided below.
default1.default              defaultWill the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?default&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBroadly speaking the Government’s current approach 
defaultwill
default help to achieve the
default UK’s 
defaulttargets
default defaultbut is unlikely to do so at lowest possible cost. Additionally
default,
default 
defaultt
defaulthe effort needed to achieve this goal has been 
defaultsignificantly
default 
defaultunderestimated by many politicians. The 2
default050 target 
defaultwill only 
defaultbe realised
default if there is a
defaultn expanded
default coherent strategy which combines 
defaultcross-party 
defaultpolitical will 
defaultwith 
defaulta platform on which social change can be built.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe creation of the Energy Technologies 
defaultInstitute
default (ETI)
default has enabled 52 low carbon pro
defaultjects to be commissioned but this is a relatively small contribution to the Government’s targets
default,
default and a significant 
defaultamount
default of work must be 
defaultdone
default to 
defaultachieve the ultimate goal. Whil
defaulte
default the ETI has begun working on transport projects 
defaultthe engineering challenge of
default decarbonising 
defaultboth 
defaulttransport
default and heating 
defaultmust be 
defaultin 
defaultthe vanguard of the next decade
default’
defaults programmes.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLow carbon innovation will be important to the future prosperity of the UK, not least through enabling low-carbon energy cost reduction,
default 
defaultand it is easier po
defaultlitically to make progress in technological areas than in the social changes that also will be required. 
defaultControlling the impact of climate change by decarbonising human activity on a global basis requires a revolution in the behaviour of populations and go
defaultvernments. The Stern report wrote that climate change risks “major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half o
defaultf the 20th century.”
default We recognise that the UK 
defaultsocial and
default defaultpolitical landscape does not yet reflect the urgency or significance of decarbonisation and many actions that are needed
default 
defaultfor example in providing sustained R&amp;D for the development and demonstration 
defaultof new technologies at scale,
default are not yet politically possible.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBusinesses and the research community cannot on their own deliver the level of change necessary without much stronger 
defaultincentives
default or 
defaultthe direct control of 
defaultGovernment. 
defaultThe current Government ap
defaultproach to UK low-carbon technologies essentially anticipates cost reduction to come from "on the job" learning stimulated through subsidised deployment of an existing range of technologies. Such an approach is 
defaultunlikely
default to result in 
defaultsubstantial innovation l
defaulteading to significant cost reductions,
default defaultor significant innovation of new technologies, but rather minor steps forward to enable deployments that meet the UK's short-term targets for renewables uptake. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s current approach appears to be 
defaultlargel
defaulty predicated on the notion 
defaultthat technological development will allow a continuation of current lifestyles but with a greatly reduced carbon impact. 
defaultWe do not 
defaulthowever
default defaulthave sight of an 
defaultaffordable
default ‘technical fix’ that will allow a continuation of the UK’s ene
defaultrgy-
defaulthungry 
defaultculture 
defaultand
default a reduction in 
defaultCO
default2
default emissions by 80%
default relative to 1990 levels by 2050
default. The task is made more difficult 
defaultby predicted UK population growth and changing demographics. In this regard the Office of National Statistics (ONS) projects that th
defaulte UK population will increase from 63.7 million to 73.3 million over the 
defaultnext 
default25 year
defaults
default, alongside a long-term trend of a reduction in average household size combined with an
default increase in the number of households.
default 
defaultAdditionally
default, the UK’s aging population wil
defaultl place more demands on the 
defaultenergy network through healthcare and heating requirement.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAgainst the background identified above, it is unlikely that the Government will manage to 
defaultachieve the targets at
default the lowest possible cost.
default&#xa0;
default2default.default              defaultDoes the Government havedefault the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultA balance between energy efficiency, renewable
default energy
default and other low carbon technologies has yet to be achieved.
default The Government’s main drive 
defaulthas 
defaultbeen 
defaultto
default 
defaultproduce more energy 
defaultto cope with demand 
defaultby 
defaultintroduc
defaulting
default 
defaultmore 
defaultlow carbon 
defaultand 
defaultrenewable 
defaulttechnologies
default, whil
defaulte
default relatively little 
defaulteffort
default has been 
defaultmade
default 
defaultin 
defaultdeal
defaulting
default with 
defaultthe 
defaultfundamental
default issue of domestic and commercial energy 
defaultefficiency
default.
default Subsidies for loft a
defaultnd cavity wall insulation are not 
defaultsufficient in themselves
default to ensure a reduction in energy 
defaultusage
default; more effort is needed to encourage households and businesses
default to reduce their energy consumption
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe UK 2050 target for decarbonisation focuses on the C
defaultO
default2 
defaultequivalent 
defaultemissions from the UK while g
defaultenuine decarbonisation 
defaultmust
default consider the 
defaultUK’s global 
defaultcarbon footprint. Measuring 
defaultnational 
defaultCO
default2
default results in driv
defaulting
default up energy cost for local manufacturing 
defaultand the export
defaulting
default of jobs and
default defaultemissions to countries that may
default have more carbon intensive processes. Over time
default,
default global agreements
default may emerge and these anomalies removed. 
defaultThe innovation agenda and priorities should reflect the global nature of the task and not be constrained by local targets 
defaultthat are
default defaultat the expense of
default areas that will genuinely reduce the country’s global CO
default2
default footprint. 
defaultManaging low carbon innovation with the resources and speed required, presents an opportunity to help rebalance the global economy but the UK cannot do this alone.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultA successful 
defaultoutc
defaultome
default defaultwill require substantial effort on six fronts of the carbon reduction strategy – energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear power, energy storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and a smart grid to pull these together. The progress made on a new nuclear 
defaultstation at Hinkley Point is very welcome. 
defaultHowever, to ensure that retired nuclear capacity is renewed and a significant proportion of the fossil fuel stations are replaced by nuclear power, the UK will need many more similar stations. In order to deliver o
defaultn the Government's aspirations for future UK transport and heat energy demand to be met through electricity, then this requirement is enhanced and CCS must be included along with the maximum possible contribution from renewables, enabled through energy sto
defaultrage and smart grid technologies.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultWithout 
defaultgenerous 
defaultsubsidies 
defaultor draconian regulations, 
defaultit is difficult (if not impossible) to meet all three objectives
default at the same time
default. The costs of 
defaultrenewable energy, 
defaultlow
default-carbon technologies or energy-efficiency
default measu
defaultres, are 
defaultin many instances
default so high that, unless energy becomes far more expensive, there are not sufficient 
defaultcommercial
default defaultincentives to invest
default defaultor innovate for cost-reduction.
default3default.default              defaultWhat outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcomdefaulting strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?default&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultAlthough the changes to 
defaultLCICG 
defaultmay
default 
defaultbe positive, they are unlikely to make a significant difference to the inadequate and piecemeal funding of R&amp;D in low-c
defaultarbon energy systems. 
defaultAt the time the 2008 
defaultClimate Change 
defaultAct was published, few recognised the enormity of the challenge it contained. The Royal Academy of Engineering subsequently studied these targets and, in a report published in March 2010,
default wrote 
default“Turning the theoretical emissions reduction targets into reality will require more than political will: it will require nothing short of the biggest peacetime programme of change ever seen in the UK.
default”
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe decarbonisation of Britain is a project 
defaultclose
defaultr in scale to the 1940s production of armaments 
defaultbut this has not been recognised by Government
default in funding terms or regulatory regimes
default. It is most unlikely that it will be achieved by the combination of funding mechanisms 
defaultalready in operation
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultSignific
defaultant spend has been incurred in economics resea
defaultrch. Government often
default place
defaults 
defaultcontract
defaults with economics consultancies
default on subjects such as an evaluation of revised rules for the renewables obligation.
default Although this may give the impres
defaultsion of action, there has 
defaultbeen little relative 
defaultprogress towards innovation in the development of 
defaultaffordable
default defaultlow carbon technology or achieving low carbon energy targets.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultAlthough DECC may have improved the situation by re-launching the LCICG, 
defaultwhich 
defaultis
default welcome
default, they still have 
defaultto work through the 16 bodies listed in the consultation 
defaultas well as various Catapult organisations, 
defaultEPSRC, 
defaultESRC, NERC, AHRC, IEA and many other bodies which all have some input to funding for research into 
defaultlow carbon
default, public attitudes to the technologies a
defaultnd the use made of them. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultM
defaultost
default renewable energy research and innovation 
defaultcurrently
default defaulttakes place in the university sector. There are 13
default2
default members of Universities UK at least half of 
defaultwhich
default undertake energy research, usually 
defaultas part of a consortium
default. EU webs
defaultite
defaults
default on renewable energy resea
defaultrch list
default 
defaultmany
default bodies involved in distribution of funding and there are 
defaultdozens of
default organisations involved in promoting and coordinating research.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultAs a result of this 
defaultcomplex 
defaultstructure, research funding mechanisms spread resources very thinly and carry a huge administration overhead. Typically a research grant is worth £3m over 3 years and involves half a dozen institutions, allowing each to employ a couple of researchers. 
defaultBy w
defaultay of an example it is worth comparing
default R&amp;D funding for renewa
defaultble energy with funding for 
defaultthe
default 
defaultTrident successor. Investment in facilities at AWE is currently running at £1bn p.a.
default In 
defaultMarch 2013 the MOD confirmed assessment phase spending on new submarines 
defaulto
defaultf
default £2.8bn
default.
default In contrast a
default recent press release from DECC
default reported that “f
defaultour offshore wind projects will receive a share of £2.5m Government investment under the Offshore Wind Component Technologies Scheme
default”
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultIf the importance of decarbonising the UK 
defaulteconomy is as great as desc
defaultribed by Lord Stern and 
defaultthe Royal Academy of Engineering, it is surprising that there has been so little direct Government investment
default in research
default. This situation is quite different to that in many of our competitor 
defaultcountries
default, suc
defaulth as China, 
defaultwho run large-scale national research facilities and appear to make progress that we seem unable to achieve.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultT
defaulthe private sector
default is unlikely to put significant resources into major 
defaultR&amp;D activity
default, such as CCS
default, nuclear
default or renewable energy, unl
defaultess there is a clear economic case
default for their adoption
default and e
defaultvidence of long-term policy continuity. 
defaultAt pr
defaultesent, for renewables, the only economic case for private sector investment is based on the continuation of the 
defaultcurrent
default subsidy regime. Recent change
defaults i
defaultn road fuel escalator duties,
default reductions in PV feed-in tariffs,
default active debate over cutting green taxes,
default and proposals to freeze energy prices
default do not instil confidence in a continuity of policy that could justify 
defaultsustained 
defaultR&amp;D investment with long 
defaultpayback times.
default&#xa0;
default4default.default              defaultAre the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, including over the long-term?default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultAt present the Government and LCICG are not targeting the 
defaultright stages 
defaultof the innovation proc
defaultess. 
defaultThe escalation of costs as a project moves from TRL1 to TRL9 is particularly marked in 
defaultlow carbon
default technologies. These are attempting to harvest energy from very diffuse sources and thus are inevitably physically large. By their nature, they operate in
default aggressive environments – the windiest and most remote hillside, the fastest ocean currents, 
defaultand the
default most exposed coastlines – and so development 
defaultand demonstration
default defaultat full scale becomes difficult and expensive. 
defaultIn the case of nuclear, prototype systems re
defaultquire specialist facilities with exacting regulations. 
defaultMany developments flounder at this 
defaultfull-scale demonstration phase, 
defaultbetween lab-based research and full-scale commercial deployment.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThe costs 
defaultencountered between TRL3 and TRL7 
defaultare particularly dif
defaultficult for SMEs. Even if research is grant-funded, no company wants to invest the time and effort of its employees in developments that do not result in long-term profitable manufacture. The complex structure of 
defaultthe privatised energy industry and its multi
default-party supply chain can bring 
defaulthelpful market behaviours and independence of actions, but
default it
default also 
defaultcreates barriers to innovation and, coupled with a complex and 
defaultchanging
default regulatory and subsidy framework, makes it 
defaultdifficult
default for smaller companies to undertake
default 
defaultdevelopment in this area.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultIt is important that 
defaultGovernment &amp; LCI
defaultCG target investment towards th
defaulte
default 
defaultso-called 
default“valley of death” and support demonstration of new technologies at scale. For many technologies, this is where investment of a few tens of milli
defaultons of pounds is 
defaultmost often
default defaultneeded. By that stage the development 
defaulttypically
default defaultinvolves a committed research establishment, developer and manufacturing partner so competition is not appropriate. Not all funding need come from government but an underwriting scheme that leverages private investment could bring forward deployment of, fo
defaultr example, marine turbines
default and energy storage
default 
defaulttechnologies 
defaultby years and show 
defaultwhether they are commercially
default defaultviable or not
default. A public-private long-term funding model may be less costly in the long-term than serial rounds of 
defaultpiecemeal 
defaultpublic funding. The latte
defaultr are often subject
default to political short-termism and
default are potentially used inefficiently due to the distraction of bidding for the next tranche of funds.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultA further problem with the current approach is the political assumption that energy prices can be he
defaultld at roughly current levels
default,
default and the private sector can be persuaded
default to
default invest heavily in new low-carbon generation. Recent announcements of a 
defaultlong-term
default default“strike price” 
defaultfor Hinkley Point C of roughly twice the current wholesale price for electricity
default,
default and 
defaulto
defaultnly slightly lower than
default the target price for offshore wind generation
default set
default in a May 
default2012 report by the Crown Estate
default are indicative of decarbonised energy costs.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultRealistically, wholesale energy prices 
defaultwould
default defaulthave to rise by a factor of at least two and 
defaultpossibly three for private sector investment in renewables, CCS, nuclear power and energy storage to become attractive propositions without subsidy. On the assumption that it is unrealistic to expect low-carbon generation to be heavily subsidised from gene
defaultral taxation far into the future, there are important 
defaultwelfare
default defaultquestions around the
default combination of increases to the minimum wage, personal tax allowances, social security payments, etc. 
defaultthat 
defaultwould allow energy prices to double or treble in real terms, witho
defaultut increasing the number of people in poverty or fomenting social unrest.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5default.default              defaultWhat is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultEnergy systems are, by their nature, long-term investments. A nuclear power station 
defaulttakes 10 years t
defaulto plan and build, operates for 6
default0 years and then takes several decades to decommission. The North Sea oil industry, the national gas grid and the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure were developed over decades. For the 
defaultprivate sector to invest in developments and innovations
default defaultthat, even if completely successful are unlikely to make more than modest returns on investment, 
defaultconfidence in long-term market conditions and policy arrangements is required
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultAt present, it is
default far from clear whether there is a coherent national strategy that will last 
defaultthree
default years, let alone the 30 years necessary to ensure adequate returns on R&amp;D investment. 
defaultAs an example, 
defaultsome parties have
default argued for the closure of the domestic gas grid and tr
defaultansfer of domesti
defaultc heating loads to electricity whilst 
defaultother 
defaultparties 
defaultare arguing for an expansion of “fracking” which would enshrine gas as the fuel of choice for domestic heating for many years to come.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultAn
default defaultuncertain policy and market environment acts
default to discourage
default private sector investment. Government funding could play a role in underwriting such R&amp;D but present short-term timelines do not provide this incentive.
default6default.default              defaultHow should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon defaultinnovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?default&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultThe re-launch of the LCICG will go some way to refreshing the energy efficiency and low carbon technologies schemes, however care must be taken to ensure that apathy from society and indu
defaultstry does not once more set in. 
defaultAs noted 
defaultin question 1,
default 
defaultthe 
defaultcurrent Government approach to UK low-carbon technologies essentially anticipates cost reduction to come from "learning by doing" stimulated through subsidised deployment of an existing range of t
defaultechnologies. Such an approach is 
defaultunlikely
default to result in any substantial innovating of the cost-out of these technologies, or significant innovation of new technologies, but rather minor steps forward to enable deployments that meet the UK's short-term targe
defaultts for renewables uptake.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultGiven Government's long-term aspirations to stimulate an affordable, secure low-carbon supply of energy, with electricity as the energy carrier – there will have to be great improvements in cost-effective building efficiency and in energy storage, amongst 
defaultother innovations. It is important that Government energy R&amp;D policy takes 
defaulteach of
default defaultthese forward in parallel. I
defaultf one area lags behind
default,
default the overall system will be far from optimum
default. The Government should
default 
defaultfocus strongly on finding innovative ways to fund the 
defaultcapital costs associated with the development of demonstration plant at full scale. DECC should work closely with BIS and the Treasury to develop such innovative Government financing arrangements, which are the key to unlocking the technical innovation tha
defaultt will lead to cost reduction for commercial deployment of low-carbon technologies.
default&#xa0;default6.3
default              
defaultSimplification of and accessibility to the schemes for domestic users, with focus on energy efficiency in the home, should 
defaultalso 
defaultbe key. Attention should be given to th
defaulte Green Deal, ensuring that a 
defaultsubstantially increased number of households
default defaultcan get easy access to funds to pay for energy efficient modifications to their homes.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultBusiness would also benefit from the Green Deal but DECC should concentrate on assisting 
defaultbusinesses to find ways to not just reduce their energy consumption but also store energy and even generate their own power using a combination of low carbon technology and energy recycling.
default&#xa0;
default7default.default              defaultHow is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from defaultand partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultThe UK Government is partnering with several EU countries on Low Carbon initiatives, but it has been recognised by the International Energy Agency
default that the UK is not participating in g
defaultlobal initiatives at the same level.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultThe G
defaultovernment could for example work with the World Bank on the Low-Carbon 
defaultLiveable
default Cities (LC2) Initiative, its goal to reach
default 
default300 of the world’s largest developing country cities with planning and financing suppo
defaultrt over the next four years. However there are initiatives closer to home which the government could partner
default with
default that already have a global dimension. UK Universities have for many years been partnering with other 
defaulti
defaultnternational 
defaultu
defaultniversities to work on low
default carbon innovation. Sussex University
default h
defaultas been working with the African Technology Policy Studies Network to look at the adopting of low carbon technology in Kenya
default. 
defaultAdditionally, 
defaultfour UK universities have partnered with three Chinese universities to inves
defaulttigate low carbon buildings and eco-cities
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultThe UK government should take greater interest in these 
defaulttypes
default of initiatives and 
defaultutilise
default their findings to help develop policy.
