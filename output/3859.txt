[[[Summary ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mind responded to the government’s consultation “Judicial Review: Proposals for further reform.” Mind considers judicial review to be a key tool for ensuring that the rights of people with experience of mental health problems are protected, promoted and upheld. The ability to hold the executive to account is a fundamental tenet of a democratic society and Mind’s view is that the government’s proposals will severely dilute the constitutional rights of citizens and undermine the role of the judiciary in holding public bodies accountable. Mind is deeply concerned about the impact of the proposals on people who experience mental health problems and we have outlined our concerns below.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Standing]]]

[[[:]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[The proposed introduction of a narrower test for “standing” to apply for judicial review, so as to limit the range of people and groups who are entitled to invoke the procedure]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;2.1              The courts have recognised the value of claims being brought by those without a direct interest in the proceedings:&#xa0;“Public law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs - that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts have always been alive to the fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issue or the outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for leave, the court's only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive.”&#xa0;2.2              Additionally, the government itself acknowledged in the consultation that cases brought by NGOs, charities and pressure groups tend to be valid claims:&#xa0;“From Administrative Court records for cases lodged between 2007 and 2011 around 50 judicial reviews per year have been identified that appear to have been lodged by NGOs, charities, pressure groups and faith organisations, i.e. by claimants who may not have had a direct interest in the matter at hand. The identified cases tended to be relatively successful compared to other JR cases.” &#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Organisations that bring cases as representatives of a group of individuals are best placed to provide the court with an expert view. This means that the court can focus on the underlying issue rather than on the specific facts of an individual case. The risk posed by the proposal to change the rules on standing is that the courts will face a series of claims from various individuals when one would do. This would be neither cost effective nor efficient. The proposals to limit those with standing will impact on a minority of cases which are generally highly meritorious by virtue of their wider public interest.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In Mind’s view, a test for standing that is any narrower than having to demonstrate “sufficient interest” risks interfering with the right to a remedy under Article 6 ECHR.

[[[Third Party Interventions]]]

[[[: The proposed modification of the rules to discour]]]

[[[age the involvement of interveners and third parties]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1              Third parties make applications to intervene in a minority of cases in order to assist the court in understanding the wider implications of a case on often large numbers of people. &#xa0;3.2              Mind has intervened in a number of cases, the majority of which have involved breaches of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms under human rights and equality legislation. Some examples are given below:&#xa0;Savage v South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Rabone and another v Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust established a positive duty on hospitals to ensure that they take reasonable steps to prevent mental health patients from taking their own lives. It was a challenge relating to the application of Article 2 ECHR.&#xa0;MM and DM v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions involves a challenge to the Employment Support Allowance (“ESA”) determination process based on the fact that it places people with mental health problems at a substantial disadvantage. &#xa0;Das v Secretary of State for the Home Department concerned the threshold for determining whether people with mental health problems should be detained in immigration removal centres. This case was brought against the backdrop of four previous cases in which the court found breaches of Article 3. &#xa0;P v Cheshire West and Chester Council &amp; P and Q v Surrey County Council concerned the proper approach to the question of when a person is deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5 ECHR. &#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The above case examples concern matters of fundamental importance to Mind’s beneficiaries and it is imperative, in Mind’s view, that the rules on interveners remain as they are in order for the court to decide whether it would benefit from the expert evidence that third parties are in a unique position to provide. &#xa0;

[[[Costs]]]

[[[: The proposed rebalancing of financial incentives so that providers are only paid for work carried out on judicial review cases where permission is granted, or exceptionally]]]

[[[ in the Legal Aid Agency’s discretion]]]

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;4.1              Aside from the fact that the government appears to be suggesting that public lawyers pursue cases for reasons other than that their client has a valid claim and that the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) grants funding for unmeritorious cases, Mind has a number of concerns relating to this proposal.   &#xa0;4.2              There is a risk that the courts will become clogged with applications for costs determinations. This can be a lengthy process and will require providers to subsidise the costs of litigation which is not viable for many firms, particularly those which undertake predominantly legal aid work. &#xa0;4.3              Another undesirable result of the proposal is that specialist public law firms, with many years experience of judicial review, may cease taking on judicial review cases because it is not financially viable for them to do so. The risk is that non-specialist lawyers will attempt to turn their hand to judicial review which will increase the likelihood of unmeritorious/vexatious and poorly prepared claims being brought. &#xa0;4.4              Vulnerable clients, for example those with mental health problems, sometimes change their mind about pursuing a claim part way through the process – i.e. between issuing the proceedings and permission being granted. They may choose to discontinue a claim because they find the process too stressful, or because they have a lack of trust in the process as a result of a previous bad experience. Therefore, providers may be less willing to act for vulnerable clients due to the risk of not getting paid.&#xa0;4.5              The introduction of discretion for the LAA to pay providers in cases where proceedings are issued, but the case concludes prior to a permission decision, is likely to lead to a significant number of claims being brought against the LAA. Where its application of the criteria leads to non-payment, providers will have no choice but to mount such challenges. Ironically, this would increase the number of judicial review applications made.   &#xa0;4.6              People with mental health problems are more likely to access health and community care services. Where the provision of such services is refused or reduced, the appropriate remedy is judicial review where all other avenues have been exhausted. If these proposals go ahead, such individuals will effectively have no remedy beyond pursuing a complaint, as they will struggle to find a lawyer able and/or willing to take their case on. Mind considers that the proposals to further curb access to legal aid risks breaching individuals’ rights under Article 6 ECHR.

[[[The Public Sector Equality Duty]]]

[[[: The proposal to make non-]]]

[[[justiciable]]]

[[[ the statutory duty ]]]

[[[imposed on public bodies by the Equality Act, to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, by providing an alternative, non-judicial mechanism for resolving disputes about whether public bodies have complied with the duty]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]           The Public Sector Equality Duty provides an important safeguard for our                     beneficiaries’ rights, if public authorities comply with it when providing            education, health and social care, planning and policing. If a public authority            fails to follow its obligations, judicial review may sometimes be the            only means by which an individual can challenge this failure. Raising a              complaint is usually a lengthy process and does not prompt urgent action.              This remedy is important for people who have mental           health problems as they are likely to be more dependent upon public            authorities. A pre-action protocol letter may be enough to secure change           swiftly and so the number of cases where s 149 Equality Act is actually                         litigated will be small. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The combined effect of these proposals with the government’s proposals to reform legal aid, in particular th]]]

[[[e introduction of a residence test  ]]]&#xa0;6.1              Under the residence test, a person detained in a psychiatric hospital would be entitled to advice as those subject to detention under the Mental Health Act are not excluded from the 12 month rule. However, once discharged into the community, such an individual would not be entitled to legal aid to enforce their rights to social care support and housing if they could not satisfy the 12 month residence test. A lack of adequate aftercare services and/or accommodation places people at serious risk of relapse and readmission to hospital. From enquiries to our Legal Advice Line, and from our work with advocates and service providers in local Minds, we know that some psychiatric patients, whether they have been detained or were admitted as voluntary inpatients, are discharged from hospital without any, or any adequate, aftercare services including social care support and housing. These people require legal assistance to enforce their rights. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Similarly, the 12 month residence test will also not apply to those in immigration detention. However, Home Office guidance stipulates that people with a serious mental illness which cannot be satisfactorily managed in detention are normally considered suitable for detention in only very exceptional circumstances. The 12 month residence test creates an anomaly as those who are detained will be entitled to legal aid, but those who are living in the community, often with serious mental health problems and therefore significant support needs, will not.&#xa0;6.3              In a climate of increasing cuts to public services, of which people with mental health problems are often beneficiaries, the government is attempting to severely restrict the ability of individuals to challenge the decisions, acts and omissions of public bodies. Combined with the further reforms to legal aid, in Mind’s opinion, the government’s plans would be catastrophic for people with mental health problems.&#xa0;27 November 20135&#xa0; Sedley J in R v Somerset County Council, ex p Dixon [1998] Env LR 111 Paragraph 78 [2007] EWCA Civ 1375 [2012] UKSC 2 2013 UKUT 260 AAC [2013] EWHC 682 (Admin) R (S) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2120 (Admin), R (BA) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 979 (Admin), HA (Nigeria), and R (D) v SSHD [2012] EWHC 2501 (Admin UKSC/2012/ 0068 UKSC/2012/0088P Chapter 55.10 Enforcement Instructions and Guidance, Home Office, August 2010.
