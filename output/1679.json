"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr Robin Curtis (HOT48)&#xa0;\nMost of my comments are related to the use of heat in buildings.\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;\nIs the government taking the right approach to reduce heat ene\nrgy demand?\n&#xa0;\nQualitatively - yes. Quantitatively - probably not. In terms of heat loss from buildings the rumoured relaxation of Part L of the Building Standards is unhelpful. The construction and testing of new buildings to meet the current Part L require\nments is not of sufficient rigour to ensure that the completed buildings meet the design heat loss levels. Insulation and draught proofing that will last the lifetime of a building are the most cost effective way of reducing a building\n'\ns heat demand. \n&#xa0;\nIt \nis acknowledged that there are still far too many UK households where there has been a failure to install loft and/or cavity wall insulation, and draught stripping measures. \n&#xa0;\nAny learning from the recent Retrofit for the Future programme should be evaluat\ned and disseminated.  The most cost effective measures in terms of heat and carbon reduction should be rolled out as soon as possible. Significant carbon reductions were achieved in many of the properties. \n&#xa0;\nThe use of night storage heating should be re-ex\namined. It was introduced in a different era to provide for baseload operation of nuclear stations. However, it leads to a wastage of heat, increased energy usage, and when driven by fossil fuel electricity, higher carbon emissions.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst this document \nspeaks to heat demand reduction - there is minimal referenc\ne to waste heat elimination and\n/or recovery. Greater attention should be given to the possible use of all varieties of heat pumps to deliver waste heat recovery in industrial processes. \nEncourag\ne\nme\nnt should be given to the use \nof newer low temperature heat-to-electric\nity devices, and planners should\n be encouraged to prom\no\nte t\nhe use of cascaded waste heat utilisation either from power stations and/or industrial process plant. \n&#xa0;\n \n•\n&#xa0;\nWhat progress is t\nhe government making on reducing the demand for heat?\n&#xa0;\nNot able to comment. \n&#xa0;\n •\n&#xa0;\nBiomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives.\n&#xa0;\n What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent \nan accurate picture?\n&#xa0;\nEverything!\n There must be a true reflection of the lifetime carbon emissions associated with the use of biomass as a heating fuel.\n I currently have difficulty with \nfigures reported by DEFRA, DECC and the Carbon Trust. The current Carb\non Trust guidelines f\nor different methods of heating\n buildings attribute a very low carbon value to biomass.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition the dynamics / lifetime of the carbon cycle needs to be accounted for. We sh\nould only be burning biomass fro\nm alre\nady sustainable \nsources. Ideally, given the currently dangerous levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, biomass carbon emitted in year one, should be re\n-\nabsorbed by new biomass in a\n matter of years - not decades.\n&#xa0;\n •\n&#xa0;\nThere are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go f\nar enough?\n&#xa0;\nSee previous paragraph.\n&#xa0;\n •\n&#xa0;\nWhat will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units? \n&#xa0;\nNot able to comment quantitatively.  Presumably will be dependent on the e\nmission standards required for these units. Uncontrolled use will lead to blue haze!\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?\n&#xa0;\nAt current tariff \nlevels, efficient mains gas boilers can offer some of the lowest running costs for the delivery of heat - particularly in older buildings (compared to say heat pumps). \n&#xa0;\nHow likely this will last depends on future UK gas prices and availability. \n&#xa0;\nThe enor\nmous, past, investment in the availability and capacity of the UK gas grid, means that it is currently able to handle peak winter heating demands (as long as there is sufficient supply and storage capacity). However, gas has little to offer in terms of \nfut\nure \ncarbon reduction, until and if \ncarbon neutral \nbiogas becomes widely available. \n&#xa0;\nGiven the investment in the U\nK gas grid, encouragement could\n be given to the development\n and roll out\n of gas fired, domestic\n,\n \nair and ground source heat pumps. These offer some reduction in gas consumption and carbon emissions - and may be one of the \ninterim \nsolutions for high density urban housing. \n&#xa0;\nNote that DECC's objective of combining electrically driven heat pumps with progressively lower carbon electricity leads to the ultimate decarbonisation of \nheat - and the release of invalua\nble liquid and gaseous fuels for far better utilisation than the pr\nov\nision of heat, ie\n/eg process industry, feedstock, and transportation. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n  •\n&#xa0;\nWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?\n&#xa0;\nA long story. We do not have a cultural history of using community heating. There are all sorts of development barriers\n. An example in Cornwall is where there is the opportunity for the development of one of Europe's largest minewater heating systems in the Camborne/Pool/Redruth Redevelopment Scheme.  It will not be realised because there is no fin\nancing or structural capa\nbility within the municipal\nity/ scheme developer to install the infrastructure. Development plots will be let to individual commercial developers - who will not be prepared to finance/install/develop the communal infrastructure. There are various in\nstituti\nonal barriers as well. I\nn a totally free energy market,\n the developer cannot guarantee uptake of the heating supply by future occupiers. It is now an issue on the Southampton District heating scheme - where new occupiers are questioning whether they have t\no and/or will make use of the communal distr\nict heating /cooling scheme.  Th\ne widespread adoption of community heating schem\ne\ns in countries in Europe us\nual arises through the participa\ntion of the \"municipality\" as the developer / owner. \n&#xa0;\nIt is interesting to note that in Sweden, with a history of municipality developed heating schemes, the recent privatisation is apparently leading to the dismantling of some schemes. \n&#xa0;\nAnother issue is that the lack of recent installations in the UK means \nthat there is a dearth of information regarding the true installed costs. \n&#xa0;\n •\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?\n&#xa0;\nNo idea. \n&#xa0;\n  •\n&#xa0;\nShould the government take any further any specif\nic actions in relation to cooling?\n&#xa0;\nIt should encourage the adoption of high efficiency cooling technology, and the use of passive cooling whenever possible.\n&#xa0;\nIn considering the energy use and carbon emissions of buildings, thought should be given to the f\nact that highly insulated buildings now give rise to cooling demand in. (Many new office buildings in the UK are now cooling \ndominated). The objective is not necessarily to prevent the use of cooling - the objective should be to minimise the overall use of\n energy, and reduce the overall carbon emissions, over the whole year comfort cycle. \n&#xa0;\n  •\n&#xa0;\nWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?\n&#xa0;\nI am not sure how yo\nu have come to this conclusion. \nIt has taken \nalmost \nfour years for the RHI to come\n \nto pass - and is only now being\n offered in any seriousness (Still yet to happen in anger - ie next Spring (perhaps?)\n)\n. This has caused utter mayhem in the supply industry and amongst consumers. Time will only tell whether the almost agreed levels of RHI t\nariff will now lead to great\ner\n heat pump rollout. \n&#xa0;\nIn the non-domestic sector it should be bore in mind that the gestation period for a new building can be anywhere between 1 and 5 years - it is not a case of just retro-fitting a few so\nlar panels to a bui\nlding.  Given\n that there is still no pre-approval process for non-do\nmestic RHI\n, it will be interesting to see whether the availability of a possible RHI tariff once the building has been\n constructed and commissioned \nwill induce developers to commit to \nrenewable heat technologies - let alone heat pumps. \n&#xa0;\n  •\n&#xa0;\nHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?\n&#xa0;\nWho knows !\n It will take some time for the supply industry to put together the trained personnel to deliver in significant numbers and to the newly required MCS standards.  Quite how the customers will react to the offer of RHI is impossible to gauge. Given the respo\nnse to FIT, \nit will all depend on the percei\nved attractivenes\ns of the offering. It should al\ns\no\n be appreciated that the replacement of a heating system is significantly more complex than the installation of say, PV panels.\n&#xa0;\n •\n&#xa0;\nThermal storage is a potential\n useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.\n&#xa0;\n What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?\n&#xa0;\nIt is funding a few possible thermal storage technologies through the DECC Ene\nrgy Entrepreneurs Schemes and the DECC Thermal Storage Innovation Scheme. The perception that mass installation of electrically driven heat pumps will give rise to peaking problems on the U grid means that attention should be given to innovations that can \nsmooth out peak heating demand.  Once the current hiatus over the use of ground source thermal storage schemes for non-domestic heating and cooling is overcome, we should see greater adoption of this technology - which has been stalled for the last four ye\nars.  Increased attention should be paid to long lasting, cost effective\n,\n phase change materials. \nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
