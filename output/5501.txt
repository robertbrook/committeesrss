[[[Written evidence by the International Primate Protection League]]]My name is Shirley McGreal and I have been working for the protection of primates for 41 years and directing a primate sanctuary.  I am writing your committee on behalf of the International Primate Protection League and its 14,000 members around the world, including many in the United Kingdom. 

[[[Summary:]]] The International Primate Protection League has opposed the pet trade in primates since its founding in 1973, wherever the practice occurs. The trade is appalling and species-destructive if the animals sold as pets are wild-caught and cruel if they are born in captivity. We urge your committee to bring the UK pet trade in primates to an end.1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Baby monkeys destined for the pet trade, when born in captivity, are removed from their mothers soon after birth. I have video of the removal of a baby gibbon from his mother at a facility in Texas. First the father was separated from his mate and baby. Next the owner of the place started shooting darts at the mother who flew around the cage defecating in panic. Finally a dart hit the mother and the next thing one saw was the baby, wrapped in an orange blanket, being paraded around at a shopping mall. 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This action was cruel and it’s the same with other primate species. From the moment of being removed from his or her mother, the baby monkey is sold by animal dealers to humans who think that having a baby monkey will be fun. Many of the purchasers call themselves “monkey moms” as if the monkey emerged from their bodies! Baby monkeys attract attention when taken out.

They often are forced to wear diapers with holes cut for their tails and some even have their tails removed. As infants they delight their owners who often befriend each other.4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Most purchasers have no clue about primate nutrition with a frequent result being rickets or other sicknesses, including stress. Many due young. 5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The fun for the human being dwindles as the “cute” pet grows up and develops canine teeth that can inflict serious injuries on “owners” and anyone they can get close to. Last week, in Ohio, USA, a two year old baby spider monkey was killed after biting a human who put his hand through the window of the car the owner was driving. 6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When the “owner” wearies of his once-cute pet, he/she often tries to find sanctuary space which is hard to find as most primate sanctuaries are over-crowded and under-funded.For all these and other reasons, the International Primate Protection League hopes that the UK trade in pet primates will be brought to an end. Thank you for your consideration of our input. Dr. Shirley McGreal OBE, Founder, IPPL26 January 2014&#xa0;
