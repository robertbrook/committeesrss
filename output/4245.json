"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Keep Britain TidyKeep Britain Tidy is an independent environmental charity, which campaigns for people’s right to live and work in a place of which they can be proud. A single truth underpins our success – caring for the environment is the first step to a better society. \n&#xa0;\nSixty years ago, we started with litter. Today we do much more. We run the world’s largest environmental education programme for about five million English students. About 1,300 parks fly our Green Flag. Clean, safe beaches fly the Blue Flag. Our Waste Watch programme helps communities conserve resources. And we work with local authorities and land managers across the country to cut costs and share what works. \n&#xa0;\nKeep Britain Tidy is also a founding member of the Break the Bag Habit coalition that includes The Campaign to Protect Rural England, Keep Britain Tidy, Surfers Against Sewage, Thames 21 and Greener upon Thames. The coalition has been campaigning for a charge on all single use carrier bags.  \n&#xa0;Summary:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The environmental impacts of the proposed 5p charge in England, including:What are the likely change in the number of bags discarded and any benefits for biodiversity and the environment&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe likely change in the volume of plastic film produced, and the impact of a reduced demand for the oil production by-product used to make bags&#xa0;\nThe impact on the use of biodegradable bags and the impact on plastics recyclingAny wider environmental or sustainability implications of a possible increased use of natural-fibre ‘bags for life’The relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed levy rather than a possible complete ban on lightweight plastic bagsThe rationale for excluding particular types of retailer from the levy schemeThe lessons to be learnt from other countries’ experiences in this areaAny social or economic impacts of the proposed bag levy, for example on affordability for particular households or businessesAny hygiene impacts or wider health impacts9 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nMcDonnell S, \nConvery\n F, Ferreira, S. 2008. \nThe most popular tax in Europe?
