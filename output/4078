defaultWrittedefaultn evidence submitted by Peter Morris defaultElecInfodefault Limited (BRC 64)default&#xa0;
defaultMay I start by stating I have an interest in NAPIT, as a 
defaultduly elected 
defaultrepresentative of
default the 
defaultNAPIT Trade
default Association
default nationally
default and 
defaultthe Electrical Safety Round table
default.
default  
defaultI am not permitted by NAPIT Group 
defaultto express the views of
default 
defaultthe 
defaultNAPIT members
default I represent
default in 
defaultPublic
default.
default 
default The 
default information
default b
defaultelow is my personal opinion
default 
defaultbased on speaking to Electrical contractors, 
defaultElectricians
default (The Trade)
default and 
defaulttheir customers
default 
defaultthe 
defaultPublic
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummary,defaultPart P of the 
defaultB
defaultuilding regulations
default, 
defaultwhy has it become so notorious? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe information contained in the letters from
default The Trade to the Committee
default have been in the 
defaultPublic
default domain, for eight years. They are more than frustrated that their voice and that of their customers the 
defaultPublic
default has been ignored. They welcome this opportunity to set the record straight, after watching the Select Committee being sold to, by organisations 
defaultthat ar
defaulte all connected commercially or at director level, restric
defaultting the evidence given to the C
defaultommittee.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou can become an Installer in three weeks, if it is so easy and safe, why do we need Schemes?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Charities, Schemes and registers don’t have any 
defaultmoney, ot
defaulther than that provided by the 
defaultPublic
default and “The Trade”
default. 
defaultThe
defaultse
default two groups are
default prin
defaultcipal stakeholders and are
default totally ignored
default,
default in particular the 
defaultPublic
default. The Trade have tried to help the 
defaultPublic
default in their communities, but they meet the same wall of compl
defaultexity and indifference the Committee has seen.  The complaints procedures in particular 
defaultprovide
defaults little 
defaultredress, there are  multiple examples of Schemes asking for money to inspect non-compliant work, conflicts of interest in this area are not acceptable. 
default Members of the 
defaultPublic
default walk away from the complaints procedure in disgust
default, 
defaultpaying again to have their electrical work carried out again to a compliant standard.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultParliament approved Part P of the Building R
defaultegulations 
defaultwhich was introduced in 2005.
default 
defaultIn 2006
default DCLG changed
default by Statutory I
defaultnstrument Part P of the Building regulations, removing the requirement to test and inspect 
defaultelectrical installations, 
defaultwas this for safety reasons?
default  
defaultDCLG then proceed
defaulted
default to allow people to join their Competent Person Schemes, befor
defaulte they were qualified.
default More below…
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe way forward,  needs to be based around performing safe electrical installations in the homes of the 
defaultPublic
default by Competent Qualified Electricians, the Trade knows that DCLG is a long way from providing that to the 
defaultPublic
default.  We hope that parliament can get agreement, as the 
defaultPublic
default and The Trade have no powers to get it themselves, that belongs to DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes
default&#xa0;default“The Committee wants to establish whether these are isolated problems or point to wider, systemic inadequacies with the competent persons scheme.” default&#xa0;defaultThe Schemes hide behind a wall of jargon and complexity, which the Select Committee have been struggling to
default unravel for almost two years. 
default W
defaulthen the 
defaultPublic
default require electrical work to 
defaultcarried out in their homes,  
defaultand
default use a member of a Competent P
defaulterson R
defaultegister 
defaultthey believ
defaulte will it  be carried out by a C
defaultompetent Qualified Electrician
default, this is not the case.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultElectrical Schemes all work to the same EAS Committee minimum standard
default, which they were 
defaultalmost exclusively involved with making
default. The Trade have been complaining about low standards for over eight years, the Select Committee have been speaking to the Schemes for almost two years, is it not strange that this has not been raised by DCLG or the Scheme in all that time, what else was o
defaultmitted?  
defaultThe Electrical Schemes have all been accredi
defaultted by UKAS in various forms
default for ye
defaultars, the statements that they will fully
default accredited by UKAS from the 14
defaultth
default June, 2014, does not mean that the 
defaultPublic
default will get a
default,
default Competent Qualified Electrician on the 
defaultDoorstep
default, the whole Competence story being sold is false. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1.1.
defaultThe 
defaultPublic
default are not aware of the Competent Person Schemes why should they be
default?
default 
defaultThe
default 
defaultPubl
defaultic
default 
defaultshould be aware of 
defaulttheir
default 
defaultresponsibilities for
default electrical work like Gas S
defaultafe
default, say Electric Safe
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
defaultThe 
defaultPublic
default are not aware of which ele
defaultctrical wor
defaultk should be notified, neither are
default 
defaultmany in 
defaultthe electrical trade.  
defaultThe 
defaultPublic
default should not be involved with notifications, that is just an imposition by DCLG and LABC because that is the way the way have always done it
default.
default 
default If you are having building work carried out which will be inspected by LABC
default,
default then notification is good. But to app
defaultly that system to ever
defaulty piece of work carried out by a
defaultll Trades such as plumbers, heating engineers, electricians etc. is a bureaucratic box ticking farce, it should be scrapped.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
defaultThe one area that does make the 
defaultPublic
default think about their responsibilities, is when a Solicitor asks what 
defaultelectrical 
defaultwork has been carried out, when they are selling a house and the have to sign the document.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultPublic
default should be 
defaultmade 
defaultaware that they need an Electrical Installation certificate,
default supplied by the person that carries out the work.
default  It is the responsibility of the person carrying out the work to ensure that it is inspected and tested and a certificate provided to the customer.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.2.
defaultT
defaulthe entry requirements
default onto the register of an Electr
defaultical Scheme are cause 
defaultfor concern
default, the five day wonders th
defaultr
defaultough to the three week wonders were agreed by the EAS Com
defaultmittee
default,
default which include the Electrical Schemes, Electrical Safety Council, DCLG etc
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
defaultThey all agree
defaultd with the short course Cheque B
defaultook Competence route for entry to their Schemes, some Schemes 
defaultlike NAPIT 
defaultset a higher standard though. The 
defaultderisory m
defaultinimum qualifications were also not required
default on joining a Scheme, you are given  twelve months to obtain them, during which time 
defaultyou could 
defaultwould work on safety critical equipment in the homes of the 
defaultPublic
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
defaultBeing an Electrician is a g
defaultood trade, we welcome
default new entrants,
default but the amounts of money charged, the sales claims made by training providers and accepted by Schemes, have misled many people. 
defaultIt is claimed that UKAS accreditation will suddenly change the competence levels of those in Schemes on the 14
defaultth
default June, 2014
default, ho
defaultw?
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
defaultThe EAS committee which
default DCLG
default,
default the Schemes and their owners sit on, set the standards for Competence
default. They then changed the meaning of Competent Person Schemes, to Competent Enterprise, which requires
default only one person per enterprise to be 
defaultAssessed 
defaultQualified or Competent, t
defaulthis misleads the 
defaultPublic
default and parliament who naturally believe a Competent Person Scheme has Competent persons on its register.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.2.
defaultThe change from Competent Person Scheme to Competent Enterprise, is also dangerously flawed in the area of supervision. The EAS Committee standard allows  
defaultthe 
defaultQualified Supervisor to certify the work of others work unseen, I believe this to be both dangerous and illegal. In the Domestic Electrical sector (Part P), individual Competence on the doorstep is the only safe solution, but the Electrical Safety Council 
defaultseem unwilling to agree to this simple step for their own Scheme.  This should be a case of 
defaultPublic
default protection, in the commercial and industrial electrical sectors, contracts and suing each other are common, the 
defaultPublic
default should not be in that situation.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
defaultThe lack of assessment has
default always
default been
default a topic on the 
defaultelectrical 
defaultforums
default for years
default, the trade has always been in favor of having assessments a separate item, 
defaultnot included in 
defaultmembership fees, p
defaultaying for an assessment upon receiving one.
default  Apparently annual assessments, were not a requirement until UKAS accreditation.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
defaultRisk based assessments were in the EAS 
defaultstandard
default from 2009, this was introduced 
defaultt
defaulto reduce the cost of Competent 
defaultp
defaulteople being assessed each year. Why did DCLG and the Schemes not implement this
default,
default was it a commercial reason or safety, if it was safety why did it appear in the standard written by them.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
defaultThe premise from the Schemes is that you are Competent if you are a 
defaultmember, if not, you are a rogue trader, although they have a right to sell this opinion, this manifestly is not true.  The Electrical Schemes base everything around assessment, why because it is 
defaultvery profitable, with the Gas Safe system you are assessed as
default Competent and then reassessed every 5 years. The premise from DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes, is that let anyone join, because membership is everything including profitable.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
defaultThe effect of competition between the accreditation bodies 
defaultNAPIT and Certsure 
defaultprovides healthy competition to ensure that charges for Scheme services are not exorbitant, which would be the case in a 
defaultsingle register 
defaultMonopoly.  The 
defaultElectrical Schemes 
defaultcharges are 
defaultstill very high
default 
defaultthrough 
defaultcompared with Gas S
defaultafe £186
default,
default which were set contr
defaultactu
defaultally under competitive tender, 
defaultthe 
defaulttwo accreditation bodies charge, 
defaultCertsure £444, NAPIT £408.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
defaultThe two separate 
defaultregisters; 
defaultElectricSafe has to my knowledge been in development since 2011, the principal being one register of Electricians 
defaultavailable to the 
defaultPublic
default.
default 
defaultCertsure was announced towards th
defaulte end of 2012, The Trade
default are puzzled 
defaultabout the formation of the 
defaultElectrical S
defaultafety Councils 
defaultsubsidiary Certsure
default between the ECA a
defaultnd the Electrical S
defaultafety Council subsidiaries
default,
default 
defaultas they were always 
defaultcompetitors.
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
defaultThe reluctance to agree with a single register is because 
defaultwhichever
default company takes control
default,
default takes the pr
defaultofit and both sides know that with DCLG Schemes they 
defaultare 
defaultanything but transparent.
default&#xa0;
defaultR
defaultegulation by DCLG of the Electrical Schemes is
default nonexistent
default,
default 
defaultnot light touch, as is
default the supervision within
default DCLG.
default&#xa0;
defaultExamples,
default6.2.
defaultP
defaultarliam
defaultent approved Part P of the Building R
defaultegulations in 2004, 
defaultwhich was introduced in 2005.
default  
defaultIn 2006 DCLG 
defaultchanged,
default by
default S
defaulttatutory instrument Part P of the Building regulations, removing the requirement to test and inspect installations, was this for safety reasons?
defaultDCLG will argue that the Electrical Regulations BS7671 require test and inspection, the electrical
default industry is highly competitive, if it is not a statutory requirement it does not happen, DCLG know this, so what was the real reason, I do not believe they will tell you.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
defaultDCLG then proceed to 
defaultallow people
default to join their Competent Person Schemes
default,
default before they were qualified.
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
defaultDCLG
default chose to a
defaultllow, the EAS Committee to change the basis of a Competent Person Scheme from 
default Competent Persons
default,
default to
default 
default“
defaultCompetent Enterprises
default”
default this change resulted in
default 
defaultonly one person per company
default being required to be Qualified, or assessed as Competent.  
defaultSurprisingly the Electrical Safety Council 
defaultis the largest
default supporter of t
defaulthis practice, the 
defaultPublic
default and
default the 
defaultSelect 
defaultCommittee may think that a Competent Person Scheme was just that
default,
default but it is not true
default. The 
defaultPublic
default believe
default that they are going to get a 
defaultCompetent Qualified Electrician, they pay
default for one,
default but that is not the case as 
defaultDCLG’s Competent P
defaulterson Schemes are not required to provide them.
default When you add in the fact that the 
defaultPublic
default are then responsible
default for that persons work, what would you describe that as?
default&#xa0;
default6.5.defaultDCLG have undertaken independent monitoring of the Electrical Schemes a number of times, defaultIn defaulta default2008 independent monitoring defaultreport defaultof the Electrical Schemes took place,default itdefault stated that, “The Department should work with LABC, Scheme operators and relevant industry bodies to actively improve the level of competence across the industry. This should seek to address the current issues surrounding inexperienced entrants and the indefaultclusion of experienced installers without formal qualifications.”default (2008)default&#xa0;
defaultThe issue of 
defaultinexperienced 
defaultpeople with
default negligible training still exist
defaults
default, those courses still exist, are the Electrical Schemes still accepting people from the courses, or are there 
defaultthousands of people bei
defaultng
default misled by training companies.
default&#xa0;
default6.6.default“The scheme operator’s conditions of authorisation should be reviewed and revised to provide a more comprehensive, clear and unambiguous definition of the criteria against which they will be judgeddefault. The scheme operator’s role and responsibilities should be clearly defined along with details of the requirements for scheme operation. default&#xa0;defaultThese should include development and defaultPublicdefaultation of scheme policies and procedures including those relating to: application and entry vetting, registration auditing and monitoring, complaints, discipline and appeals, reporting, customer services and protection, branding, promotion, defaultPublicdefaultations anddefault communications and financial management.default&#xa0;defaultIn particular, scheme operators should put in place processes and procedures to ensure that scheme finances are clearly ring-fenced and adequately accounted for. The Department should consider clarifying the requidefaultrement to account separately for scheme finances by requiring that scheme operators produce audited accounts for the scheme.” (2008)default&#xa0;
defaultI would like to thank the Select Committee for finally getting DCLG to act in this area, the requirement to take action ha
defaults been known since 2008, without the Select Committees intervention, progress and agreement would not have happened. 
defaultThere are c
defaultoncerns 
defaultwithin The Trade
default about what happens when t
defaulthe S
defaultelect Committees 
defaultscrutiny is removed, we are aware that the Part P industry 
defaultjust sees this as a short delay.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.7.
defaultThe goal posts have been moved so many times i
defaultn the last eight years,  the latest move
default being 
defaultUKAS accred
defaultitation from the 14th June, 2014 
defaultseems to be 
defaulta 
defaultnirvana 
defaultmome
defaultnt whe
defaultn the Schemes will miraculously change and everyone will become Competent.  UKAS is unlikely to be able to provide the co
defaultntrol required
default A
defaults a group 
defaultthe Schemes have tested this committee
default,
default I do not believe that UKAS could control the excesses the S
defaultchemes ar
defaulte capable of, with 
defaultjust 
defaultpolicies,
default procedure
defaults
default and
default 
defaultticking boxes.
default&#xa0;
default6.8.
defaultSo w
defaultho funds the Schemes
default, Registers, DCLG and the rest of the growing profitable Part P industry? 
defaultt
defaulthe principal stakeholders are the 
defaultPublic
default and the Trade
default,
default Do
default the present policies and procedures
default provide what the 
defaultPublic
default or Trade would recognise as
default Competent Persons no
default, DCLG and the Schemes 
defaultprobably 
defaultbelieve they do.
default  
defaultDCLG and there authorised Schemes should be service providers for what the 
defaultPublic
default want
default,
default not veste

defaultinterest.
default&#xa0;
default6.9.
defaultThe way forward
default,
default 
default needs to be based around performing safe electrical installations in the homes of the
