[normal]Writte[bold]n evidence submitted by Peter Morris [bold]ElecInfo[bold] Limited (BRC 64)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]May I start by stating I have an interest in NAPIT, as a 
[normal]duly elected 
[normal]representative of
[normal] the 
[normal]NAPIT Trade
[normal] Association
[normal] nationally
[normal] and 
[normal]the Electrical Safety Round table
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]I am not permitted by NAPIT Group 
[normal]to express the views of
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]NAPIT members
[normal] I represent
[normal] in 
[normal]Public
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] The 
[normal] information
[normal] b
[normal]elow is my personal opinion
[normal] 
[normal]based on speaking to Electrical contractors, 
[normal]Electricians
[normal] (The Trade)
[normal] and 
[normal]their customers
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Public
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary,[bold]Part P of the 
[normal]B
[normal]uilding regulations
[normal], 
[normal]why has it become so notorious? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The information contained in the letters from
[normal] The Trade to the Committee
[normal] have been in the 
[normal]Public
[normal] domain, for eight years. They are more than frustrated that their voice and that of their customers the 
[normal]Public
[normal] has been ignored. They welcome this opportunity to set the record straight, after watching the Select Committee being sold to, by organisations 
[normal]that ar
[normal]e all connected commercially or at director level, restric
[normal]ting the evidence given to the C
[normal]ommittee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You can become an Installer in three weeks, if it is so easy and safe, why do we need Schemes?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Charities, Schemes and registers don’t have any 
[normal]money, ot
[normal]her than that provided by the 
[normal]Public
[normal] and “The Trade”
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal]se
[normal] two groups are
[normal] prin
[normal]cipal stakeholders and are
[normal] totally ignored
[normal],
[normal] in particular the 
[normal]Public
[normal]. The Trade have tried to help the 
[normal]Public
[normal] in their communities, but they meet the same wall of compl
[normal]exity and indifference the Committee has seen.  The complaints procedures in particular 
[normal]provide
[normal]s little 
[normal]redress, there are  multiple examples of Schemes asking for money to inspect non-compliant work, conflicts of interest in this area are not acceptable. 
[normal] Members of the 
[normal]Public
[normal] walk away from the complaints procedure in disgust
[normal], 
[normal]paying again to have their electrical work carried out again to a compliant standard.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Parliament approved Part P of the Building R
[normal]egulations 
[normal]which was introduced in 2005.
[normal] 
[normal]In 2006
[normal] DCLG changed
[normal] by Statutory I
[normal]nstrument Part P of the Building regulations, removing the requirement to test and inspect 
[normal]electrical installations, 
[normal]was this for safety reasons?
[normal]  
[normal]DCLG then proceed
[normal]ed
[normal] to allow people to join their Competent Person Schemes, befor
[normal]e they were qualified.
[normal] More below…
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The way forward,  needs to be based around performing safe electrical installations in the homes of the 
[normal]Public
[normal] by Competent Qualified Electricians, the Trade knows that DCLG is a long way from providing that to the 
[normal]Public
[normal].  We hope that parliament can get agreement, as the 
[normal]Public
[normal] and The Trade have no powers to get it themselves, that belongs to DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]“The Committee wants to establish whether these are isolated problems or point to wider, systemic inadequacies with the competent persons scheme.” [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Schemes hide behind a wall of jargon and complexity, which the Select Committee have been struggling to
[normal] unravel for almost two years. 
[normal] W
[normal]hen the 
[normal]Public
[normal] require electrical work to 
[normal]carried out in their homes,  
[normal]and
[normal] use a member of a Competent P
[normal]erson R
[normal]egister 
[normal]they believ
[normal]e will it  be carried out by a C
[normal]ompetent Qualified Electrician
[normal], this is not the case.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Electrical Schemes all work to the same EAS Committee minimum standard
[normal], which they were 
[normal]almost exclusively involved with making
[normal]. The Trade have been complaining about low standards for over eight years, the Select Committee have been speaking to the Schemes for almost two years, is it not strange that this has not been raised by DCLG or the Scheme in all that time, what else was o
[normal]mitted?  
[normal]The Electrical Schemes have all been accredi
[normal]ted by UKAS in various forms
[normal] for ye
[normal]ars, the statements that they will fully
[normal] accredited by UKAS from the 14
[normal]th
[normal] June, 2014, does not mean that the 
[normal]Public
[normal] will get a
[normal],
[normal] Competent Qualified Electrician on the 
[normal]Doorstep
[normal], the whole Competence story being sold is false. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]The 
[normal]Public
[normal] are not aware of the Competent Person Schemes why should they be
[normal]?
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]Publ
[normal]ic
[normal] 
[normal]should be aware of 
[normal]their
[normal] 
[normal]responsibilities for
[normal] electrical work like Gas S
[normal]afe
[normal], say Electric Safe
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]The 
[normal]Public
[normal] are not aware of which ele
[normal]ctrical wor
[normal]k should be notified, neither are
[normal] 
[normal]many in 
[normal]the electrical trade.  
[normal]The 
[normal]Public
[normal] should not be involved with notifications, that is just an imposition by DCLG and LABC because that is the way the way have always done it
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] If you are having building work carried out which will be inspected by LABC
[normal],
[normal] then notification is good. But to app
[normal]ly that system to ever
[normal]y piece of work carried out by a
[normal]ll Trades such as plumbers, heating engineers, electricians etc. is a bureaucratic box ticking farce, it should be scrapped.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]The one area that does make the 
[normal]Public
[normal] think about their responsibilities, is when a Solicitor asks what 
[normal]electrical 
[normal]work has been carried out, when they are selling a house and the have to sign the document.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Public
[normal] should be 
[normal]made 
[normal]aware that they need an Electrical Installation certificate,
[normal] supplied by the person that carries out the work.
[normal]  It is the responsibility of the person carrying out the work to ensure that it is inspected and tested and a certificate provided to the customer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal]T
[normal]he entry requirements
[normal] onto the register of an Electr
[normal]ical Scheme are cause 
[normal]for concern
[normal], the five day wonders th
[normal]r
[normal]ough to the three week wonders were agreed by the EAS Com
[normal]mittee
[normal],
[normal] which include the Electrical Schemes, Electrical Safety Council, DCLG etc
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]They all agree
[normal]d with the short course Cheque B
[normal]ook Competence route for entry to their Schemes, some Schemes 
[normal]like NAPIT 
[normal]set a higher standard though. The 
[normal]derisory m
[normal]inimum qualifications were also not required
[normal] on joining a Scheme, you are given  twelve months to obtain them, during which time 
[normal]you could 
[normal]would work on safety critical equipment in the homes of the 
[normal]Public
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]Being an Electrician is a g
[normal]ood trade, we welcome
[normal] new entrants,
[normal] but the amounts of money charged, the sales claims made by training providers and accepted by Schemes, have misled many people. 
[normal]It is claimed that UKAS accreditation will suddenly change the competence levels of those in Schemes on the 14
[normal]th
[normal] June, 2014
[normal], ho
[normal]w?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.
[normal]The EAS committee which
[normal] DCLG
[normal],
[normal] the Schemes and their owners sit on, set the standards for Competence
[normal]. They then changed the meaning of Competent Person Schemes, to Competent Enterprise, which requires
[normal] only one person per enterprise to be 
[normal]Assessed 
[normal]Qualified or Competent, t
[normal]his misleads the 
[normal]Public
[normal] and parliament who naturally believe a Competent Person Scheme has Competent persons on its register.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.2.
[normal]The change from Competent Person Scheme to Competent Enterprise, is also dangerously flawed in the area of supervision. The EAS Committee standard allows  
[normal]the 
[normal]Qualified Supervisor to certify the work of others work unseen, I believe this to be both dangerous and illegal. In the Domestic Electrical sector (Part P), individual Competence on the doorstep is the only safe solution, but the Electrical Safety Council 
[normal]seem unwilling to agree to this simple step for their own Scheme.  This should be a case of 
[normal]Public
[normal] protection, in the commercial and industrial electrical sectors, contracts and suing each other are common, the 
[normal]Public
[normal] should not be in that situation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]The lack of assessment has
[normal] always
[normal] been
[normal] a topic on the 
[normal]electrical 
[normal]forums
[normal] for years
[normal], the trade has always been in favor of having assessments a separate item, 
[normal]not included in 
[normal]membership fees, p
[normal]aying for an assessment upon receiving one.
[normal]  Apparently annual assessments, were not a requirement until UKAS accreditation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]Risk based assessments were in the EAS 
[normal]standard
[normal] from 2009, this was introduced 
[normal]t
[normal]o reduce the cost of Competent 
[normal]p
[normal]eople being assessed each year. Why did DCLG and the Schemes not implement this
[normal],
[normal] was it a commercial reason or safety, if it was safety why did it appear in the standard written by them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]The premise from the Schemes is that you are Competent if you are a 
[normal]member, if not, you are a rogue trader, although they have a right to sell this opinion, this manifestly is not true.  The Electrical Schemes base everything around assessment, why because it is 
[normal]very profitable, with the Gas Safe system you are assessed as
[normal] Competent and then reassessed every 5 years. The premise from DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes, is that let anyone join, because membership is everything including profitable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]The effect of competition between the accreditation bodies 
[normal]NAPIT and Certsure 
[normal]provides healthy competition to ensure that charges for Scheme services are not exorbitant, which would be the case in a 
[normal]single register 
[normal]Monopoly.  The 
[normal]Electrical Schemes 
[normal]charges are 
[normal]still very high
[normal] 
[normal]through 
[normal]compared with Gas S
[normal]afe £186
[normal],
[normal] which were set contr
[normal]actu
[normal]ally under competitive tender, 
[normal]the 
[normal]two accreditation bodies charge, 
[normal]Certsure £444, NAPIT £408.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]The two separate 
[normal]registers; 
[normal]ElectricSafe has to my knowledge been in development since 2011, the principal being one register of Electricians 
[normal]available to the 
[normal]Public
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Certsure was announced towards th
[normal]e end of 2012, The Trade
[normal] are puzzled 
[normal]about the formation of the 
[normal]Electrical S
[normal]afety Councils 
[normal]subsidiary Certsure
[normal] between the ECA a
[normal]nd the Electrical S
[normal]afety Council subsidiaries
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as they were always 
[normal]competitors.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]The reluctance to agree with a single register is because 
[normal]whichever
[normal] company takes control
[normal],
[normal] takes the pr
[normal]ofit and both sides know that with DCLG Schemes they 
[normal]are 
[normal]anything but transparent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]R
[normal]egulation by DCLG of the Electrical Schemes is
[normal] nonexistent
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]not light touch, as is
[normal] the supervision within
[normal] DCLG.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Examples,
[normal]6.2.
[normal]P
[normal]arliam
[normal]ent approved Part P of the Building R
[normal]egulations in 2004, 
[normal]which was introduced in 2005.
[normal]  
[normal]In 2006 DCLG 
[normal]changed,
[normal] by
[normal] S
[normal]tatutory instrument Part P of the Building regulations, removing the requirement to test and inspect installations, was this for safety reasons?
[normal]DCLG will argue that the Electrical Regulations BS7671 require test and inspection, the electrical
[normal] industry is highly competitive, if it is not a statutory requirement it does not happen, DCLG know this, so what was the real reason, I do not believe they will tell you.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3.
[normal]DCLG then proceed to 
[normal]allow people
[normal] to join their Competent Person Schemes
[normal],
[normal] before they were qualified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4.
[normal]DCLG
[normal] chose to a
[normal]llow, the EAS Committee to change the basis of a Competent Person Scheme from 
[normal] Competent Persons
[normal],
[normal] to
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]Competent Enterprises
[normal]”
[normal] this change resulted in
[normal] 
[normal]only one person per company
[normal] being required to be Qualified, or assessed as Competent.  
[normal]Surprisingly the Electrical Safety Council 
[normal]is the largest
[normal] supporter of t
[normal]his practice, the 
[normal]Public
[normal] and
[normal] the 
[normal]Select 
[normal]Committee may think that a Competent Person Scheme was just that
[normal],
[normal] but it is not true
[normal]. The 
[normal]Public
[normal] believe
[normal] that they are going to get a 
[normal]Competent Qualified Electrician, they pay
[normal] for one,
[normal] but that is not the case as 
[normal]DCLG’s Competent P
[normal]erson Schemes are not required to provide them.
[normal] When you add in the fact that the 
[normal]Public
[normal] are then responsible
[normal] for that persons work, what would you describe that as?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5.[bold]DCLG have undertaken independent monitoring of the Electrical Schemes a number of times, [bold]In [bold]a [bold]2008 independent monitoring [bold]report [bold]of the Electrical Schemes took place,[bold] it[bold] stated that, “The Department should work with LABC, Scheme operators and relevant industry bodies to actively improve the level of competence across the industry. This should seek to address the current issues surrounding inexperienced entrants and the in[bold]clusion of experienced installers without formal qualifications.”[bold] (2008)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The issue of 
[normal]inexperienced 
[normal]people with
[normal] negligible training still exist
[normal]s
[normal], those courses still exist, are the Electrical Schemes still accepting people from the courses, or are there 
[normal]thousands of people bei
[normal]ng
[normal] misled by training companies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6.[bold]“The scheme operator’s conditions of authorisation should be reviewed and revised to provide a more comprehensive, clear and unambiguous definition of the criteria against which they will be judged[bold]. The scheme operator’s role and responsibilities should be clearly defined along with details of the requirements for scheme operation. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]These should include development and [bold]Public[bold]ation of scheme policies and procedures including those relating to: application and entry vetting, registration auditing and monitoring, complaints, discipline and appeals, reporting, customer services and protection, branding, promotion, [bold]Public[bold]ations and[bold] communications and financial management.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In particular, scheme operators should put in place processes and procedures to ensure that scheme finances are clearly ring-fenced and adequately accounted for. The Department should consider clarifying the requi[bold]rement to account separately for scheme finances by requiring that scheme operators produce audited accounts for the scheme.” (2008)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to thank the Select Committee for finally getting DCLG to act in this area, the requirement to take action ha
[normal]s been known since 2008, without the Select Committees intervention, progress and agreement would not have happened. 
[normal]There are c
[normal]oncerns 
[normal]within The Trade
[normal] about what happens when t
[normal]he S
[normal]elect Committees 
[normal]scrutiny is removed, we are aware that the Part P industry 
[normal]just sees this as a short delay.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.7.
[normal]The goal posts have been moved so many times i
[normal]n the last eight years,  the latest move
[normal] being 
[normal]UKAS accred
[normal]itation from the 14th June, 2014 
[normal]seems to be 
[normal]a 
[normal]nirvana 
[normal]mome
[normal]nt whe
[normal]n the Schemes will miraculously change and everyone will become Competent.  UKAS is unlikely to be able to provide the co
[normal]ntrol required
[normal] A
[normal]s a group 
[normal]the Schemes have tested this committee
[normal],
[normal] I do not believe that UKAS could control the excesses the S
[normal]chemes ar
[normal]e capable of, with 
[normal]just 
[normal]policies,
[normal] procedure
[normal]s
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]ticking boxes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.8.
[normal]So w
[normal]ho funds the Schemes
[normal], Registers, DCLG and the rest of the growing profitable Part P industry? 
[normal]t
[normal]he principal stakeholders are the 
[normal]Public
[normal] and the Trade
[normal],
[normal] Do
[normal] the present policies and procedures
[normal] provide what the 
[normal]Public
[normal] or Trade would recognise as
[normal] Competent Persons no
[normal], DCLG and the Schemes 
[normal]probably 
[normal]believe they do.
[normal]  
[normal]DCLG and there authorised Schemes should be service providers for what the 
[normal]Public
[normal] want
[normal],
[normal] not veste
[normal]d 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]interest.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.9.
[normal]The way forward
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal] needs to be based around performing safe electrical installations in the homes of the 
[normal]Public
[normal] by Competent Qualified Elect
[normal]ricians, the Trade knows that DCLG is a long way from providing that to the 
[normal]Public
[normal].  We hope that parliament can get agreement, as the 
[normal]Public
[normal] and The Trade have no powers to get it themselves, that belongs to DCLG and their commercial partners the Schemes
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is becoming a 
[normal]Public
[normal] protection issue,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]December 2013
[normal]&#xa0;
