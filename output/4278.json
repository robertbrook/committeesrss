"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Food and Drink Federation (FDF)&#xa0;\nThis written evidence is submitted by the Food and Drink Federation, the trade association for food and drink manufacturing. Food and drink is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK (accounting for 15% of the total manufacturing sector) turning over £78.7bn per annum; creating GVA of £20bn and employing up to 400,000 people.\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nFood security is fundamental, not only to individual well-being but to all wider human social and economic activity. It is also an extremely complex issue dependent on many different factors and variables. UK food security cannot be seen in isolation from what is happening elsewhere in the world. But, as the Committee recognised in its 2009 inquiry, there is potential for us to do more at a national level to address the challenges which have since been comprehensively articulated in the Final Report of the Government Office for Science Foresight Global Food and Farming Futures Project\n published in January 2011.\n&#xa0;\nIn essence these challenges involve producing more, from less and with less impact against a background of world population growth, increased pressure on natural resources and the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n&#xa0;\nOther contributory drivers such as increasing urbanisation, demand for higher protein diets in developing countries and the apparently more frequent incidence of extreme weather events, notably droughts and floods, are widely recognised as reinforcing the need for greater resilience and sustainability across the whole food system, in terms of both production and consumption.\n&#xa0;\nFood and drink manufacturing plays an essential role in driving resource efficiency and supplying consumers with a wide range of safe, nutritious, appetising and affordable products, as well as contributing to economic growth and supporting rural and other communities by offering many different employment opportunities.\n&#xa0;\nBut improvements are needed at all stages of production, from the raw materials we source, to the energy, water and other resources we use in processing, through to helping consumers in the choices they make.\n&#xa0;\nScience and technology have the potential to make a major contribution to the innovation required to make food which is healthier, more sustainable and more affordable for everyone.\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe relationship between the price of food and the cost of producing it&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability can contribute to increased resilience&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhether climate change risks are adequately incorporated in UK food security strategies and planning&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase production and access new markets&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWays of increasing self-sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10 December 2013\n&#xa0;\nThe UK Food and Drink Manufacturing Industry&#xa0;\nThe Food and Drink Federation (FDF) represents the food and drink manufacturing industry, the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, employing 400,000 people.\n&#xa0;\n The industry has an annual turnover of over £78.7bn accounting \nfor 15% of the total manufacturing sector. Exports amount to over £12bn of which 76% goes to EU members. The industry buys two-thirds of all UK’s agricultural produce.\n&#xa0;\nThe following Associations actively work with the Food and Drink Federation:\n&#xa0;\nABIM\n              \nAssociation of Bakery Ingredient Manufacturers\nACFM\n              \nAssociation of Cereal Food Manufacturers\nBCA\n              \nBritish Coffee Association\nBOBMA\n              \nBritish Oats and Barley Millers Association\nBSIA\n              \nBritish Starch Industry Association\nBSNA\n              \nBritish Specialist Nutrition Association\nCIMA\n              \nCereal Ingredient Manufacturers’ Association\nEMMA\n              \nEuropean Malt Product Manufacturers’ Association\nFCPPA\n              \nFrozen and Chilled Potato Processors Association\nFOB\n              \nFederation of Bakers\nPPA\n              \nPotato Processors Association\nSMA\n              \nSalt Manufacturers’ Association\nSN\n              \nSugar Nutrition UK\nSNACMA\n              \nSnack, Nut and Crisp Manufacturers’ Association\nSPA\n              \nSoya Protein Association\nSSA\n              \nSeasoning and Spice Association\nUKAMBY\n              \nUK\n Association of Manufacturers of Bakers’ Yeast\nUKHIA\n              \nUK\n Herbal Infusions Association\nUKTC\n              \nUK\n Tea Council\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFDF also runs specialist sector groups for members:\n&#xa0;\nBCCC\n              \nBiscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Group\nFF\n              \nFrozen Food Group\nMG\n              \nMeat Group\nORG\n              \nOrganic Group\nSG\n              \nSeafood Group\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n               \nhttp://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf\n \nhttp://www.fdf.org.uk/publicgeneral/2020_vision_for_growth.pdf\n \nhttp://www.fdf.org.uk/environment_progress_report.aspx\n \n \nhttp:/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/food/food_matte\nr\ns1.pdf\n \nhttp://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/food/pdf/food2030strategy.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69575/pb13794-greenfoodproject-report.pdf\n \nhttp://www.food-scp.eu\n \nhttp://www.wrap.org.uk/content/product-sustainability-forum\n \nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0571:FIN:EN:PDF\n \nhttp://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk\n \nhttp://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/assets/pdfs/frp-severe-weather-uk-food-chain-resilience.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/adapting-to-climate-change\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227259/9643-BIS-UK_Agri_Tech_Strategy_Accessible.pdf\n \nhttp://ec.e\nu\nropa.eu/europe2020/\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/policies/using-industrial-strategy-to-help-the-uk-economy-and-business-compete-and-grow/supporting-pages/developing-strategic-partnerships-with-industry\n \nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmenvaud/879/879.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/groceries-supply-code-of-practice\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/groceries-code-adjudicator\n \nhttp://www.fdf.org.uk/innovations.aspx\n \n20.\nhttp://www.fdf.org.uk/corporate_pubs/Graduate%20Excellence%20flyer.pdf\n21.\nhttps://connect.innovateuk.org/web/uk-ntp-for-food/about-us\n22\n \nhttp://etp.fooddrinkeurope.eu/asp/index.asp\n&#xa0;\n23\n \nhttp://www.fdf.org.uk/corporate_pubs/Sustainability%20booklet_7.pdf\n24\n \nhttp://www.fdf.org.uk/food-authenticity.aspx\n25\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/fil\ne\n/209866/pb13942-nap-20130701.pdf\n&#xa0;\n26\n \nhttp://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=11198_ITOCCFinalReport_Complete.pdf\n27\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/249891/food-drink-strategy-131004.pdf\n28\nhttps://www.fdf.org.uk/publicgeneral/FDF-10-Steps-t\no\n-Export-Success.pdf\n&#xa0;\n"
