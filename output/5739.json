"&#xa0;\nSupplementary w\nritten evidence from \nChief Constable Martin Richards\n QPM\n, Sussex Police\n [PCC Progress \n50\n]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am writing in response to your letter dated 17th January 2014 which was received in my\n \noffice on 28th January 2014. In this letter you request the information that I had agreed to\n \nprovide relating to \nPolice Information Notices (PIN\ns) during my evidence to the Committee on\n 7th\n January 2014.\n&#xa0;\nI am aware that a response ha\ns\n been provided\n to the Committee providing the \nnumber of\n PIN\ns issued by Sussex Police during 2013. However your subsequent letter asks for the\n number of PIN\ns that have been issued for the last two years. For the sake of completeness, I\n \ncan confirm that in 201\n2 Sussex Police issued 1796 PIN\ns,\n and in 2013 we issued 2006 PIN\ns.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMartin RichardsChief Constable\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
