[[[Executive Summery]]]High quality education for all children including disabled in their first years of schooling builds a foundation for future learning and for healthy and productive family and civic life. Literacy skills equip a person to both gain knowledge and understanding of their immediate environment as well as to make sense of the wider world. Research shows that a child who is able to read and write is better able to contribute to his or her personal and community well being. Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP III), Big Results Now (BRN) and LANES proposal firmly recognizes the importance of education to support literacy development, to ensure better lives for the Tanzanians including people with disabilities. But the challenges are many including semi-trained teachers for literacy, lack of Braille reading materials to read, besides having few textbooks transcribed into Braille.The CBP’s experience in Braille Book provision is in line with the DFID’s mission to support disabled children and youths to improve their lives, and prepare them to become responsible citizens in their communities.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[.]]]Rationale for the ProjectIn 1994 CBP organized a Children’s Book Day at the National Library. Among the invited children where visually impaired children from Uhuru Mchanganyiko, in Ilala District, Dar es Salaam region. The children performed a poem which raised their voice that they were being neglected in CBP’s book project activities, while normal children were provided with books.The children raised their concern that, they had very few textbooks in Braille and there were no reading books. Following the request, CBP embarked on a programme of producing Braille books for visually impaired children. Those were the first readers ever produced for visually impaired children in the country. To-date CBP has transcribed 37 story books for visually impaired children. The books have been distributed to 25 schools which cater for the disabled children.Currently there are more than 2,000 visually impaired children in primary schools in Tanzania. Among them are two specials namely Bwigili in Dodoma region and Furaha in Tabora region. There are also integrated schools which are Uhuru Mchanganyiko in Dar es Salaam,Mazinyungu in Morogoro region and another one in Lushoto, the rest are inclusive schools.&#xa0;

[[[ Activities]]]CBP will carry out needs assessment to determine the actual number of visually impaired children who are in primary schools in Tanzania. The number of visually impaired children will determine the print run of the Braille books to be produced and distributed to schools. Apart from getting this crucial information, the project will be informed on the list of schools with such children and number of tutors and teachers available for these children. The information will support project planning.2.

[[[ ]]]Training of Trainers Selected a number of tutors from the colleges which train teachers for visually impaired children and train them on how to teach effective literacy skills .and prepare them to become trainers and mentors.. Train teachers through in- service teacher training through Train the trainer model.. The initiative is focusing on enabling teachers to acquire book management skills of Braille books, and provide them with basic librarian skills, and also on how to incorporate reading materials into instructional strategies of their school culture through library development and instructional practice..The Braille book provision initiative strongly supports PEDP III which states the necessity for school libraries and supplementary materials to support learning and teaching.Provision of Braille Books to integrated schools which cater for visually impaired children and inclusive schools will support instruction strategies, literacy development and learning outcomes. These materials will support the quality of education, the country’s literacy development and nurture children’s lifelong habits of reading during a formative period of learning.CBP has participated in the preparation of the government (Ministry of Education and Vocational Training) proposal on Literacy and Numeracy (LANES) to the Global Partners Education (GPE) which has been approved. The proposal to GPE did not neither accommodate an activity for provision of reading books to both normal and visually impaired children nor establishment of school libraries.Furthermore, the new presidential Initiative Big Results Now (BRN) and the PEDP III activities did not also accommodate the same. In this respect CBP is appealing to DFID to take the responsibility to provide Braille Books to improve the children’s outcome and eventually contribute to improving the quality education.December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
