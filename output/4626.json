"&#xa0;\nAFS0057Written evidence submitted by Paul A HartleyPoints for consideration\n in no particular order\n:-\n&#xa0;\nThe above points are all relevant to the Route 39 Free School in North Dev\non that is at present in temporary buildings and likely to be so for some time due to planning objections. Route 39 has failed to recruit their stated numbers and projected numbers for their second year are 50% of expected numbers.Â  \n&#xa0;\nI am not against the \nconcept of free schools but the public money that is being wasted on free schools is a scandal. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
