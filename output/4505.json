"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Classic FM [FBB0090]&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION\n&#xa0;This paper \nshould be seen in conjunction with a submission from Global Radio. \nIt focuses on the future of the BBC with regard to BBC Radio\n \n3 and its exceptional role in broadcasting and commissioning classical music. \n&#xa0;\nBBC Radio 3 holds a unique position in the British broadcasting landscape. Its strength in the past has been in its ability to use this unique position, with the safety net of generous public funding, to create bold, distinctive, brave programming, unfette\nred by the need to deliver audiences to advertisers. With a guaranteed income from the Licence Fee, BBC Radio 3 operates in common with other BBC services, without any fear of commercial failure. \n&#xa0;\nAlone among any BBC radio or television service, it can be\n argued that BBC Radio 3’s uniquely guaranteed funding, along with the concentration of power in the hands of the station’s Controller, is unprecedented in any other area of broadcasting or the arts in the UK. Not only is this role editorially and financia\nlly responsible for the radio network, but the holder of the post is also the largest commissioner of classical music in the UK, controls the UK’s biggest live classical music festival (The BBC Proms) and is responsible for the five BBC Orchestras and the \nBBC Singers. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nposition of \nBBC \nRadio\n \n3 in the marketplace means that the \nBBC occupies a potentially market-distorting role in terms of the commissioning, broadcast and promotion of live classical music in the UK, either on radio or via digital online b\nroadcasts. \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC must have great regard for the impact of \nBBC \nRadio\n \n3 on the market place and on the classical music eco-system in the UK. In future, \nthe BBC should enforce far tighter content requirements on publicly subsidised services such as BBC Ra\ndio 3, with far greater regard to the overall competitive broadcast marketplace when programming changes are made. \n&#xa0;\nAny incursions into digital delivery of classical music by the BBC – either via Radio 3 or through other means should be closely monitored \nand controlled. \nAt present, these appear to be unfettered. \n&#xa0;\nWe would also welcome a new funding mechanism, which allows a far wider dissemination of classical music content from orchestras funded by the Arts Council. This could be through a public service fund, provided by a proportion of the licence fee, which all\nows commercial services to broadcast cultural events (such as live classical music concerts). This mechanism would ensure that these events reach a far wider audience, thereby making the ratio of public subsidy to audience reached far more economically jus\ntifiable. \n&#xa0;\nBy way of background, t\nhis submission\n examines \nthe effect of \nrecent programme changes at BBC Radio 3. It will argue that although each of these changes may on its own be regarded as being \nrelatively \nminor, \nwhen taken \ncumulatively over \na \nsustain\ned period, they have \nprofoundly affect\ned\n both the character and the content of BBC Radio 3’s service.\n In the process, this has resulted in a significant change to the classical music ra\ndio landscape in the UK, with the serious\n erosion of listener choice \nin\n key dayparts \nbeing the principal outcome. \n&#xa0;\nAs a radio station that primarily broadcasts classical music, BBC Radio 3 operates in a market of two, with Classic FM its commercial radio competitor. \nThese significant changes by BBC Radio 3 have the potential\n to radically alter the classical music radio marketplace in the UK\n to the detriment of its commercial rival\n.\n As yet, the BBC Trust has refused formally to examine the impact of these changes. \n \n&#xa0;\nGiven the amount of public money available to BBC Radio 3’s management, it is imperative that this funding is invested to augment and widen the artistic depth and breadth of classical music broadcasting in the UK, rather than in replicating the service alr\neady provided by Classic FM, the BBC’s only commercial competitor in this area. \n&#xa0;\nAccording to BBC Radio 3’s Service Licence, issued by the BBC Trust in July 2011:\n&#xa0;\n“The remit of Radio 3 is to offer a mix of music and cultural programming in order to engag\ne and entertain its audience… Radio 3’s programmes should exhibit some or all of the following characteristics: high quality, original, challenging, innovative and engaging, and it should nurture UK talent… The service should aim to educate audi\nences about\n music, broadcasting a\n wide range of programmes that expose listeners to new and sometimes challenging material they may not otherwise experience.\n” \nPROGRAMMING CHANGES\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nThe past few years have seen a series of major programming changes to the style and content of BBC Radio 3’s output. \nThese changes have not been introduced all at once in one bold move. Rather, it is apparent that there has been a creeping \npopularisation\n o\nf BBC Radio 3’s output\n over the past few years\n, with the effect that\n the clear \ngap between it and Classic FM has been\n gradually eroded, with the BBC station moving inexorably towards the position which has traditionally been occupied by its commercial comp\netitor. \n&#xa0;\nThese \nchanges \nhave included (but are not limited to):\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRESPONSES TO BBC RADIO 3’s OUTPUT CHANGES\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIn its Service Review of BBC Radio 3, published in April 2011, the BBC Trust says:\n&#xa0;\n“We are aware that there are ways in which Radio 3 could more actively target new \nlisteners. In particular, it could pursue a far more populist approach by abandoning its commitment to a wide range of challenging music, or by playing much shorter excerpts of orchestral pieces. However, such an approach would significantly jeopardise and\n damage those elements that make Radio 3 distinctive and highly valued. Such a strategy would not be welcomed by either audiences or industry.\n” \n&#xa0;\nAlthough it is clear to those intimately involved in classical music broadcasting \nthat the character and conte\nnt of BBC R\nadio 3’s output has \nin fact \nbeen creeping towards that of Classic FM over the \npast couple of years, this \nhas now been noticed both by the \nwider \nlistening public and by cultural commentators.\n&#xa0;\nThe Voice of the Listener and Viewer says:\n&#xa0;\n“We \nconsider that Radio 3 needs to be highly distinctive in comparison with Classic FM. At present the morning drive ti\nme is often indistinguishable f\nr\no\nm the commercial station. The BBC should originate not copy.\n” &#xa0;\nOn January 10\nth\n 2011, Nicholas de Jongh wrot\ne in The Independent under the headline \nRadio 3 – Low-brow, lightweight and losing its way?\n:\n&#xa0;\n“These days Radio 3 sometimes sounds as if intent on transforming itself into a superior version of Classic FM. The wretchedly low-brow three hours’ a night of li\nsteners’ requests during The Genius of Mozart festival sounds for the first ti\nme as i\nf the station were seriously dress-rehearsing to slip down-market.\n” \n&#xa0;\nOn October 5\nth\n 2011, Sarah Spilsbury from the listeners’ group Friends of Radio 3 wrote in The Guardian:\n \n&#xa0;\n“The BBC Trust agreed in February that Radio 3 must redouble its efforts to reach a “broader audience”. Indeed, for their recent report on the station’s performanc\ne, they sought the views of the broader public – most of whom do not listen to the station. Having ascertained that the non-listeners find Radio 3 \n‘slightly daunting at times’\n, Mr Wright has imported all the tricks of popular, downmarket broadcasting to he\nlp win over a new audience…\n&#xa0;\nPerhaps it will attract Classic FM listeners. But should the BBC be using public funds to provide a competitive alternative to a commercial station which has already staked out the territory as its own? Classic FM needs those l\nisteners to survive; the BBC does not. \n&#xa0;\nIn order to be less “intimidating”, Radio 3 has lowered its intellectual standards. Instead of critical insights, the guests, listeners, presenters, even performers, are encouraged to \nshare personal feelings, memori\nes and tastes. Musical anal\nysis\n has been reduced to the occ\nasional concert interval talk, t\nhe same truncated morsels of longer works are played and replayed.\n” \n&#xa0;\nThe Daily Telegraph reported on 1\nst\n September 2011 that:\n&#xa0;\n“Radio 3 is facing a growing backlash\n from listeners fed up with hearing the same pieces played repeatedly alongside an abundance \nof excerpts rather than entire works. Ardent classical music fans are becoming increasingly frustrated with the station’s attempts to appeal to the mass market by \ndiluting its content. Online message boards and forums have been buzzing with disquiet from listeners unimpressed with the steady influx of celebrity presenters, the regular phone-ins and audience participation.\n”&#xa0;\nMichael White wrote in the Daily Telegraph\n on 3\nrd\n September 2011 under the headline \n“\nRadio 3 is getting out of tune with its audience\n”\n:\n&#xa0;\n“In its search for that “wider public”, Radio 3 is edging ever closer to the comfortable banality of Classic FM. It uses celebrity presenters. It replaces inform\ned discussion with vacuous blather. It fills vast tracts of airtime with disc-jockey formats. It slips into Classic FM’s (commercially successful) routine of selling art as relaxation – as if Bach, Brahms and the other towering giants of music churned out \nall those notes for tired executives to sleep through. Needless to say, no one at Radio 3 would admit this. For them, Classic FM is the elephant in the room, its existence barely acknowledged, \nits influence denied. Roger Wright, the station’s controller, w\nill emphatically tell you that there’s no competition between the two, and no pressure for him to follow Classic’s lead. The truth is otherwise. Classic FM pulls an audience of around 5.7 million, while Radio 3 only manages 2.2 million. And that means pres\nsure – which Wright has never resisted with the vigour that certain of his predecessors (especially John Drummond) managed.\n” \n   \n&#xa0;\nOn 3\nrd\n October 2011, the Daily Telegraph radio critic Gillian Reynolds noted that\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n“[Roger] Wright can plead he is obeying \norders from the BBC Trust to reach new audiences by making Radio 3 less formal.\n” \n&#xa0;\nWhile \nthe Daily Mail reported on 21\nst\n September that \nBreakfast on Radio \n3\n…\n&#xa0;\n“…has become Radio 2.5,’ say listeners who accuse BBC of cultural vandalism… Many called for a \nreturn to ‘pure and simple good music’, while others criticised the station’s creep into commercial territory saying the breakfast show sounded increasingly like rival network Classic FM.\n” \n&#xa0;\nAnd o\nn 28\nth\n November 2013, Nicholas Lezard \nwrote\n in the New State\nsman\n about\n:\n&#xa0;\n              \n“The sad decline of Radio 3 into Classic FM without adverts”.\n&#xa0;\nWHAT DO RADIO 3 LISTENERS SAY?\n&#xa0;\nBetter to understand the views of BBC Radio 3’s listeners, Classic FM commissioned YouGov to undertake research with a p\nanel of 1,086 Radio 3 \nlisteners at the end of March 2012.\n \n&#xa0;\nYouGov notes that there are clear indications in this research that \n&#xa0;\n“...\nsome listeners perceive that Radio 3 is becoming less specialised in its output and on occasion may be seen as imitating the output of oth\ner sta\ntions such as Classic FM.\n”&#xa0;\nYouGov adds:\n&#xa0;\n“A\nmong those dissatisfied with Radio 3, there appears to be a perception that presenters now try to cater for an audience with less sophisticated tastes and no longer try as hard to intellectu\nally challenge the \naudience.\n”&#xa0;\nRadio 3’s remit is intended to extend far beyond being only a classical music station (unlike Classic FM, which only broadcasts classical music). However,\n the researchers comment that:\n&#xa0;\n“F\new listeners associate Radio 3 with representing jazz, d\nrama and religion well as part o\nf its overall remit i.e. this is\n the majority perception of where Radio 3 currently falls short. This implies that by over representing classical music, other, non-classical music based outputs are being und\ner represented.\n”&#xa0;Only 58% of Radio 3’s listeners regard the station as being “original” and just 48% say that it is “innovative”.\n&#xa0;\nThere is clear evidence in the research that Radio 3’s listeners believe that their station has recently moved closer to the output of Classi\nc FM, thereby reducing the choice \nof styles of classical music radio stations \navailable to them\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n“Radio 3 listeners enjoy the notion that this radio station specialises in classical music and appeals to a niche group of listeners, further echoed by close\n to 3 in 10 (29%) saying that the reason for their dissatisfaction is the dumbing down of content, trying to be more like Classic FM and\n playing more well-known music.\n”&#xa0;When YouGov questioned Radio 3 listeners specifically about the station’s programming \noutput, clear areas of dissatisfaction become apparent:\n&#xa0;\n“Around 1 in 4 listeners perceive that Radio 3 does not play enough specialist/rare recordings of classical music (24%) or live\n classical music concerts (24%).\n”&#xa0;\n“22% of listeners think that there ha\ns been a decline in the amount of less well known classical music that is played now compared to 12 months ago, with this increasing to 56% of dissatisfied listeners. 39% of listeners think that there is more popular classic\nal music being played (59% am\nong\n those that clai\nm that they will listen to less over the next 12 months and 64% among dissatisfied listeners), indicating a potential cause of their dissatisfaction.\n”&#xa0;\n“A quarter of all listeners have said that they have noticed a change to the frequency with which popular classics are played on Radio 3. Of these listeners, \n86% claim that they are playing more popular classical music on Radio 3.\n”&#xa0;“Amongst those less sati\nsfied with Radio 3 now compared to 12 months ago, 56% say that the quality of less well known classical music is lower compared to 12 months ago, while 44% think that the quality of popular classical music is lower compared to 12 months ago and 23% think t\nhe quality for contemporary classical music is lower.\n”&#xa0;\nYouGov also looked at Radio 3 listeners’ perceptions of the station’s non-classical music output – an important part of the station’s remit. 50% of listeners fee\nl that Radio 3 is representing R\neligion\n poorly; 38% say feel that the station is representing Drama poorly; 31% believe th\nat J\nazz \nis represented\n poorly; \n26% believe that W\norld Music is represented poorly; and 19% believe that Arts and Ideas are represented poorly.\n \n&#xa0;\nWhen it comes to the amount \nof non-classical music broadcast on Radio 3, 27% of listeners feel not enough Jazz is being played; 22% of listeners feel not enough World Music is being played; 21% believe not enough Drama is being broadcast; 20% believe not enough Literature is featured\n and 19% believe that there is not enough Educational Content on the station. \n&#xa0;\nAs part of YouGov’s research into the BBC Radio 3 audience\n carried out in March 2012\n, the station’s listeners were offered t\nhe opportunity to make open-ended \nobservations about\n the station’s programming. Many of these centred on the perception that BBC Radio 3’s output had moved towards th\nat of its commercial competitor:\n&#xa0;\n“In trying to appeal more to the traditional Classic FM listener, you’re alienating a lot of your dedicated listeners. I know a lot of people who used to listen to Radio 3 through most of the day and now regularly turn it off \nwhen it becomes too populist\n.\n”&#xa0;“Stop trying to copy other radio stations. Radio 3 stood out from the rest a few years ago. Why do you feel the need to imitate Classic FM or Radio 2? I deliberately choose Radio 3 over Classic FM. Stop worrying about ratings and put the money into what y\nou do best.\n”&#xa0;“Go back to being a station specialising in authoritative ways of playing and talking about classical music, and stop all the dumbing down.\n”&#xa0;“More excerpts rather than fuller pieces. Radio 3 should not try to become Classic FM.\n”&#xa0;&#xa0;\nTHE BBC TR\nUST’S RESPONSE TO RADIO 3’s CHANGES\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC Management’s decision to make these changes \n- and \nthe BBC Trust’s decision to wave them thr\nough - has\n, in each case, served to reduce the choice of listening available to audiences.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC Trust’s Service \nReview of\n BBC Radio 3, published in February\n 2011, admits that:\n&#xa0;\n“…over recent years, BBC management has made changes to Radio 3 in order to make the station more accessible and welcoming to potential listeners, particularly in peak-time slots (breakfast a\nnd drive) as these are the key entry points for potential listeners.\n” \n&#xa0;\nHowever, we would argue that BBC Radio 3’s management is plotting a course\n firmly towards the increasing\n popularisation of the service and a dilution of its core public service output.\n Crucially, these changes erode the choice available to listeners.  This view was echoed in submissions to the BBC Trust’s Service Review consultation by the Friends of Radio 3, \nby \nthe Voice of the Listener and Viewer, and \nby \nthe Incorporated Society of Mu\nsicians. \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC Trust acknowledged that:\n&#xa0;\n“BBC management…has changed the nature of the programmes during these hours.\n”&#xa0;\nAlthough, the BBC Trust then goes on to describe this as:\n&#xa0;\n              \n“Legitimate.\n”&#xa0;\nWe \ndisagree. T\nhe cumulative effect of the \nalterations \nmade to BBC Radio 3’s output, \nwhen taken collectively\n, constitute a significant change to the service\n.\n \nUnder its own rules, the BBC Trust should have undertaken a Public Value Test, includ\ning a market impact assessment before allowing BBC Management to und\nertake such a radical overhaul of one of its national networks. \n&#xa0;\nIt is clear from the responses to BBC Radio 3’s programming outlined above \n(and there are many, many more similar – and some rather more trenchant – views in chatrooms online) that the liste\nning public, critics and\n commentators have\n taken a very differen\nt view of these changes than that put forward by\n \nthe \nBBC Trust.  \n&#xa0;\nRather than pushing for BBC Radio 3 to maintain its distinctiveness, the BBC Trust’s Service Review instead appears to have a\nctively encouraged Radio 3 to become \nmore like Classic FM. \nIn\n a market of \njust \ntwo \nclassical music radio stations in the UK, the BBC has significantly changed the output on Radio 3 in pursuit of audiences, rather than with the aim of offering distinctive and original programming content. This lessening of distinctiveness is particula\nrly stark in the key morning dayparts, when listening to classical music on the radio reaches the largest number of people. \n&#xa0;\nBack in 1992, \nClassic FM introduced a new way of broadcasting classical music on UK radio. It complemented the style and content o\nf BBC Radio 3’s output at the time, providing a real point of difference. Given Classic FM’s success in building audiences for classical music radio, \ntwenty years later, \nthe BBC now appears to have decided to ape its commercial co\nmpetitor, abandoning much \nof the\n distinctiveness in peak\n-\ntime\n \nhours in the process. \n&#xa0;\nNo doubt, BBC Management will point to BBC Radio 3’s commitment to specialist off-peak programming, but \nby so starkly changing\n \nBBC Radio 3’s programming to that of\n a ‘ratings by day, reputation by\n night’ strategy in a market place\n of \njust \ntwo, repres\ne\nn\nts a potentially serious threat to the ability of Classic FM to operate \nas an \neffective commercial competitor. Classic FM is virtually unique in the classical music world in never having received a pe\nnny of public subsidy to fund its work; it also does not enjoy the certainty of a fixed income from the Licence Fee. \n  \n&#xa0;\nNot only did the BBC Trust fail to implement a Public Value Test\n into the BBC Management’s changes to Radio 3’s output\n, but it also fai\nled to abide by its own ‘Competitive Impact Policy’, which requires the BBC ‘to minimise its negative competitive impacts on the wider market’.\n&#xa0;\nThe BBC Trust is obliged under the terms of the BBC Agreement with DCMS to undertake a Public Value Test before\n a decision is taken to make a significant ch\nange to a BBC service. Although this is a decision for the Trust, the BBC Agreement requires the Trust before exercising its judgement to ‘investigate or otherwise inform itself of any facts or considerations wh\nich it considers potentially relevant’.\n&#xa0;\nIt appears that no such investigation took place. \nRadioCentre \nrequested further detail \nfrom the BBC \non the proposed strategy to make Radio 3 more accessible and welcoming under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 \n(Letter, 24\nth\n February, 2011). In its re\ns\nponse to the request, the BBC said:\n&#xa0;\n“The BBC did not undertake a significance assessment of making Radio 3 more accessible and welcoming. This is because it is not a new proposal, but ‘business as usual’: BBC Manag\nement has been seeking for some time to make its content more accessible and welcoming, and will continue to strive to do so. As such, no significance assessment was required.\n”&#xa0;\nThis would suggest that the BBC Trust did not believe that a Public Value Test\n was appropriate because the change\ns made to BBC Radio 3 took place \nover a period of time, rather than at one single moment. However, the BBC Trust’s own protocols state that:\n&#xa0;\n“A series of minor changes to a service licence may, cumulatively, require the \nTrust to consider whether a further regulatory approvals process, such as a Public Value Test, is required.\n” \n              \n&#xa0;\nNot only should a Public Value Test have been undertaken, but also in failing to undertake a ‘significance assessment’ at all, the BBC Trust did\n not abide by the terms of the BBC Agreement with DCMS. \n&#xa0;\nThere must be an overhaul of how BBC radio services are held accountable for their remit. As set out in the submission fr\nom\n our parent company, Global Radio, a new set of duties that take precedence\n over the BBC’s public purposes will ensure BBC services do not encroach on their private sector competitors. \n&#xa0;\nBBC \nRadio 3, along with all BBC radio services, must have a tighter remit in future for which management are accountable. This new remit must re\nassert \nBBC \nRadio\n \n3’s duty to play specialist music throughout the schedule and ensure that the station does not duplicate content available on commercial services. \n&#xa0;\nA CHANGE OF BRAND POSITIONING\n&#xa0;\nClassic FM’s pure classical music proposition has been highly successful in building new audiences for the genre. \n&#xa0;\nAs the \nBBC \nRadio 3 programming output continues \nto be allowed \ngradually to creep away from its responsibilities to non-classical music genre\ns and peak\n-\ntime\n \ncoverage of speech-based arts programme, the station now appears to be publicly acknowledging this move for the first time in its brand proposition.\n&#xa0;\nDuring 2013, it has \nchanged its brand strapline to ‘The Home of Classical Music’\n. Gone is \nany mention of other cultural or arts activities from its public-facing messaging.\n&#xa0;\nThis move in itself is worthy of investigation by the BBC Trust. Sadly, once again, the Trustees do not appear to be concerned about \nBBC \nRadio 3’s downgrading of the statio\nn’s responsibilities to support wider arts and cultural programming. Once again, it appears that \nBBC \nRadio 3 is being encouraged to use its public funding to chase ratings b\ny broadcasting classical music, which is well served by a commercial competitor\n, at\n the expense of the promotion of other music genres, which are not well-served by the commercial radio sector. \n&#xa0;A QUESTION OF COST&#xa0;&#xa0;\nYet further significant changes to BBC Radio 3’s programming output \nwere discussed\n in the \nDelivering Quality First \ndocument, which was published by the BBC in October 2011. \n&#xa0;\nThese include\nd\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEach of these changes represents a furth\ner dilution of the essence that makes BB\nC Radio 3’s output distinctive from that of Classic FM. These changes further compound the radical nature of programming changes to the station. \n&#xa0;\nGiven these \nfu\nrther changes to BBC Radio 3\n’s output and the public re\nsponse to the changes, which have already taken place, it would be an appropriate moment for the BBC Trust to follow the procedures which it itself put in place and to undertake a full Public Value Test\n at the earliest opportunity\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe latest round of \nprogramming changes have been blamed on the need for the BBC to reduce costs. However, an analysis of the BBC’s annual report suggests that BBC Radio 3\n has an annual programme content \nbudget of £38.3 million\n. \nIt additionally spends £5.3 million on distribu\ntion, with a further £10.7 million spent on infrastructure and support. The BBC defines this latter figure as including: Property; HR; Policy and Strategy; Finance and Operations; and Marketing. It is important to note that these figures do not include the\n cost of newsgathering or of BBC Radio 3’s online digital services, which are accounted for separately. \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC orchestras and performing groups receive total funding of £23.4 million per annum for content, with a further £5.8 million of infrastructure a\nnd support funding. \n&#xa0;\nWhen added together, BBC Radio 3 and the BBC orchestras and performing groups spend £61.7 million on content, £5.3 million on distribution and £16.5 million on infrastructure and support – giving a grand total of £83.5 million of expe\nnditure in the 2012-13 financial year – an increase of \n£2 million on the previous year. \n&#xa0;\nThis is a huge amount of money. \nBBC \nRadio 3 cited the need to cut costs as the reason for the reduction in its commitment to specialist music programming from Septemb\ner 2013. However, given the scale of public money at \nBBC \nRadio 3’s disposal, there must surely be concern that the service is operating with a huge level of inefficiency for it not to be able to contain overall costs at a level that allowed these programme\ns to continue. \nFor this to be the case, we find it hard to believe that the stringent cost controls that would be in place in the commercial sector – out of commercial necessity - can possibly be being applied to a service that relies on a high level of gu\naranteed public subsidy via the Licence Fee. \n&#xa0;\nIt should also be noted that the live classical music market place already sees publicly funded orchestras in the geographic regions where the BBC funds additional orchestras. This is particularly the case in \nLondon, Manchester and Glasgow\n, where it could be argued that the Licence Fee duplicates provision already funded via Arts Council England and the Scottish Government. \n&#xa0;\nTHE CONCENTRATION OF POWER&#xa0;Nowhere in the broadcasting or the arts world does\n so much power to spend such a large amount of public money rest in the hands of a single individual.\n&#xa0;\nThe Controller of Radio 3 is responsible for the UK’s biggest broadcaster of live classical music; the biggest commissioner of classical music; the UK’s \nbiggest classical music festival (the BBC Proms); and responsibility for no fewer than five orchestras. \n&#xa0;\nTo concentrate so much power in the hands of one individual\n \nhas the potential to create\n an abuse of \nthis market dominant position.\n \nWe \nremain concerned\n that this does not represent\n \nthe best\n system for\n stewardship of a significa\nnt amount of licence fee money – and nor is it in the best interests o\nf creating a plural and diverse classical music ecosystem in the UK. \n&#xa0;\nL\nicence \nfunding in this area \nshould be \nopen to competition \nto enable commercial operators to broadcast\n classical music concerts\n that are already funded or subsidised through Arts Council investment, perhaps through the creation of a ‘public service content publisher’ model, funded by a proporti\non of the licence fee.\n \n&#xa0;\nAdditionally, we are concerned that the creation in 2012 of The Space by the BBC and the Arts Council effectively creates a new publicly funded BBC service by the backdoor, without the usual checks and balances that are applied to the introduction of a new\n BBC channel. This \nintroduces \na new level of \npublicly subsidised \ncompetition to the classical music broadcasting marketplace that did not previously ex\nist. Given the move towards wider digital distribution of radio services, a brand new online channel supp\nor\nted through Licence Fee funding\n should not be regarded in isolation, but should be seen as being a part of the overall media marketplace. \n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSION&#xa0;&#xa0;\nBBC \nRadio\n \n3 offers a unique service\n, which adds enormous value on the occasions that it broadcasts content that is not served well by its commercial competitor. \nIn these instances, it is a cultural gem which is rightly cherished – and which is deserving of its significant public funding.\n&#xa0;\nH\nowever, t\nhere is clear evidence that programming changes to BBC Radio 3 cumulatively constitute a significant alteration to the station’s on-air output\n which is undermining listener choice and value for money for the licence fee payer\n. \n&#xa0;\nThis view is not only held by \nClassic FM and its parent company, \nGlobal Radio. It has been commented upon widely in the press and both quantitative and qualitative independent research supports this assertion.\n Indeed, the view that \nBBC \nRadio 3’s output now\n apes that of Classic FM for much of the day has reached a crescendo. \n&#xa0;\nBeyond 2016, a new set of public duties for the BBC and a new remit for \nBBC \nRadio\n \n3 must reverse and prevent further incursion of the service into commercial, populist territory. \n&#xa0;\nFai\nlure to do so would allow BBC Management to continue to manoeuvre BBC Radio 3 away from its core remit, supported by the privilege \nof its generous public funding, further towards that of its commercial competitor.\n In future, station management must be held\n to account for a more detailed remit focused on delivering distinct public service content. To carry on as now \nwould result in further erosion in listener choice and the UK’s broadcasting landscape would be the poorer for it. \n&#xa0;\nWe would encourage the C\nult\nure, Media and Sport Select C\nommittee\n \nto examine ways in which these issues can be both monitored and controlled as \nany new funding agreement\n is negotiated. \nIt is clear that the existing control mechanisms are both inadequate and open to abuse. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
