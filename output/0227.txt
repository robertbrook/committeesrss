[[[Home Office Chief Scientific Adviser’s Review of Research and Development in Forensic Science]]]Following the announcement by the Government that the FSS would close, the Home Office Chief Scientific Adviser (Professor Bernard Silverman) was asked by Home Office Ministers, to review the UK’s current and future landscape of forensic science research and development. &#xa0;The results of the forensic science review were published on 30 June 2011 and made eight recommendations which focused on ensuring:&#xa0;&#xa0;Good progress has been made in taking forward the recommendations from this review: &#xa0;

[[[Communication ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Forensic Science Providers (FSPs), such as LGC Forensics report participation in a number of national and international conferences, presenting the opportunity to speak directly to the (mainly) academic community. This level of interaction between a major service provider and the academic community helps ensure that academic research is rooted in an end-point of practical application.  The Home Office’s Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST) is actively involved in discussions with academic institutions in order to encourage cross-academic departmental activity that responds to public safety priorities. A number of institutions attended the Forensic Science Society’s (FSSoc) Education and Industry forum where presenters from the end user community were discussing issues with potential research and development partners.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Regulator is working with the judiciary to develop a series of draft “primers” on forensic issues. The first topic of consideration is DNA profiling.  This is a complex area and so, rather than a single primer, a series of short primers addressing each facet of the DNA process is being developed. This approach should allow deliberation of any particular area of the process which might be the subject of dispute.&#xa0;&#xa0;During 2011, National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) (now part of the Home Office) led wide ranging discussions with researchers, providers, users and professional bodies.  The focus of these discussions was to improve communication within the forensic science research landscape.  As a result, a series of national conferences have been agreed. The first was held in November 2012, titled “Forensic Horizons: Promoting Awareness of Research and Development International”, and attracted some 200 delegates. A further conference is planned for 2013, and aims to increase participation substantially.  Planning for these has been led by the FSSoc with close involvement by the Forensic Regulator.  In addition, discussion has taken place between the Forensic Regulator and the Australia and New Zealand Forensic Science Society (regarding their plan to hold a four day conference in Adelaide in 2014); the Forensic Regulator believes that by 2015 the UK may be able to host a similar international conference.&#xa0;

[[[Research and development]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;To review the levels (and appropriateness) of the research and development being carried out by FSPs, the Forensic Policy Group (formerly Forensic Transition Board) has written out to FSPs for an update.  Important examples of recent innovation from the market have been described in the main response.  Appendix B, to the Home Office submission contains further details about those examples, along with other illustrations of research and development being carried out by UK FSPs.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Forensic Regulator is working closely with leading professional bodies such as the FSSoc and Fingerprint Society, to develop their roles as leaders in providing linkages and information sources. CAST is also supporting the FSSoc in developing their ability to respond to emerging priority areas of work, and assisting them in making the clear distinction between end user driven requirements and established scientific research.&#xa0;Since the closure of the Forensic Science Service the Regulator has taken responsibility for the UK representation on the Interpol planning committee for their triennial conference (to be held 2013) and review of forensic science research.  The abstracts from this conference will be treated as open source documents and will be published on the Regulator’s web-site.&#xa0;In addition, in order to foster international relations, the Regulator and his team have attended international conferences in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  The consensus (between UK, US, European and Australian delegates) is on a need to collaborate internationally on forensic research issues and to this end the Regulator has received a first draft of Australian research expectations. He will also lead the UK delegation at the European CEN forensic science project. This committee has been established to oversee the production of European standards for forensic science and is a key opportunity to influence research across Europe to underpin the validity of forensic science methods.&#xa0;More widely FSPs, such as LGC Forensics, report establishing strong links with UK academic institutes. In addition, membership of the Association of Forensic Providers ensures collaboration with other UK FSPs to work collaboratively for example within the Body Fluid Forum which ensures the dissemination of best practice across all UK FSPs. Participation in European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFIS) is another mechanism through which best practice is shared.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;HEFCE have appointed assessors to provide specialist advice on forensic science research and have added a number of professional forensic science bodies to their Nominating Bodies for the Research Excellence Framework.  &#xa0;and&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Following Home Office led discussion with Research Council UK, the TSB announced earlier this year that it would establish a Forensic Science (SIG).  The SIG was formally launched at the Forensic Horizons Conference held in Nov 2012.  Though still under development the initial aims of the SIG are:&#xa0;&#xa0;In addition the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council have been in discussion with CAST and the Forensic Regulator on how they can support forensic science in line with their strategic priorities.&#xa0;The NPIA (now Home Office) have been working with Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to identify three key strategic work streams and user requirements for the priority areas for policing (crime scene examination, forensic processes in custody and personal identification).  This has resulted in the recent ACPO publication “Harnessing Science and Innovation for Forensics Investigation in Policing:  Live-time Forensics” document which outlines these strategic priority areas for industry and academia.&#xa0;Appendix B

[[[Innovation and Research in the provision of forensic services ]]]As a long-established science company we are highly committed to identifying, developing and introducing new methodologies and technologies and have many links with academia and industry to facilitate and maximise the contribution we are able to make to forensic science. We select areas on which to focus from our own extensive casework experience, and from ideas generated in discussions with our customers, and with academic and industry colleagues. We also regularly review our own internal processes to identify where a new approach or new or different instrumentation might streamline our services with cost and/or time savings, or quality improvements (e.g. in discrimination) that can be passed on to our customers. &#xa0;So far as our pipeline of new developments is concerned, these fall into 4 main categories, namely: DNA, Trace evidence, Searching and Time association with crime activities. &#xa0;Our DNA research activities themselves fall into four key areas: Identification of body fluids associated with DNA; DNA sampling and extraction; DNA transferred on textile fibres; and, Fast DNA. These distinct categories each address some of the key issues we face in DNA profiling and supplement our continuing ongoing development in our DNA unit – which primarily focuses on improved method and kit development. &#xa0;Trace evidence analysis highlights some important areas for improvement to eliminate traditional bottle necks and other historical problems associated with delivery of forensic services, some which have proved so off-putting to some Police Forces on cost and/or timeliness grounds that valuable evidence types are increasingly being overlooked. We are looking at advances in technology and how these could be combined in order to overcome some of these issues. Through important collaborations with industrial specialists in this area we are exploring how we might harness this service to identify and evaluate forensic traces of the type we sometimes see in surface debris. One of the key activities in forensic science is being able to search for and find forensic evidence. We are currently working on several projects which focus on the ability to search slides and tapings for evidence such as spermatozoa or textile fibres respectively. Searching activities can be very time consuming and we are working with various organisations both academic and industrial so we can develop the best science strategy for each of these. &#xa0;We are involved in a Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Union for the funding of research and technology. We are working with the University of Huddersfield as well as a number of other European collaborations to offer a research and training programme to PhD students. This research project is separated into several work packages relating to time association of crime activities, for example stain age identification for Blood Pattern Analysis and identifying the age of individuals from skeletal and radiological information. We are the industrial link in the extensive European collaboration able to offer training and practical support to the students whilst advancing forensic science capabilities in this area. &#xa0;In addition to the industrial collaborations already mentioned and working with the University of Huddersfield we are actively involved with a number of other Universities within the UK in order to build and develop our research capability. As part of our expansion strategy we have recently opened a North Eastern laboratory based within the UK Government Central Science Laboratory (the Food and Environment Research Agency – Fera). One of the main reasons we decided to locate on this site was the ready access it provides to a vast scientific expertise and instrumentation. Much of this is directly relevant to forensic science and, working with them, we are developing ways of converting some of the technologies to the benefit of all stakeholders in criminal justice. &#xa0;Forensic Access currently invests approximately 9% of turnover on Research and Development. We have a dedicated member of staff who manages and develops our research portfolio along with input which is encouraged from all members of staff within the company. In addition we have a non-executive director who not only has extremely strong credentials in research and development but his background will ensure that forensic science can learn from other associated sciences from across Europe. We also call upon other highly experienced forensic scientists and researchers to help with specific projects when they are required. &#xa0;&#xa0;Report prepared by:               Dr Philip Avenell Forensic Principal, Forensic Access &#xa0;Forensic Focus LtdLatest research and development projects are 1) Proficiency Testing Scheme for Finger Mark Development and Finger and Footwear Mark Identification with Staffordshire University 2)Fingerprint Identification Project with Lincoln University the details of which cannot be disclosed at this time 3) Fingerprint Management Project with Wolverhampton University, the details of which cannot be disclosed at this time 4) Supervision of several&#xa0;under and post graduate research projects There is no financial investment only time, knowledge and experience.

[[[Forensic Focus Ltd]]]Forensic Medicine and Science&#xa0;The research carried out within FMS is entirely related to the field of forensic toxicology. Research interests range from developing methods for the analysis of new designer drugs or new prescription medication to investigating the use of alternative matrices as a tool in drug facilitated crime. &#xa0;On-going projects within FMS which require further investigation include:·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The stability of drugs and alcohol under different storage conditions;·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Development of broad drug screening methods;·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Investigating oral fluid as an alternative matrix (e.g. roadside drug testing);·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Investigating alcohol biomarkers in alternative matrices·&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Interpretation of drug concentrations in post-mortem samples&#xa0;Over the past 18 months we have invested over £200,000 in new instrumentation so that our research staff and doctoral students can carry out research on state-of-the-art equipment which is directly aligned with our service laboratory. We have recently employed two part-time trainee toxicologists&#xa0;whom we hope to enrol part-time on&#xa0;our&#xa0;doctoral programme. This will result in a further £25,000 annual investment in research.&#xa0;The development of methods for many new designer drugs and prescription medications has had a direct impact on the completion of casework and the subsequent publications have helped other laboratories to expand their testing capabilities both in the UK and worldwide.&#xa0;As a service provider and an academic institute, the links are intrinsically, although not exclusively in-house. Glasgow University is a research-led teaching institute and the research carried out within FMS is primarily focused on improving the forensic toxicology service we provide by helping us to better understand and interpret casework findings. Our students carry out research projects that will benefit our service laboratory and other Forensic Toxicology laboratories worldwide. Both staff and students are encouraged to attend national and international conferences to present our research findings.&#xa0;The senior toxicology staff within FMS are professional members of&#xa0;the UK &amp; Ireland Association of Forensic Toxicologists and are directly involved with setting industry standards her in the UK, Europe and Worldwide.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Key Forensic Services&#xa0;During the reporting period ending 30 April 2012 KFS expended £369k on specific R&amp;D related projects, representing 5.5% of the company’s turnover for the same period. This expenditure was made across a variety of projects as detailed below, the largest project being the Laboratory Information Management Systems and Force Major Incident Team compliance requirement project (an NPIA project to standardise the capture of data relating to the quantity and type of work submitted by police forces under contract) which was carried over from the previous year. &#xa0;Towards the end of 2011/12 KFS commenced classifying expenditure on the RapidHIT human DNA profiling instrument as R&amp;D. The RapidHIT project will run throughout 2012/13 and possibly in to 2013/14 and will likely comprise the largest R&amp;D project for 2012/13. We anticipate R&amp;D expenditure will continue to grow in value terms, probably in line with the previous year’s percentage of sales for at least 2012/13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Paul Hackett]]]Group Managing DirectorKey Forensic Services Ltd&#xa0;LGC Forensics&#xa0;Recent Tender responses submitted under the Framework Agreement have highlighted that LGC continues to invest in R&amp;D activity in a considered but effective manner.  Our desire is both to enhance those services we currently offer (making them more reliable, faster and more cost-effective), but also staying abreast of operational changes that we are obliged to make in response to legislation, and those other innovations we identify as being of greatest potential benefit to the Criminal Justice System.&#xa0;We can currently identify significant development projects in the disciplines of Drugs, Toxicology, Body Fluids analysis and of course DNA analysis.&#xa0;LGC Forensics is extremely fortunate to benefit from cross-Divisional collaboration with our ‘Sister Divisions’ of LGC Genomics, LGC Science and Technology and LGC Health Sciences all conducting their own R&amp;D programs that can have application in the Forensics Division. R&amp;D activity between the Forensics and Genomics Divisions in particular has now started to involve international collaboration, although with the caveat that the practical application of some of this work may be hindered by legislative issues (Next Generation DNA Sequencing).&#xa0;We manage the prioritisation of our Innovation Pipeline through a dedicated knowledge management team and senior management oversight and approval of specific project work.  Innovation is gathered from all of our staff through an intranet portal called ‘iThink’.  Ideas from this source and other routes populate our Innovation Pipeline, for consideration by either the Strategy Group (large investment, radically new technologies and new business opportunities) or the Delivery Group (more operationally focused or smaller investment projects).  Consideration is also given to the ethical and legislative landscape, influencing whether operational and technical developments that are achievable would actually be permissible in the UK at the moment.  Concerns over this issue are certainly delaying our development of certain technically achievable advances at the moment, such as introduction of improved STR biochemistries, or the application of ‘Next Generation DNA Sequencing’ to aid forensic investigation.&#xa0;Where it is not possible to fund projects of merit in isolation, and ideally where collaborators can be identified that have either Intellectual Property or technical capability required for successful R&amp;D, we seek to build these mutually beneficial collaborations. &#xa0;Across the Forensics Division, we can account for a total R&amp;D spend of £3.4M in this financial year.  This figure consist of both large projects (such as ParaDNA and DNA Insight, see below), the development of Strategic Projects  and smaller Operational (Delivery Group) Projects.&#xa0;Our DNA-focused projects are resourced from dedicated R&amp;D staff, comprising (all projects considered) in excess of 30 individuals.  5 scientists and management are employed directly in our standing DNA R&amp;D Team, whereas other non-DNA related projects are resourced through the secondment of suitably qualified individuals from casework delivery roles&#xa0;This figure of £3.4M must be viewed in the light that LGC’s revenues in Forensic Science was £41M in the last financial year.&#xa0;Our most significant investment in R&amp;D is our ParaDNA product, which brings together a novel DNA sampling technology with LGC-created biochemistry, analysed on an instrument that has been designed and optimised in house, with automated software to carry out the final results analyses.  Together, this system allows operators with only minimal training to collect analyse and assess DNA evidence in a decentralised (non-laboratory) environment.  This project is now coming to fruition with recent placement of the first instruments into (in the first instance) non-UK jurisdictions.&#xa0;The preliminarily application of ParaDNA technology allows police forces to evaluate the suitability of potential DNA evidence before it is submitted for laboratory analysis.&#xa0; This ‘sample triage’ can, by identifying items that are unlikely to produce useable profiles, allow forces to prioritise those items that are most likely to produce a useful result and, thereby, avoid the expense of unnecessary laboratory work.  A second application of the technology allows for the assessment of biological material to a higher degree of ‘person specificity’ allowing matching of material to suspects to a level believed to aid the investigative process.  This ‘field deployable’ unit is at its core the same instrumentation, but in a format that supplies a self contained power source and onboard PC in a ruggedized housing.&#xa0;A second significant project that we invest in is the implementation and continued development of a DNA analysis computer software system we acquired from the FSS, called FSS DNA Insight.  We are committed to the ongoing development of this groundbreaking software, which enables seamless analysis of very complex DNA profiles, originating from more than one contributor.  The operational deployment of this software within LGC Forensics is scheduled for February 2013, by which time it will have been validated and accredited by the National DNA Database Assurance Services (NAS) and by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).&#xa0;Other activity in non-DNA fields is being made with our ongoing assessment of novel psychoactive drugs using ‘accurate mass’ spectrometry, and the more efficient screening of a panel of drugs and drug metabolites using LC-MS in Toxicology.  We are also developing supporting technologies for allied operations such as improved evidence recovery and secure long term storage.  &#xa0;We have signed CDA’s with three of the UKs most respected academic forensic departments, and we host a number of MSc Students from these institutions each year.  In the last year, 5 students were accommodated and contributed to both fundamental research projects (eg ParaDNA and its application to sexual assault investigations) and also to more operationally-focused projects (the use of ‘gender markers to indicate the relative contributions to a mixture’ and validation of a technique for the ‘analysis of Beta HydroxyButerate ‘).  &#xa0;We are in discussion with one of these institutions at the moment about the potential to collaborate on two novel projects that, although regarded as important at LGC, represent projects that are not guaranteed of success, and will require a high degree of basic research.  As they are not projects that we regard as having near-term implementation, these sit most comfortably within the academic arena in the first instance, but the need to ensure these projects stay on a trajectory that leads most definitely to operational deployment is essential.  These projects will potentially require the support of an MRes (Masters by Research) degree in the first instance, perhaps developing to something more substantial, such as a PhD.&#xa0;In addition to working on ‘higher risk/ long term’ projects with academia, we recognise that the CJS has as much of a need for ‘mundane’ R&amp;D to be performed such as counting the background incidence of a particular textile fibre type in public areas; essential if we are to speak with confidence on the significance of finding this fibre type in the course of an investigation.  Such work must be supported for the benefit of the CJS.  We do engage in such work, and have an academic collaboration on this very subject with Northumbria University.  Far from glamorous research, but absolutely essential.&#xa0;The operational expertise that exists within LGC Forensics is a valuable resource for those companies who supply consumables into the forensic marketplace.  Unsurprisingly we have collaborations with international companies who supply the reagents we currently utilise, and who’s next generation of products we can advise upon from an ‘operational desirability’ standpoint.  This operational knowledge has recently resulted in a significant change in the formulation of one globally supplied reagent; a change that makes the reagent more effective in our labs and will we believe result in a higher success rate with the processing of challenging DNA samples. &#xa0;Steve AllenManaging DirectorLGC ForensicsManlove Forensics&#xa0;

[[[Randox Laboratories Ltd / Randox Testing Services: Provision of Forensic Services.]]]Founded 30 years ago, the Randox Group of companies has been a supplier of forensic analytical products and services for over 10 years. The Group is committed to maintain the highest possible standard of forensic analysers and consumables as well as analytical services available to the forensic community and law enforcement agencies.  Randox is constantly striving to move forward the frontiers of science by developing innovative analytical platforms and novel tests to help expand the knowledge gained from of clinical and forensic specimens in the shortest time possible. 

[[[Investment.]]]In order to achieve these goals, Randox have always made significant commitments to research and development. One hundred and ninety nine staff are employed in R&amp;D and expenditure for 2012 is estimated to be above £10 million by year end - re-invested directly into research and development across a wide range of disciplines including engineering, software development, molecular biology, antibody development, chemistry, biochemistry and immunology. The inter-departmental interactions allows for the development of products tailored for the requirements of forensic laboratories – a fact demonstrated at Randox’s own dedicated Testing Services forensic laboratory based in Crumlin, Northern Ireland.

[[[Innovation.]]]Randox demonstrated its innovative ability by being awarded the MacRobert Award for Innovation in Engineering in the design of the Randox Evidence biochip analyser. This was awarded by The Royal Academy of Engineering – along with a quote that Evidence ‘will make a significant contribution to society’.Randox is currently working with the Technology Strategy Board to continue to develop the Evidence Multistat analyser. Following a successful phase I feasibility study in which Randox demonstrated the equipment’s capability of simultaneously testing for the presence of 13 drugs from a single oral fluid sample, Randox are in the process of building a prototype device with the aim of cutting testing time from 20 minutes to eight minutes. Randox has its own Life Sciences division allowing us to provide our customers with an extensive range of Drugs of Abuse testing options. This capability also allows us to react very quickly to new or emerging drugs and develop testing solutions to meet police forces changing needs throughout the lifetime of any contract. For example Randox was the first company to develop and market a laboratory screen for the synthetic drug Spice when it first manifested itself as a new drug of abuse, which very rapidly became popular across Europe and the US.

[[[Collaborations.]]]In order to maintain its position within science, Randox have always had close collaborations with many academic institutions. This includes secondments with the Medical University of Vienna (Alzheimer’s disease research), post-graduate sponsorships at the Schools of Forensic and Biological Sciences, Bournemouth University and Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Dundee.There have also been a significant number of collaborative projects with medical and commercial institutions. These include cardiac and cerebral research programmes at St James Hospital, Dublin; Leeds General Infirmary and McMaster University, Ontario to name but a few. There are also a number of on-going collaborations which are currently commercially sensitive so cannot be disclosed at this time.Randox has always maintained close links with all facets of science and are regular top-tier sponsors at all major biochemistry and forensic science conferences around the world. Links with end-users is a vital part of the business and will continue to keep Randox at the front of the drug-testing business.&#xa0;Roar Forensics&#xa0;We have an on-going policy for research and development, primarily relating to the necessity for analytical toxicology to keep up with the ever changing invention, availability and nature of drugs. A particular example is new "designer drugs" (see below). The company's primary concept of R&amp;D is casework led; in that it is not uncommon to have to develop new methods of detection or measurement for drugs. Therefore, this is largely an ad hoc process but involves the use of Forensic Analysts and the&#xa0;adaptation&#xa0;of various analytical techniques. We are not necessarily in a position to invent a totally new technology that may be the case in other disciplines but have a great deal of experience in adapting, applying and enhancing existing techniques over and above our toxicology competitors. The company has long had a policy of ensuring we obtain and invest in the latest techniques (see below). In the last 18 months we have been the industrial partner in a government supported Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) scheme with Wolverhampton University. This has specifically allowed the recruitment of a "KTP Associate" graduate staff member who's sole role has been to further develop existing analytical methods as well as develop new ones to enable us to provide the widest level of ISO17025 accredited toxicological analysis in the UK. Further, we have worked with equipment manufacturers to test their latest analytical techniques and apply them to the discipline of forensic toxicology. This has been recently successful for designer drug detection, drugs and alcohol in hair testing and specialist cannabis and cocaine analysis to provide some indication as to the profile of use. Furthermore, we have supported the on-going education of some staff for post graduate degrees (e.g. MSc Toxicology) as well as MPhil and PhDs in Toxicology, the latter looking at the role of alternative matrices (i.e. not just blood or urine) in toxicology with the former looking at latent drug metabolites that may allow the extension of detection windows for drugs - which has a particular application to drug facilitated sexual assault casework where the victim may not provide specimens for testing until days after the incident.&#xa0;As indicated above, as the R&amp;D we undertake is largely ad hoc and forms part of our usual case investigation requirements for HM Coroners and the Police, it is difficult to separate this from "normal" costs. However, we invested £220,000 in obtaining an LC-accurate mass-spectrometer (LC-QTOF-MS) to enhance unknown drug screening, detect and identify new designer drugs and assist in the latent metabolite work for increasing drug detection windows. &#xa0;This is in addition to an imminent intention to obtain a GC-MS-MS system (for the hair, cocaine and cannabis work) equating to ~£100,000. Furthermore, we have supported a King's College London studentship for drug hair analysis which is £24,000 over 4 years (we are about to enter Year 3) on top of the KTP commitment of ~£17,000 per year.&#xa0;I would like to particularly highlight our success in new designer drug detection and identification that has proved invaluable in numerous case examples (HM Coroners and Police), leading to assisting in determining the cause of death as well as criminal proceedings in some cases that would not have been progressed by the CPS without our evidence. &#xa0;We were the first in the UK and sometimes the World to report the detection in biological fluid, fatalities and casework for some designer drugs; notably 5-MeO-DALT, MDAI, methiopropamine, methoxetamine, 4-methylamphetamine, alpha-methyltryptamine, synthetic cannabinoids. For instance, our work led me to be invited to attend the European Union Risk Assessment meeting for 4-methylamphetamine (Lisbon, Nov 2012) as a member of the extended scientific committee - not for the first time, along with assisting the World Health Organization (WHO) with their drug review process for International Control.&#xa0;&#xa0;We have existing links with various Universities notably; King's College London, Wolverhampton University and University of Birmingham. In addition to this, we regularly publish in the peer reviewed scientific literature to ensure other toxicology organisations and researchers can benefit from our work, whilst considering the commercially sensitive aspects.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Gail A.
