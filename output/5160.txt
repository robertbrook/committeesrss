[[[Bzee Shop]]]

[[[, Cavendish Square, Chesterfield]]]On 14 January 2013, following complaints to the trading standards service regarding the alleged sale of illicit/counterfeit tobacco, an officer of the Department undertook a ‘test purchase’ from the above shop in Chesterfield. This resulted in the sale of cigarettes which, on further examination by the brand holder, were found to be counterfeit.&#xa0;As a result, on 30th January, the shop was searched and a quantity of counterfeit cigarettes (approximately 31,000) and tobacco (approximately 16kg) was found on the premises, all of which has been confirmed as counterfeit or illicit.&#xa0; These goods were found hidden in an outside store, linked to the premises, and under the counter. The assistant in the shop at the time was arrested, interviewed in custody and bailed pending our on-going enquiries.&#xa0;Following further reports that the shop was continuing to sell, a second visit was carried out on 20th March 2013, with police and Trading Standards Officers again in attendance. A prior test purchase was conducted on the day which resulted in a sale. &#xa0;On this occasion the goods were hidden inside a security door (which we believe had been constructed since the last raid) and in the empty tank of a disused water heater. In total 4,680 cigarettes and 2.15 kg of tobacco were found. &#xa0;On this occasion the shop assistant was arrested, questioned, detained (as he provided no definitive address) and prosecuted in Chesterfield Magistrates Court on the following day, having pleaded guilty to the ‘sale’ charges for the test purchase. Our enquiries continue following this subsequent enforcement.&#xa0;It is worth noting that the person working in the shop has been different on the three occasions our officers have attended (overtly or covertly)&#xa0;- and we do not believe that they are acting in isolation of some greater degree of control from a ‘directing mind’.&#xa0;We have had reports again since our visit that the shop has reopened and is continuing to sell illegal goods. The reports have been direct and via the local police, and often emanate from local shopkeepers who state that they are losing significant trade due to the illegal activities of the Bzee shop. &#xa0;The local authority has no power to close down premises breaching either the Trade Marks Act 1994 or the Consumer Protection Act 1987 which are enforced by the Trading Standards division. Our experience is that the shops restock and are up and running within a day/a few hours of our enforcement, and consider our intervention an ‘occupational hazard’&#xa0;It could be argued that the get up of the shop, the concealment of illegal stock, the lack of legitimate cigarettes and tobacco (and other stock) and the alterations undertaken to facilitate this trade (security door and water heater), as well as the conduct of the shop workers, all give rise to the conclusion that the main purpose of the shop is the supply of counterfeit cigarettes and tobacco. &#xa0;Tobacco worth £15,000 seized in raid against counterfeit suppliers: Your council - Derbyshire County Council.Sniffer dog used in latest raids to target counterfeit tobacco suppliers: Your council - Derbyshire County Councilobert Tayloury,nterest.se whcih aders not to call. ar to provide a source of local relaible traders (eness of this issue. heir1 http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/news_events/news-updates/2013/may/news_items/hefty_fine_for_illegal_tobacco_seller.asp http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/news_events/news-updates/2013/february/news_items/tobacco_worth_15000_seized_in_raid_against_counterfeit_suppliers.asp http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/council/news_events/news-updates/2013/march/news_items/sniffer_dog_used_in_latest_raids_to_target_counterfeit_tobacco_suppliers.asp
