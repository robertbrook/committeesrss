defaultThe British Veterinary Zoological Society (BVZS) is the specialist division of the British Veterinary 
defaultAssociation (BVA) and has over 400 active members. The membership includes registered veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses working with exotic species at all levels, from those in general practice providing a service for herpetologists, aviculturists,
default aquarists and the owners of exotic pets including primates, to those working in animal sanctuari
defaultes, wildlife parks
default, bird gardens, zoos and aquaria, and with free living wild animals. 
default&#xa0;

defaultAn aim of the Society is
default to promot

defaultto the veterinary profession and 
defaultto 
defaultexotic pet owners
default, so

defaultbeen prepared following a full consult
defaultation with the BVZS membership
default,
default including a debate on the
default subject of keeping 
defaultprimates as pets held at the BVZS spring conference held in Cambridge in 2013
default. The Society has also consulted with the British Veterinary Association (BVA).

default2. BVZS Observationsdefault2.1default 
defaultPrimates are not kept commonly as pets in the UK although the remov
defaultal of several species from the S
defaultchedule of animals requiring a Dangerous Wild Animal licence in 2007 appears to have led to an increase in popularity in keeping captive primates. 
default2.2default 
defaultThe husbandry requirements for primate groups are complex requiring large enclosures to prevent hierarchical stress and need to be constructed robustly. In addition, most primate species have such specialised UV-B, temperature, humidity, lighting, behaviou
defaultr and dietary requirements to be taken into account that BVZS consider
defaults
default it is extremely difficult to fulfil their basic welfare needs, as specified in the Animal Welfare Act 2006, if kept as pets. 
default2.3default The majority of the 
defaultclinical 
defaultconditions in all primate
defaults presented to veterinary practices in the UK are associated with a failure by the owner to meet basic husbandry requirements.
default2.4default 
defaultPrimates are 
defaultextremely 
defaultintelligent and social animals
default. T
defaulthe BVZS 
defaulttherefore 
defaultdo
defaultes
default not consider any 
defaultprimate 
defaultspecies to be su
defaultitable to be kept as
default solitary
default (singleton)
default 
defaultpets
default as their basic welfare needs cannot 
defaultpossibly 
defaultbe met
default,
default due to a fundamental requirement for
default the
default company of 
defaultconspecifics
default.
default2.5default Nevertheless, the BVZS recognises that there are individuals in the UK who maintain sm
defaultall privately owned collections of primates, not subject to inspection under the Zoo Licensing Act, 
defaultbut 
defaultthat meet the specialised requirements of the species. These animals are not kept as pets per se
default,
default but maintained 
defaultin 
defaultcollections
default 
defaultusually 
defaultfor conservation
default or educational
default reasons
default.
default2.6default The definition of a 
default‘
defaultpet
default’ 
defaultis 
defaulttypically
default accepted as 
defaultthe keeping of an animal as a companion to a pe
defaultrson. Although the BVZS agree a
default 
defaultsolitary 
defaultprimate is not suitable as a c
defaultompanion to a human
default, the definition of 
default‘
defaultpet
default’
default can also be i
defaultnterpreted as an animal that is kept for the 
defaultemotional benefit of a human. If a primate was kept appropriately in a collection, it could therefore still be consider as a ‘p
defaultet’ under 
defaultthis sense of the word, 
defaultso BVZS believes great care
default is required in draftin
defaultg any legislation
default in order to avoid inadvertently effecting stakeholders maintaining primate collections
default under the terms
default outlined in
default paragraph
default 
default2.5default.  
default2.7default 
defaultG
defaultiven the recent evolution of European policy towards lists of exotic species with potential to be kept as pets or traded following an evidence-based risk assessment, BVZS considers there is considerable merit in keeping primate species within this overall 
defaultregulatory 
defaultframework
default,
default to ensure a consistent 
defaultevidence-
defaultbased 
defaultapproach, 
defaultto 
defaultreduce duplication of

defaultcost
defaults in

defaultseparate 
defaultlegislation
default and to avoid margi
defaultnalising particular stakeholder groups
default.
default3 Summary of BVZS positiondefault3.1default 
defaultBVZS acknowledge there should be 
defaultregulation preventing the keeping of primates 
defaultas 
defaultsolitary (singleton) 
defaultpets, but proposes there should be dispensation for stakeholders to be able to keep 
defaultgroups
default of pr
defaultimates
default, assuming their welfare needs are entirely satisfied,

default 
defaultthat gives consideration to appropriate private

defaultrimate rescue, rehabilitation and 
defaultbreeding facilities that form part of 
defaultrecognised, global conservation efforts
default. 
defaultThe Society considers 
defaultgreat 
defaultcare is required drafting any new legislation particularly in defining
default the term
default ‘pet’ and believes there are 
defaultsignificant 
defaultbenefits 
defaultprovided by 
defaultincluding primates within the framework of E
defaulturopean policy 
defaultpresently evolving regarding
default exotic pet 
defaultspecies
default,
default 
defaultwhich would be expected to be evidence-based, 
defaultrather than creating separate regulation for one taxonomic group.
default 
defaultIn addition, if ther

defaultban on privately owned primates

default,
default 
defaultBVZS believes it is important
default 
defaultconsideration is
default given to the difficulty privately owned collections would face disposing of their animals.
