[normal]The British Veterinary Zoological [bold]Society[bold] (BVZS)[bold] submission[bold]1. [bold]Introduction[bold]1.1[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The British Veterinary Zoological Society (BVZS) is the specialist division of the British Veterinary 
[normal]Association (BVA) and has over 400 active members. The membership includes registered veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses working with exotic species at all levels, from those in general practice providing a service for herpetologists, aviculturists,
[normal] aquarists and the owners of exotic pets including primates, to those working in animal sanctuari
[normal]es, wildlife parks
[normal], bird gardens, zoos and aquaria, and with free living wild animals. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]An aim of the Society is
[normal] to promot
[normal]e the advancement of knowledge 
[normal]in the maintenance of the health and welfare of non-domesticated animals 
[normal]to the veterinary profession and 
[normal]to 
[normal]exotic pet owners
[normal], so 
[normal]would appear
[normal] well placed to provide a submission to the Committee
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]This response 
[normal]h
[normal]as 
[normal]been prepared following a full consult
[normal]ation with the BVZS membership
[normal],
[normal] including a debate on the
[normal] subject of keeping 
[normal]primates as pets held at the BVZS spring conference held in Cambridge in 2013
[normal]. The Society has also consulted with the British Veterinary Association (BVA).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. BVZS Observations[bold]2.1[bold] 
[normal]Primates are not kept commonly as pets in the UK although the remov
[normal]al of several species from the S
[normal]chedule of animals requiring a Dangerous Wild Animal licence in 2007 appears to have led to an increase in popularity in keeping captive primates. 
[normal]2.2[bold] 
[normal]The husbandry requirements for primate groups are complex requiring large enclosures to prevent hierarchical stress and need to be constructed robustly. In addition, most primate species have such specialised UV-B, temperature, humidity, lighting, behaviou
[normal]r and dietary requirements to be taken into account that BVZS consider
[normal]s
[normal] it is extremely difficult to fulfil their basic welfare needs, as specified in the Animal Welfare Act 2006, if kept as pets. 
[normal]2.3[bold] The majority of the 
[normal]clinical 
[normal]conditions in all primate
[normal]s presented to veterinary practices in the UK are associated with a failure by the owner to meet basic husbandry requirements.
[normal]2.4[bold] 
[normal]Primates are 
[normal]extremely 
[normal]intelligent and social animals
[normal]. T
[normal]he BVZS 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]do
[normal]es
[normal] not consider any 
[normal]primate 
[normal]species to be su
[normal]itable to be kept as
[normal] solitary
[normal] (singleton)
[normal] 
[normal]pets
[normal] as their basic welfare needs cannot 
[normal]possibly 
[normal]be met
[normal],
[normal] due to a fundamental requirement for
[normal] the
[normal] company of 
[normal]conspecifics
[normal].
[normal]2.5[bold] Nevertheless, the BVZS recognises that there are individuals in the UK who maintain sm
[normal]all privately owned collections of primates, not subject to inspection under the Zoo Licensing Act, 
[normal]but 
[normal]that meet the specialised requirements of the species. These animals are not kept as pets per se
[normal],
[normal] but maintained 
[normal]in 
[normal]collections
[normal] 
[normal]usually 
[normal]for conservation
[normal] or educational
[normal] reasons
[normal].
[normal]2.6[bold] The definition of a 
[normal]‘
[normal]pet
[normal]’ 
[normal]is 
[normal]typically
[normal] accepted as 
[normal]the keeping of an animal as a companion to a pe
[normal]rson. Although the BVZS agree a
[normal] 
[normal]solitary 
[normal]primate is not suitable as a c
[normal]ompanion to a human
[normal], the definition of 
[normal]‘
[normal]pet
[normal]’
[normal] can also be i
[normal]nterpreted as an animal that is kept for the 
[normal]emotional benefit of a human. If a primate was kept appropriately in a collection, it could therefore still be consider as a ‘p
[normal]et’ under 
[normal]this sense of the word, 
[normal]so BVZS believes great care
[normal] is required in draftin
[normal]g any legislation
[normal] in order to avoid inadvertently effecting stakeholders maintaining primate collections
[normal] under the terms
[normal] outlined in
[normal] paragraph
[normal] 
[normal]2.5[bold].  
[normal]2.7[bold] 
[normal]G
[normal]iven the recent evolution of European policy towards lists of exotic species with potential to be kept as pets or traded following an evidence-based risk assessment, BVZS considers there is considerable merit in keeping primate species within this overall 
[normal]regulatory 
[normal]framework
[normal],
[normal] to ensure a consistent 
[normal]evidence-
[normal]based 
[normal]approach, 
[normal]to 
[normal]reduce duplication of
[normal] 
[normal]cost
[normal]s in 
[normal]creating 
[normal]separate 
[normal]legislation
[normal] and to avoid margi
[normal]nalising particular stakeholder groups
[normal].
[normal]3 Summary of BVZS position[bold]3.1[bold] 
[normal]BVZS acknowledge there should be 
[normal]regulation preventing the keeping of primates 
[normal]as 
[normal]solitary (singleton) 
[normal]pets, but proposes there should be dispensation for stakeholders to be able to keep 
[normal]groups
[normal] of pr
[normal]imates
[normal], assuming their welfare needs are entirely satisfied, 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]either 
[normal]in partnership
[normal] w
[normal]ith an 
[normal]accredited 
[normal]BIAZA 
[normal]zoo 
[normal]facility
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]alternatively 
[normal]regulated through an inspection and licensing process
[normal] 
[normal]that gives consideration to appropriate private
[normal]ly owned
[normal] or charitable p
[normal]rimate rescue, rehabilitation and 
[normal]breeding facilities that form part of 
[normal]recognised, global conservation efforts
[normal]. 
[normal]The Society considers 
[normal]great 
[normal]care is required drafting any new legislation particularly in defining
[normal] the term
[normal] ‘pet’ and believes there are 
[normal]significant 
[normal]benefits 
[normal]provided by 
[normal]including primates within the framework of E
[normal]uropean policy 
[normal]presently evolving regarding
[normal] exotic pet 
[normal]species
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which would be expected to be evidence-based, 
[normal]rather than creating separate regulation for one taxonomic group.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, if ther
[normal]e is to be an outright 
[normal]ban on privately owned primates
[normal] eith
[normal]er in Europe or the UK
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]BVZS believes it is important
[normal] 
[normal]consideration is
[normal] given to the difficulty privately owned collections would face disposing of their animals.
