&#xa0;Written evidence from Neil Taylor (CYS021)&#xa0;I am a keen and experienced cyclist (about 7000 miles per year). My wife and I have ridden tandem in 29 countries. Probably the most hostile and aggressive driving we have encountered is from a minority of drivers in this country.&#xa0;Such drivers do not take seriously their duty of care to vulnerable road users (cyclists and pedestrians).&#xa0;The situation is different in many continental countries where there is a  ‘rebuttable presumption’ in favour of the vulnerable party ie the motorised vehicle driver is held to be responsible for a collision unless they can prove otherwise.&#xa0;Adopting this measure here would make far more motorists pay due care and attention.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
