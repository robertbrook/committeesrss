Delay cannot be an excuse for failing to do that. None of the delay, it seems has arisen as a result of the fault of the applicant.”   \n[3]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nArticle 8 (1) of the Human Rights Act and the GMC’s Data Base of findings against the doctor\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n     Article 8(2) states:\n2   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security [or] public safety . . . for the prevention of disorder or crime, . . . or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nArticle 8(1) Right to a private life\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe physical and psychological integrity of a person and can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the person's physical and social identity.\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by art.8. \n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeyond a person’s name, his or her private and family life may include other means of personal identification and of linking to a family.\n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n Information about the person’s health is an important element of private life.\n(e)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n An individual’s ethnic identity must be regarded as another such element. \n(f)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n A right to personal development, and the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. \n(g)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe concept of private life includes elements relating to a person’s right to their image.\n&#xa0;\ni)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthat it is in accordance with the law;\nii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthat it is carried out in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthat the interference is proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.\nOnce a doctor’s case has concluded then the legitimate aim of protecting the public has been satisfied.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n    “The Criminal Records Review will examine whether the criminal records regime strikes the \n    right balance between respecting civil liberties and protecting the public. It is expected to make   \n            proposals to scale back the use of systems involving criminal records to common sense levels.”\n&#xa0;\nAs a result of the review there have been changes which enable rehabilitated persons to \nre-establish their lives, in a way that doctors are unable to.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n[\n1] Information Commissioners Letter of findings against the GMC dated 29 May 2002\n[2] Information Commissioners Letter of findings against the GMC dated 15 May 2004\n[3] \nThe Queen on the Application of Colman v GMC  \n[2009] EWCA \nCiv\n 746 \n[4] \nThe Queen on the Application of John \nOldroyd\n Catt v (1) The Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland and ors\n [2012] EWHC 1472 (Admin). \n[5] \nThe Queen on the Application of T v (1) Chief Constable of Greater Manchester and ors \n[ 2013] EWCA \nCiv\n 25\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
