"EIS 04\nWritten evidence submitted by the British Aggregates Association (BAA)Executive SummaryThe UK has an active domestic \nminerals \nextract\nion\n industry providing national wealth, employment and resource security \nto the construction industry and \nto\n a wide spectrum of consumer and manufacturing  industries.  The UK also has abundant reserves and the sector could grow and provide\n additional employment and resource security.\nIn addition the industry has an enviable and world-leading reputation for the highest level of restoration and after-care following mineral extraction (generally over and above planning requirements)  with resp\nect to landscape, tree planting,  environment and to biodiversity and geodiversity. \nThe sector would benefit from \nThe publicly listed mining houses on the UK Stock Market and with London HQs generally have little direct involvement in  any of the UK domestic \nmining industry\n. \nThe UK minerals extraction industry is \nrepresented through the CBI \nMinerals Group\n. The broader stakeholder interests for the industry sector including national, regional and local government and NGOs is through the UK National Minerals Forum established for this purpose in 2007. I\nn addition \nthe industry engage with \nWestmi\nnster\n through the A\nssociate\n Parliamentary Minerals Group\n (AP\nMG)\n. \nThe\n \nUK \nminerals\n extraction\n industry has not been involved with the EITI initiative which appears to be of little consequence to\n our sector. However, we do note that HMG reiterated its econom\nic and growth policy objectives in item (8) of its notes to the\n EITI launch\n \nPress Release\n dated 9\nth\n July which we do fully support. \n \nWe trus\nt that \nthe\n \nEITI \ninitiative will not \nmake\n any additional imposition\ns\n on\n an already overburdened and regulated\n \ndomestic minerals industry compared to our colleagues in other countries; and particularly not to SMEs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Introduction and BackgroundThis response \nis on behalf of the \nB\nritish Aggregates Association\n \n(BAA)\n  as well as for \nThe Barytes Association\n (TBA)\n of which I am Director\n;\n and also various other interests in the minerals industry in the UK, Europe and globally gained in over 40 years experience mainly at the sharp end of industry.\nBAA\n represent\ns\n the interests of \nsome 11\n0 members of which some \n70\n are independent and privatel\ny-owned SME quarry companies throughout the UK with some 1\n3\n% of national output and who operate out of \nsome\n \n30\n0 sites.\n \nTBA members provide \nglobally \ntwo-thirds of the barytes consumed in the oil and gas drilling, TV and PC glass, and automotive industries.\n There are three UK members who mine and produce barytes and fluorspar domestically, one \nof whom operates\n in a National Park.\n&#xa0;\n I am an active member of the CBI Minerals Group and also of the UK National Minerals Forum which \nincludes central, devolved\n and \nlocal government officials,\n planners, heritage groups and NGOs as well as industry representatives\n. \n \nI also belong to the Mining Association of the UK; and \nam\n a member of two professional associations for \nthe\n industry\n -\n IOM3 (Institute of Materials, Minera\nls and Mining) and IOQ (Institute of Quarrying). \n \nI am involved with the activities of\n Euromines\n and through them an EU Commission Expert Group the \nRaw Materials Supply Group\n which includes industry, the Commission and member state representatives\n.\n&#xa0;Submission We have restricted our comments  to only the first of the\n questions  laid out in your  submission of evidence\n dated\n 3\nrd\n July\n 2013\n.\nWhat is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? The UK has an active domestic industry producing \nwell \nover 200Mt of minerals annually in addition to o\nil and gas\n, and provide both employment and resource security\n. \n \n(Further detail is included in the submission by the CBI Minerals Group).\n \nA high proportion of the tonnage is land-won aggregates for the construction industry, \nand extracted material only tr\navels short distances (under 30km average) to the next customer \nmeeting local requirements and \nwhich minimises environmental footprint and \ntransportation\n - \nand which meet\n \nproximity\n \nprinciples\n .  \nM\nany industrial minerals feed the wider economy  and key ind\nustries like the chemical, metals and electronics, high tech industries and the manufacturing sector more generally\n such as barytes,   fluorspar,\n \nindustrial high-purity  limestone, metallurgical coke and silica sands.\nMinerals extraction is a rural industr\ny and individual companies live in and engage with the local community and all stakeholders. The level of restoration and aftercare is of high standards and generally over that required in the planning permission. BAA is part of the \nNature After Minerals\n programme a partnership between Nat6ural England, RSPB and industry.\nThere is considerable potential for a higher level of extraction\n which provide\n a g\nreate\nr p\nroportion\n of national need and reduc\ne\n import dependence and potential future supply risk\n. \nThis is fully endorsed in the Government’s  \nResource Security Action Plan\n of\n March 2012, paragraph 21.\nThis al\nso provides growth for both our\n sector and any manufacturing renaissance, and reduces the cost of purchasing materials from outside the UK and the sterling area . \nThe EU recognised in 2008 the increasing need for indigeno\nus supply and to improve the \nplanning \naccess to\n,\n and the investment potential for\n,\n domestic sourcing in their \nRaw Material Initiative\n.\n This also identified specific strategic minerals t\nhat were at particular risk, \nmany of which are geologically available in the UK and \nwhich included fluor\nspar and barytes which are already extracted here.\nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) and Camborne School of Mines (Exeter University) have also highli\nghted similar \nconcerns\n for UK supply\n and security\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPeter Huxtable MA(Cantab), CEng, FIMMM, FIQ\nSecretary, British Aggregates Association\n&#xa0;\n10\nth\n September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
