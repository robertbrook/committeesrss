"Written evidence submitted by Aigas Community Forest&#xa0;\nBackground: \n&#xa0;\nSince 2009 \nAigas\n Community Forest has been in negotiations with Forestry Commission Scotland to purchase/ lease \nAigas\n Forest through the National Forest Land Scheme. FCS deems \nAigas\n Forest to be ‘surplus land’ and is therefore looking to sell the forest as part of its ‘repositioning programme’. A full summary of what this has involved over the last 4 and a half years is provided in Annex 1 attached. There are a wide range of issues that require to be resolved around State Aids (please refer to our experience at the bottom of Page 3) and interpretation of the Treasury Finance Manual amongst other things but we would like to raise a number of specific issues around the Treasury rules and the valuation of the land and the forest as this may be an area where the Scottish Affairs Committee can contribute.\n&#xa0;\nKey Points:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex 1:               Aigas Community Forest – A Timeline&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n"
