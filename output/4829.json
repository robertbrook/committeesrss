"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by European Bioplastics e.V.&#xa0;&#xa0;Background paper on the behaviour of bioplastic films in mechanical recycling streams&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1. Definitions&#xa0;\nBioplastics are plastics that are biobased, biodegradable,\n              \nor both. This large family of different materials can be \nsimplified into\n two groups\n:\n&#xa0;\n1.\n1. \nBiobased non-biodegradable plastics \n(also: durable bioplastics) \n&#xa0;\nMaterials: B\niobased polyethylene (PE)\n, \nbiobased \npolyethylene\n \nterephthalate\n (\nPET\n), biobased polyamides, and materials such as starch-polyolefin blends etc.\n&#xa0;\nUses: P\nackaging sector or durable applications, for example \nin vehicles\n, building\ns, household appliances, interior design\n,\n lifestyle goods\n and electronics.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n. \nBiobased biodegradable and compostable plastics&#xa0;Materials: Thermoplastic starch, polylactic acid (PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates etc.\n&#xa0;\nUses: \nS\nhort-lived applications such as \nin \nagricultur\ne,\n catering products, packaging, or thin bags\n.\n \nS\nuitable for organic recycling\n, especially industrial composting.\n&#xa0;\nStandards: Within the EU compostable products are certified under \nEN 13432\n and EN 14995.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. Bioplastics in mixed waste streams &#xa0;Modern waste recovery systems\n cope with intermingled materials, including a \nvariety of different polymer types. \nA\nutomated plant\ns\n sort out\n the\n profitable parts of the \nw\naste stream (for example PE, or PET)\n. The p\nromising polymers are \nseparated. The rest\n ends in another \ncontainer\n, usually marke\nd\n \nand resold as\n ‘mixed plastics’. \n&#xa0;\nTo achieve this \nadvanced sorting systems us\ne a variety of\n analytica\nl methods \nincluding\n near infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray, laser, polarized light, fluorescent light, electrostatic, melting point and other techniques. \nThese methods are effective in keeping contamination of the main recycling streams with unwanted material low. \n&#xa0;\nBiodegradable plastics should end up in biowaste bins. If such bins are not available they can still be clearly identified from their labels and sorted out for delivery to a biowaste processer. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, even\n in well working systems a\nn\n \nintermingling\n of waste streams cannot be completely avoided.\n Non-biodegradable plastics can end up in the organic waste stream (e.g. misthrows) and biodegradable, compostable plastics might be found in \nmechanical recycling (e.g. misidentification\n). It is already the case that conventional plastics find their way, in low volumes, to the wrong stream. \n&#xa0;\nWe can then say that in well run waste management facilities most r\nesidual bioplastic will end up as ‘mixed plastic’ until such a time as recovery is profitable. We can also say, even when incorrectly sorted, that b\nioplastics\n today\n \ndo not enter the waste stream in sufficient volume to cause concern. Or at least no more concern than any other type of plastic. \n&#xa0;\n3. The case against bioplastics is not evidence-based&#xa0;Voices in some parts of the waste management industry claim that bioplastics are a serious disturbance to the established recycling streams of for example, PE or PET. \n&#xa0;\nThe following research and evidence refutes these assertions. It suggests the\n influence on the \ncollection and processing of profitable \nmaterials is \nn\negligible\n.\n&#xa0;\nBiobased Polyethylene (PE, not biodegradable or compostable)\n&#xa0;\nBiobased PE is obtained by polymerisation of ethylene monomers. Depending on the polymerisation process biobased LDPE or biobased HDPE can be produced. The only difference to fossil-based PE is the source, which is plant based (bioethanol made from sugar cane, sugar beet, wheat etc.). \n&#xa0;\nAs a result fossil and plant based PE are chemically identical. They share the exact same physical properties.  Therefore biobased PE can be mechanically recycled with the fossil based PE in the corresponding recycling streams. \nThere is no\n new\n issue.\n \n&#xa0;\nPLA/PBAT blends (compostable according to EN 13432)\n&#xa0;\nStudies\n by the University of Ha\nn\nnover [1]\n, [2]\n examined the\n influence of different compostable plastics on low-density polyethylene (LDPE).\n The tested mixtures contained between 0.5 % to 10 % foreign material. The LDPE contaminants were a PLA/PBAT\n blend, pure PBAT and a starch blend. They found:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe biodegradable polyester \nPBAT \nwas also tested as\n a\n possible contaminant for LDPE. The blending of \npure \nPBAT with LDPE had no influence on the viscosity behaviour compared with pure LDPE and was affi\nr\nmed to have no influence on the processing properties. The values for melt flow rate were close to the ones of pure \nL\nD\nPE and were also described to result in no distinctive disturbances during processing of the material.\n Optical changes could also not be observed.\n&#xa0;\nBelow 10% contamination there is no issue\n.\n&#xa0;\nStarch blends (compostable according to EN 13432)\n&#xa0;\nA study by BIOTEC \n[3] \nhas\n evaluated \nt\nensile strength, elongation at break and specific impact resistance for mixtures of PE with possible contaminations\n with a starch/PBAT\n blend\n as\n well as \nPP and P\nS. It was \nshown that \nthe biodegradable starch blend contaminates PE \nno more than a contamination with conventional plastics\n as PS or PP. \n&#xa0;\nIn most case\ns\n the properties of the mixtures \nof PE \nwith PS or PP as \ncontaminants \nshowed worse performances than \nthe contamination of PE with a \nstarch blend. \n&#xa0;\nHowever\n, the same study found out that even lowest PET shares (2%)\n in a PE recycling stream\n \nresults in serious problems. Due to the comparatively high melting temperature of PET (approx. 250°C), it was impossible to run a PE-based blown-film. \n&#xa0;\nThese results suggest that \nthe contaminating effect of a compostable plastic on PE is actually less than the contaminating effect of PET\n on PE. \n&#xa0;\nA study by the University of Hannover [1] also examined a starch blend used in flexible packaging applications. It\n was found out that the influence on the viscosity and flow characteristics was only marginal up to the tested ratio of 10%. \n&#xa0;\nConcerning the melt flow rate the influence on the processing properties was described as low considered with the pure LDPE. A change of colour was observed with \nin\ncreasing amount of starch blend.\n&#xa0;\nTes\nts carried out at the Plastics T\nesting Laboratory Foundation of the Polytechnic Institute of Milan and the Proplast \nL\naboratories in Tortona/Italy\n (on behalf of CONAI, the National Packaging Consortium in Italy)\n \n[4], \nhave \nconfirmed \nthat it is possible to reprocess and recycle bags of a starch based materia\nl\n and traditional plastic shopping bag waste up to a concentration of 10%\n of starch-blends as input material\n. \n&#xa0;\nCONAI\n \nf\nound\n \nthat flexible, compostable packaging can be recycled with common plastics packaging materials up to a content of 10% without any problems\n \n[5]. \n&#xa0;\nCONAI conclude\nd\n \nthat \neven if \nbiodegradable bags \nare not disposed of\nf\n \nproperl\ny they do not interfere with the recycling stream of conventional plastics.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.
