[[[0025)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Article 3 of the First Protocol and its meaning&#xa0;&#xa0;"The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature."&#xa0;This provision contains an obligation to secret ballot and slightly unspecific obligations as to the frequency of elections and their freedom.  But it says nothing about the extent of the electoral roll.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; "what matters is the intention of the parties as expressed in the text." &#xa0;The role of working papers and negotiations is expressly recognised in article 32 of the Vienna Convention:-&#xa0;"Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion ... to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31:(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure ... "&#xa0;Cases on prisoner voting prior to Hirst&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"Nor do the travaux preparatoires of Protocol No.1 disclose any intention of excluding the right of individual petition as regards article 3 ... "&#xa0;As such, there is no reason to complain at that statement, nor, indeed, anything in the Mathieu-Mohin judgment.&#xa0;&#xa0;"Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons ..."&#xa0;In contrast, as we have seen, the European Convention on Human Rights did not, either expressly, or on a proper interpretation, confer an absolute right to universal suffrage.&#xa0;&#xa0;The Hirst case&#xa0;&#xa0;"57.              ... having regard to the preparatory work to Art 3 of the Protocol and the interpretation of the provision in the context of the Convention as a whole, the Court has established that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election. "&#xa0;The authority cited for that statement was the judgment in Mathieu-Mohin.  The actual documents do not appear to have been looked at.  The tenable contention that the travaux demonstrated some individual right to be conferred by A3P1 slid into the notion, which as a matter of historical fact was plain wrong, of an intention for universal suffrage extending to prisoners.  &#xa0;&#xa0;The Scoppola case&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"96.              The Court accordingly reaffirms the principles set out by the Grand Chamber in the Hirst judgment, in particular the fact that when the disenfranchisement affects a group of people generally, automatically and indiscriminately, based solely on the fact that they are serving a prison sentence, irrespective of the length of the sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances, it is not compatible with art 3 of Protocol no 1."&#xa0;On one reading that may be taken to signal that the 4-year option or the 6-month option in the Bill would be regarded by the Strasbourg Court as acceptable.  But even if that might be the thinking this year, there is little intellectual substance in such a position, and so it might not stand the test of much time.  A ban on those serving over 6 months or 4 years is as automatic and as indiscriminate as a ban on all prisoners.  In one sense a ban on those serving prison sentences is not indiscriminate, since, with the exception of murder, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is always an exercise of discretion by the sentencing court.   Such factors as "nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances" are taken into account by the court.  In another sense the disenfranchisement is indiscriminate in that it is an automatic consequence of the imprisonment.  But that quality of automatic application would be as much present in a ban which affected every sentence in excess of any arbitrarily selected length.&#xa0;&#xa0;Do Hirst and Scoppola justify respect?&#xa0;&#xa0;"... the importance of the principle that each state is free to adopt legislation in the matter [of prisoner voting] in accordance with,&#xa0;&gt;historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe, which it is for each Contracting state to mould into their own democratic vision’."&#xa0;If that really is the guiding principle it is difficult to understand why the UK Parliament’s decision, as reflected both in the Representation of the People Acts and in the House of Commons vote on the resolution proposed by the Rt Hon Jack Straw MP and Mr David Davis MP, cannot be adequate demonstration of the "democratic vision" of this country.&#xa0;Should the UK wholly ignore the Strasbourg decisions?&#xa0;&#xa0;"The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties."&#xa0;The national interest of the UK lies in fostering an international climate in which treaty obligations are respected.  It is hard to believe that our foreign policy objectives are compatible with a deliberate flouting of a treaty obligation.&#xa0;&#xa0;The policy proposed: a discretion to excuse from disenfranchisement for special reasons&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"special reasons related to the nature or gravity of the offence, or the defendant’s particular circumstances, sufficient to displace the general policy emerging from the historical development and political thought of the United Kingdom that an offender whose offence justifies a sentence of immediate imprisonment ought to be disenfranchised during the period of imprisonment". &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;June 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;  Raab Strasbourg in the Dock: Prisoner voting, human rights &amp; the case for democracy (Civitas, 2011) pp. 5-6   6th ed 2003 Oxford University Press p.602  These cases are discussed in the Divisional Court judgment by Kennedy LJ in the case which Hirst brought in our domestic courts before he commenced his case at Strasbourg, which is reported as in R (ex p Pearson) v Secretary of State [2001] EWHC (Admin) 239 at [12] to [17].
