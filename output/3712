defaultWritten evidence from 
defaultMr Andrew and Mrs Kathryn Curry (CYS0010)
default&#xa0;defaultRef: Session on Cycle Safety Debate on Monday December 2defaultnddefault 2013defaultAs tandem cyclists who average approximately 150 miles on, and off road, on our tandems each week we would like to put forward the following proposals 
defaultand experiences for road use.
default(a)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs we
default cycle in a high volume H
defaultGV area we have experienced
default very good driving by H
defaultGV drivers and also very poor driving, unfortunately we have not been able to survey the drivers to ascertain the reason for poor driving.
defaultHGV Dridefaultversdefault    We would present the following proposals to the committee that have made a difference to the attitude of HGV drivers, and have received a positive response from the drivers such a sound of a horn, wave of hand or flash of lights;
default(1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen approaching 
defaulta bend, hill or hazard we will, as soon as is reasonably practicable, get on to a safe location to allow the HGV to pass;
default(2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default 
defaultWe always thank any motorist, however, especially HGV’s, who wait behind us for a safe place to pass;
default(3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultpoor weather we will always 
defaultwear
default bright clothes, use lights and generally make ourselves as conspicuous as possible;
default(4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe always, in line with Institute of Advanced Motorist
default cycling handbook, ride a metre 
default from the curb;
default(5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default When passed very close by an HGV we don’t
default react by being 
default offens
defaultive, aggressive or antagonistic;
default(6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also do not get involved in more than single file riding;
default(7)default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are, however, very poor HGV drivers/motorists who do need more education which should include face to face communication with cyclists who can explain the d
defaultiscomfort, fear which comes from a large vehicle passing very close;
defaultGeneral Road Use defaultWe continually read/hear on the news from drivers, media reports, newspapers who report the small number of cyclists who ignore the road rules, going through red lights,
default etc. However there is never any mention of the same frustrations 
defaultcyclists
default experience:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMotorists who ignore red lights, have illegal number plates, drive extremely close to cyclists, sound vehicle horns when very close to cyclists, shout abuse at cyclists,
default fail to use lights in poor light conditions, use mobile phones, applying makeup, doing hair, setting sat-navs, talking to passengers, turning left/right immediately in front of cyclists, driving through puddles deliberately while passing cyclists, etc, et
defaultc. All of these actions cause frustration between cyclists and motorists and increase the animosity between both parties.
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen so called celebrities make aggressive or negative comments about cyclists on TV, radio, in papers or magazines
default,
default animosity 
defaulttowards
default cyclists on the road
default increases.
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoor indication, or no indication, by motorists when turning or carrying out manoeuvres can cause a lot of frustration and puts cyclists at risk when approaching/passing a road junction;
default(d)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSpeed of motorists approaching road 
defaultjunctions can be disconcerting as a cyclist is unaware if the driver has seen them and
default is
default going to stop;
default(e)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoorly parked cars especially when the driver has stopped, with brake lights lit, and talking on the mobile phone, talking to passengers, etc. as the 
defaultcyclist does not know what action the driver is going to take, pull off, park up, open the door;  
default(f)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMotorists using cycle safe zones at traffic lights, pulling into and parking in allocated cycle lanes;
defaultTrainingdefaultWe would suggest that vehicle learner drivers
default have to get involved with cycle safety as part of the driver training programme and that schools have, as part of any curriculum
default,
default road use, road safety, cycling for fitness/health/environmental improvement and driving with respect for all road users as pa
defaultrt of cycling/road proficiency. 
defaultLaw and PunishmentdefaultThe law/judges must start to 
defaulthave a uniform
default approach to penalties for breaking the Road Traffic Act and impose stricter penalties for those who abuse the road and other road users. We hear of motorists wh
defaulto are still driving with high numbers of points on their licence which clearly gives the wrong impression to the individual given the points or other road users. There is very little action against those involved in hitting and killing/injuring cyclists, w
defaulthich very clearly gives the impression that a cyclist is likely to do less damage to their vehicle than hitting road furniture/other vehicle so is a soft target which will probably result in no action being taken against you should you hit one.
defaultFinallydefaultThe
defaultre is an increasing number of motorist
defaults
default and cyclist
defaults
default who really don’t care about others and will not alter or move from their planned actions/direction regardless of the consequences of doing so. They will sit with a hand on the car horn
default, get verbal, use h
defaulteadlights or sit on your rear bumper
default should someone challenge their actions by getting in their way, lane, road junction, etc.
defaultParents and carers taking their children to school often drive with little or no consideration for other road users, even those w
defaultalking children to school. They may only drive for a very limited time each day and consequently don’t always have the skills learnt by other road users with more experience.
