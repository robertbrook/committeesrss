[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Mr Andrew and Mrs Kathryn Curry (CYS0010)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Ref: Session on Cycle Safety Debate on Monday December 2[bold]nd[bold] 2013[bold]As tandem cyclists who average approximately 150 miles on, and off road, on our tandems each week we would like to put forward the following proposals 
[normal]and experiences for road use.
[normal](a)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As we
[normal] cycle in a high volume H
[normal]GV area we have experienced
[normal] very good driving by H
[normal]GV drivers and also very poor driving, unfortunately we have not been able to survey the drivers to ascertain the reason for poor driving.
[normal]HGV Dri[bold]vers[bold]    We would present the following proposals to the committee that have made a difference to the attitude of HGV drivers, and have received a positive response from the drivers such a sound of a horn, wave of hand or flash of lights;
[normal](1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When approaching 
[normal]a bend, hill or hazard we will, as soon as is reasonably practicable, get on to a safe location to allow the HGV to pass;
[normal](2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]We always thank any motorist, however, especially HGV’s, who wait behind us for a safe place to pass;
[normal](3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]poor weather we will always 
[normal]wear
[normal] bright clothes, use lights and generally make ourselves as conspicuous as possible;
[normal](4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We always, in line with Institute of Advanced Motorist
[normal] cycling handbook, ride a metre 
[normal] from the curb;
[normal](5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] When passed very close by an HGV we don’t
[normal] react by being 
[normal] offens
[normal]ive, aggressive or antagonistic;
[normal](6)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also do not get involved in more than single file riding;
[normal](7)[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are, however, very poor HGV drivers/motorists who do need more education which should include face to face communication with cyclists who can explain the d
[normal]iscomfort, fear which comes from a large vehicle passing very close;
[normal]General Road Use [bold]We continually read/hear on the news from drivers, media reports, newspapers who report the small number of cyclists who ignore the road rules, going through red lights,
[normal] etc. However there is never any mention of the same frustrations 
[normal]cyclists
[normal] experience:
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Motorists who ignore red lights, have illegal number plates, drive extremely close to cyclists, sound vehicle horns when very close to cyclists, shout abuse at cyclists,
[normal] fail to use lights in poor light conditions, use mobile phones, applying makeup, doing hair, setting sat-navs, talking to passengers, turning left/right immediately in front of cyclists, driving through puddles deliberately while passing cyclists, etc, et
[normal]c. All of these actions cause frustration between cyclists and motorists and increase the animosity between both parties.
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When so called celebrities make aggressive or negative comments about cyclists on TV, radio, in papers or magazines
[normal],
[normal] animosity 
[normal]towards
[normal] cyclists on the road
[normal] increases.
[normal](c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Poor indication, or no indication, by motorists when turning or carrying out manoeuvres can cause a lot of frustration and puts cyclists at risk when approaching/passing a road junction;
[normal](d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Speed of motorists approaching road 
[normal]junctions can be disconcerting as a cyclist is unaware if the driver has seen them and
[normal] is
[normal] going to stop;
[normal](e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Poorly parked cars especially when the driver has stopped, with brake lights lit, and talking on the mobile phone, talking to passengers, etc. as the 
[normal]cyclist does not know what action the driver is going to take, pull off, park up, open the door;  
[normal](f)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Motorists using cycle safe zones at traffic lights, pulling into and parking in allocated cycle lanes;
[normal]Training[bold]We would suggest that vehicle learner drivers
[normal] have to get involved with cycle safety as part of the driver training programme and that schools have, as part of any curriculum
[normal],
[normal] road use, road safety, cycling for fitness/health/environmental improvement and driving with respect for all road users as pa
[normal]rt of cycling/road proficiency. 
[normal]Law and Punishment[bold]The law/judges must start to 
[normal]have a uniform
[normal] approach to penalties for breaking the Road Traffic Act and impose stricter penalties for those who abuse the road and other road users. We hear of motorists wh
[normal]o are still driving with high numbers of points on their licence which clearly gives the wrong impression to the individual given the points or other road users. There is very little action against those involved in hitting and killing/injuring cyclists, w
[normal]hich very clearly gives the impression that a cyclist is likely to do less damage to their vehicle than hitting road furniture/other vehicle so is a soft target which will probably result in no action being taken against you should you hit one.
[normal]Finally[bold]The
[normal]re is an increasing number of motorist
[normal]s
[normal] and cyclist
[normal]s
[normal] who really don’t care about others and will not alter or move from their planned actions/direction regardless of the consequences of doing so. They will sit with a hand on the car horn
[normal], get verbal, use h
[normal]eadlights or sit on your rear bumper
[normal] should someone challenge their actions by getting in their way, lane, road junction, etc.
[normal]Parents and carers taking their children to school often drive with little or no consideration for other road users, even those w
[normal]alking children to school. They may only drive for a very limited time each day and consequently don’t always have the skills learnt by other road users with more experience.
