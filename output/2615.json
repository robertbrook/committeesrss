"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by FPA and Brook [OLS0066]&#xa0;&#xa0;About FPA&#xa0;FPA is one of the UK’s leading sexual health charities. Our mission is to help establish a society in which everyone has positive, informed and non-judgmental attitudes to sex and relationships; where everyone can make informed choices about sex and reprod\nuction so that they can enjoy sexual health free from prejudice or harm. \n&#xa0;\nWe do this through providing a comprehensive sexual health information service for professionals and the public, running community based sex and relationships education programmes a\nnd campaigning to ensure that high quality sexual health information and services are available to all who need them. \n&#xa0;\nTo find out more about FPA and the work we do please visit our website: \nwww.fpa.org.uk\n&#xa0;\nAbout Brook&#xa0;Brook is the UK’s leading provider of sexual health services and advice for young people under 25. Our mission is to ensure young people can enjoy their sexuality without harm.\n Brook services provide free and confidential sexual health information, co\nntraception, pregnancy testing, advice and counselling, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and outreach and education work, reaching over 290,000 young people every year. \n&#xa0;\nBrook believes that every young person in Britain deserves \nsex and relationships education (SRE) that is relevant to them, focuses on relationships as well as sex, honest about human sexuality and taught by professionals who are well prepared and confident. Sex and relationships are a life skill, as important to o\nur future health and happiness as any other subject, and young people deserve to be heard.\n&#xa0;\nTo find out more about Brook visit: \nwww.brook.org.uk\n. \n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\nBrook and FPA \nwelcome the focus on pr\notecting young\n people from harm. Young people are vulnerable from online environments in a number of ways, which are not just about access to pornography. These include grooming, bullying and exploitation, and it is important that this Inquiry does not seek to dispropor\ntionately focus on pornography in comparison to these other important areas of consideration. Certainly,\n we know that \nsimply blocking internet content is not a cure-all\n, and the role of education \nin supporting young people’s safe navigation of the online e\nnvironment \nis \nkey\n. \nTherefore we\n strongly advise for the need to\n talk about education for young people and support for parents at the same time.\n&#xa0;\nIn particular, w\ne would be concerned if actions resulting from a review of filtering\n meant that legitimate educ\natio\nn websites\n were blocked\n as well.\n&#xa0;\nIn summary:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBrook’s young people’s response to this Inquiry&#xa0;To inform this response, Brook asked\n groups of young people across the country to consider their views of the questions and th\nemes raised in this Inquiry\n. \n&#xa0;\nThese groups included young people who identified as LGB and T\n (Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender)\n, male, female and non-binary, \nBME\n (Black, Minority, \nEthnic\n communities)\n, experience of mental health, experience of homelessness, and as young offenders. A summary of their conclusions is provided here and a full copy of the report can be found in Annex A of this document.\n&#xa0;\nConclusio\nns from young people’s response\n&#xa0;\n“If young people want to access porn, out of arousal or curiosity, that's perfectly healthy and typical. However, easy access to porn needs to be supplemented with good sex education and lessons about internet awareness and\n safety, as well as an open and non-judgemental societal attitude towards sex and sexuality.”\n&#xa0;\n(\nanonymised\n quote from young people’s response)\n&#xa0;\nThe feedback from the young people shows that, broadly speaking, \nit is clear that\n young people need better, more\n inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and for parents, \nnot least \nto ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next generation. This would support a societal shift in the bullying culture w\nhich has developed around social media, without imposing enforced censorship which could inhibit young people’s ability to access accurate information about sex. \n&#xa0;\nCompulsory education on internet safety, covering issues which include pornography and cyber\n bullying, would allow young people to explore and understand their developing sexuality whilst reducing any risk of harm.\n&#xa0;\nRESPONSE TO QUESTIONS&#xa0;\n1. How best to protect minors from accessing adult content?&#xa0;\n1.1 \nIn order to protect minors from accessing adult content \nwe must provide young people with the support, education, skills and understan\nding to ensure that they\n are not damaged by, pressured into or exploited through exposure to porn and that they are able t\no cope with the availability of pornography, on and offline. \n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nHowever, \nBrook and FPA do not believe that it is possible or right to simply prevent young people \naccessing pornography. \nWe make a clear distinction between child abuse and pornography, and indeed censorship and protection. \nWe \nalso \nwelcome\n the focus \nof this Inquiry \non protecting you\nng people from harm and condemn\n all images of child abuse\n,\n which are illegal. \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nBrook’s re\nsearch with\n groups of young people suggests:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nIn terms of how young people would like to better deal with \npornography they may see, \nBrook and FPA recommend\n an educational approach which helps young people to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nParents\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nBrook and FPA \nbelieve\n that parents should be better enabled and encouraged to\n take responsibility for supervising their children and setting appropriate safety settings\n,\n particularly\n if they have young children who may be vulnerable\n to seeing images that \nthey \nmight find\n distressing. The young people \nwe spoke with \npointed out that there are existing safety settings which are very good \nfilters\n.\n \nThey felt that if safety settings are used appropriately then young people would not come across adult content when searching for \nsomething else.\n&#xa0;\n“We don't need to create new \nfilters,\n we just need to educate parents about how to use existing safety settings.” \nYoung woman, 16.\n&#xa0;\n“Educate the parents, who can in turn educate the children.” \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n1.6 \nTo enable parents to \nact accordingly, they suggested that education should be provided to parents so that they are able to understand and set parent\nal controls. The young people that Brook\n spoke to all knew how to \nset controls\n themselves, describing the process as simple, and \nfelt that \nwith the right level of intervention and education from parents, \nthere should be no reason why children should see adult content if they \nor their parents deem the material disturbing\n. \nThey suggested developing leaflets, posters or training/workshops for parents, explaining how simple it is to set these controls. \n&#xa0;\n“Educate parents on how young people access what they do and make it so that young people know that they can talk to their p\narents or someone they trust if they have seen something that makes them distressed.”\n Young person, 20\n&#xa0;\n“Individual guidance by parents to ensure children \ndon't\n find this material. If a parent is present, even if they do find it, it can be explained proper\nly, explained why it's wrong and why not to go back to the site.” \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n1.7 \nParenting support programmes such as the FPA’s Speakeasy\n programme (see below) can help parents build up the knowledge and skills they need to enable them to discuss \nissues around sex, relationships and growing up with their children and teach them key skills in these areas. \nIn turn, developing a stronger dialogue between parents and children can help build the co\nnfidence of the children to\n be more open with their pare\nnts about what they may have seen.\n&#xa0;\nSpeakeasy\n&#xa0;\n1.8 \nSpeakeasy\n is a FPA course for parents and carers to better enable them to engage with the children for \nwh\nich\n they are responsible, on\n often tric\nky issues surrounding\n sex and relationships. FPA knows that many parents and carers want to talk with their children about issues associated with growing up, including sex and relationships, but many are embarrassed or unsure about where to start and what to say. \n&#xa0;\n1.9 \nFPA has\n developed the Speakeasy programme to enable parents and carers to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to have these sometimes difficult conversations. The community-based project runs over eight weeks and covers factual information including how \nto keep children and young people safe; the pressures young people may be under; and strategies for proactively starting \ndiscussions on growing up, sex and relationships. The course is accredited by the Open College Network, which gives parents the opportu\nnity to receive credits for the work they do, which they can then apply in further learning or in employment. \n&#xa0;\n1.10 \nEvaluations of the project have demonstrated the positive impact it has on parents’ knowledge, confidence and their relationships with thei\nr children. A Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis of the programme has estimated the total value of benefits to children and parents and to the state to be £21 million. The value to the state represents a return of £5.29 for every pound of public m\noney invested in the project. \n&#xa0;\nSex and Rela\nt\nionships Education \n(SRE) \nand the role of s\nchools\n&#xa0;\n1.11 \nBrook and FPA believe that parents and \ncarers\n play a crucial role in giving information and advice to children and young people about sex, relationships and\n growing up. However, a\nlthough parents and \ncarers\n absolutely have a role to play in protecting minors from accessing potentially damaging online material, according to the National Association of Head Teachers, 83% of parents also had sufficient confidence\n in schools' ability to help their children understand the dangers specifically associated with pornography, and that they believed teachers were as important as parents in handling the issue. Just 13% thought it should be left to parents alone to educate \nchildren about pornography (NAHT survey, May 2013)\n \n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.12 \nIndeed, Brook and FPA strongly believe SRE must cove\nr many issues relating to this I\nnquiry beyond porn, including \nsexting\n, making friends and relationships online, bullying, and safety in relationships. \n&#xa0;\n1.13 \nIn order to achieve this, \nBrook \nand \nFPA \nbe\nlieve that the best strategy\n is a joint home-school programme between schools, parents \nand young people. \nWe should also acknowledge that many parents, despite the\nir\n best intentions, will still fee\nl\n too awkward to have conversation\ns\n about sex with their children. Furthermore, schools are widely\n regarded as an \nappropriate and \nimpartial ground \nfor such discussions.\n&#xa0;\n1.14 \nThis sentiment is supported by Brook’s discussion with young people who said that\n internet safety should be \ntaught in school, including about\n how to set controls. Brook and FPA support the young people’s suggestion that educator\ns could explain to children that there are images on the internet which may not be suitable, talk to them about what it means, and teach them how to avoid it. Furthermore, children should be taught that there are some things on the internet that they may f\nind disturbing and that there are \npeople they can talk to if they do see something that upsets\n them.\n&#xa0;\n“\nI think education is more important than sheltering young people and just pretending they are not there, because they would no doubt find them anyway.”\n \nY\noung Person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“Better education in schools. Explain to them that those films are not real, and are actors.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n“I think educating young people on the different types of images etc is also important to ensure that when they are faced with such things they know how to deal with them.” \nYoung person, 23.\n&#xa0;\nSRE and the prevention of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation \nand domestic and sexual violence\n&#xa0;\n1.15 \nIn its May 2013 report into PSHE, \nOfsted\n states that l\nack\n of age-appropriate sex and relationships education may leave young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation, particularly i\nf they are not taught the appropriate language, or have not developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours, or do not know who to go to for help\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.16 \nSRE can play a role in keeping children and young people safe. SRE aims to equip children and\n young people with language and skills to understand appropriate and inappropriate \nbehaviour\n, be able to resist pressure and to know who to talk to and how to access help and support when they need it.\n&#xa0;\n1.17 \nSpecifically\n Brook \nand \nFPA believe that in the \ncontext of online safety, SRE could be used to teach young people as follows: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.18 \nThe backing for this is clear. In May 2013, a \nYouGov\n opinion poll found that 86% of UK adults \nbelieve that sex and relationships education “which addresses sexual consent and respectful relationships” should be compulsory in secondary schools\n.\n&#xa0;\nFantasy \nvs\n Reality course\n and training resou\nrc\ne\n&#xa0;\n1.18 \nFPA has developed a course and booklet which su\npports teachers to deliver a series of lessons exploring the influence and impact of the media, the internet and pornography on the sexual attitudes and \nbehaviour\n of young people.\n&#xa0;\n1.19 \nThese resources help teachers to plan lessons on the very sensitive su\nbject of the \nsexualisation\n of young people, including the role of pornography. It also provides objective, safe and creative ways to tackle the issue.\n&#xa0;\n1.20 \nThese resources meet official guidance for students at Key stages 3 and 4 with, and include \ndifferent lesson plans and training options for each stage. The booklet also includes a CD-ROM with video clips, images and PowerPoint presentations suitable for use with Key stage 3 and 4 students, and was produced by the Brighton &amp; Hove Healthy Schools T\neam and developed in partnership with \nPSHE (Personal, Social, Health and Economic) education teachers with guidance from the Metropolitan police and FPA staff.\n&#xa0;\nRelationships, Safety and Risks booklet\n&#xa0;1.21 \nBrook has developed a booklet, which\n offers ins\night, signposting and support around the everyday risks young people face as they navigate the worlds of social media, the internet and their own social lives; at home, in education, and when out and about.\n&#xa0;\n1.22 \nThe booklet gives an overview of a wide \nrange of potential issues; including “\nsexting\n”, sexual bullying, pornography and unhealthy relationships. Crucially, it offers relevant information and tips for staying safe as well as details of where young people can go if they need help, support and adv\nice.\n&#xa0;\n1.23 \nAsk Brook about relationships, safety and risks\n is a brand new addition to the pocket-sized A6 Ask Brook booklet range. It is aimed at 14+ young people and an extremely useful tool to all professionals working with youth groups and young people.\n&#xa0;\nUpdating current Government guidance re SRE\n&#xa0;\n1.24 \nCurrently, maintained schools must have regard to the (as was) Department for Education and Employment’s, \nSex and Relationship Education Guidance\n \n(2000). This guidance \npre-dates the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act and the 2010 Equalities legislation which includes the recommendation that schools teach gender equality and non-violent, respectful relationships between women an\nd men.\n&#xa0;\n This current Government SRE guidance also pre-dates recent and emerging issues on technology and safeguarding, with no reference to addressing on-line safety, '\nsexting\n' or pornography in SRE. \n&#xa0;\n1.25 \nBrook \nand \nFPA recommen\nd that the Government shoul\nd up\ndate SRE guidance for the modern era.\n&#xa0;\n2. How best to filter out extremist material, including images of child abuse and material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence?&#xa0;\nWhen children start to hit puberty\n,\n then without places where they can talk about sex in a positive way (and not just mechanics) then they will go looking for potentially harmful images, and in the world we live in it is virtually impossible to censor those completely.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n2.1 \nAny proposal to restrict young people’s access to extreme material online will be fraught with complication and difficult to implement. Filters must be sophisticated to allow for a range of factors (for example, households with children of different ag\nes, and differing definitions of pornography). Part of supporting young people through education is ensuring they have access to good quality, factual information on sexual health online. Attempts to restrict young people’s access to pornography may inadve\nrtently lead to the blocking of good quality education sites. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nAlthough y\noung people have told us that while they are concerned about pornography and would like help and support dealing with it, we must \nalso \nacknowledge that a block can only go so far\n and as discussed in our response to Question 1, we should ensure we \npromote the need for\n education for young people and support for parents at the same time.\n&#xa0;\nDefining ‘extremist’\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nBrook and FPA support the views of the young people interviewed by \nBrook\n and that it is \nimportant to give consideration to what is deemed \n‘\nextremist\n’\n. They were clear that images of child abuse or bestiality should be banned, but some felt that censoring images of bondage, for example, is wrong because acts of bondage may\n be consensual. They were clear that there is a huge difference between sexual violence and consensual acts of bondage. There was also concern from young people who identify as LGB\n and \nT that some of the porn they can relate to might be labeled as “extremi\nst” whereas in fact porn involving\n, for example,\n trans* individuals often reinforces their identity and sense of self, rather than being fetishistic. \n&#xa0;\nAddressing the issue at the source\n&#xa0;\n2.4 \nSome of the young people \nthat Brook\n spoke with \nalso \nfelt that \nresponsibility should be placed on the websites which host extreme materials. Rather than being an issue of filters, the issue should be addressed at the source.\n&#xa0;\n“Surely the issue should be with the websites themselves existing, rather than blocking out young people's free will to surf the web. We should be tackling the websites themselves, rather than blocking access to them...” \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n“Make the promot\nion and creation of website such as these illegal and ensure that it's an offence that the police take active force to enforce.” \nYoung person, 23.\n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nFurthermore, Brook \nand FPA \nwould like to point out that although online pornography will almost always \nshow consenting adults, it rarely shows that the consent leading to the actions being undertaken has been pre-discussed and negotiated. This leads to a perception that it is somehow acceptable to quickly engage in sexual acts that others may find extreme, \nwithout gaining the permission of all parties involved. Brook\n and FPA \nrecommend that the perception of \nthis needs\n to change, and \nthe\n Government \nshould implement \npolicy which leads to pornography websites showing the consent and negotiation that leads to the sexual acts which are shown. \n&#xa0;\n3. How best to prevent abusive or threatening comments on social media?&#xa0;\n“Educating young people about how some people on the i\nnternet use anonymity and personas to try to hurt or control other people; and how to identify spaces in which they feel safe and unsafe so they can find spaces on the internet that suit them best. I would also foster a society in which people didn't feel \nthey needed to use the internet (or anything else) to dominate others, but that would take a while.”\n \nYoung person, 24.\n&#xa0;\n3.1 \nBrook and FPA concur with the views of the young people interviewed by Brook that cyber bullying should not be looked at in isolatio\nn, and that it is just one facet to the much wider issue of bullying generally. The solution is not as simple as increasing b\nlocking or reporting options. W\nhat is\n really\n required is a societal shift in attitudes around respect and how we treat others. The media, in \nall its formats, has an important role to play in this shift\n, particularly in enforcing a message that there are no unhealthy sexual or societal norms that you\nng people should feel that they should have to live up to with regards to their sexuality and sexual \nbehaviour\n. \n&#xa0;\nHelping young people to understand abusive and threatening \nbehaviour\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nFurther to our response to Question 1, Brook \nand \nFPA \nfirmly believe\n that quality S\nRE \nas part of PSHE should encompass education \nthat helps\n \npupils\n understand why people bully\n, and to teach them\n to react in a way that is both responsible and appropriate to their individual circumstances. \n&#xa0;\n“Teach the children to be \nunderstanding of the harsh semiotics of the internet, and how to be emotionally resilient and secure.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“You need to teach children to take advantage of the ability to block people on websites and use high privacy settings.”\n \nYoung person,\n 18.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nThe young people that Brook\n spoke with also\n suggested targeting the bullies or potential bullies and increasing understanding of power dynamics through education. \n&#xa0;\n“If you want to solve society's problems, you need to start at the source.” \nYoung person, 16.\n&#xa0;\n“Education is \nkey\n. Having the appropriate education at school will help people \nrealise\n that being a keyboard warrior is not constructive.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nAs mentioned in our response to Question 1 under the ‘SRE and the preventio\nn of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and domestic and sexual violence’ section, teaching about abuse \nhas the potential to help both \nthe perpetrators and potential victims of bullying and abuse\n. Brook and FPA \nstrongly recommend the need for quality SRE as\n part of PSHE education to be fully implemented across all school settings\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe need for a transparent internet culture\n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nThe young people that Brook spoke with,\n described some innovative ideas about having more transparent internet culture, where websites should have clear terms of reference, including whether\n the website allows free speech, which some people may find offensive. Where ‘free speech which some peop\nle may find offensive’ is endorsed,\n \nusers of these websites\n should therefore\n be prepared for the fact that\n&#xa0;\nothers can say what they like; or whether it is a friendly and respectful community, where people will be removed if they post something th\nat is offe\nnsive. The obvious benefit of implementing such a system is that\n young people would be enabled to exercise choice over what type of online community they choose to be part of.\n&#xa0;\n3.6 \nThe\n young people also highlighted the importance of social media sites developing smooth mechanisms to ensure that trolls are dealt with quickly and appropriately. One young person suggested that in addition to trolls being blocked from social media sites whe\nre they demonstrate \nabusive \nbehaviour\n,\n large fines\n could also\n be introduced in order\n to reinforce the anti-bullying commitment.\n&#xa0;\n“Introduction of a procedure allowing anonymous trolls/abusers to be reported to either the website administration or the polic\ne.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“Sufficient justice for trolls, better functioning 'flagging' on social media sites”.\n \nYoung man, 20.\n&#xa0;\nWhitleblowing\n button\n&#xa0;\n3.7 \nIn addition to the need to report trolls and bullies, s\nome young people \nthat Brook spoke with \nalso felt \nthat more could be done to support children who do find dis\ntressing or extremist images on\nline, and one particularly helpful idea was to enact a help/ \nwhistleblowing\n button on websites so that children can be immediately directed to reputable professional \norganisations\n and get advice about what they have experienced.\n&#xa0;\n“Have a number/email/button that they can get in contact with so that if the see something inappropriate they can tell someone with influence who can do the right thing and reassure the young \nperson.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAnnex A:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Young people’s response to the Culture, Media and Sport Inquiry into online safety&#xa0;BackgroundThe Culture, Media and Sport Committee have decided to investigate a number\n of aspects of online safety that are currently raising concerns, in particular:\n&#xa0;\nBrook will be submitting a written response to \nthe inquiry where we will\n pull together recent policy and lines on the issue. Young people’s views will form a key element of this\n response.\n&#xa0;MethodIn order to ensure that young people’s views were accurately represented in Brook’s response to the CMS inquiry, the Participation Lead created an online survey, which was promoted via our \nBeSexPositive\n social media channels, and\n asked groups of young people across the country to consider their views of the questions and themes raised in this Inquiry. \n&#xa0;\nThese groups included young people who identified as LGB and T (Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender), male, female and non-bina\nry, BME\n (Black, Minority, \nEthnic\n communities)\n, experience of mental health, experience of homelessness, and as young offenders. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Findings&#xa0;Question 1) Some internet sites, for example those that show graphic images of sexual violence, are usually considered as inappropriate for young people under the age of 18. What do you think are the best ways to protect children, or younger young people, from accessing images that they might find distressing?&#xa0;\nThe young people were really clear that the\nre needs to be a distinction between protection and censorship. They felt it was important to \nrecognise\n the fact that some young people will be purposefully seeking out porn for a variety of reasons, including being intrigued about sex. \n&#xa0;\nThey felt that pa\nrents need to take responsibility for supervising their children and setting appropriate safety settings if they have young children who may be vulnerable to seeing images that they might find distressing. The young people pointed out that there are existi\nng safety settings which are very good \nfilters\n. They felt that if safety settings are used appropriately then young people would not come across adult content when searching for something else.\n&#xa0;\n“Educate the parents, who can in turn educate the children.” \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\nTo enable parents to act accordingly, they suggested that education should be provided to parents so that they are able to understand and set parental controls. The young people we spoke to all knew how to do this themselves, describing \nthe process as simple, and felt that there should be no reason why children should see adult content if they don't want to. \n&#xa0;\n“We don't need to create new \nfilters,\n we just need to educate parents about how to use existing safety settings.” \nYoung woman, 16.\n&#xa0;\nThey suggested developing leaflets, posters or training/workshops for parents, explaining how simple it is to set these controls. \n&#xa0;\n“I think to help keep children from accessing images which may cause distress, parents and \ncarers\n need to take responsibil\nity to discuss these subjects with their children and as well as the need to make sure these kind of sites are not accessible if they have children under 18.”\n \nYoung person, 15.\n&#xa0;\nThey also felt strongly that young people should be taught about internet safe\nty in school and taught how to set controls themselves. They suggested that educators could explain to children that there are image on the internet which may not be suitable, talk to them about what it means, and teach them how to avoid it. They thought t\nhat children should be taught that there are some things on the internet that they may find disturbing and that there are people they can talk to, if they do see something that upsets them.\n&#xa0;\n“\nI think education is more important than sheltering young people\n and just pretending they are not there, because they would no doubt find them anyway.”\n \nYoung Person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“Better education in schools. Explain to them that those films are not real, and are actors.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n“Making young people and parents awa\nre of how to block distressing images and educating children and younger young people about who to speak to if they come across something they find upsetting.”\n \nYoung person, 24.\n&#xa0;\n“Educate parents on how young people access what they do and make it so that \nyoung people know that they can talk to their parents or someone they trust if they have seen something that makes them distressed.”\n Young person, 20\n&#xa0;\n“I think educating young people on the different types of images etc is also important to ensure that whe\nn they are faced with such things they know how to deal with them.” \nYoung person, 23.\n&#xa0;\nSome young people also gave suggestions about how safeguards could be improved to ensure that children are not able to access adult content.\n&#xa0;\n“Require date of birth conf\nirmation before entering, have captions preceding these images warning of graphic content.” \nYoung person\n, \n21.\n&#xa0;\n“Ensuring that \nthere's better parental controls\n, rather than just having to click a button to say you are over the age, instead asking the parent\n to enter the password. I also think that there should be better control over sites use of pop-ups and advertising on other websites that are harmless and have nothing to do with porn.” \nYoung person, 23.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 2) What ways do you think would be best to protect children and young people from extremist material, such as images of child abuse and sites that promote terrorism or other acts of violence?&#xa0;First of all, the young people thought it was important to give consideration to what is considered extremist. They were clear that images of child abuse or bestiality should be banned, but some felt that censoring images of bondage, for example, is wrong \nbecause it may be consensual. They were clear that there is a huge difference between sexual violence and consensual acts of bondage. There was also concern from young people who identify as LGBT that porn that they can relate to might be \nlabelled\n as “extr\nemist” whereas in fact porn involving trans* individuals often reinforces their identity and sense of self, rather than being fetishistic. \n&#xa0;\nAgain, the young people highlighted the importance of open and honest discussion, and comprehensive education, to i\nnform children of the dangers of accessing certain sites, and the importance of education for parents to enable them to have those potentially difficult discussions, whilst also learning about how to use appropriate parental controls. \n&#xa0;“I believe [that th\ne way] to truly protect children from extremist material... is [by having] positive shared discussion, with family, \ncarers\n or teachers when possible, about the subjects.”\n \nYoung person, 15.\n&#xa0;\n“Individual guidance by parents to ensure children \ndon't\n find this\n material. If a parent is present, even if they do find it, it can be explained properly, explained why it's wrong and why not to go back to the site.” \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the young people also felt that responsibility should be placed on the websit\nes which host extremist materials. Rather than being an issue of filters, the issue should be addressed at the source.\n&#xa0;\n“Surely the issue should be with the websites themselves existing, rather than blocking out young people's free will to surf the web. We should be tackling the websites themselves, rather than blocking access to them...” \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n“Make the promot\nion and creation of website such as these illegal and ensure that it's an offence that the police take active force to enforce.” \nYoung person, 23.\n&#xa0;\nSome young people also felt that more could be done to support children who do find distressing or extremis\nt images on line.\n&#xa0;\n“Have a number/email/button that they can get in contact with so that if the see something inappropriate they can tell someone with influence who can do the right thing and reassure the young person.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 3) What do you think are the best ways that young people can be kept safe from abusive or threatening comments on social media? If you were in charge, how would you deal with internet trolls?&#xa0;There was a strong focus from young people that cyber bullying should \nnot be looked at in isolation, and that it is just one facet to the much wider issue of bullying generally. \nThey felt that the \nsolution is not as simple as increasing blocking or reporting options, and that what is required is a societal shift in attitudes\n around respect and how we treat others.\n&#xa0;\nThey suggested that all children and young people should receive education about relationships so that they can understand bullying and why people bully. \n&#xa0;\n“Teach the children to be understanding of the harsh semio\ntics of the internet, and how to be emotionally resilient and secure.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“You need to teach children to take advantage of the ability to block people on websites and use high privacy settings.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\nThey suggested targeting t\nhe bullies or potential bullies and increasing understanding of power dynamics through education. \n&#xa0;\n“If you want to solve society's problems, you need to start at the source.” \nYoung person, 16.\n&#xa0;\n“Education is \nkey\n. Having the appropriate education at \nschool will help people \nrealise\n that being a keyboard warrior is not constructive.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\nThey also described some innovative ideas about having more transparent internet culture, where websites should have clear terms of reference, including \nwhether the website allows free speech, and therefore people need to be prepared for the fact that\n&#xa0;\nothers can say what they like; or whether it is a friendly and respectful community, where people will be removed if they post something that is offensive. T\nhen young people would be enabled to exercise choice over what type of online community they choose to be part of.\n&#xa0;\n“Educating young people about how some people on the internet use anonymity and personas to try to hurt or control other people; and how to \nidentify spaces in which they feel safe and unsafe so they can find spaces on the internet that suit them best. I would also foster a society in which people didn't feel they needed to use the internet (or anything else) to dominate others, but that would \ntake a while.”\n \nYoung person, 24.\n&#xa0;\nThey young people also highlighted the importance of social media sites developing smooth mechanisms to ensure that trolls are dealt with quickly and appropriately. One young person suggested that in addition to trolls bei\nng blocked from social media sites where they demonstrate abusive \nbehaviour\n, they could also impose \n“large fines!”\n to reinforce the anti-bullying commitment.\n&#xa0;\n“Introduction of a procedure allowing anonymous trolls/abusers to be reported to either the websi\nte administration or the police.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“Sufficient justice for trolls, better functioning 'flagging' on social media sites”.\n \nYoung man, 20.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 4) The Government is worried that children and young people can find porn too easily. What do you think? And if you were Prime Minister what would you do?&#xa0;“I believe if the Government \nfeel\n the porn is too accessible and want to ensure young people don't see it, they should improve the sex education in schools. As porn is usually viewed by young\n people who are not entirely sure or can't understand sex, are intrigued to see what people do when they have sex (as this is not the kind of information we find out in sex education, we tend to only get the \"mate and \nfertilisation\n\" and how to avoid becomi\nng pregnant) especially LGBT youth. If I was prime minister I would insist more in depth sex education and awareness about LGBT sexual relationships.”\n \nYoung person, 15.\n&#xa0;\n“I think it is more to do with education, I accessed pornographic images from the age o\nf 11 and this was a lot to do with my own questions about my body and sexuality, but I was never given any outlet or information about these images, it was just not talked about at all throughout education[...] When children start to hit puberty then witho\nut places where they can talk about sex in a positive way (and not just mechanics) then they will go looking for potentially harmful images, and in the world we live in it is virtually impossible to censor those completely.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“Mandatory r\nelationship education that rolls on into sex education from a VERY young age.”\n \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“Porn is not always a negative thing. Masturbation feels good; I enjoy watching porn when I masturbate... who are the government to intervene? If the \ngovernment continues to speak about porn in this way it's steering us away from the goal of sex being more openly discussed in society. Look at the media...all of these over \nsexualised\n adverts and graphic scenes in films - blocking porn sites is a waste of\n time, instead they should be regulated; and young people should learn more about porn in schools.”\n \nYoung person, 20.\n&#xa0;\n“If young people want to access porn, out of arousal or curiosity, that's perfectly healthy and typical. However, easy access to porn nee\nds to be supplemented with good sex education and lessons about internet awareness and safety, as well as an open and non-\njudgemental\n societal attitude towards sex and sexuality.”\n \nYoung person, 24.\n&#xa0;\n“I think there is imagery that could be considered pornog\nraphic everywhere (advertising, newsagents, etc) I think that the focus should be on educating children and young people about sex and parents essentially doing their job of parenting.”\n \nYoung person, 21.\n&#xa0;\n“Enforce education. The sex \ned\n bill hasn't been upd\nated since 2000, predating all internet issues. This would be a cause for outrage in any other subject.”\n Young man, 20.\n&#xa0;\n“I would leave the porn industry as is. They already have age warnings on \nwebsites,\n many programs can be installed by parents that auto\nmatically block these websites (without infringing on adults and young people exploring their sexuality). Porn is \nlabelled\n as 18+, but it's undeniable that many teens watch porn and watch it safely. For many people it's a major way of exploring their sexua\nlity, being sexually satisfied and learning about themselves in a safe environment with no chance of disease and if they find a problem they just need to hit the close button.” \nYoung person, 18.\n&#xa0;\n“I think that it's more important that young people receive \nbetter sex and relationship education in school to ensure that they are appropriately informed that porn is not reality and to help them understand what real sex and relationships look like.”\n \nYoung person, 23.\n&#xa0;\nConclusionIn conclusion, it is clear that the young people we spoke to demand better, more inclusive education on internet safety, both for children and for parents, to ensure that knowledge, skills and understanding around online safety are embedded in the next gen\neration. This would support a societal shift in the bullying culture which has developed around social media, without imposing enforced censorship which could inhibit young people’s ability to access accurate information about sex. \n&#xa0;\nCompulsory education o\nn internet safety, covering issues which include pornography and cyber bullying, would allow young people to explore and understand their developing sexuality whilst reducing any risk of harm.\n&#xa0;September 2013\n&#xa0;\n Further information on Speakeasy: \nhttp://www.fpa.org.uk/communityprojects/parentsandcarers\n \n Further information on Speakeasy: \nhttp://www.fpa.org.uk/communityprojects/parentsandcarers\n NAHT survey, May 2013\n \nYouGov\n \nOpinion poll commissioned by the End Violence Against Women and Girls Coalition\n, May 2013\n Further information about \nFPA’s Fantasy \nvs\n Reality course can be found here: \nhttp://www.fpa.org.uk/course/fantasy-vs-reality-impact-and-influence-pornography-young-people-0\n \n Further information about FPA’s Fantasy \nvs\n Reality training resource can be found here: \nhttp://www.fpa.org.uk/product/fantasy-vs-reality#product-content\n \n Further information about Brook’s Relationships, Safety and Risks Booklet can be found here:\nhttp://www.brook.org.uk/index.php/resources/resource-types/ask-brook-booklets/ask-brook-about-relationships-saf\nety-and-risks-detail\n \n Unfortunately, SRE across the country is often weak. \nThere is lots of evidence to substantiate this, but most recently in May 2013, an \nOfsted\n report found that \nschools are failing children and young people by not meeting the set \nstatutory guidance on SRE, but equally there is a lack of accountability surrounding SRE and PSHE generally, highlighted by there being no set curriculum to deliver, and poor assessment (\nNot yet good enough: personal, social, health and economic education in schools, \nOfsted\n, May 2013\n).\n"
