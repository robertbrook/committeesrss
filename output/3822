defaultWritten evidence from Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) (CYS 057)
default&#xa0;
defaultCIHT is a membership organisation representing over 12,000 people who work in the highways and transportation sector.  CIHT membe
defaultrs plan, design, build, operate and maintain best-in-class transport systems and infrastructure, whilst respecting the imperatives of improving safety, ensuring economic competitiveness and minimising environmental impact.
default&#xa0;
defaultCIHT welcomes the opportunity to
default submit evidence to the Committee’s call for evidence on 
defaultCycling Safety
default. CIHT responses are based on inputs from members of our 
defaultRoad Safety and Urban Design
default panel
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;defaultCIHT aim
defaults
default to encourage more people to cycle safely and more regu
defaultlarly for 
defaulttheir everyday travel, as part of a
default wider promotion of sustainable transport and development.
default&#xa0;
defaultCIHT members are involved in road safety and traffic management, and the scale of recent cyclist death
defaults
default and injury in London
default, as with all casualties and deaths a
defaultcross users of the highway network,
default has been both shocking and 
defaultgives
default cause for concern.
default&#xa0;
default These incidents appear to raise common problems of conflict at busy intersections and of inherent hazards between certain vehicle types, especially between cyclists an
defaultd buses or heavy goods vehicles.
default&#xa0;
defaultCycling has substantial health benefits for physical and mental wellbeing, as well as having a 
defaultmuch lower
default 
defaultenvironmental impact than motor transport, and CIHT continues to urge all highway authorities to maintain these bene
defaultfits while delivering infrastructure and other actions to 
defaultreduce
default cyclist injury
default. Although there 
defaulthas been a decline in the level of risk to cycling over the longer term, there have been more recent increases in the rate of killed and serious injuries
default, which
default is at odds with other transport modes
default.
default&#xa0;defaultIn part due to these concerns, although there has been an increase in l
defaultevels of both cycle use and investment in cycling
default, take up
default across the UK 
defaultremains
default variable and considerably lower than is achieved in many other western European nations.  
default&#xa0;default1.0default              defaultIsdefault cycling safe, particularly in towns and citiesdefault?default&#xa0;
default1.1default              
defaultThe first point to make is that ‘safety’ is always relative – there is no absolutely safe mode of 
defaulttransport.  Cycling in the UK, expressed in terms of casualties per mile cycled, is safer than other countries such as the US, but less
default safe 
defaultthan 
defaultcountries such as 
defaultthe Netherlands and Denmark.
default  The aim must be to ma
defaultke cycling 
defaultin the UK 
defaultas safe as in the 
defaultbest
default countries.
default  However, it should be recognised that the risk of a cycling fatality in the UK, per mile travelled, is about half what it was 20 years ago
default. M
defaultany people believe cycling to be more hazardous than walking, yet deaths per mile travelled by cyc
defaultlist have been lower that for pedestrians for every year since 1994
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2default              
defaultUnfortunately 
defaultthe risk per mile of being killed or seriously injured in when cycling has increased
default more recently
default, and this is worrying, particularly since the risks for other mode
defaults of travel have continued to decline.  The reasons for this are not fully clear, but many of the fatalities that have occurred have involved cyclists and HGVs
default, particularly when the HGV is turning left at a junction.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.3default              
defaultThe health benefits of cycling a
defaultlso need to be taken into account – people die from illnesses brought on by inactivity as well as through road traffic accidents.  Cycling has been 
defaultshown to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancers, which together kill over a hu
defaultndred times the number of people who die 
defaulton the roads.
default&#xa0;
default1.4default              
defaultUrban areas are complex and present a characteristic combination of hazards that 
defaultresult in, per
default 
defaultmile cycled
default, 
defaulta higher number of collisions involving a cyclist than in 
defaultrural areas.  Cyclists are 
defaultmore likely to encounter congestion and compete with motorists
default, particularly at junctions where most collisions take place.  Due to the higher traffic speeds involved though, collisions in rural ar
defaulteas tend to be more severe – when they do occur the cyclist
default has a greater chance of being killed or seriously injured.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.0default              defaultWhat Central and local Government could do to improve cycldefaulting defaultsdefaultafety?default&#xa0;
default2.1default              
defaultSuccessive Governments have demonstrated a commitment to promoting cycling by 
defaultdedicated 
defaultfunding, issuing policy not
defaultes and publishing guidance.  
defaultUnfortunately t
defaulthe outcome has been mixed, with some provision being disjointed or of limited use to 
defaultmore confident 
defaultcyclists.  However
default the recent increases in the levels of cycling in some places, particularly in London and the 
defaultcentres of the larger cities, as well as the ‘Cycling Demonstration Towns’, indicates that
default promoting cycling is succeeding.  Success in terms of safety 
defaultmust now follow and will 
defaultcome from joint working 
defaultbetween central and local government
default, the Institutions 
defaultand cycling organisations
default, 
defaultidentifying the challenges
default and developing 
defaultand implementing 
defaultbetter solutions
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2default              
defaultIn order to make this happen, s
defaultenior political and executive commitment at both national and local level 
defaultmust 
defaultbe
default achieved
default to 
defaultsupport 
defaulta 
defaultpackage of m
defaulteasures to increase both cycle 
defaultuse
default 
defaultand cycle
default safety
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.3default              
defaultCIHT believes that 
defaulta return to the setting and delivery of casualty reduction targets
default has a key part to play in this
default.  There is solid evidence that they are successful in reducing road deaths and in
defaultjury, 
defaultand 
defaultthe CIHT believes the abandonment of targets in the current Roa
defaultd Safety Framework should be reconsidered
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4default              
defaultLocal authorities and police forces have always had a key role in the implementation and achievement of casualty reduction in Great Bri
defaulttain over the last two decades. We endorse the view that decisions about local roads are best taken at the local level. Our concern, however, is that an emphasis on decentralisation with no commitment from central government to monitor progress may lead to
default inconsistency around the country with some authorities continuing to focus on road safety and others concentrating on different local priorities
default, disbanding the professional safety teams that were part of many authorities
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5default              
defaultAs the DfT
default itself has admitted in the Strategic Framework, performance in casualty reduction around the country is varied. Decentralisation is likely to exacerbate that position. It is vital to monitor independently performance across local authorities and the diffe
defaultrent administrations and to share good practice across the profession. The Strategic Framework fails to do this.
default&#xa0;
default2.6default              
defaultRoad Safety A
defaultudit is an acknowledged technique that reduces risks of individual schemes and also allows highway authorities and their 
defaultdesigners to learn from past experiences.
default  
defaultGovernment should work with stakeholders to promote
default the development of a mechanism for 
defaultincreasing 
defaultthe knowledge of road safety practitioners 
defaulton cycling matters, which will then be shared 
defaultwith 
defaulthighway designers. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.0default              defaultIs it desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users?default&#xa0;
default3.1default              
defaultWe know that many people who wish to take up cycling are deterred by the fact that on most roads in the UK they will have to share space with traffic.
default&#xa0;
default Achieving some separ
defaultation from motor vehicles is therefore important if we are to match the levels that are seen in other countries.
default&#xa0;
default3.2default              
defaultIt is certainly feasible for new roads to be designed and developed to incorporate segregation, and there is a need for highway standards 
default(such as the Highways Agency’s Design Manual) to be updated with this in mind.
default&#xa0;
default It will be more difficult on much of the existing highway network, but there are many sections of road where there is space that can be reallocated to cycling.
default&#xa0;
default This could be d
defaultone by a slight reduction in the width of traffic lanes, removing areas of hatching and so on.
default&#xa0;
default Only in exceptional circumstances should space be taken from pedestrians, but sometimes there are very wide footpaths that are only lightly used. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3default              
defaultNew tech
defaultniques such as ‘light segregation’ (dividing off cycle lanes with bollards, planters or ‘armadillos’) offer promising ways of giving cyclists a good degree of actual and perceived safety at relatively low cost and need to be rolled out much more widely. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4default              
defaultWhere segregation is not possible then cycling must be made more safe and pleasant through reducing traffic speeds and flows.
default&#xa0;
default CIHT welcomes the recent guidance by Government which makes it easier for local authorities to introduce 20mph limits and zon
defaultes, and wishes to see them introduced more widely in urban areas.
default&#xa0;
default3.5default              
defaultAt junctions, where most collisions occur, a choice needs to
default be 
defaultmade between segregating and integrating cyclists.  
defaultThere are fewer conflict points when cyclists are integrated with tra
defaultffic, but this will only be attractive to cyclists (particularly novice ones) at lightly trafficked locations.
default 
defaultAt busy and complex junctions segregation will often be needed, but it must be done carefully so that cyclists do not lose out in terms of priori
defaultty or delay, or they will simply remain on the road.  
default&#xa0;
default3.6default              
defaultDrivers must also 
defaultclearly recognise when cyclists are returned to the traffic flow that they are to be treated as any other vehicle, and given the space and respect they need.  There is a role for Government here in educating drivers how to engage with cyclists, as has been
default done in other countries such as Ireland. 
default&#xa0;
default4.0 default              defaultOther ideas for defaultimproving defaultcyclingdefault safetydefault&#xa0;
default4.1default              
defaultThe Welsh Government has recently enacted the Active Travel Act, which will require all Welsh authorities to develop a strategy for developing safe and attractiv
defaulte cycling and walking routes, with a 15 year horizon.  The Act also requires authorities to plan for walking and cycling when designing and improving highways, a significant step.  This has the potential to bring cycling into the mainstream and CIHT would 
defaultwelcome its introduction in other parts of the UK.
default&#xa0;
default4.2default              
defaultCentral 
defaultGovernment needs to take more of a lead in the trialling, development and rolling out of innovative (to the UK) solutions which improve the convenience and safety of routes used by cyclists.  Many techniques that are used in other countries – such as low l
defaultevel 
defaultcycle-specific 
defaultsignals, combined cycle and pedes
defaulttrian zebras and two-stage turns at junctions
default – are impossible or difficult to achieve within current UK legislation and practice.  
default&#xa0;
default4.3default              
defaultGovernment is working with Transport for London on the trialling 
defaultof some new ideas at TRL, but CIHT calls on the DfT to go further and faster, taking a much more proactive role
default, 
defaultand 
defaultdeveloping a culture of continuous improvement. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.4default              
defaultAchieving better outcomes 
defaultshould be based around a 
defaultproven evidence base and 
defaultsound principles of likely net benefit.  Road safety professionals have skills central to 
defaultthese 
defaultissues and 
defaultthe development of better 
defaultpolicies in highway design and management
default.
default 
defaultPromoting the collation of an evidence base for road safety professionals to ref
defaulterence
default will help them in this role
default.
default 
defaultIn all areas, road safety skills must be integrated to maximise 
defaultthe benefits for cyclists and other road users 
defaultwithout 
defaultan 
defaultadverse safety impact.  Properly managed, many schemes can deliver reductions in cost, environment
defaultal and casualty levels.
default&#xa0;
default4.5default              
defaultBecause of the historic low levels of investment and political support, there is a real 
defaultskills gap amongst highway professionals.  There should be support for
default the development of skilled and motivated delivery teams
default centrally or
default regionally
default, able to engage with colleagues 
defaultwithin 
defaultlocal authorit
defaulties
default and
default external organisations
default. Government should also work with the Institutions and other stakeholders to develop and roll out training for highway professionals 
defaultso that they are better inf
defaultormed on how to design for cycling.
