[normal]Written evidence submitted by Dr [bold]Elaheh[bold] [bold]Ghassemieh[bold] (WSC02)[bold]P
[normal]lease notice that the statement
[normal] below 
[normal]is
[normal] on the basis of what I have observed within 
[normal]my 
[normal]past 20 years in UK academia
[normal] in the field of engineering. The questions raised here are the questions that have been long my personal questions as I had observed the patterns within the circle of female colleagues for years. Unfortunately each individually thinks they are alone in th
[normal]e circumstances which have led to them leaving the academia or STEM career. I am glad to see that the statistics are now out to indicate that there is a problem and a trend.  Also I am pleased to see that there is some interest in the authorities to do som
[normal]ething about it. 
[normal]Why do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]I believe there are several reasons behind this matter as follows:
[normal]1- Lack of equal opportunity for women in assessment of promotion:
[normal] 
[normal]I think women 
[normal]are not favoured in terms of promotion. If the record were to be taken out carefully which normally does not happen at
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]university, it would have become clear that with equal CV, majority of women tend to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]hold by far
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]lower grades, position and salary. Altho
[normal]ugh in most systems there seems to be a supposedly appeal
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]system of scrutinising this, I believe women are less likely to use the system. They are generally more accepting of the system and tend not to challenge the decisions. So they get beaten by general
[normal]ly more accepting and less challenging nature. Also it is possible that the male dominated culture in STEM does not help this.
[normal] The only way to avoid the discrimination is by setting more rigour system of scrutinising it.
[normal] 
[normal]There is a huge gap between women’s
[normal] and men’s salary in academia and if you question this they will say the role/job description is different. Whilst you are fully aware that your job demand and description has been exactly the same as your male colleague next door. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2- Many female academi
[normal]cs might lose their interest in career progress as later in life they have children
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This is because
[normal] still mothers are known to be the centre of the family and care at home.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Their priority somehow changes towards their family and motherhood role and their 
[normal]career becomes a secondary focus. The current academic progression demand does which requires 
[normal]longer hours at work do
[normal] not tolerate this change of focus.
[normal]3- In many families still the income of the women is considered as second income and not the main incom
[normal]e 
[normal]for the family.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]herefore women are more likely to give up work in cases that for example moving of the family needs to happen. Women become the followers rather than the leaders in these situations.  
[normal]When women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? 
[normal]I have seen some go to industry as it allows them to have a more balanced life/work role. The demand of academic work does not allow for this balance easily
[normal].
[normal] Some choose to become housewife 
[normal]or pick up much less demanding work on part time basis. 
[normal]What should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers?
[normal]There could be several ways to retain women graduates or PhD students:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1-
[normal] Bringing to light and introducing successful women in STEM as example to the graduates and PhD candidates. The more successful women are seen in STEM, the more female graduates are encouraged to stay in.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2-Of course if we want more successful women in ST
[normal]EM to show as example, then we need to work on changing the culture 
[normal]for
[normal] this success
[normal] to become possible
[normal]. Providing awareness to 
[normal]the 
[normal]management who make
[normal]s
[normal] decision in terms of progression of staff is
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]essential. System of scrutiny of management in this matter
[normal] would help. For example setting one of the measures of evaluation of the university on the basis of provision of good environment for female academics to grow
[normal], 
[normal]could be quite helpful. If STEM related departments at university are obliged to provide statis
[normal]tics on what happens to their female staff they would have to act fairly in terms of opportunities they provide. The system of scrutiny does not exist at the moment. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3- Special funding scheme to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]especially encourage female graduates and PhD students to 
[normal]stay in Academia. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
[normal]I think government
[normal]/higher education
[normal] could help in
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]what is mentioned in my previous answer.
[normal]1- Reinforcing system of scrutinising 
[normal]women progression in STEM:
[normal]Setting one of the measures of evaluation of the university on the basis of provision of good environment for female academics to grow could be quite helpful. If STEM related departments at university are obliged to provide stati
[normal]stics on what happens to their female staff they would have to act fairly in terms of opportunities they provide. The system of scrutiny does not exist at the moment. 
[normal]2-
[normal] 
[normal]Provision of special funding for attracting more women
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]to STEM and also working on ch
[normal]ange of culture from "all men in trousers in STEM to a mixed culture".
[normal]3- Some systems such as US they support spouse recruitment system. This does not exist in UK. I suppose the government could bring such policies in place. For example in the cases of tw
[normal]o academics in the family at the moment it is very difficult for husband
[normal] and wife both
[normal] to find job
[normal]s
[normal] in the same place and therefore they have to either live separate or one (normally wife) to give up 
[normal]her
[normal] job. These policies could help to retain the women i
[normal]n academia whilst they stay with their family.
