defaultlease notice that the statement
default below 
defaultis
default on the basis of what I have observed within 
defaultmy 
defaultpast 20 years in UK academia
default in the field of engineering. The questions raised here are the questions that have been long my personal questions as I had observed the patterns within the circle of female colleagues for years. Unfortunately each individually thinks they are alone in th
defaulte circumstances which have led to them leaving the academia or STEM career. I am glad to see that the statistics are now out to indicate that there is a problem and a trend.  Also I am pleased to see that there is some interest in the authorities to do som
defaultething about it. 
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultI believe there are several reasons behind this matter as follows:
default1- Lack of equal opportunity for women in assessment of promotion:
default 
defaultI think women 
defaultare not favoured in terms of promotion. If the record were to be taken out carefully which normally does not happen at
default&#xa0;
defaultuniversity, it would have become clear that with equal CV, majority of women tend to
default&#xa0;
defaulthold by far
default&#xa0;
defaultlower grades, position and salary. Altho
defaultugh in most systems there seems to be a supposedly appeal
default&#xa0;
defaultsystem of scrutinising this, I believe women are less likely to use the system. They are generally more accepting of the system and tend not to challenge the decisions. So they get beaten by general
defaultly more accepting and less challenging nature. Also it is possible that the male dominated culture in STEM does not help this.
default The only way to avoid the discrimination is by setting more rigour system of scrutinising it.
default 
defaultThere is a huge gap between women’s
default and men’s salary in academia and if you question this they will say the role/job description is different. Whilst you are fully aware that your job demand and description has been exactly the same as your male colleague next door. 
default&#xa0;
default2- Many female academi
defaultcs might lose their interest in career progress as later in life they have children
default.
default 
defaultThis is because
default still mothers are known to be the centre of the family and care at home.
default&#xa0;
defaultTheir priority somehow changes towards their family and motherhood role and their 
defaultcareer becomes a secondary focus. The current academic progression demand does which requires 
defaultlonger hours at work do
default not tolerate this change of focus.
default3- In many families still the income of the women is considered as second income and not the main incom
defaulte 
defaultfor the family.
default 
defaultT
defaultherefore women are more likely to give up work in cases that for example moving of the family needs to happen. Women become the followers rather than the leaders in these situations.  
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? 
defaultI have seen some go to industry as it allows them to have a more balanced life/work role. The demand of academic work does not allow for this balance easily
default.
default Some choose to become housewife 
defaultor pick up much less demanding work on part time basis. 
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers?
defaultThere could be several ways to retain women graduates or PhD students:
default&#xa0;
default1-
default Bringing to light and introducing successful women in STEM as example to the graduates and PhD candidates. The more successful women are seen in STEM, the more female graduates are encouraged to stay in.
default&#xa0;
default2-Of course if we want more successful women in ST
defaultEM to show as example, then we need to work on changing the culture 
defaultfor
default this success
default to become possible
default. Providing awareness to 
defaultthe 
defaultmanagement who make
defaults
default decision in terms of progression of staff is
default&#xa0;
defaultessential. System of scrutiny of management in this matter
default would help. For example setting one of the measures of evaluation of the university on the basis of provision of good environment for female academics to grow
default, 
defaultcould be quite helpful. If STEM related departments at university are obliged to provide statis
defaulttics on what happens to their female staff they would have to act fairly in terms of opportunities they provide. The system of scrutiny does not exist at the moment. 
default&#xa0;
default3- Special funding scheme to
default&#xa0;
defaultespecially encourage female graduates and PhD students to 
defaultstay in Academia. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
defaultI think government
default/higher education
default could help in
default&#xa0;
defaultwhat is mentioned in my previous answer.
default1- Reinforcing system of scrutinising 
defaultwomen progression in STEM:
defaultSetting one of the measures of evaluation of the university on the basis of provision of good environment for female academics to grow could be quite helpful. If STEM related departments at university are obliged to provide stati
defaultstics on what happens to their female staff they would have to act fairly in terms of opportunities they provide. The system of scrutiny does not exist at the moment. 
default2-
default 
defaultProvision of special funding for attracting more women
default&#xa0;
defaultto STEM and also working on ch
defaultange of culture from "all men in trousers in STEM to a mixed culture".
default3- Some systems such as US they support spouse recruitment system. This does not exist in UK. I suppose the government could bring such policies in place. For example in the cases of tw
defaulto academics in the family at the moment it is very difficult for husband
default and wife both
default to find job
defaults
default in the same place and therefore they have to either live separate or one (normally wife) to give up 
defaulther
default job. These policies could help to retain the women i
defaultn academia whilst they stay with their family.
