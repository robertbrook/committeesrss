[[[Issue raised by Castles and Parish for 51M]]]

[[[Has the identified issue been addressed in the updated economic case?]]]Inappropriate do minimumYes – updated to take into account substantial commitments to enhance existing rail networkInconsistent ‘base case’ used in HS2 and alternativesYes – the same base case used throughout Alternatives not considered fullyYes, multiple variants considered by Atkins and compared with HS2 using the same models and economic appraisal techniquesOut of date assumption on income elasticity of demandYes, updatedUse of over-long appraisal period Judgment call. The appraisal period used is consistent with HM Treasury Green Book guidance but with demand growth cut off three years after project opening. How can this be over-long?Over-statement of crowding benefitsYes, train lengthening investments included in revised base caseDoubts over validity of reliability benefitsYes. A lot of new evidence provided on the extent of train punctuality and its relationship with the intensity of network useIncorrect value of time that does not reflect the productive use of time while travellingYes. Value of business time revised downwards sharply and shown to be consistent with preparedness to pay research that reflects the ability to work while travelling by trainSubsidy increase across the network unquantifiedYes and now evident that the operating cost of the network (and hence subsidy) is lower with HS2 than without itRisk and uncertainty not taken into accountYes, full probabilistic analysis of BCRs and in treatment of costsHigh dependency on long term benefitsNo. This is an inescapable feature of long term investments&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;(i)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the BCR of the upgrade alternative to the full HSR network, which, as developed by Atkins for DfT showed a higher BCR of 3.1; and(ii)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the Eddington Report which found, he says, lots of schemes with a higher BCR than 2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“While the [upgrade] packages are likely to be relatively future proof in relation to downside risks (where lower demand can be accommodated through reduced crowding and de-scoping of some interventions), there is likely to be less scope to address higher demand growth, or continued growth beyond the ‘cap year’ (i.e. 2036). Given that, even on the basis of current demand forecasts, peak crowding levels are high, increases in demand would probably require additional capacity to be found.There is scope within the existing packages, particularly for MML, ECML and Cross Country, to provide some extra capacity through train lengthening but there is more limited scope to increase capacity through frequency enhancements without further considerable infrastructure investments. Discussions in this study did not identify any obvious further infrastructure investments which were likely to boost capacity and offer value for money.”
