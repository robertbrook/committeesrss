[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In my view the BBC’s daily news reporting and other political programmes (
[normal]e.g
[normal] 
[normal]Newsnight
[normal]) are heavily biased in favour of the left.  It is clearly evident that the BBC is operating from a left wing agenda which is having the affect of continually brainwashi
[normal]ng the public and undermining our democratic process.

[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The reports are extremely biased and have been for at least the last decade.  In my view it is more like a party political broadcast, knocking the right and promoting the left at EVERY opportunity.  
[normal]It is a sickening disgrace and whoever is pulling the strings should be shown up and bought to book.  We are supposedly living in a democracy but the BBC has changed the status quo with its continual pro left wing stance.  The fact that I have to pay for t
[normal]his daily barrage of propaganda is diabolical and wrong.  The damage that the BBC’s abuse of power has caused this country is beyond comprehension.

[normal]In view of the dire and far reaching consequences of the BB
[normal]C
[normal]’s actions that continue to tear this country a
[normal]part, there should be an immediate full and in depth public inquiry.  It is mind boggling to note how long the organization has got away with this an
[normal]ti
[normal] democratic process which in my view is as bad, if not worse than the recent 
[normal]‘paedophile’
[normal] 
[normal]revelations bec
[normal]ause of the untold damage to our nation.
