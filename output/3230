defaultIn my view the BBC’s daily news reporting and other political programmes (
defaulte.g
default 
defaultNewsnight
default) are heavily biased in favour of the left.  It is clearly evident that the BBC is operating from a left wing agenda which is having the affect of continually brainwashi
defaultng the public and undermining our democratic process.

defaultThe reports are extremely biased and have been for at least the last decade.  In my view it is more like a party political broadcast, knocking the right and promoting the left at EVERY opportunity.  
defaultIt is a sickening disgrace and whoever is pulling the strings should be shown up and bought to book.  We are supposedly living in a democracy but the BBC has changed the status quo with its continual pro left wing stance.  The fact that I have to pay for t
defaulthis daily barrage of propaganda is diabolical and wrong.  The damage that the BBC’s abuse of power has caused this country is beyond comprehension.

defaultIn view of the dire and far reaching consequences of the BB

default’s actions that continue to tear this country a
defaultpart, there should be an immediate full and in depth public inquiry.  It is mind boggling to note how long the organization has got away with this an
