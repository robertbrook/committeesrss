"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Waitrose&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis document sets out Waitrose’s \nresponse to the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry into a carrier bag charge for England.\n&#xa0;\n1.0              Introduction1.1\n              \nWaitrose \nwelcomes the opportunity to \nrespon\nd \nto the \nEnvironmental Audit Committee’s inquiry \ninto \nthe sustainability of measures to reduce the use of plastic shopping bags.\n  The views represented are the views of Waitrose supermarkets, \na division\n of the John Lewis Partnership.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nWaitrose believes that a 5p charge on single use bags will reduce bag consumption as consumers begin to change their behaviour as a result of having to pay for every bag.\n  \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nSince the introduction of charging in Wales in October 2011, Waitrose has seen a reduction of 76 per cent of single use bags.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nProviding a free, more sustainable bag is likely to lead to increased usage, which could reverse falls in consumption as consumers begin to fall back into old habits. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.0              background2.1\n              \nOur understanding is that \nthe existing types of biodegradable and \noxo\n degradable \nbags \nwould not be exempt from the charge. Currently, only paper would be exempt and as WRAP have reported, whilst coming from a renewable source, paper requires significantly more energy to manufacture and transport than plastics and also have limited \nreuseability\n. \n2.2\n              \nWe also understand that industry has been tasked with identifying a new type of biodegradable material that overcomes the main issues already identified namely: contamination of recycling stream, confusing consumers and the potential impact on existing consumer behaviour.  \nOur \nresponse is therefore based on the knowledge currently available.\n3.0              The likely change in the number of bags discarded and any benefits for biodiversity and the environmentChanges in number of bags discarded3\n.1\n              \nSince charging in Wales was introduced\n on ALL SINGLE USE BAGS\n in October 2011, Waitrose has seen a reduction of 76 \nper cent\n of single use \nbags.  This supports the wider report produced by WRAP earlier this summer\n (UK Voluntary Carrier Bag Monitoring – WRAP July 2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.2\n              \nWe believe a 5p charge on single use bags will reduce bag consumption as consumers start to change their behaviour as a result of having to pay for every bag.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n              \nIf there was a free bag available with more ‘sustainable’ credentials, the likely increase in usage could reverse falls in consumption as consumers began to fall back into old habits.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nbenefits for biodiversity and the environment3\n.4\n              \nThe main problem associated with single use bags is the generation of litter.\n3\n.5\n              \nAccording to WRAP’s research, we know the majority of households (65%) \nreuse\n their single use bags as bin liners. This would infer that the bags are either sent to landfill or for incineration and thus energy recovery.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nSome consumers will recycle their bags, we offer recycling facilities in our shops, we then reuse the plastic as part of our closed loop initiatives.  \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nBy imposing a charge on ALL single use bags, we know from evidence in Wales this results in a significant reduction of bags in circulation, therefore a charge on ALL bags would contribute towards a reduction in litter.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nA charging exemption on biodegradable and degradable bags would result in \nan increase in bag consumption.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n              \nThese would still end up in either landfill or incineration as consumers will continue to use them as bin liners. Biodegradable bags (paper/natural materials) are not designed to degrade in anaerobic landfill conditions and could release methane under such conditions.\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nBiodegradable and degradable bags should not enter the recycling stream as they contaminate the recycled content and therefore are not suitable for recycling.\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n              \nThe only benefit of a biodegradable bag therefore, is with regards to litter, however existing types of bio (plastic) bags still take years to decompose. We need to be changing behaviour not condoning the discarding of bags into the environment with the hope they will break down before they cause damage to marine life or unsightly litter. \n4.0              the impact on the use of biodegradable bags and the impact on plastics recycling4\n.1\n              \nRecent \ncustomer research showed there is poor understanding of what biodegradable really means. When asked if consumers wanted a free biodegradable\n,\n the majority said yes, however when asked how they would dispose of the bags the majority confirmed they would continue to reuse \nthem \nas bin liners. When asked if they knew the impact on the environment could \nbe detrimental, the\n \nmajority went on to say they would prefer to pay 5p for a bag that could be recycled.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nA \nbiodegradable bag should break\n \ndown more quickly. If these types of bags enter the recycling stream they will compromise the quality of the \nrecyclant\n. We have established an effective closed loop process with our plastics company. There would need to be a new process to ensure bags were segregated to reduce contamination however it is likely that recycling rates would be affected.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.0              any wider environmental or sustainability implications of a possible increased use of natural fibre ‘bags for life’&#xa0;\n5\n.1\n              \nWith the potential introduction of a free biodegradable bag, we would need to consider the impact on our existing range of reusable bags. We would withdraw the existing ‘recycled and recyclable’\n \nplastic bag as consumers would be unlikely to \npay a\n 5p \ncharge if \na\nn alternative,\n free biodegradable bag \nis available.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.2\n              \nA\n \nfree bag option is likely to change the behaviour of those consumers who already reuse their bags as they would switch to using a free alternative.\n \n&#xa0;\n5\n.3\n              \nC\nonsumers \nare more likely to move \naway from the bag for life, which\n,\n if used four times and recycled\n,\n has the lowest impact on the environment\n.\n (\nThe Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Supermarket Carrier Bags 2011\n)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.0              the relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed levy rather than a possible complete ban on lightweight plastic bags6\n.1\n              \nThe proposed levy exempts biodegradable bags. By offering a free bag\n,\n it would continue to encourage a ‘use once’ mentality as there would \nbe \nlittle incentive to remember to reuse bags. Consumers would also view the bag as a more sustainable solution to plastic, despite it not being suitable for recycling nor would it change consumers’ behaviour \nregarding \ndisposal.\n6\n.2\n              \nFrom WRAP’s own report and LCA data, all bags should be reused as many times as possible. Biodegradable bags especially paper bags have very limited reuse opportunities.\n&#xa0;\n7.0              the rationale for excluding particular types of retailer from the levy scheme7\n.1\n              \nIf the rationale for the plastic bag charge\n \nis environmental, then its aim should be to change consumer behaviour and to encourage the reuse of bags as many times as possible.  This would not be achieved if some retailers were exempt.\n7\n.2\n              \nExcluding some retailers would send out conflicting messages to consumers and could therefore affect the potential benefits from the charge in other areas.\n&#xa0;\n8.0              the lessons to be learnt from other countries’ experiences in this area8\n.1\n              \n              \nIn Wales, consumers have adapted to the charge and reusing bags is commonplace as in Europe. \n9.0              Any social or economic impacts of the proposed bag levy, for example on affordability for particular households or businesses9\n.1\n              \nThere would be an enormous loss of potential funds available to charities as a result of the exemption of biodegradable bags.  In Wales, the proceeds from the 5p charge go towards social and environmental good causes. With the potential volumes available, charities stand to lose considerable funds as few retailers w\nould offer a plastic bag for 5p.\n \n M\nost retailers will want to be as competitive as possible and therefore most will offer a free bio\ndegradable\n bag. If a charge was imposed on all single use bags as in Wales, the proceeds could be redirected into research and development to improve kerbside recycling/on the go recycling where the main problem lies.\n10.0              Any hygiene impacts or wider health impacts10\n.1\n              \nWe are not aware of any health implications of a biodegradable or \noxo\n degradable bag. \n11.0              About Waitrose11\n.1\n              \nWaitrose is a national supermarket operator, operating \n300\n \nbranches\n in the UK grocery market.  Waitrose also has an e-commerce grocery business (Waitrose Deliver) and an export business.\n&#xa0;\n8.2\n              \nWaitrose believes that few things in life are more important than the food we buy ourselves and our families and that good, healthy food is one of life’s great pleasures.  Waitrose’s mission is to be the best quality food and wine retailer for its customers.\n&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \nWaitrose employs over 54,000\n people \nacross the UK and \nthey \nare\n all co-owners of \nthe John Lewis Partnership\n.  \n&#xa0;\n8.4\n              \nTreading lightly\n on the environment\n is a commercial and environmental priority for Waitrose and a fundamental principle of the Waitrose Way.\n&#xa0;\n10 December 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
