"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from \nDevon County Council (TIC 041)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction.&#xa0;E\nach of the issues identified by\n \nth\ne\n Committee \nare answered in turn belo\nw.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?&#xa0;\n1.1. \nPeopl\ne\n \noften \nmake decision\ns\n on\n \nwhere they live and \nwhere\n they work based on current provision, so there is a need to\n \nproduce\n a degree of stability in the \nprovision\n of the \npublic\n \ntransport\n \nnetwork\n. It is more \ndifficult\n to identify unmet \ndemand\n, and this \nwill\n often \ntake\n a long \nperiod\n of \ntime to\n \ntranslate\n into \nsignificant\n \npassenger\n flows. Most focus on \npotential\n new \nservices\n relates to new \nhousing\n and \nbusiness\n \ndevelopments\n. \nIn Devon the \nmeans\n of identify\ning\n \ndemand\n \nincludes\n \nthrough\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?&#xa0;\n2.1. \nIn Devon m\nost\n bus \nservices\n are now low floor/ accessible.\n C\nonventional\n bus \nservices\n are augmented by:\n&#xa0;\n2.2. \nIn Devon 27% of passenger journeys on supported bus s\nervices are to/ from work (Passenger Focus survey 2013). While \nit is difficult to provide\n empirical evidence, it would appear safe to assume that there is low time-elasticity for people travelling to work (little ability to continue in work if times change\n significantly)\n. This compares to\n essential access to other services \n- \ne.g.  \nt\nown centr\ne\n services, shopping, chemists, and other services people need to use\n - which\n can \noften \nbe expected to be \nmore \nflexible (high time-elasticity)\n \nenabling these needs to be\n broadly met \nwithin\n wider service\n time bands\n.   \n&#xa0;\n2.3. \nIt is often stated that the travel needs of young people are not well served by pre-booked \nDemand Responsive Transport (\nDRT\n)\n services – and are therefore better served by regular timetabled services as there is a high degree of “turn-up-and-go” in their travel patterns.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?&#xa0;\n3.1. \nIn rel\na\ntion to m\neeting \nn\need\n, t\no\n \nperhaps \nstate the obvious, cost-efficient public transport requires significant passenger flows to provide the fares income to offset costs. Rural areas ha\nve flows which are diverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.\n&#xa0;\n3.2. \nTransport in rural areas is often characterised by d\niverse\n \ndemands\n to \nmany \ndifferent\n \nlocations\n. \nThe\n rural economy is \noften\n \nmade\n up of \nmany\n different\n employers (SMEs) in different \nlocations\n. \nSignificant and established flows are therefore often difficult to find.\n&#xa0;\n3.3. \nIt is difficult to provide for all the interchange needs of people living along a route, as many interchange opportunities can conflict\n. And different interchange needs at e.g. a station from bus to train or vice versa, or in different direction\ns\n, may not be compatible\n – unless the vehicle waits at the station thereby increasing journey time \n(\nand inconvenience for other passengers\n)\n and op\nerating costs through less efficient vehicle utilisation\n. As with many decisions on shaping the public transport network, the decision tends to favour “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” – which will mean that \nnot all\n needs \ncan\n be \nmet.\n&#xa0;\n3.4. \nIn \nmeeting demands, m\nuch depends on \nlocal\n \ngeography\n. \nTherefore different service types and models fit different areas best, and a single service model is unlikely to meet all rural needs. \nDepending\n on \npopulation\n, w\nhere there are few\ner roads\n there may tend to \nbe a \ngreater\n \nconcentration\n of travel demand on a corridor, and a greater \nnumber\n of people \ntravelling\n on a \npublic\n \ntransport\n route. \n&#xa0;\n3.5. \nDevon County Council (DCC) has operated 12 Fare car schemes – a taxi-bus DRT service -  across the county with very dif\nferent costs/ passenger resulting. \nDRT often has higher costs per \npassenger\n than conventional bus \nservices\n, and a\ngain \ngeography\n \nis a key influence \non \nwhether\n this is the case. \nThere is not a continuum of reducing service levels and reducing costs from high\n frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs may therefore rise\n. Where DRT schemes have been introduced with reduced overall costs this tends to be as a result of losing significant passenger numbers on \nthe change from timetabled to pre-booked services.\n&#xa0;\n3.6. \nThe council also believes that key success factors are for Local Transport Authorities to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?&#xa0;\n4.1. \nCommunity Transport\n (CT)\n may be well placed to cater for the needs of isolated communities on grounds of cost and responsiveness to small scale local needs. \n&#xa0;\n4.2. \nThe \ncapacity\n to expand community \ntransport\n \nservices\n \ndepends\n \nsubstantially \non the volunteer base. Much has been said \nabout reduc\ning\n levels of volunteering \nin recent\n \ndecades\n, \nwhich\n is seen to be a constraint on \nthe \nability of \nsector \nto \noperat\ne\n a \ngreater\n \nrange\n of \nservices\n or cater for the \ntravel\n needs of more people. \nThe driving licence restrictions introduced in 1997 rega\nrding category D1 also provide an increasing constraint to sourcing drivers for minibuses as time goes by. \n&#xa0;\n4.3. \nDCC has supported the Community Transport sector for more than 25 years, and sees its \nown \nrole as \nsupporting and \nworking with the sector to ca\npacity-build the sector\n. \nMaintaining \ngrant support to our CT can also help \ngroups \nlever in matched funding from other sources, helping the con\ns\nta\nn\nt challenge for the s\ne\ncto\nr\n of fundraising.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4. \nThis role has evolved as groups grow in professionalism and \nbecome more self-reliant, and with reduced council budgets seeking a more focussed approach to outcomes sought from funding. \nThis has \nalso \nincluded encouraging CT groups to operate local bus services under Section 22 provisions, which has happened only to \na limited extent. \nCT tenders are often no more competitive than those of \ncommercial\n \noperators\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.5. \nCommunity transport tends to focus \nwell on certain \nneeds\n in their communities, in particular the needs of\n the frail elderly and disabled\n – \nwhich\n has been a key aim of groups generally\n. This chimed well with the provisions of the 1985 Transport Act which allowed local authorities to make provision for th\nis sector\n. \nCommunity Transport \ndoes no\nt\n tend\n to cater so well for people in their communities wh\no need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people and the opportunities that this travel can bring them.\n&#xa0;\n4.6. \nScope for CT to address needs \ncurrently\n provided by \nlocal\n \nauthority\n \nfunded\n \nbus\n \nservices\n is limited, due to:\n&#xa0;\n(i) rural needs a\nre spread thinly; rural poverty and deprivation, and any lack of rural opportunities, even though this may be significant across a rural \narea\n, are often therefore invisible\n;\n&#xa0;\n(ii) \nm\nost local \nbus\n \nservices\n \nfunded\n by DCC are \nroutes\n that serve \nmany\n \ncommunities\n, often \nrelatively\n strategic \nrather than local \nin nature\n, and operated with large buses\n;\n&#xa0;\n(ii\ni\n) Devon’s CT \nsector\n is strong and \nwidespread\n, but \ngenerally comprises many\n small groups \nserving\n their own \nlocality\n – e.g. the 16 Ring &amp; Ride schemes \noperated\n by \ndifferent\n groups;\n&#xa0;\n(iv) \nt\nhe change from local minibus operation to large scale sub-regional large bus operation is a \nlarge \nstep to take for most groups\n; \npremises and operating centres will be required which are not required for minibus operation;\n&#xa0;\n(v) \nt\nhe \nwillingness\n \nof\n volunteer \norganisations\n to \noperate\n, \noften\n with unpaid \ndrivers\n, to take \npeople\n to work, is \nseen to be limited as it is \nvery \ndifferent\n from \noperating\n to meet the needs of the frail \nelderly\n and disabled;\n&#xa0;\n(vi) The cost of running \nlarge\n buses is\n \nas\n great for the CT sector as it is for \ncommercial\n \noperators\n. \nDevon’s supported services tend to be operated by smaller bus operators at keen prices – but these costs are unlikely to be further reduced by CT operation – evidenced in DCC tender results\n;\n&#xa0;\n(vii) CT groups are often fundraising at full stretch; they are likely to find fundraising for multiple large bus operation unsustainable\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.7. \nThe need for support for rural services needs to be seen as a given; there are clearly exceptions that geograph\ny etc. may help, but on the whole there is little scope for making rural services sustainable. \nKick-starting CT schemes with short-term funding is unlikely to make new services financially sustainable long\n-\nterm \nas the \nshortfall between cost and revenue wil\nl continue. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?&#xa0;\n5.1. \nThe passenger’s need and \npriority\n is \nan\n \navailable\n, reliable, \naffordable\n \nservice\n, irrespective of how this is \nprovided\n. There is no reason to assume this \nshould\n be by \na\nny \nparticular\n mode. \nFrom the viewpoint of the funding local authority, provided the appropriate service standards are met, the aim is to achieve best value. The mode wi\nll therefore be determined by circumstances, not from any inherent bias towards any one particularly mode.\n&#xa0;\n5.2. \nIn rural areas t\naxis \ncannot be regarded as \nmore or less universally available\n; in some market towns, let alone villages, there are still no acc\nessible taxis available at all for those that need their more specialist support; where they are available \nthe cost is \nclearly\n \nprohibitive\n for \nregular\n use for many people. \nJoseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport \nP\noverty is a greater fac\ntor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty\n: nationally \nwe hear much about\n the latter whilst\n,\n e\nven now\n,\n \nthe importance of Transport Poverty \nis not \nwidely\n \nrecognised\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3. \nD\nRT s\nervices\n are \noften\n \nunsuitable\n for \nregular\n \ncommuting\n to work. \nFor understandable reasons including juggling balance the need to meet diverse demands, \nschemes \noften \nonly allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs.\n \nTherefore \nDRT\n, when it is cost-effect\nive, \nis \nlikely\n to \nwork\n better\n for off-peak \naccessibility\n needs to \nshopping\n/ \ntown\n \ncentre\n \nfacilities\n and \nservices\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.4. \nOff\n-\npeak rural services in Devon tend to be more cost\n-\neffectively operated\n, on the margin,\n by buses that are fully used in the peak for c\nommuting etc., rather than those buses being parked in the off-peak and using \nadditional \nother smaller vehicles for off-peak DRT services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?&#xa0;\n6.\n1. Relative Cost\nThe \noverriding \nchallenge\n \nis\n the \nunchangeable\n \ndefining\n feature of \nisolated\n \nrural \ncommunities\n: low \npopulation\n and long \ndistances\n from centres that provide essential services and employment. \nTransport will therefore \nalways be expensive to provide in terms of cost per passenger; this is inescapable, and the main challenge \nwill the\nre\nfore\n always be funding, and what is deemed worth funding. \n&#xa0;\nRural high cost/ passenger services will always compet\ne unfavourably for shrinking council funding with lower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services. Cost/ passenger is a prime assessment tool, as applying it to decisions on service cuts provides the means of minimising the number of people affected b\ny service reductions. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n2. \nNetwork\n \nEfficiency\nDevon County Council has reduced the amount needed to support the local bus network through growing supported bus services to commercial operation and through working with operators of failing commercial serv\nices to make them fully commercial and financially sustainable in the long term. This reduction in funding that would otherwise be needed to continue to support the current network amounts to £2m annually, or 40% of the current bus support budget.\n I.e. wit\nhout growing these services the cost to the public purse of the current bus network would be 40% higher.\n&#xa0;\nBut \nin spite of Devon’s success in \ngrowing network efficiency and effective management of the network in this way, and \nin achieving \npassenger growth i\nn the last decade in contrast to\n \nthe national trend outside London, it has become clear that bus services which require a significant amount of funding support \ntend to be \nboth \ndifficult\n to grow\n and \nunlikely to ever become financially viable if funding supp\nort ended. \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n. \nThe “\nm\nyth of the empty bus”. \nIn Devon all supported bus services use buses that are fully used in the peak hours. Using these buses in the off-peak will at times mean they are perhaps largely empty, but it is still more cost-effective to\n provide rural services using these vehicles on the margin than to use other (additional) vehicles for lower demand off-peak travel, with the added costs that would bring. Many commercially viable bus services are also empty at times – to see a bus empty a\nt times does not mean that resource is being wastefully used. Nevertheless this misperception may be in danger of distorting how society generally may value rural bus services as funding shortfalls result in increasing competition for dwindling funding res\nources across councils.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n. \nThe \nNon-\nStatutory\n \nNature\n of \nPublic\n Transport \nFunding\nThe non-statutory nature of council bus service support relative to e.g. social care, school transport, and the need to maintain roads, means that no matter how sympathetic \na council may be towards maintaining bus support, the size of the Spending Review funding cuts will inevitably mean that there will be little funding left for non-statutory services.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n5. \nENCTS Scheme Costs\nIn Devon the cost of the statutory English Natio\nnal Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) is double that of the cost of supporting rural bus services. Whilst Devon sees the benefits of the scheme to eligible passholders, given the acute pressure on revenue budgets from the Spending Review, it has to be qu\nestioned nationally whether it is sensible to continue to fund statutory free travel when this is at the expense of a reduced ability to travel through cuts to council funded routes.  \n&#xa0;\n6.\n6\n. Cross-Sector Benefits \nA \nsignificant\n \nelement\n of the \nvalue of bu\ns \nservices lies in other \norganisations\n or in wider \npolicy\n aims\n, e.g.\n:\n&#xa0;\nIt is difficult to \nfully \nengage with local public sector departments on this while government is not joined-up and does not provide joined\n-up targets and messages on this to the local agencies. Agencies are not keen to work with the council to part-fund transport, even where this may reduce their overall net costs,  as their aims handed down from central government do not encourage this. \nAs \na result it is difficult for \nlocal government\n to\n successfully engage in joined-up service and budgetary planning with other public sector agencies when central government departments are not working together sufficiently on these issues\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.\n7\n. Long Term \nBenefits vs. Short Term Funding Needs\nA significant element of the \nknown significant \nbenefits \nof public transport \nwould also only be realised in the long term. \nT\nhe contribution of council public transport funding towards the \neconomy, employment, youth oppo\nrtunities is critical. Transport is a key component of action required to succeed on \nthe Prevention Agenda \n– reducing de\npendence \no\nn\n bene\nf\nit\ns\n through enabling employm\ne\nnt\n;\n reducing dependence on \nbespoke care services through increased independen\nce in life\n at\n all ages; reducing ill-health through improving healthy lifestyles. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe payback is long term, and budget cut targets need to be met this year or next. So no matter how much it would be sensible to continue to provide funding for public transport, as th\ne payback is (a) often not within the council, and (b) not short-term or immediate, the\ns\ne \nimmediate \npressures are \nunderstandably \ngreater than the long\n-\nterm need to continue public transport funding.\n   \n&#xa0;\n6.8. Summary\nTo summarise, the \nsignificant \ncross-sect\nor benefits that bus services provide\n,\n across society and \npolicy aims\n,\n need to be reflected in national policies to enable these linkages to be made locally - by recognising the need to treat \ntransport funding \nas wider than a purely \ntransport budget\n issue.\n Only through such a new approach will \nthe public sector achieve the benefits that will accrue and grow from continued public transport funding\n and will it avoid increas\ning\n future costs and problems that would result \nif this is not addressed urgently.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
