"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by St Mungo’sSt Mungo’s has been opening doors for homeless people since 1969. We currently run over 100 projects, providing accommodation for more than 1,700 people every night and helping thousands more who are rough sleeping or at risk of homelessness. St Mungo’s delivers a range of residential services from emergency shelters to semi-independent flats, as well as non-residential health, education and employment services. We also prevent homelessness through our housing advice programmes. \n&#xa0;\nSt Mungo’s services are based on a recovery approach and we aim to work in partnership with clients in a personalised, effective way. Our clients often have complex problems that cause, or are caused by, homelessness; we deliver holistic support to help people rebuild their lives.\n&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0; \nLocal housing allowance (LHA) caps combined with high demand for rental properties are likely to be making people homeless - There has been a 78 per cent increase the number of people becoming homeless due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy, \nwhich is \nthe most common type of private tenancy, \nwhen the first quarter of 2013 is compared to the first quarter of 2011.\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nHousing that is available with LHA rates is decreasing in quality and increasing the risk of homelessness - Living in a poor quality property\n can often impact on tenants\n’\n health \nand\n l\neads\n to an increased risk of homelessness.\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nThere is less housing available for people who are homeless in London to move into. This could result in insufficient beds being available for people who are sleeping rough - W\ne are concerned that \nthe shortage of available housing \nwill \nresult in \na\nn\n \nincreasing\n number of our clients be\ning\n stuck in supported accommodation\n,\n despite being ready to live independently. This \ncould\n cause o\nu\nr hostels to ‘silt up’, meaning we cannot provide beds people who are\n sleeping rough.\n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nLHA caps mean that more people who have been homeless and have settled into private rented accommodation will have to move again, but without any financial assistance - This \nleads to\n an increased risk of repeat homelessness \n1.5.\n&#xa0; \nUnresolved welfare reform issues, particularly those relating to supported ‘exempt’ accommodation, \nare threatening to disrupt the provision of supported accommodation for people who are homeless - Failure to resolve these issues could \nlead to\n a\n further reduction \nin \nthe\n \namount of accommodation available for people who are homeless. \n1.6.\n&#xa0; \nUniversal Credit direct payments: more detail is needed in plans for alternative payment arrangements and local support services - I\nt is vital that \nlocal support\n \nservices are effective\n and tha\nt suitable alternative pay\nment\n arrangements are in place\n \ni\nn order to prevent Univers\nal Credit causing homelessness.\n \nThere is a particular need for \nmore clarity \nover \narrangements and support for claimants transitioning from supported accommodation to \nindependent accommodation.\n1.7.\n&#xa0; \nThe transfer of responsibility for the much of the social fund to local authorities has seen varying provision put in place. Local authorities have refused assistance to people who are moving out of their area - This means people\n are \ntreated as \nnot \nresident anywhere for \nlocal support fund purposes and so cannot access any funds\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.8.\n&#xa0; \nRequirements to apply for a budgeting loan before a local support fund will be considered have been put in place in some areas - This is resulting in\n peo\nple who have been \nhomeless people starting a\n new tenancy saddled with debt, increasing the risk of repeat homelessness. It is unclear why some local authorities have decided to adopt this measure, unless it is an attempt to deflect costs that they should m\neet onto the DWP.\n1.9.\n&#xa0; \nThe replacement of council tax benefit with localised schemes has led to significant extra costs for people on low incomes, particularly in poorer areas.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0; \nLHA caps combined with high demand for rental properties are likely to be making people homeless, especially in London. 2.2.\n&#xa0; \nin April 2011 t\nhe Government introduced caps on the maximum amount of LHA, \nthe\n type of housing benefit that people living in private rented accommodation\n claim\n.\n \nSince these caps were introduced\n,\n official\n statistics\n show a dramatic rise in the number of people who have become homeless after losing private rented accommodation\n.\n \nThere has been a 78 per cent increase\n in\n the number of people becoming homeless due to the end of an assured shorthold tenancy\n, the most common type of private tenancy,\n when the first quarter of 2013 is compared to the first quarter of 2011.\n \n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nCaps to LHA are likely to be partly responsible for t\nhis increase. \nFew l\nandlords are lowering rents \nas the amount of housing benefit that their tenants can claim is capped. \nDepartment for Work and Pensions research shows that 37 per cent of private landlords \nin London \nhave taken action to evict tenants or no\nt renew tenancies when there is a shortfall between LHA and rent\n, \nwhile \njust \n6 \nper \nwould consider \nlower\ning\n rent\n for a current tenant\n.\n \nDWP research also\n \nthat landlords and housing advisors believe that the changes to LHA are behind increases in homelessnes\ns.\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nIn\n August\n 2012 Hackney Citizens Advice \nfound that just nine per cent of rental properties on the market\n in Hackney\n were within LHA limits for self contained accommodation. Ninety per cent of\n \nproperties within these limits were owned by landlords un\nwill\ning to\n \naccept LHA claimants\n. Therefore \nonly one per cent of rental properties \nin Hackney were available to LHA claimants.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe annual cap of a\n one \nper cent\n increase to the LHA cap that will take effect from April 2014 will \nfurther reduce\n the number of \nren\ntal properties available in London with LHA levels\n,\n as rents look certain to rise\n by more than \none\n per cent\n a year.\n \nThe Government could mitigate this widening affordability gap through targeting LHA affordability funding at areas in London. \n2.6.\n&#xa0; \nIf people can\nnot \nfind affordable rented\n accommodation then there is usually no other type of accomm\nodation that they can rent or buy\n. \nS\nome people m\nay cho\no\nse to move\n areas\n with cheaper housing available. O\nthers may try to remain within living distance of their work, \nfamily, friends or services that the\ny\n rely on such as schools\n and medical care\n. These people \nmay sofa surf or squat, or end up rough sleeping and/or presenting themselves as homeless to their local authority.\n \n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0; \nIn St Mungo’s experience an ever greater proportion of the accommodation which is available within LHA rates is \nin \npoor\n condition. \nT\nenants \noften move into these properties\n as they feel they have no \nchoice\n but do \nso,\n hoping that repairs and maintenance work\n will be completed by the landlord. Living in a poor quality property\n can often\n impact \non tenant’s health and\n lead\ns\n to an increased risk of homelessness.\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe introduction of the LHA caps has made it more difficult for St Mungo’s clients to move out of our projects and into private \nrented housing, especially in London. In the last two years there has been a steep decline in the number of our clients who have move\nd\n on from our projects into social housing. Over the same period the number of clients moving into private rented housing h\nas ceased to grow.\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nWe are concerned that this will mean an increasing number of our clients will be stuck in supported accommodation \ndespite being\n ready to live \nindependently\n. This is likely to cause our hostels to ‘silt up’, meaning we cannot \nprovide beds\n \npeople who are sleeping rough.\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nAs landlords raise rent to levels not met by LHA, m\nore peo\nple who have been homeless \nbut have since moved into private rented housing \nwill have\n to move at the end of a tenancy\n.\n \nWhen homeless they may have been assisted to move into private housing by a local au\nthority or \nother service through contribution\n towards\n \nthe deposit and \nrent \nadvance\n. However, this assistance is \nusually non transferable, meaning that at the end of \nthe\n initial \ntenancy the \nperson\n has no financial assistance \nto secure a new home. \nThis leads to an increased risk of repeat homelessness\n.\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0; \nThere is considerable uncertainty around the immediate and long term effects of welfare reform on the funding of supported accommodation. \nThe \nGovernment consulted on the future of housing benefit and supported accommodation in 2011, but has yet to produce \na response to the submissions it received. \n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nIn the meantime \nthe \nGovernment has committed to retain current arrangements for meeting the housing costs of benefit claimants living in supported ‘exempt’ accommodation, i.e. housing benefit will be administered\n by local authorities\n and paid directly to the landlord.\n \nHowever, the legal definition of ‘exempt’ accommodation does not cov\ner all supported accommodation. It is likely that \nt\nhere are high support projects homelessness project\ns\n which may not meet the defi\nnition.\n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nPeople staying in supported accommodation that falls outside the definition (non exempt supported accommodation) will have support for their housing costs limited by the overall benefit cap. \nTh\nis will make it difficult to meet the cost of running p\nrojects designed for people with very high housing needs.\n \n \nI\nt is\n also\n unclear how people\n in these projects\n will be able to claim any support whatsoever\n through Universal Credit\n for housing costs for stays in non exempt \nsupported \naccommodation lasting less \nthan a month.\n6.4.\n&#xa0; \nSt Mungo’s understand that this is a complex policy area which\n the\n \nG\novernment are working with partners\n to resolve. A timely resolution \nis vital to enable \nproviders of supported accommodation\n \nto be able to plan for the future\n. Failure to reso\nlve these issues could \nreduce the\n amount of accommodation available for people who are homeless as homelessness increases. \n&#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0; \nSt Mungo’s are implementing a strategy to boost the financial and budgeting skill\ns of our clients. However, uncertainty over DWP’s plans around alternative payments and local support services mean it is extremely challenging to plan how the support we provide can be coordinated with Universal Credit.\n7.2.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe\n Universal Credit \nl\nocal \ns\nupport \ns\nervices \nf\nramework and \nal\nternative payments arrangements guidance\n \nset out the \nG\novernment’s approach to deciding \nwhich claimants\n should be \nexempt \nfrom direct monthly payments and how budgeting support for claimants is to be provided. The current documents \nset out an over\nall approach but are lacking in detail\n7.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe DWP’s direct payment pilots showed significant increases in rent arrears when dir\nect payments were introduced.\n \nD\nirect payments have the potential to lead to\n increased levels of homelessness, substa\nnce use and financial exploitation if the correct alternative payments and budgeting support are not in place.\n Alternative payment arrangement\ns\n and budgeting support must be targeted at the correct claimants and effectively administered.\n In this context r\neports \naround \nproblems in administering the \nso far \nextremely limited roll out \nof \nUniversal Credit\n are cause for deep concern.\n7.4.\n&#xa0; \nThere is a particular need for clarity over arrangements and support for claimants transitioning from supported to independent acc\nommodation. There is a risk that claimants could move from living in supported accommodation where there housing costs are paid directly to their landlord\n,\n to living \nin\n independent accommodation with no support available\n,\n and receiving all of their Univers\nal Credit award in one monthly payment.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;8.1.\n&#xa0; \nLocal authorities have refused assistance to people who are moving outside of their boundaries. This means people are treated as not resident anywhere for local support fund purposes and so cannot access any funds&#xa0;\n8.2.\n&#xa0; \nPeople in this \nsituatio\nn\n may \nnot be able to ask for help from the \nlocal authority that\n they are\n moving into\n. Th\ney\n are likely to\n need assistance before mov\ning\n and s\nome \nlocal authorities\n require a minimum residence period before applications will be considered. \nGood practice standards should be adopted across London – or preferably nationwide – so that no\n \none finds that they are effectively not treated as resident anywhere for \nloc\nal suppo\nrt fund\n purposes and so cannot access any funds.\n&#xa0;\n8.3.\n&#xa0; \nRequirements to apply for a budgeting loan before a local support fund will be considered have been put in place in some areas 8.4.\n&#xa0; \nThis is \nresult\ning \nin homeless people starting a new tenancy saddled with debt,\n undermining their chances of sustaining the tenancy\n.\n The scheme operated by the DWP did not require a budgeting loan application to be applied for before a Commun\nity Care Grant would be awarded. It is unclear why some local authorities have decided to ado\npt this measure\n, unless it is an attempt to deflect costs that they should meet onto the DWP.\n&#xa0;9.1.\n&#xa0; \nSt \nMungo’s works across a number of local authority areas, we have seen significant variation in the way in which local schemes to replace council tax benefit\n operate. \nWe have observed that p\neople on low incomes \nin \nsome of the poorer areas in which we operate\n,\n have been asked to make the highest contribution to council tax. This can \nmeans that people are now expected to pay a significant proportion of their income on council tax.\n9.2.\n&#xa0; \nSt Mungo’s runs Peer Advice Link, a resettlement and tenancy support programme st\naffed by volunteers. One of our volunteers now has to pay £13 a month in council tax. His income consists of £56.80 a week Jobseekers Allowance.\n He therefore has to spend over five per cent of his income on council tax.\n&#xa0;23 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-homelessness\n, Table 774\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/193477/rrep798.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monitoring-the-impact-of-changes-to-the-local-housing-allowance-system-of-housing-benefit-interim-report-rr-838\n \nhttp://www.hackneycabcrowdmap.com/wp-content/uploads/Locked-out.pdf\n see University of Sheffield \n(2011) For- home study: moves to independent living \nhttp://www.centrepoint.org.uk/media/57906/for-home_final_report.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-local-support-services-framework\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/s\nystem/uploads/attachment_data/file/228925/direct-payment-demo-figures-may-2013.pdf\n  see St Mungo’s submission to previous inquiry  on Universal Credit \nhttp://www.mungos.org/homelessness/publications/latest_publications_and_research2/1421_st-mungo-s-response-to-the-work-and-pensions-committee-universal-credit\n"
