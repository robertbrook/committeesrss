"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;As a campaigning organisation of blind and partially sighted people, we fight for the rights of people with sight loss in each of the \nUK\n’s countries. Our priorities are to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe also provide expert knowledge to business and the public sector through consultancy on improving the accessibility of the bu\nilt environment, technology, products and services.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe are pleased to have the opportunity to provide a submission to the work and pensions select committee in response to the call for evidence for the inquiry \ninto s\nupport for housing costs in the reformed welfare system\n. Our submission will focus on the implications of the new social sector size criteria introduced by the Government \nin April 2013 (also referred to \nas “the Bedroom tax” or “Spare room subsidy”).\n&#xa0;\nOn \n27 February\n 2013\n, Wayne David MP raised the issue of the social sector size criteria on behalf of his constituents during Prime Minister’s questions:\n&#xa0;\n“Mr and Mrs Goodwin live in the Caerphilly borough. They are both registered blind, and rely heavily on their guide dogs, family and neighbours. Life is not easy for them, but from 1 April it will become even more difficult, because they will have to pay the Government’s bedroom tax on the home in which they have lived for 26 years. What justification can there be for that?”Wayne David MP, 27 February 2013&#xa0;\nMr and Mrs Goodwin are not alone in facing \nsignificant \nincreased difficulties \ninhibiting their independence \nas \na result of the new size criteri\na\n; many blind and partially sighted people have contacted \nRNIB with deep concerns about the impact of the change, worried that they will be forced into debt or to move to an unfamiliar area where they end up isolated in their home\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Government have accepted that 63 per cent of those affected by the new socia\nl sector size criteria will be disabled\n;\n roughly\n 420,000 \npeople. B\nlind and partially sighted people make up approximately 4% of all disabled people in the \nUK\n, so \nthe number of \nblind and partially sighted people affected\n can be estimated at\n 17,000.\n&#xa0;\nRehabil\nitation training for a person with sight loss is designed to enable that person to live independently in their home and surrounding area and to travel safely to and from work. Being forced to move from that home \ncan create the absurd situation where a pers\non loses their sight, is provided with rehabilitation support, is forced to move property and area and subsequently requires all that training to be delivered again. It is an illogical \nwaste\n of\n the financial and personal investment both by the individual a\nnd their local authority. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore it could cause unnecessary considerable stress and may mean some blind and partially sighted people are either unable to continue with their current jobs or will need to cl\naim additional funding \nthrough A\nccess to \nW\nor\nk for taxi fares until they receive mobility training in their new area.\n&#xa0;\nN\nearly two thirds of people say that because of their sight loss they need help to get out of the house, a figure that\n \nwill only increase with \nfinancially enforced relocation\ns as a r\nesult of the new size criteria\n. This in turn will place further strain on already overstretched social services.\n&#xa0;\n“If I had to move I’d face weeks in isolation, unable to step outside the front door because it’s too dangerous. It’s a long process to learn a new area. I’d have to wait for a trained guide to teach me the roads.”Siobhan, 29&#xa0;\nThe new social sector size criteria risks pushing blind and partially sighted people over the tipping point to a \nposition\n of \nserious \nmental, financial and physical hardsh\nip. \n&#xa0;\nWe also urge the Work and Pensions \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee to take into account that blind and partially sighted people may rely on adaptations made to their house or an extra room \nto store\n bulky assistive technologies in considering their recommendations for the future of this Government policy. \n&#xa0;\nThe recent case in \nWestminster\n of blind housing association tenant \nSurinder\n \nLall\n demonstrates the im\nportance of the spare room for people with si\nght loss. Assistive technology is vital in maintaining independence both out and about and in the home. However, much of this equipment can be bulky and take up a significant amount of space, necessitating the use of another room for storage. It is unfair \nfor anyone to be penalised for needing more space due to their disability, and we are pleased that the courts recognised \nthis\n in Mr \nLall’s\n case.\n&#xa0;\nAlthough we believe this policy is an unreasonable burden to place on a blind or partially sighted individual \nfor the reasons outlined above, there is the added factor of the financial implications. \n&#xa0;\nIt has been estimated \nfrom the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) impact assessment that \ndisabled people will lose an average of £728 per year on housing benefit\n.\n At a time when people with sight loss are twice as likely to live in households with an income of less than £300 a week compared to those with no impairment \nand \ntwo in five people\n living\n with sight loss are having difficulty making ends meet (McManus and \nLord, 2012) this further financial burden \nwill have\n \nan amplified and \nsignificant impact. An \nincrease\nd two year\n discretionary housing payment budget\n,\n which the Government are relying on to offset the impact on disabled people\n, will not provide a long term s\nolution to the impact of this reform, \nand we know already that it is not covering \nall those who apply on the basis of their disability\n.\n&#xa0;\nWe would like to see the Government take immediate and urgent steps to ensure that people with severe sight loss are ma\nde exempt from the new restrictions to reflect their mobility needs\n. This needs to happen urgently; \nthe \nGovernment's \nproposed review date of March 2015 is too far away for many blind and partially sighted people already going through this process.\n&#xa0;\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
