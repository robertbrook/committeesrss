[[[AVTUG’s response to the committee’s points:]]]

[[[How do Government and Local Authorities identify demand for passenger ]]]

[[[transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?]]]There is a need for longer term planning than presently exists. Buckinghamshire County Council has no long term plan for transport.AVTUG identify 4 categories of demand for travel:Medical ShoppingFriendsRelativesAVTUG recognises the social and economic benefits that access to tranport brings to both individuals and communities.

[[[To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with di]]]

[[[sabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?]]]Insufficiently – for example:Dial a ride at its worst can charge up to £30 for a return fare to travel between an outlying village and the county town. The situation is particularly difficult in the northern, less populated, part of Aylesbury Vale.Marsh village lost its bus service and 5 car-less households were left without any means of travelling out from their small community.A new secondary school, on a new estate on the edge of Aylesbury town, is due to open in September 2013. As of early August no transport arrangements had been announced for its new students.There is a perception that profits come before service to the public.

[[[What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?]]]The cost of providing them.The lack of volunteers .This is not due to apathy, more volunteer fatigue. Buckinghamshire already boasts twice the national average of volunteers in the community.

[[[How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How cou]]]

[[[ld Community Transport be improved?]]]Larger communities, such as Wendover and Winslow already have community buses. This does not appear to be the solution for smaller more isolated communities given costs and volunteer issues referred to above.Local Area Fora already offer small cash incentives to local transport initiatives but these are necessarily limited.

[[[To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?]]]Please see reference to Dial a Ride services above. They are demand led, but their costs can be prohibitive. In such situations they are no answer to social isolation.

[[[What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How ca]]]

[[[n these services be made more affordable?]]]A long-term plan for transport by the county council would be a useful start. At present planning for the future is apparently too often influenced by more immediate financial considerations.August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
