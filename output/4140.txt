[[[SUMMARY ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We do not oppose a levy on plastic bags. &#xa0;However, the promotion of degradable bags via a levy exemption would be a very bad idea since such bags (both bio-degradable and oxo-degradable), according to scientific studies released by DEFRA and the Environment Agency: 

[[[1.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[have a greater environmental impact than conventional bags; ]]]

[[[2.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[cannot be separated from conventional non degradable bags, so the whole stream will go to disposal rather than recycling ]]]&#xa0;The study released by the Environment Agency states:  “

[[[Starch-polyester blend bags have a higher global warming potential and ]]]

[[[abiotic]]]

[[[ depletion than conventional polymer bags]]]….  This was partially due to it weighing approximately twice that of the conventional HDPE bags but also due to the high impacts of raw material production, transport and the 

[[[generation of methane from landfill.”]]]&#xa0;The study released by DEFRA states that “

[[[incorporation of additives… that cause plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects… ]]]

[[[Oxo]]]

[[[-degradable plastics are not suitable for recycling with main-stream plastics.”]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Apart from the damaging environmental impact of such degradable materials, some of which contain 

[[[heavy metals]]], it is 

[[[not possible to effectively sort and recycle them]]]. They will simply pollute other recycled materials. As a result the UK Government will fail to meet its stringent plastic recycling targets for 2017. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]An exemption for degradable bags would also be a 

[[[licence to litter.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]A better solution is to improve the recycling and reprocessing infrastructure in the UK for conventional carrier bags, 

[[[“Remade in Britain”. ]]]A very recent APSRG report, Chaired by Caroline Spelman MP, makes a series of important recommendations to ensure the UK maximises value from its waste. &#xa0;PlasRecycle has built the first plant in the UK to reprocess carrier bags and other post-consumer films back into a clean plastic granulate for reuse in new bags and in black sacks for sale in supermarkets. The plant has been funded by £10.7 million of investment, much of it from public funds, including from DEFRA’s delivery body WRAP, The Mayor of London’s Waste &amp; Recycling Board and the Foresight Environmental Fund. The plant can process over 20,000 tonnes per annum of post-consumer bags and films, equivalent to 2.5 billion singlet bags each weighing 8g or 600 million bags for life each weighing 33g. We have created 32 new jobs and will be expanding capacity in 2014. &#xa0;&#xa0;A number of scientific studies have been conducted which are relevant to the environmental impact of carrier bags:  &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]In February 2011 the Environment Agency released a study that concluded that:• The environmental impact of all types of carrier bag is dominated by resource use and production stages. Transport, secondary packaging and end-of-life management generally have a minimal influence on their performance.• Whatever type of bag is used, the key to reducing the impacts is to reuse it asmany times as possible and where reuse for shopping is not practicable, otherreuse, e.g. to replace bin liners, is beneficial.• The reuse of conventional HDPE and other lightweight carrier bags for shopping and/or as bin-liners is pivotal to their environmental performance and reuse as bin liners produces greater benefits than recycling bags.• Starch-polyester blend bags have a higher global warming potential and abioticdepletion than conventional polymer bags, due both to the increased weight ofmaterial in a bag and higher material production impacts.&#xa0;Further the report states   “The starch-polyester bag degrades fully to methane and carbon dioxide in landfill, producing a higher global warming impact from the end-of-life than the paper bag, which does not fully degrade in landfill”.&#xa0;And further “The starch-polyester bag had the highest impact in seven of the nine impact categories considered. This was partially due to it weighing approximately twice that of the conventional HDPE bags but also due to the high impacts of raw material production, transport and the generation of methane from landfill.”&#xa0;Biodegradable means capable of being broken down by bacteria or other living organisms. ‘Bioplastics’ are made from natural materials such as corn-starch. Whilst this sounds like a green option, as per the EA report, the result is methane gas which is 23 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide. Compostable plastic is generally made from corn, a crop that is resource intensive, requiring large quantities land, water, and resources such as fertilizers for production. &#xa0;&#xa0;An alternative to starch based bio-degradable bags are bags that include “oxo-degradable additives” which are generally made of heavy metals. Oxidative degradation is a series of chemical reactions in which the long chains of polyethylene molecules are broken down into shorter lengths by the action of oxygen, ultra-violet light and/or heat. Defra commissioned Loughborough University to undertake a research project which assessed the environmental impact of oxo-degradable plastics across the life cycle. The key finding of this report was that 

[[[“]]]

[[[The overall conclusion of this review is that incorporation of additives into petroleum-based plastics that cause those plastics to undergo accelerated degradation does not improve their environmental impact and potentially gives rise to certain negative effects”.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Further : &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The length of time to degradation of oxo-degradable plastic cannot be predicted accurately because it depends so much on the environmental conditions. It is suggested that oxo-degradable plastics left in the open environment in the UK degrade to small fragments within 2 to 5 years. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Oxo-degradable plastics are not compostable, according to established international standards EN13432 and ASTM 6400. Oxo-degradable plastics should not be included in waste going for composting, because the plastic fragments remaining after the composting process might adversely affect the quality and saleability of the compost. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is thought that labelling the oxo-degradable plastics as biodegradable can lead to confusion on the part of consumers, who may assume that biodegradable plastics are compostable. This may lead to contamination of the composting waste-stream with oxo-degradable plastics. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Biodegradation of oxo-degradable plastics can only occur after they have fragmented and then proceeds very slowly, for example, at a rate many times slower than that of a compostable plastic.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Recycling]]]   Oxo-degradable plastics are 

[[[not suitable for recycling with main-stream plastics.]]] The recyclate will contain oxo-degradable additives that will render the product more susceptible to degradation.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Litter  ]]]Some oxo-degradable producers maintain that their products are a solution to the littering problem because oxo-degradable packaging will eventually degrade and then biodegrade. However, as the plastics will not degrade for approximately 2-5 years, they will still remain visible as litter before they start to degrade.&#xa0;Another review published recently in Environmental Science and Technology by a group of scientists including the polymer science division of the Indian Institute of Technology, finds that “degradable polyethylenes,“ used in one type of “recyclable” plastic bag, do not really disintegrate back into nature. The polyethylenes in the plastic bags studied are made by adding metals such as iron and cobalt to the mix of ethylene polymers, to speed up their oxidation. 

[[[But while such hybrid plastic bags once discarded, do indeed break into fragments relatively quickly, those shreds persist for a long tim]]]

[[[e.]]]  A number of users, for example TESCO and the CO-OP in 2010, stopped using oxo-degradable additives due to concerns about their environmental impact. This recent report states: “the results show that 

[[[e]]]

[[[ven in quantities as low as 2% ]]]

[[[degradable plastic films cause significant, detrimental impacts to the quality of ]]]

[[[plastic ]]]

[[[recyclates]]]. These impacts are not only detrimental in terms of mechanical properties of the recycled material, but also involve visual impacts on the newly produced film”. &#xa0;In this report, MEPs are calling for a phase out and/or 

[[[ban]]] of oxo-degradable materials – paragraph 5 of the Report states: “The most dangerous plastics, those that by scientific evidence are shown to be the 

[[[most disruptive to human health and the environment (such as micro- and ]]]

[[[oxo]]]

[[[-biodegradable plastics]]]) and those which contain 

[[[heavy metals and other substances that can also make recycling processes more difficult, should be phased out of the market or banned outright]]], as soon as possible before 2020 to develop a market for reused and recycled materials”. &#xa0;We are also concerned that certain manufacturers of degradable materials have been making misleading statements. We urge the Government to look at the underlying science &#xa0;Currently, we can effectively recycle plastic film from carrier bags and other secondary packaging many times, creating a “closed loop of polymer recycling” and contributing to the circular economy. The proposal to promote a degradable plastic bag would have potentially disastrous consequences for the nascent plastic recycling industry in the UK. Customers require a premium recycled material that has virtually the same properties as virgin polymer. Mixing degradable polymers with standard polythene feedstocks would result in premature degradation of the end product. This may manifest as a lack of impact or tensile strength, or an inability to process altogether as the resulting polymer matrix can potentially cause cross-linking, rendering impossible further processing into film or other products.&#xa0;It is not possible to efficiently separate degradable plastic from films sourced from UK Material Recycling Facilities and kerbside collections, even with modern sorting equipment and manual techniques. Sorting is simply not effective enough to guarantee the purity of the finished recycled output. Customers of recycled polymers want to manufacture a robust and reliable end product that will endure – they will not take the risk of their end product failing. Inclusion of bio or oxo degradable bags in the waste stream will make them refuse to include recycled materials in their product. This will cause substantial increases in carbon footprint by a return to virgin materials made from petrochemicals. 

[[[As a result ]]]

[[[the UK government will fail to meet its stringent plastic recycling targets set for 2017. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Further, if consumers believe that plastic bags will degrade, then the litter problem will in fact worsen. 

[[[Consumers will see this “solution” as a ]]]

[[[licence]]]

[[[ to litter]]]. There is no magic bullet – there is no magical material that will vanish once you have carried your groceries home. &#xa0;&#xa0;In fact we should be promoting recovery of the carrier bag waste stream, to be recycled back into new products, rather than simply thrown away to degrade. The UK Government should be encouraging recovery of this and other waste resources back into a recovery loop, also creating jobs in the UK. The APSRG's has very recently published a new report, Chaired by Caroline Spelman MP, that makes clear recommendations for policy change designed to ensure the UK maximizes value from its waste. We would encourage you to read this important document. &#xa0;&#xa0;It is also worth considering evidence from other parts of the world:&#xa0;

[[[USA    ]]]In the USA, there are proposed laws for several states which will require compostable or biodegradable containers &amp; packaging to be labeled 

[[[“not recyclable, do not recycle”]]] (Senate Bill 298). The laws aim to prevent contamination of the recycled plastic stream and protect a progressive industry which adds $3 billion of value to the economies of the states involved. These conflicting messages to the consumer create more problems for recyclers, and diminish the faith that people have in the feedstock and products that are made from it. Further, many of the compostable polymers are actually only degraded when subject to high temperatures or a specialist environment. Simply putting them in a garden rubbish pile will not activate the additives used and the bag or receptacle will still be around for years. According to the California Organics Institute: “the term biodegradable does not distinguish between a product that biodegrades in the soil in a thousand years, and one that biodegrades in a compost pile in 180 days.”&#xa0;

[[[Canada     ]]]The City of Toronto has very strict procedures, according to their website: “The City of Toronto 

[[[does not]]] accept&#xa0;biodegradable plastic packaging, including biodegradable plastic bags in the Green Bin organics or&#xa0;the&#xa0;Blue Bin&#xa0;recycling programs.”  The reasons for not accepting this material include:•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Biodegradable plastics are removed]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[during]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[organics processing.]]] There is no benefit or point for residents to add biodegradable plastic bags or packaging (i.e. snack food bags promoted to be compostable) into the Green Bin. All bags and packaging&#xa0;are removed at the beginning of Toronto's organics processing system. These products&#xa0;are not in the system long enough to break down. The equipment used cannot distinguish between a compostable/biodegradable bag or package from ones that are not, so all are removed and treated as residue garbage sent to landfill. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Biodegradable plastics can ruin recycling markets.]]] The plastics we recycle are used to manufacture new products such as landscape edging, decking and automotive parts. These products are manufactured to be durable and to not break down over time. The presence of biodegradable plastics puts the durability of these products with recycled plastic content in peril. The markets which buy waste plastic from municipal Blue Bin programs refuse to buy any material which may contain any bio-plastics. •&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Biodegradable plastics can put marketed recyclables revenue at risk.]]] 

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is crucial that the integrity of our plastic recycling contracts remain intact. The City generates over $20 Million per year from the sale of recyclables to help offset the cost of collecting recyclables. Bio plastics put a portion of this revenue at risk. “It is worth noting that where singlet bags have been levied in other countries, there is always an increase in the purchase of both thicker bags for life and of black refuse sacks, which require more plastic resin. This has happened in a number of other countries. &#xa0;We note that Lord de Mauley used this argument recently in May 2013, quoting from an article on Letsrecycle.com: 

[[[The Republic of Ireland’s levy had had the unintended consequence of causing an increase in sales of bin liners “because consumers no longer used free carrier bags to line their bins,” the minister said. “The production of bin liners has a bigger environmental impact than single-use carrier bags. In addition, following the introduction of the charge in Wales there was an increase in sales of bags for life. “As the aim of a charge is to reduce use, it could result in a worse environmental outcome if they are used only once or twice, because they need to be used at least four times to have a lower carbon footprint than single-use carrier bags”.]]]As such, we suggest that a better solution would be to give an 

[[[exemption (or partial exemption) for bags that have been made from recycled plastic.]]] These bags have a much better carbon footprint and can themselves be recycled. &#xa0;We are also very surprised to see a suggestion that paper bags might also be exempted from the levy. Paper bags have a far worse environmental impact that plastic carrier bags – see Environment Agency, Life Cycle Assessment of supermarket carrier bags, 2011 (Report: SC030148). &#xa0;In summary, the promotion of degradable bags would be a disaster for recycling programs and we strongly believe that the best solution is to improve the infrastructure for recycling and reprocessing of carrier bags and other consumer packaging films. &#xa0;6 December 2013&#xa0;
