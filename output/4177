[normal]Executive Summary[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A great deal of scientific effort has gone into the IPCC report and there is a lot of good science included.  However, because of the make up of the group writi
[normal]ng this report, 
[normal]I feel that 
[normal]there are several 
[normal]significant 
[normal]major inadequacies 
[normal]in the report, which undermine its quality.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Details and 
[normal]justification follow
[normal]s
[normal] in the next section.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Discussion.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report?[bold]  What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I have 
[normal]concerns about some 
[normal]important 
[normal]science 
[normal]which seems to have been omitted 
[normal]in the report.

[normal]The report has chosen not to evaluate the contribution of clouds in the summary figure TS.7 attached below.  There is 
[normal]an “aerosol-cloud” factor of 
[normal]~
[normal]0.5
[normal]5 W/m
[normal]2
[normal] with 
[normal]a 
[normal]relative
[normal] error bar up to 
[normal]~
[normal]1.3
[normal] W/m
[normal]2
[normal]. This is inadequate and underestimates the contribution 
[normal]of clouds to the radi
[normal]ation balance of the planet.  (
[normal]Double CO
[normal]2
[normal] forcing is 
[normal]~ 3.7 W/m
[normal]2 
[normal])
[normal]Marine stratocumulus 
[normal](layer) 
[normal]clouds 
[normal]cover 30% of the ocean surface, ~ 20% of the global planetary surface.  Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models (i.e. weather fore
[normal]casting models) have difficulty in getting sufficient and correct cloud fr
[normal]action / cover.  In 2008 there 
[normal]was a large VOCALS project which aimed at understanding the processes, which generate and dissipate these clouds.
[normal]  NWP models improved, but these solve
[normal] the equations on grids on 1 to 10km.  Climate models have gridpoints ev
[normal]ery hundreds of kilometres,  underestimate stratocumulus cloud cover.  With incoming solar radiation of 1350 W/m
[normal]2 
[normal], and a change of reflection /albedo in the equator regions from 
[normal]20% t
[normal]o 80% depending on non-cloud or cloud cover, combined with the under
[normal]-
[normal]representation of Marine Stratocumulus clouds
[normal] in the climate models
[normal], then 3.7W/m
[normal]2 
[normal] is far smaller than the potential errors in the reflected solar radiation.  Even a modest error in the cloud cover would le
[normal]a
[normal]d to feedback uncertainties of 10’s W/m
[normal]2
[normal]. The IPCC report g
[normal]ives a negative feedback of ~ 0.5
[normal]5 W/m
[normal]2
[normal] up to 
[normal]~1.3
[normal] W/m
[normal]2 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]for the cloud 
[normal]contribution. Th
[normal]is an 
[normal]unde
[normal]restim
[normal]ate of the cloud component forcing, which by
[normal] 
[normal]far dominates the uncertainties provided by aerosols etc.
[normal] 
[normal](see Figure TS.7 below taken fro
[normal]m a preparatory copy of the IPCC report)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The small error bars and the lac
[normal]k of discussion
[normal] / application is a hugely significant oversight.

[normal]     The methane emissions from the melting sub-Arctic permafrost are well documented in the scientific liter
[normal]atur
[normal]e. They
[normal] are hugely important in 
[normal]the earth’s radiation
[normal] balance and yet of small contribution
[normal] in the report
[normal].  The 
[normal]UK 
[normal]NCAS research aircraft 
[normal]used 
[normal]by UK scientists has produce
[normal]d
[normal] data and publications evaluating this.
[normal] Many S
[normal]candinavian scientists are publishing results.

[normal].
[normal]Methane is a gas which is 
[normal]arguably 20-70 times more effective as a greenhouse gas.  However, in Fig TS.7 below, methane does n
[normal]ot even appear as a gas
[normal] of 
[normal]much import
[normal]ance and with 
[normal]associated 
[normal]small error bars.

[normal]      Furthermore water vapour is an 
[normal]important greenhouse g
[normal]as.  The amount 
[normal]of water vapour, mainly found in the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere 
[normal]very much depends
[normal] on lower atmosphere temperatures and dynamical processes.  This is a large contributor to global greenhouse warming that should be 
[normal]more carefully 
[normal]evaluated.

[normal] 
[normal]    
[normal]Climate models are unable to describe (resolve) 
[normal]some of 
[normal]the important processes
[normal] which control the climate.   
[normal]The location
[normal] of “blocking anticy
[normal]clones”, high pressures in the Atlantic
[normal],
[normal] largely determine the flux of warm moist air to the North Pole.  Climate models cannot resolve these large scale meteorological features, basically because the smaller scale eddies in the atmosphere, which drive and maintain these large structures, are to
[normal]o small and cannot be seen or resolved by climate models.  Thus the transport of heat to the poles (the main kinematic function of the atmosphere on the global scale) is misrepresented.  The critical differences between the Northern Hemisphere circulation,
[normal] where the frequency of
[normal] “blocks” are under-represented 
[normal]and the Southern Hemisphere circulation, where blocks are far to
[normal]o frequent
[normal],
[normal] is important.  This inadequacy 
[normal]is of significant concern
[normal] in the prediction of future climates
[normal].  The increase in intensity of 
[normal]Southern North Atlantic hurricanes
[normal], observed, understood and predicted by meteor
[normal]o
[normal]logists, and which have significant impact o
[normal]n the North American climate is
[normal] not seen in climate models. The resolution in climate models is just not good enough to produce the
[normal]m as they are driven from smaller scale convective systems and easterly waves, too small for these models.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](vi)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]      The overall Meridional Heat f
[normal]lux 
[normal](MHF) 
[normal]in the climate models is, for the above reasons 
[normal]given in section (iv)
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]not adequate to simulate the 
[normal]flux of warm moist air to Artic regions
[normal].  
[normal]This 
[normal]issue 
[normal]is controversial
[normal] and topical but
[normal] 
[normal]getting these ideas into the mainstream 
[normal]scientific discussion 
[normal]is difficult 
[normal]partly 
[normal]due to the 
[normal]consequence 
[normal](
[normal]and a negative aspect
[normal])
[normal] of the peer review process
[normal], 
[normal]whi
[normal]ch is by n
[normal]ature reticent to
[normal]wards
[normal] new ideas.  
[normal]I would argue 
[normal]MHF 
[normal]is critically 
[normal]important to explain why
[normal] the Arctic Ice melt is very much more rapid than the models 
[normal]have 
[normal]predict
[normal]ed
[normal].  
[normal]Tentatively I would
[normal] suggest, that in just a few years time, the Arctic will be ice free
[normal] in September. (Ice-free I define as &lt; 15% broken ice).  Artic Polar ice retreats 
[normal]and advances each year, but 
[normal]Figure 1 below, shows that over the past 30 years the Arctic Ice volume has been very 
[normal]much 
[normal]significantly reduced.  This process can be reversed (a
[normal]nd hence why the climate sceptics and the climate green lobby 
[normal]both object to this hypothesis)  Yet
[normal] the overall assertion is that the sophisticated climate models do NOT
[normal] replicate this rapid decline (e
[normal]lephant in the room) and the “climate modelling industry
[normal]” largely ignore this.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?
[normal] To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the AR5 Physical Science Basis summary?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](vii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]     
[normal]The IPCC and the 
[normal]current structures are not an effective 
[normal]mechanism.  T
[normal]he peer review system is excellent at ensuring a good level of
[normal] scientific achievement.  When new ideas and approaches appear, history has shown th
[normal]at peer review procedures are far from ideal to provide funding for 
[normal]blue sky thinking.
[normal]  IPCC is a concensus document.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](viii)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he q
[normal]uestion is not as simple as po
[normal]litical intervent
[normal]ion and control
[normal].
[normal]  Certainly governments have a vested interes
[normal]t in being re-elected and there
[normal]fore not upsetting major commercial interests
[normal] or electorate into a change in life style
[normal] behaviour
[normal].  
[normal] In science
[normal], as above, 
[normal]accepted theories 
[normal]are difficult to 
[normal]change. History is full of such scientific challenges (
[normal](a) 
[normal]longitude measurement, 
[normal](b) flat earth etc) which cannot
[normal] be put down 
[normal]just 
[normal]t
[normal]o political intransigence. 
[normal] 
[normal]I would argue
[normal] also
[normal], the scientific
[normal] community 
[normal]is traditionally 
[normal]conservative, 
[normal]blinkered
[normal] a
[normal]nd self-
[normal]preserving
[normal]. (e.g. 
[normal](c
[normal]) 
[normal]when US satellites lost signals going into the Venusian atmosphere, the NASA scientists said it had hit a mountain 27km high, when every 
[normal]UK 
[normal]“A”
[normal]level
[normal] geology student  knew a mountain that high would sink into the g
[normal]round.  F
[normal]ew
[normal] 
[normal]scientist
[normal]s 
[normal]would accept the spectroscopic evidence of 
[normal]Sulphuric acid vapour.  (d
[normal]) the ozone hole 
[normal]was 
[normal]discovered 
[normal]by Joe Farnam 
[normal](BAS) 
[normal]when he contradicted
[normal] years of NASA satellite data whi
[normal]ch said there was no problem
[normal].
[normal]  Thus the sci
[normal]entific community (and the IPCC) shou
[normal]ld take
[normal] some of the blame.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ix)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]      
[normal]Some would argue that the academic scientific establishment is unable to 
[normal]recognis
[normal]e 
[normal]rapid change, 
[normal](e.g. AMEG group
[normal] hypothesis
[normal])
[normal].  New ideas 
[normal]often 
[normal]threaten the scientific community.  They
[normal] consider bigger computers and satellites 
[normal]alone 
[normal]will provide the solution, rather than new scientific ideas.
[normal]  
[normal]Although
[normal],
[normal] I would not go as far as
[normal] some climate scientists who say
[normal],
[normal] that the IPCC (document and report) ha
[normal]s now become a co
[normal]ncensus document 
[normal]unable to see the “elephant in the room
[normal] of very rapid climate change”
[normal] and 
[normal] “
[normal]a career gravy train 
[normal]for the scientists who have been promoted by being involved
[normal], and 
[normal]the 
[normal]lure of research grants and fame
[normal]”
[normal].  The report
[normal], in my vi
[normal]ew, 
[normal]has 
[normal]omissi
[normal]ons
[normal], two of which
[normal] 
[normal]I have explained 
[normal]above
[normal].  
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]major 
[normal]scientific 
[normal]criticism is that 
[normal]the report 
[normal]has ignored major meteorological processes
[normal] which
[normal] some 
[normal]would 
[normal]consider obvious and important.
[normal]  Blue sky research, needs to be funded by the government
[normal] but spent wisely
[normal]. 
[normal]The £3 million 
[normal]funding by EPSRC for the “SPICE” project was a classical example w
[normal]here government money was squandered on a project which had “good” 
[normal]peer reviewed” 
[normal]and
[normal] was
[normal] “acceptable”
[normal], yet
[normal] has resulted in
[normal] 
[normal]a waste of 
[normal]valuable resources
[normal].  
[normal] Many s
[normal]cientists
[normal] and engineers 
[normal]who understan
[normal]d
[normal] basic
[normal] meteorolo
[normal]gy and engineering
[normal],
[normal] predicted failure
[normal] yet, they 
[normal]were ignored because of 
[normal]the 
[normal]accepted 
[normal]“good peer review”.

[normal]I have

[normal]that

[normal], m

[normal]reenhouse gas which has
[normal] 
[normal]only been included 
[normal]as a small factor
[normal] in the report. 
[normal]  
[normal]Similarly, the contribution to greenhouse warming by water vapour in the boundary layer
[normal] although
[normal] important
[normal] has been underrepresented
[normal].   
[normal]The measurement of w
