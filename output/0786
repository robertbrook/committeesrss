Written evidence from Julie defaultHinksdefault (LTC 38)defaultAt the age of 41 I had breast cancer in 2006 and consequently had to have a mastectomy.
default 
defaultI had reconstruction at the time of my surgery which unfortunately was unsuccessful so had to have further corrective reconstruction in 2010.
default 
defaultAs a result of my initial surgery I developed 
defaultlymphodeama
default in my left arm.
default 
defaultA part from regular measurements and supply of compression sleeves there is no MLD ( Manual Lymphatic Drainage ) available in our area.
defaultI have been paying an excellent private MLD practitioner on a regular basis for the past 5 years.
default 
defaultThis treatment has vastly improved and managed my condition and this is going to be on going for the rest of my life. 
defaultI know it is the case with a
default 
defaultlot of ladies that 
defaultI have come into contact with that have developed 
defaultLymphodeama
default following surgery that it is just treated as unfortunate and something we have to just deal with.
default 
defaultI know financially the NHS is extremely stretched but as more an ladies are now ending up with this lifelong disability it seems very sad that his problem is not being totally understood and treated as the disability it is.
default 
defaultI have to be constantly aware of what I do in my day to day living and am not able to do a
default 
defaultlot of activities and general work that I used to be
default 
defaultable to do.
defaultI hope my account of my situation helps in maybe looking into this problem that affects so many people.
