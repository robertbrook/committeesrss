"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nHTMA (Highways Term Maintenance Association) \n(WRT 029)\n&#xa0;\nThe HTMA is the trade organisation which represents service providers who currently maintain around 80% of the highway network within the United Kingdom.  The Association aims to deliver high quality maintenance and asset management services, whilst seeking to drive positive change within the industry, for the communities within which we work.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1 The HTMA (Highway Term Maintenance Association) is a trade association representing the private sector providers delivering professional and maintenance services to strategic and local road networks around the UK. As such this response will deal with winter resilience in road networks only.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 HTMA believes that a considerable amount of work has been done by all agencies around the UK following the severe winters from 2009-12 to ensure that there is more resilience in dealing with the potential for severe, adverse conditions.  In general, this has been successful and we believe there is much better awareness of the pressures on the winter service which have a potential to disrupt the network than was the case in 2009-2010. There is evidence of a more proactive approach to contingency planning to alleviate these pressures.\n&#xa0;\n1.3 One of the primary concerns in 2009 and 2010 was the availability of salt and many authorities now have greater salt stocks available or arrangements with groups of similar authorities to share resources in difficult circumstances. As a minimum action, most authorities are much more proactive in their planning for managing salt stocks and re-stocking throughout the season. The strategic road networks have all acquired significant resilience salt stocks which would ease pressure on the readily available supply in the UK should prolonged, severe weather be experienced. This is important as it is difficult to significantly increase the amount of salt which can be purchased at short notice\n&#xa0;\n1.4 There is also experience of reducing requirements for salting should it be necessary to conserve salt and most authorities will have processes to move to such arrangements quickly built in to winter service plans. Communication of likely conditions and planned action has also improved greatly as it is understood that this proactive preparation for conditions will assist in ensuring that the public reduces demand and pressure on the network in times of extreme weather.\n&#xa0;\n1.5 Many authorities also have enhanced plans for self-help in communities and use of third parties such as farmers in extreme circumstances.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1 It is to be welcomed that budget allocations for winter maintenance have generally been maintained despite the severe pressure on public finances and reductions in most other areas of activity funded by revenue budgets. This demonstrates that the likelihood and impact of disruption to the network as a result of severe weather is fully understood. It does not mean that there has been no attempt to become more efficient as almost all authorities have looked at ways of providing the same or improved services for less by examining equipment, modern salting techniques such as pre-wetted salting and collaborating with others to make best use of resources.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 Some of the changes which have been made are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2.1 Investment in new equipment and enhanced spreading capability has taken place on strategic road networks. It is worth noting that in Scotland a very significant increase in spreading capacity has been put in place.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.2 Planning and management of\n \nsalt \nstocks \nis generally more proactive. There is more initial salt in stock due in part to additional capacity within authorities but primarily because of additional resilience stores in the strategic road networks. This, along with greater collaboration, will ease the pressure on the system in prolonged adverse weather.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.3 \nA number of trials of alternative de-\nicers\n \nand spray systems \nhave also taken place with plans to adopt these quickly if required.\n The use of pre-wetted salting techniques and the use of additives which prolong the effectiveness of salt have both increased resulting in a slightly reduced overall demand for salt.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.4 More use of sub-contract plant and equipment has been arranged in preparation for extreme conditions (including farmers).\n&#xa0;\n2.2.5 \nCommunication \nand co-operation \nis \nmuch prominent in winter service plans.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.6 Arrangements for self-help have been increased in many places and encouragement for the public treating footways has been promoted.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.7 The \nrevison\n of Appendix H of Well Maintained Highways, the sector guide for best practice, has been launched. This encourages and supports more precise specifications for salt spread\n \nrates in certain circumstances.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 On this last point, the HTMA has a concern that the equipment typically used in winter maintenance spreading in the UK will have difficulty in meeting the very exact and reduced spread rates. The most modern equipment, for example on the strategic road networks, will be better placed to try and achieve the specified requirements. However, the fleet for winter maintenance varies greatly across all the authorities in the country in terms of age and condition.\n&#xa0;\n2.4 Achieving the lowest spread rates will require good storage conditions for salt, high standards of vehicle maintenance, regular calibration and a more rigorous assessment of actual road surface conditions as opposed to reliance on weather forecasts. Weather and road surface conditions in the UK can be highly variable, prone to rapid change and more generally have more moisture present than colder, drier climates. Traffic at the time of salting \nare\n also important.\n&#xa0;\n2.5 Providers are concerned that the suggested lower spread rates are achievable in practice. The success of the salting strategies advocated in the revision of Appendix H will need close scrutiny.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1 The HTMA view is that a considerable amount has been done within limited budgets to try and prepare more rigorously for severe adverse weather.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn particular, the measures taken to increase salt stocks, reduce demand for salt, increase co-operation and encourage self-help are beneficial. \n&#xa0;\n3.3 \n              \nHTMA would suggest that careful consideration is required over the\n \nuse of low salt spreading rates below 10grammes per square meter\n. Spreaders have improved over time but the same techniques have been used for many years and the quality of output requires careful management and assessment given the widely varying conditions that exist across the UK.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 Heightened awareness and communication of winter action and potential periods of adverse weather are crucial in involving the public. Reducing demand on the network is critical to the success of winter operations and the importance of advance warning to motorists cannot be overstated.\n&#xa0;\n3.5 Whilst maintaining budgets and the increased resilience measures have improved preparedness in recent years, the risk associated with adverse winter weather is that the network will be disrupted for short periods in most winters. It is impossible to keep roads free of snow and ice at all times and road users must have the best possible information to make informed choices about their journeys.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
