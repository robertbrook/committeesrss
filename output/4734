defaultAround 70%
default of Free Schools have opened 
defaultin areas where there is a 
defaultneed for new school places
default, but they are also providing new good school places in areas where existing schools are underperforming.  Introducing choice for parents has been an important rationale for 
defaultmany groups, with 45% of pr
defaultimary and 34% of secondary Free 
defaultSchools opening in areas where the number of schools rated as ‘requires improvement’ or ‘inadequate’ is at or above the national average

defaultNew schools can

default from local

defaultThe fact that parents, teachers, local businesses and other interested organisations can now dem
defaultand, and set up, a new school
default – even where there is a surplus of places –
default challenge
defaults existing schools 
defaultto 
defaultreassess their own educational offer and attainment, helping to raise standards across the board. Anecdotally,
default we are already beginning to see the competitive impact of
default 
defaultFree Schools influencing the b
defaultehaviour of neighbouring schools
default. 
defaultFor example, since one primary Free School in Haringey started offering an extended day, a number of local primaries have 
defaultfollowed suit
default. Similarly, since a Free School was approved to open on the Isle of Wight next year offering pupils Latin, several local
default secondary schools have also decided to offer it.

defaultto 
defaultexpand

defaultThis is an ar

defaultof significant growth. In 2011

default.
default&#xa0;
default2.9default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 
defaultsome cases, outstanding schools have set up Free Schools to replicate their existing model
defaults
default. For example, Perry Beeches, an ‘outstanding’ secondary school in Bi
defaultrmingham has been able to open two
default 
defaultnew
default schools in 
defaultdeprived parts of the
default city
default where parents have 
defaultnot 
defaultpreviously 
defaulthad access to the same standard of education
default. In others, successful schools have been able to complement their existing provision by opening different phases or types of school. For example, 
defaultin London,
default St Marylebone School has recently opene
defaultd a Special school for pupils with speech, language and communication difficulties and
default Burlington Danes Academy will 
defaultsoon 
defaultopen a primary school to feed into
default its existing secondary school. And this growth hasn’t been limited just to Acad
defaultemies.
default 
defaultMaintained 
defaultschools have also taken advantage of the opportunity to open Free Scho
defaultols
default. For example, school leaders in one of the most deprived par
defaultts of Barking and Dagenham 
defaultrecently opened the Riverside School, which will share a Head with the exi
defaultsting Sydney Russell 
defaultschool. They
default will open a n
defaultew Special Free School in 2014
default. Similarly, in Slough a group of local Headteachers came together to form the SASH school 
defaultto help to meet the
default critical need for new secondary school places in the town.

default to grow rapidly, with

default. For example, 
defaultfrom next year

defaultFree School
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.11default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFinally
default with the policy starting to mature, we are seeing
default the emergence of the first Free School chains, with a number now looking to open a second or third school. For example, Canary Wharf College, one of the first ‘outstanding’ Free Schools, has recently 
defaultbeen approved to 
defaultopen
default a second primary school
default while 
defaultKha
defaultlsa Primary School, a Sikh ethos Free School in 
defaulta deprived area of

default and e

default Free School Meal (FSM) data is available for 72 of the 81 schools that opened in 2011 or 2012 and 50% of these 72 schools have more students on FSM than their

default&#xa0;
default2.13default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn some cases, existing schools are collaborating 
defaultto find 
defaultnew solutions to longstanding challenges –
default 
defaultthe East Birmingham Network Free School
default for instance has been
default formed by local schools for pupils who have traditionally fallen out of education
default while

defaultThe p

default or Uncommon
default. 
defaultSuch

default 
defaultAt the application stage g
defaultroups have to:

defaultSet out a strong vision for their school
default;
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevelop detailed education, finance and

defaultgood 
defaultschool
default;
default and
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProve there is need and demand for the school in their community.
default&#xa0;
default3.3default&#xa0; 
defaultThis is not t
defaulto say that further
default improvements cannot be made to the current approvals process to make it more rigorous
default. 
defaultIn particular NSN
default believe
defaults
default that greater expertise is needed when reviewing the governance elements of applications. With the growth of Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) the complexity of governance arrangements is increasing and ensuring that groups 
defaulthave effective structures in place to 
defaultgovern new schools is critical.
default&#xa0;
default3.4default&#xa0; 
defaultThe fast growth of the Free Schools programme
default has also meant that the process
default 
defaulth
defaultas
default 
defaultchanged, often quite substantial
defaultly,
default with each wave of applications. 
defaultHaving learned these lessons to create the more rigorous systems that are
default in place today, it will now be important to maintain these standards consistently.
default&#xa0;
default3.5default&#xa0; 
defaultOnce groups 
defaultare approved 
defaultto open a Free School, they 
defaultenter a ‘pre-opening’ phase during which they have to meet fur
defaultther stringent targets if
default the school 
defaultis 
defaultto 
defaultopen. This 
defaultincludes developing comprehensive education plans and policies; building financial systems and recruiting pupils. They must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community
default while the DfE 
defaultconducts an assessment of the impact the project will h
defaultave on other schools in the area.
default&#xa0;
default3.6default&#xa0; 
defaultThe DfE provides oversight and challenge to the project through a series of che
defaultckpoint meetings and, 
defaultbefore being allow
defaulted to open
default,
default the school must 
defaultbe inspected by Ofsted to ensure premises 
defaultand policies are up to standard
default.
default If the school is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the 
defaultproject may be cancelled 
defaultor delayed.
default&#xa0;
default3.7default&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough L
defaultocal 
defaultA
defaultuthoritie
defaults have no formal role in the approval of Free Schools, NSN encourages all groups 
defaultwe work with 
defaultto m
defaultake early contact with their
default LA
default. In many cases 
defaultgroups have been able to work collaboratively particularly
default 
defaultaround
default 
defaultprovision of data on places shortages and 
defaultthe identification of premises
default. 
defaultWhile 
defaultLAs 
defaultcannot formally block t
defaulthe opening of a Free School, 
defaultthey
default 
defaultcan 
defaultma
defaultke submissions to a 
defaultgroup’s public consultation or to the DfE’s impact assessment report 
defaultduring the pre
default-
defaultopening stage.
default 
defaultFor Special (and in some cases 
defaultAlternative 
defaultP
defaultrovision
default) Free Schools
default, the
defaultir
default support is essential since 
defaultL
defaultAs
default must provide evidence of demand for their proposals.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOversight and accountability default&#xa0;
default3.8default&#xa0; 
defaultFree schools are subject to greater examination than almost any other type of state
default-funded
default school. Not only are they subject to the same accountability framework
default 
defaultas 
defaultany Academy
default but they face additional levels of scrutiny. The political controversy which has surround
defaulted
default the policy means that Free Schools are the subject of intense analysis from local and national media as well as other interest groups. Even 
defaultmore important
default, because
default parents have actively chosen a Free School, often before it even physically exists, they have high expectations of what the school will deliver and are more engaged in holding it to account.
default&#xa0;
default3.9default&#xa0; 
defaultOnce open, Free Schools have the same legal status as Academies
default which is formally set out in a Funding Agreement
default, signed by the Secretary of State and the 
defaultCompany Limited by Guarantee that operates the new academy
default. Free Schools are expected to adopt a model funding agreement which, amongst other 
defaultthings, states that t
defaulthey must follow the School Admissions Code, be inspected by Ofsted, publish their results and provide a broad and balanced curriculum, which cannot teach anything counter to fundamental British values, or creationism.
default&#xa0;
default3.10default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a seven year notice period i
defaultn standard Free School funding agreements
default. 
defaultI
defaultf a Free School is found to be in breach of it any time before then, the Secretary of State 
defaulthas the power to 
defaultterminate 
defaultthe agreement. 
defaultThis power has proved reasonably
default effective – it was the threat of terminating 
defaultthe funding agreement that allowed the 
defaultDfE 
defaultto 
defaulttake action 
defaultin terms of the governance of
default 
defaultAl-Madinah
default in Derby
default 
default– requiring them 
defaultto 
defaultaccept new 
defaultmanagement
default or face termination
default.
default It is worth noting however that there is no defined point at which an agreement is re
defaultviewed and, apart from this power to terminate, there is no power to intervene or pass management of 
defaulta Free School or an 
defaultacademy to someone else. The need for these wider powers and the standard period of funding agreements should be 
defaultreviewed to ensure 
defaultthat they allow swift and decisive action can be taken in cases where there are serious concerns about the school
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.11default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe EFA oversees the financial management and governance of Free Schools through a named contact for each school
default 
defaultand 
defaultwho visits the
defaultm in thei
defaultr
default first term
default. DfE Education Advisers 
defaultalso visit new schools 
defaultin the autumn term of each of the first two years of 
defaultoperation
default. 
defaultFinally, 
defaultOfsted inspects the school within two years of opening 
defaultassessing against the same standards 
defaultrequired of all state schools. 
default These assessments are used to identify potential risks to schools and risk rate each school, with particular concerns being escalated through further monitoring. 
defaultIt was through this route that the issues at Discovery New School
default in Crawley
default were identified 
defaultand 
defaultsubsequently 
defaultaddressed.
default&#xa0;
default3.12default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Secretary of State can take a number of actions in relation to failing Free Schools:
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAllow Ofsted to follow its standard processes for all state schools through subsequent inspection and monitoring; 
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultD
defaultemand a compreh
defaultensive 
defaultplan to address failure; 
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIntervene to appoint and rem
defaultove governors; 
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransfer the running of the school to a different Academy sponsor; or
default—
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTerminate the school’s funding agreement and close the school
default3.13default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAttention has been drawn to the weaknesses of a small number of the first Free Schools, which have been exposed either by inspection from Ofsted, investigation by the EFA or by individuals bringing matters to the attention of the DfE. In all cases the resp
defaultonse has been both swift and practical. There is little evidence to suggest that intervention would have been any swifter if these schools had been s
defaultubject to LA oversight – for instance 
defaultthere are currently more than 350 maintained schools in special measu
defaultres, nearly a third of which have had that status for more than a year.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1default&#xa0; 
defaultIf Free Schools are to reach their full potential in 
defaultimproving
default standards
default, 
defaultusing their academy freedoms
default, 
defaultintroducing innovation into
default the system
default, 
defaultallowing outstanding providers to open new schools, encouraging competition
default and increasing
default the number of good school places in the system
default, it is important
default 
defaultthat both the approval and oversight systems to which Free Schools are subject are designed to protec
defaultt and encourage their distinctive features and the unique addition they make to the schools system
default&#xa0;
default4.2default&#xa0; 
defaultUnderlying these distinctive features is the fact that new 
defaultproviders and 
defaultinnovations have 
defaultthe potential to raise educational standards 
defaultby 
defaultbring
defaulting
default challenge
default and competition to existing systems, even if this means creating a surplus of places. 
defaultAny 
defaultrevisions to the 
defaultapproval 
defaultand 
defaultoversight systems
default, especially if they are designed 
defaultto accommodate all a
defaultcademies or schools more widely, will 
defaulttherefore 
defaultneed to be caref
defaultully assessed to ensure they do 
defaultnot create unforeseen 
defaultbarriers
default or stifle the development and potential of the Free School programme in particular
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3default&#xa0; 
defaultThis need is particularly a
defaultcute when it comes to
default the
default 
defaultapprovalsdefault 
defaultprocess where it is important to
default ensure that good schools continue to be approved to open where they are needed
default and wanted by local parents
default – including
default when they will be competing with existing 
defaultunderperforming

default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities and local schools, as providers with 
defaultresponsibil
defaultity for managing and overseeing 
defaultexisting 
defaultschools
default in a given region
default 
defaultmay be inclined to resist 
defaultwhen it
default comes to considering the introduction of alternative school
defaults
default that might challenge the status quo. In light of this, 
defaultNSN believes 
defaultt
defaulthe approval process for Free Schools should remain independent of Local Authorities and other local existing providers. 
defaultWhile it is undeniable the 
defaultFree School programme has a strong momentum behind it
default, the scale of growth
default, even in the medium term,
default is likel
defaulty to be small enough that it should be possible to manage centrally.  
default&#xa0;
default4.5default&#xa0; 
defaultSimilarly, there are unique challenges in setting up an entirely new school and the right support and challenge is needed to ensure schools are set up to succeed not fail. 
defaultStrong accou
defaultntability and performance 
defaultcriteria
default are vital to the success of the Free School programme. In NSN’s view, the current framework is robust and, alongside the Ofsted systems that apply to all schools, has allowed the DfE/EFA
default/Ofsted
default to take swift and decisive 
defaultaction where necessary.  However, given the rate of growth in the number of Free Schools and academies more widely, the DfE’s capacity to monitor risks centrally and interv
defaultene where appropriate is becoming
default 
defaultstretched so it is 
defaulta sensible next step to fully 
defaultreview
default whether 
defaultthe current framework will remain fit for purpose
default.

defaultAPPENDIXdefault: defaultThe defaultcurrent approval processdefault&#xa0;
defaultAs it stands, the approval process falls broadly into two phases:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe application phase defaultGroups wanting to set up a Free School rightly have to 
defaultcomplete a demanding application process. Aside from the first year of the programme – when 
defaultgroups completed a much briefer initial application and then received paid for support to turn this into a detailed 
defaultbusiness 
defaultplan

defaultFollowing this, a number of applicants are invited for interview by a panel which includes representatives from the DfE, EFA, external educational advis
defaulters and independent experts.

defaultThe rigour of the application phase can be seen in’ the relatively low success rate of applicants, with only 26% of the 1103 applications received by the DfE being progressed to the pre-opening phase

defaultey must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community to ask whether stakeholders believe the school should open, and respond to any concerns.
default&#xa0;
defaultGroups also receive substantial support at this stage with finding, securing and developing a s
defaultite with the EFA taking all key decisions. Aside from this, the role of the DfE is largely to provide oversight and challenge to the project – through a dedicated project lead, education and finance advisers, who hold regular checkpoint meetings to review 
defaultits progress. 
defaultIf 
defaultthis is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the

defaultBefore being allowed to open, the school must also 
defaultpass
default two further requirements. First, it is inspected by

defaultthat it meets 
defaultnecessary standards
default around the quality of its premises and the provision of policies relating to issues such as the welfare, health and safety of pupils
default. Secondly, DfE officials must 
defaultconduct an
default assessment of the
default Free School
default’s impact
default on other schools in the area. Only at this stage, if all other requirements have been fulfilled, will the Secretary of State sign a funding agreement with the school which allows it to formally open.
