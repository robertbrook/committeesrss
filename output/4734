[normal]We have restricted our responses to those elements
[normal] of the Inquiry
[normal] most relevant to Free Schools and 
[normal]raised some key questions that will need to be considered to 
[normal]ensure that any 
[normal]system
[normal] that approve
[normal]s
[normal] and oversee
[normal]s
[normal] academies – including Free Schools – 
[normal]in future 
[normal]do

[normal] not limit the potential of these new schools to improve standards.

[normal]T
[normal]he first Free Schools 
[normal]open
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] September 
[normal]2011
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]early evidence 
[normal]suggests that they are ach
[normal]ieving what the policy intended
[normal]: 
[normal]creating good new 
[normal]local 
[normal]schools. 
[normal]Of the first 24 to open
[normal],
[normal] 75% have been
[normal] rated Good or Outstanding
[normal] by Ofsted
[normal] compared to
[normal] 
[normal]64
[normal]% of Local 
[normal]Authority (LA)
[normal] maintained schools inspected under the same regime
[normal] during the same perio
[normal]d
[normal]. In an even closer comparison, 
[normal]half of new local authority schools that opened at the same 
[normal]time as the 2011 Free Schools were rated as 
[normal]good or 
[normal]outstanding under the new Framework
[normal]. 
[normal]NSN 
[normal]believe
[normal]s
[normal] that
[normal] Free Schools will continue to 
[normal]raise 
[normal]standards 
[normal]both 
[normal]directly through 
[normal]the creation of good new school
[normal]s and
[normal] 
[normal]indirectly through the impact they have on 
[normal]surrounding schools 
[normal]because
[normal] of the following factors
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I[bold]ncreas[bold]e[bold] [bold]of providers[bold] within the system[bold] [bold]and the benefits of competition[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.2[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The opportunity to start a school from scratch has allowed teachers, charities, universities
[normal], independent schools and community groups
[normal] (oft
[normal]en in conjunction with parents)
[normal] to 
[normal]bring new ideas
[normal] and expertise into the st
[normal]ate sector, creating schools
[normal] 
[normal]which offer 
[normal]a new approach to meeting the needs of 
[normal]pupils in their area. 
[normal]Amongst others, s
[normal]chools have been set up by:

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]41[bold] 
[normal]parent/community 
[normal]groups
[normal],
[normal] often in areas where new school places are needed such as 
[normal]Camden,
[normal] 
[normal]Runcorn
[normal] and 
[normal]Leeds
[normal]; 
[normal] 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]37[bold] groups of t
[normal]eachers,
[normal] often in areas of high deprivation such as 
[normal]Greenwich
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Knowsley and Sheffield;

[normal]and existing 
[normal]education 
[normal]providers 
[normal]including the Nation
[normal]al Autistic Society,
[normal] Everton Football Club and
[normal] 
[normal]Southend YMCA
[normal];
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]21[bold] independent 
[normal]schools, 
[normal]including Manchester Grammar School, 
[normal]Brighton College
[normal] 
[normal]and Eton College; and 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Four[bold] universities – including King
[normal]’
[normal]s Colleg
[normal]e London and Exeter University.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Around 70%
[normal] of Free Schools have opened 
[normal]in areas where there is a 
[normal]need for new school places
[normal], but they are also providing new good school places in areas where existing schools are underperforming.  Introducing choice for parents has been an important rationale for 
[normal]many groups, with 45% of pr
[normal]imary and 34% of secondary Free 
[normal]Schools opening in areas where the number of schools rated as ‘requires improvement’ or ‘inadequate’ is at or above the national average
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]New schools can
[normal] act as a 
[normal]catalytic 
[normal]force, particularly 
[normal]thanks to
[normal] the support they 
[normal]receive
[normal] from local 
[normal]parents. 
[normal]The fact that parents, teachers, local businesses and other interested organisations can now dem
[normal]and, and set up, a new school
[normal] – even where there is a surplus of places –
[normal] challenge
[normal]s existing schools 
[normal]to 
[normal]reassess their own educational offer and attainment, helping to raise standards across the board. Anecdotally,
[normal] we are already beginning to see the competitive impact of
[normal] 
[normal]Free Schools influencing the b
[normal]ehaviour of neighbouring schools
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, since one primary Free School in Haringey started offering an extended day, a number of local primaries have 
[normal]followed suit
[normal]. Similarly, since a Free School was approved to open on the Isle of Wight next year offering pupils Latin, several local
[normal] secondary schools have also decided to offer it.

[normal]Increas[bold]ing[bold] [bold]innovation[bold] [bold]and [bold]testing[bold] best practice [bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.5[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Free
[normal] Schools are leading
[normal] educational innovation
[normal]. Though all mainstream Free Schools 
[normal]must offer their 
[normal]pupils a 
[normal]broad and balanced curriculum, some of them take a different approach to 
[normal]teaching and learning
[normal]. In many cases they 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]drawing on
[normal] international best practice and 
[normal]adopt
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]approaches from countries which consistently score highly in the PISA tests. Free Sch
[normal]ools are now pioneering the use of:
[normal] 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]‘Core Knowledge’
[normal] curricula, 
[normal]which 
[normal]are 
[normal]a feature of 
[normal]many 
[normal]top performing US states
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] used by Pimlico Primary Academy to raise the cultural liter
[normal]acy of deprived pupils
[normal]; 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]‘Forest School’ 
[normal]education
[normal], 
[normal]which is popular in 
[normal]Scandinavian countries
[normal],
[normal] is being used by West Newcastle Academy to engage pupils and parents in one of the most deprived parts of the city; 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]‘Maths Mastery’, 
[normal]which is based on the approach Singaporean schools use to teach Maths
[normal], 
[normal]is now being 
[normal]across the
[normal] 
[normal]ARK
[normal] network of
[normal] Free Schools; 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Project based learning
[normal] will be used in the XP Scho
[normal]ol in Doncaster and is
[normal] based on the success of ‘High Tech High’ in California;
[normal] and
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Bilingual
[normal] curricul
[normal]a 
[normal]are being taught to
[normal] students at 
[normal]Brighton Bilingual Primary School and the 
[normal]Judith Kerr School
[normal] 
[normal]where
[normal] half their 
[normal]studies 
[normal]are conducted 
[normal]in S
[normal]panish and German respectively. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]nitial indications 
[normal]also 
[normal]suggest that 
[normal]Free Schools 
[normal]are more likely to take advantage of 
[normal]Academy freedoms
[normal] than traditional 
[normal]academies
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]n a recent 
[normal]NSN 
[normal]survey
[normal] of mainstr
[normal]eam Free Schools (
[normal]2011 and 2012
[normal] openers)
[normal], 82
[normal]% of 
[normal]respondents said they 
[normal]make
[normal] use of
[normal] their freedo
[normal]m to offer a longer school day compared to 
[normal]10% of Academies
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]s new schools, Free Schools have unparalleled opportunities to measure the impact of 
[normal]these alter
[normal]n
[normal]ative approaches 
[normal]and 
[normal]so make an important contribution to improving the quality of educational research in England
[normal]. A number of Free Schools (like School 21
[normal] in Newham
[normal]) are working with organisations like the Education Endowment Fund to do just 
[normal]that.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Allow[bold]ing[bold] [bold]outstanding schools[bold] [bold]to expand[bold] and creat[bold]e[bold] new Academy chains[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.8[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Free School
[normal] policy i
[normal]s 
[normal]providing
[normal] new 
[normal]ways 
[normal]for successful schools 
[normal]to 
[normal]expand 
[normal]their educational offering, and 
[normal]disseminate
[normal] leadership and best practice across a wider network of schools
[normal]. 
[normal]This is an ar
[normal]ea 
[normal]of significant growth. In 2011 
[normal]existing state schools opened four 
[normal]of the 
[normal]free 
[normal]schools set up 
[normal](17%);
[normal] of those expected to open in 2014 that 
[normal]has
[normal] risen to 41 schools (35%)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]In 
[normal]some cases, outstanding schools have set up Free Schools to replicate their existing model
[normal]s
[normal]. For example, Perry Beeches, an ‘outstanding’ secondary school in Bi
[normal]rmingham has been able to open two
[normal] 
[normal]new
[normal] schools in 
[normal]deprived parts of the
[normal] city
[normal] where parents have 
[normal]not 
[normal]previously 
[normal]had access to the same standard of education
[normal]. In others, successful schools have been able to complement their existing provision by opening different phases or types of school. For example, 
[normal]in London,
[normal] St Marylebone School has recently opene
[normal]d a Special school for pupils with speech, language and communication difficulties and
[normal] Burlington Danes Academy will 
[normal]soon 
[normal]open a primary school to feed into
[normal] its existing secondary school. And this growth hasn’t been limited just to Acad
[normal]emies.
[normal] 
[normal]Maintained 
[normal]schools have also taken advantage of the opportunity to open Free Scho
[normal]ols
[normal]. For example, school leaders in one of the most deprived par
[normal]ts of Barking and Dagenham 
[normal]recently opened the Riverside School, which will share a Head with the exi
[normal]sting Sydney Russell 
[normal]school. They
[normal] will open a n
[normal]ew Special Free School in 2014
[normal]. Similarly, in Slough a group of local Headteachers came together to form the SASH school 
[normal]to help to meet the
[normal] critical need for new secondary school places in the town. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Free School 
[normal]policy has 
[normal]a
[normal]lso 
[normal]allowed the
[normal] best Academy chains
[normal] to grow rapidly, with 
[normal]45 multi-academy sponsors so far 
[normal]approved to open Free Schools, and to innovate with
[normal]in their chain
[normal]. For example, 
[normal]from next year 
[normal]the 
[normal]Harris
[normal] Federation
[normal] 
[normal]will offer academically gifted sixth formers fro
[normal]m London’s deprived inner boroughs the chance to study at a sixth for
[normal]m linked to Westminster School, while t
[normal]he Phoenix Family of Schools will be opening a b
[normal]ilingual 
[normal]primary 
[normal]Free School
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally
[normal] with the policy starting to mature, we are seeing
[normal] the emergence of the first Free School chains, with a number now looking to open a second or third school. For example, Canary Wharf College, one of the first ‘outstanding’ Free Schools, has recently 
[normal]been approved to 
[normal]open
[normal] a second primary school
[normal] while 
[normal]Kha
[normal]lsa Primary School, a Sikh ethos Free School in 
[normal]a deprived area of 
[normal]Leeds
[normal],
[normal] has been approved to open another school in Bradford 
[normal]which will share its STEM focus. 
[normal]

[normal]Reaching[bold] the[bold] most disadvantaged [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.12[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]NSN
[normal] bel
[normal]ieves that Free Schools should be targeting
[normal] the most deprived 
[normal]pupils
[normal] and e
[normal]arly evidence suggests 
[normal]they are
[normal].
[normal] Free School Meal (FSM) data is available for 72 of the 81 schools that opened in 2011 or 2012 and 50% of these 72 schools have more students on FSM than their 
[normal]LA
[normal] average. At Secondary this ris
[normal]es to 63%
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.13[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In some cases, existing schools are collaborating 
[normal]to find 
[normal]new solutions to longstanding challenges –
[normal] 
[normal]the East Birmingham Network Free School
[normal] for instance has been
[normal] formed by local schools for pupils who have traditionally fallen out of education
[normal] while
[normal] th
[normal]e London Academy of Excellence 
[normal]has been 
[normal]set up
[normal] by a group of independent schools to offer 
[normal]young people in Newham 
[normal]access to 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]high quality academic education
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.14[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The p
[normal]olicy has also enabled
[normal] dynamic groups of teachers to start schools in areas of high deprivation, often modelling themselves on some of the most successful urban Cha
[normal]rter School chains, such as KIPP
[normal] or Uncommon
[normal]. 
[normal]Such
[normal] motivation 
[normal]is 
[normal]behind Reach Academy 
[normal]Feltham and Greenwich Free School – both of which are led by teachers who use the same ‘no excuses’ approach, a longer school day and an emphasis on the education of pupils’ character to raise standards in those areas.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Approval[bold]3.1[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Free Schools 
[normal]under
[normal]go a rigorous approval process,
[normal] distinct
[normal] from th
[normal]at for
[normal] both converter and sponsored academies
[normal]. 
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] has evolved 
[normal]in every year since the programme began
[normal] and has built
[normal] on the experience of each 
[normal]of the five
[normal] 
[normal]application wave
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]The tightening of this
[normal] process was
[normal] noted by the recent NAO report
[normal], which found that the DfE has, ‘incrementally improved its selection and pre-opening processes’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]current 
[normal]proc
[normal]ess 
[normal]is 
[normal]demanding
[normal], 
[normal]only 
[normal]26% of applications 
[normal]submitted 
[normal]have been approved by the DfE
[normal]. A
[normal] full s
[normal]ummary of each stage is included
[normal] as an a
[normal]ppendix but a
[normal] brief outline is provided
[normal] here.
[normal] 
[normal]At the application stage g
[normal]roups have to:
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Set out a strong vision for their school
[normal];
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Develop detailed education, finance and 
[normal]governance plans
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]set out ambitious outcomes for their pupils
[normal];
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Prove they have the capacity and capability – especially in educational expertise – to run a 
[normal]good 
[normal]school
[normal];
[normal] and
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Prove there is need and demand for the school in their community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]This is not t
[normal]o say that further
[normal] improvements cannot be made to the current approvals process to make it more rigorous
[normal]. 
[normal]In particular NSN
[normal] believe
[normal]s
[normal] that greater expertise is needed when reviewing the governance elements of applications. With the growth of Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) the complexity of governance arrangements is increasing and ensuring that groups 
[normal]have effective structures in place to 
[normal]govern new schools is critical.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The fast growth of the Free Schools programme
[normal] has also meant that the process
[normal] 
[normal]h
[normal]as
[normal] 
[normal]changed, often quite substantial
[normal]ly,
[normal] with each wave of applications. 
[normal]Having learned these lessons to create the more rigorous systems that are
[normal] in place today, it will now be important to maintain these standards consistently.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Once groups 
[normal]are approved 
[normal]to open a Free School, they 
[normal]enter a ‘pre-opening’ phase during which they have to meet fur
[normal]ther stringent targets if
[normal] the school 
[normal]is 
[normal]to 
[normal]open. This 
[normal]includes developing comprehensive education plans and policies; building financial systems and recruiting pupils. They must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community
[normal] while the DfE 
[normal]conducts an assessment of the impact the project will h
[normal]ave on other schools in the area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The DfE provides oversight and challenge to the project through a series of che
[normal]ckpoint meetings and, 
[normal]before being allow
[normal]ed to open
[normal],
[normal] the school must 
[normal]be inspected by Ofsted to ensure premises 
[normal]and policies are up to standard
[normal].
[normal] If the school is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the 
[normal]project may be cancelled 
[normal]or delayed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Although L
[normal]ocal 
[normal]A
[normal]uthoritie
[normal]s have no formal role in the approval of Free Schools, NSN encourages all groups 
[normal]we work with 
[normal]to m
[normal]ake early contact with their
[normal] LA
[normal]. In many cases 
[normal]groups have been able to work collaboratively particularly
[normal] 
[normal]around
[normal] 
[normal]provision of data on places shortages and 
[normal]the identification of premises
[normal]. 
[normal]While 
[normal]LAs 
[normal]cannot formally block t
[normal]he opening of a Free School, 
[normal]they
[normal] 
[normal]can 
[normal]ma
[normal]ke submissions to a 
[normal]group’s public consultation or to the DfE’s impact assessment report 
[normal]during the pre
[normal]-
[normal]opening stage.
[normal] 
[normal]For Special (and in some cases 
[normal]Alternative 
[normal]P
[normal]rovision
[normal]) Free Schools
[normal], the
[normal]ir
[normal] support is essential since 
[normal]L
[normal]As
[normal] must provide evidence of demand for their proposals.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Oversight and accountability [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Free schools are subject to greater examination than almost any other type of state
[normal]-funded
[normal] school. Not only are they subject to the same accountability framework
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]any Academy
[normal] but they face additional levels of scrutiny. The political controversy which has surround
[normal]ed
[normal] the policy means that Free Schools are the subject of intense analysis from local and national media as well as other interest groups. Even 
[normal]more important
[normal], because
[normal] parents have actively chosen a Free School, often before it even physically exists, they have high expectations of what the school will deliver and are more engaged in holding it to account.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Once open, Free Schools have the same legal status as Academies
[normal] which is formally set out in a Funding Agreement
[normal], signed by the Secretary of State and the 
[normal]Company Limited by Guarantee that operates the new academy
[normal]. Free Schools are expected to adopt a model funding agreement which, amongst other 
[normal]things, states that t
[normal]hey must follow the School Admissions Code, be inspected by Ofsted, publish their results and provide a broad and balanced curriculum, which cannot teach anything counter to fundamental British values, or creationism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a seven year notice period i
[normal]n standard Free School funding agreements
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]f a Free School is found to be in breach of it any time before then, the Secretary of State 
[normal]has the power to 
[normal]terminate 
[normal]the agreement. 
[normal]This power has proved reasonably
[normal] effective – it was the threat of terminating 
[normal]the funding agreement that allowed the 
[normal]DfE 
[normal]to 
[normal]take action 
[normal]in terms of the governance of
[normal] 
[normal]Al-Madinah
[normal] in Derby
[normal] 
[normal]– requiring them 
[normal]to 
[normal]accept new 
[normal]management
[normal] or face termination
[normal].
[normal] It is worth noting however that there is no defined point at which an agreement is re
[normal]viewed and, apart from this power to terminate, there is no power to intervene or pass management of 
[normal]a Free School or an 
[normal]academy to someone else. The need for these wider powers and the standard period of funding agreements should be 
[normal]reviewed to ensure 
[normal]that they allow swift and decisive action can be taken in cases where there are serious concerns about the school
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The EFA oversees the financial management and governance of Free Schools through a named contact for each school
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]who visits the
[normal]m in thei
[normal]r
[normal] first term
[normal]. DfE Education Advisers 
[normal]also visit new schools 
[normal]in the autumn term of each of the first two years of 
[normal]operation
[normal]. 
[normal]Finally, 
[normal]Ofsted inspects the school within two years of opening 
[normal]assessing against the same standards 
[normal]required of all state schools. 
[normal] These assessments are used to identify potential risks to schools and risk rate each school, with particular concerns being escalated through further monitoring. 
[normal]It was through this route that the issues at Discovery New School
[normal] in Crawley
[normal] were identified 
[normal]and 
[normal]subsequently 
[normal]addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.12[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Secretary of State can take a number of actions in relation to failing Free Schools:

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Allow Ofsted to follow its standard processes for all state schools through subsequent inspection and monitoring; 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]D
[normal]emand a compreh
[normal]ensive 
[normal]plan to address failure; 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Intervene to appoint and rem
[normal]ove governors; 
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Transfer the running of the school to a different Academy sponsor; or
[normal]—
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Terminate the school’s funding agreement and close the school
[normal]3.13[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Attention has been drawn to the weaknesses of a small number of the first Free Schools, which have been exposed either by inspection from Ofsted, investigation by the EFA or by individuals bringing matters to the attention of the DfE. In all cases the resp
[normal]onse has been both swift and practical. There is little evidence to suggest that intervention would have been any swifter if these schools had been s
[normal]ubject to LA oversight – for instance 
[normal]there are currently more than 350 maintained schools in special measu
[normal]res, nearly a third of which have had that status for more than a year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]If Free Schools are to reach their full potential in 
[normal]improving
[normal] standards
[normal], 
[normal]using their academy freedoms
[normal], 
[normal]introducing innovation into
[normal] the system
[normal], 
[normal]allowing outstanding providers to open new schools, encouraging competition
[normal] and increasing
[normal] the number of good school places in the system
[normal], it is important
[normal] 
[normal]that both the approval and oversight systems to which Free Schools are subject are designed to protec
[normal]t and encourage their distinctive features and the unique addition they make to the schools system
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Underlying these distinctive features is the fact that new 
[normal]providers and 
[normal]innovations have 
[normal]the potential to raise educational standards 
[normal]by 
[normal]bring
[normal]ing
[normal] challenge
[normal] and competition to existing systems, even if this means creating a surplus of places. 
[normal]Any 
[normal]revisions to the 
[normal]approval 
[normal]and 
[normal]oversight systems
[normal], especially if they are designed 
[normal]to accommodate all a
[normal]cademies or schools more widely, will 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]need to be caref
[normal]ully assessed to ensure they do 
[normal]not create unforeseen 
[normal]barriers
[normal] or stifle the development and potential of the Free School programme in particular
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]This need is particularly a
[normal]cute when it comes to
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]approvals[bold] 
[normal]process where it is important to
[normal] ensure that good schools continue to be approved to open where they are needed
[normal] and wanted by local parents
[normal] – including
[normal] when they will be competing with existing 
[normal]underperforming 
[normal]provision
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities and local schools, as providers with 
[normal]responsibil
[normal]ity for managing and overseeing 
[normal]existing 
[normal]schools
[normal] in a given region
[normal] 
[normal]may be inclined to resist 
[normal]when it
[normal] comes to considering the introduction of alternative school
[normal]s
[normal] that might challenge the status quo. In light of this, 
[normal]NSN believes 
[normal]t
[normal]he approval process for Free Schools should remain independent of Local Authorities and other local existing providers. 
[normal]While it is undeniable the 
[normal]Free School programme has a strong momentum behind it
[normal], the scale of growth
[normal], even in the medium term,
[normal] is likel
[normal]y to be small enough that it should be possible to manage centrally.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly, there are unique challenges in setting up an entirely new school and the right support and challenge is needed to ensure schools are set up to succeed not fail. 
[normal]Strong accou
[normal]ntability and performance 
[normal]criteria
[normal] are vital to the success of the Free School programme. In NSN’s view, the current framework is robust and, alongside the Ofsted systems that apply to all schools, has allowed the DfE/EFA
[normal]/Ofsted
[normal] to take swift and decisive 
[normal]action where necessary.  However, given the rate of growth in the number of Free Schools and academies more widely, the DfE’s capacity to monitor risks centrally and interv
[normal]ene where appropriate is becoming
[normal] 
[normal]stretched so it is 
[normal]a sensible next step to fully 
[normal]review
[normal] whether 
[normal]the current framework will remain fit for purpose
[normal].

[normal]APPENDIX[bold]: [bold]The [bold]current approval process[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As it stands, the approval process falls broadly into two phases:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The application phase [bold]Groups wanting to set up a Free School rightly have to 
[normal]complete a demanding application process. Aside from the first year of the programme – when 
[normal]groups completed a much briefer initial application and then received paid for support to turn this into a detailed 
[normal]business 
[normal]plan
[normal] – all Free School applicants have 
[normal]had to undertake significant work 
[normal]without any financial support (except those receiv
[normal]ing small grants from NSN). Currently, this includes:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To gather evidence of demand
[normal], M
[normal]ainstream Free School
[normal] applicant
[normal]s 
[normal]must
[normal] show 
[normal]that 
[normal]local parents
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] children of 
[normal]relevant
[normal] age
[normal]s
[normal] to attend the 
[normal]s
[normal]chool when it opens
[normal], would choose it as a first choice, were it to open
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Special and AP Free School applicants must show that they have both the
[normal] support of relevant parents/young people and in principle financial commitments from relevant commissioners to purchase places at the school
[normal], over and
[normal] above the central funding (£10,000 and £8
[normal],
[normal]000
[normal] respectively) available to them
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]deally
[normal], applicants have to show that the school would be 
[normal]several times oversubscribed
[normal] in its first two years of operation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Once submitt
[normal]ed, these applications are 
[normal]assessed by dedicated teams at the DfE/EFA and, where they have been submitted by an existing Acade
[normal]my sponsor, discussed with the Academies division to analyse the sponsor’s capacity to expand further.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following this, a number of applicants are invited for interview by a panel which includes representatives from the DfE, EFA, external educational advis
[normal]ers and independent experts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The rigour of the application phase can be seen in’ the relatively low success rate of applicants, with only 26% of the 1103 applications received by the DfE being progressed to the pre-opening phase
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The pre-opening phas[bold]e[bold]If successful 
[normal]at interview
[normal], groups are
[normal] then
[normal] 
[normal]provisionally 
[normal]‘approved’ to open a 
[normal]Free S
[normal]chool
[normal]. Groups receive funding from the DfE
[normal] (currently £220,000 for primary schools and £300,000 for secondary/all-through schools) in order to ensure the school ready to open – including recruiting staff, developing education plans and policies, building financial systems and recruiting pupils. Th
[normal]ey must also conduct a statutory consultation with the local community to ask whether stakeholders believe the school should open, and respond to any concerns.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Groups also receive substantial support at this stage with finding, securing and developing a s
[normal]ite with the EFA taking all key decisions. Aside from this, the role of the DfE is largely to provide oversight and challenge to the project – through a dedicated project lead, education and finance advisers, who hold regular checkpoint meetings to review 
[normal]its progress. 
[normal]If 
[normal]this is found to be unsatisfactory at any stage then the 
[normal]project may be cancelled, or the opening 
[normal]of the school delayed. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Before being allowed to open, the school must also 
[normal]pass
[normal] two further requirements. First, it is inspected by
[normal] Ofsted t
[normal]o ensure 
[normal]that it meets 
[normal]necessary standards
[normal] around the quality of its premises and the provision of policies relating to issues such as the welfare, health and safety of pupils
[normal]. Secondly, DfE officials must 
[normal]conduct an
[normal] assessment of the
[normal] Free School
[normal]’s impact
[normal] on other schools in the area. Only at this stage, if all other requirements have been fulfilled, will the Secretary of State sign a funding agreement with the school which allows it to formally open. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Of the 24 Free Schools which opened in 2011: four were rated outstanding; 14 were rated good; five required improvement and one was inadequate. Comparative data here:
