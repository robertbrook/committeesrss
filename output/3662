[normal]During the year
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman carries 
[normal]out research to 
[normal]find out
[normal] what our customers thin
[normal]k about our service
[normal].  [bold]This includes telephone calls by the independent market research company IFF Research with 
[normal]all of our customers whose complaints have been investigated
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]with 
[normal]a random sample of those customers who have made an initial enquiry
[normal] to
[normal] us
[normal].  Since 2010
[normal],
[normal] we have received feedback from over 
[normal]8,000 people 
[normal]this way.  T
[normal]his financial year alone we have 
[normal]sought 
[normal]the 
[normal]opinions
[normal] 
[normal]of over 1,700 of those who 
[normal]have 
[normal]used our service.
[normal]We welcome this opportunity to share the latest figures from our customer satisfaction surv
[normal]ey with the Public Administration Select Committee
[normal]. We
[normal] hope that 
[normal]they
[normal] 
[normal]provide 
[normal]further context for the Committee’s 
[normal]inquiry into 
[normal]Parliament’s Ombudsman
[normal] Service
[normal].
[normal]Satisfaction levels have
[normal] remained stable over the past five
[normal] years
[normal],
[normal] even though the number of people seeking our help has increased.

[normal]Our research has found that whether or not someone’s complaint is 
[normal]upheld 
[normal]has a significant impact on 
[normal]their
[normal] satisfaction levels.  
[normal]C
[normal]ustomers whose complaints were 
[normal]investigated and 
[normal]upheld had a 98% satisfaction level. 
[normal] 
[normal]In cont
[normal]rast
[normal],
[normal] only
[normal] 57% of those whose complaint
[normal]s
[normal] we investigated but did not upho
[normal]ld were satisfied with our customer service overall. 
[normal] In 2012/13 
[normal]more 
[normal]complaints 
[normal]were 
[normal]upheld than in 2011/12 or 
[normal]that 
[normal]have been upheld so far in 2013/14.
[normal]  This is reflected in 
[normal]the higher satisfaction levels for 2012/13.
[normal]These findings are borne out by research by other comparable bodies.  In their annual 
[normal]review
[normal] of 
[normal]2012/13, the Financial Ombudsman Service found that 
[normal]90%
[normal] 
[normal]of those consumers who said they felt they had 
[normal]‘
[normal]won
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]their 
[normal]complaint gave positive feedback on the level of service
[normal] provided.  
[normal]In contrast,
[normal] 48%
[normal] o
[normal]f those consumers who said 
[normal]they had 
[normal]‘
[normal]lost
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]their complaint gave positive feedback.

[normal] our service.
[normal]Mr B’s mother was admitted to hospital with malnutrition and dehydration, and did not survive.  Mr[bold]&#xa0;[bold]B came to us but, after a detailed consideration of events by our clinical advisers, we decided there was nothing more we could achieve.  Despite this, Mr B wrote telling us:[bold]‘You have now answered our concerns methodically and sensitively and given us clarification to questions we were struggling to interpret … we would like to thank you for your diligence and integrity.’[bold]Our customer satisfaction survey reveals that
[normal] the main reasons our customers
[normal] are satisfied with our service
[normal] are:
[normal][bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The quality of the information and advice
[normal] we provide
[normal][bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our h
[normal]elpful, polite and sympathetic staff
[normal][bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Being kept
[normal] informed and good communication
[normal][bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our
[normal] professionalism
[normal].
[normal]‘They found things out that we didn’t have access to and they have made the hospital be truthful and honest with us at last.’
[normal]‘They are very tolerant – they are easy to talk to – they are professionals and are not taking sides.’
[normal]‘I feel like this will be coming to an end now, because the Ombudsman has taken over, it will bring closure.  As it’s independent it will either be yes it’s their failure or no.  You can’t go higher than the ombudsman.’
