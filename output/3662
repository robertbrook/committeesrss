defaultDuring the year
default,
default 
defaultthe Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman carries 
defaultout research to 
defaultfind out
default what our customers thin
defaultk about our service
default.  defaultThis includes telephone calls by the independent market research company IFF Research with 
defaultall of our customers whose complaints have been investigated
default,
default and 
defaultwith 
defaulta random sample of those customers who have made an initial enquiry
default to
default us
default.  Since 2010
default,
default we have received feedback from over 
default8,000 people 
defaultthis way.  T
defaulthis financial year alone we have 
defaultsought 
defaultthe 
defaultopinions
default 
defaultof over 1,700 of those who 
defaulthave 
defaultused our service.
defaultWe welcome this opportunity to share the latest figures from our customer satisfaction surv
defaultey with the Public Administration Select Committee
default. We
default hope that 
defaultthey
default 
defaultprovide 
defaultfurther context for the Committee’s 
defaultinquiry into 
defaultParliament’s Ombudsman
default Service
default.
defaultSatisfaction levels have
default remained stable over the past five
default years
default,
default even though the number of people seeking our help has increased.

defaultOur research has found that whether or not someone’s complaint is 
defaultupheld 
defaulthas a significant impact on 
defaulttheir
default satisfaction levels.  
defaultC
defaultustomers whose complaints were 
defaultinvestigated and 
defaultupheld had a 98% satisfaction level. 
default 
defaultIn cont
defaultrast
default,
default only
default 57% of those whose complaint
defaults
default we investigated but did not upho
defaultld were satisfied with our customer service overall. 
default In 2012/13 
defaultmore 
defaultcomplaints 
defaultwere 
defaultupheld than in 2011/12 or 
defaultthat 
defaulthave been upheld so far in 2013/14.
default  This is reflected in 
defaultthe higher satisfaction levels for 2012/13.
defaultThese findings are borne out by research by other comparable bodies.  In their annual 
defaultreview
default of 
default2012/13, the Financial Ombudsman Service found that 
default90%
default 
defaultof those consumers who said they felt they had 
default‘

default 
defaulttheir 
defaultcomplaint gave positive feedback on the level of service
default provided.  
defaultIn contrast,

defaultMr B’s mother was admitted to hospital with malnutrition and dehydration, and did not survive.  Mrdefault&#xa0;defaultB came to us but, after a detailed consideration of events by our clinical advisers, we decided there was nothing more we could achieve.  Despite this, Mr B wrote telling us:default‘You have now answered our concerns methodically and sensitively and given us clarification to questions we were struggling to interpret … we would like to thank you for your diligence and integrity.’defaultOur customer satisfaction survey reveals that
default the main reasons our customers

default‘They found things out that we didn’t have access to and they have made the hospital be truthful and honest with us at last.’
default‘They are very tolerant – they are easy to talk to – they are professionals and are not taking sides.’
default‘I feel like this will be coming to an end now, because the Ombudsman has taken over, it will bring closure.  As it’s independent it will either be yes it’s their failure or no.  You can’t go higher than the ombudsman.’
