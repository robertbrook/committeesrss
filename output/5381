default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdvanced Enzyme Science Limited (AESL) is a UK based company that has developed an innovative polymer technology based on enzymes (Enzymoplast), which breaks down the C-H bonds in the synthetic polymer chain thereby pr
defaulto
defaultducing CO
default2
default and water in the biodegradation process. The company was founded in England in 2011, although Research and Development has been carried out since 2000. AESL is the Intellectual Property owner and therefore owns all production and distribution rights worldwide. The Head Office is in Ba
defaultl
defaultham, London where all administration, finance and Sales and Marketing fun
defaultc
defaulttions are carried out.
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK Market for biodegradable Plastic is significant; AESL is an export-oriented business with a global Distributor network in place. The unique nature of the proprietary technology will allow AESL to grow over the coming years and should place it as the number one technology in the biodegradable, compost
defaulta
defaultble and recyclable plastics market globally. 
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeclaration of Interests. AESL networks its products through a global distrib
defaultu
defaulttion network. AESL is not a manufacturer of plastic bags and seeks to present facts and information about Enzymoplast technology. 
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnzymoplast®
default is an additive which uses specific enzymes with other plant-based components in the form of a Master batch. The Master batch is added and mixed during the further processing of polyethylene into an end product. Under certain environmental conditions the finished product will significantly, biologically-degrade within a few months dependant on the prevailing conditions at End-of-Life. 
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnzymes are special proteins which are present almost everywhere. For exa
defaultm
defaultple, certain enzymes decompose food in the stomach or are used for cheese production, cleaning products, washing-up liquid etc. Enzymes act as a 
default“Biocatalysator” and accelerate biochemical processes.
default Enzymes are natural living beings and are therefore especially environmentally friendly.
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn enzyme is only able to decompose one single substrate because of its stru
defaultc
defaulttural configuration.
default Therefore there is an extremely wide diversity in enzyme species; each enzyme has an active, as well as a passive, side. The active part of the enzyme fits like a ‘key’ into a lock. The enzyme lodges itself into the a
defaultp
defaultpropriate portion of the substrate (similar to a round peg in a round hole). 
defaultAs soon as this “Enzymatic Reaction” has started, the substrate begins to be converted back into its basic components. 
defaultIt is important to mention
default 
defaultthat the enzyme
default 
defaultdoes not die
default 
defaultor
default 
defaultinactivate after this reaction,
default 
defaultbut
default 
defaultmoves on
default 
defaultto the next
default 
defaultsubstrate in the chain reaction to restart the process.

defaultthis process:
defaultFig.1
default.
defaultThis enzymatic reaction process is verified by numerous well-founded studies. Thus, it is undisputed that enzymes actually work – hence it is quite unde
defaultr
defaultstandable that polyethylene can also be biodegraded by enzymes.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs early as 1992, among others Pometto et al. published a scientific study of the possibility of the biodegradation of polyethylene by means of enzymes. Sc
defaulti
defaultentists agree that enzymes are present in soil, which can decompose polyethy
defaultl
defaultene. However, so far these enzymes could not be identified and also their exact function is not fully understood. Above all it was never possible, despite years of research, to influence the speed of the decomposition.
default The scientists at AESL have now discovered the mechanics of these enzymatic reactions in polyolefin. 
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe solution is not just a single enzyme, but six specific ones out of about 250 thousand different types of enzymes, so-called Multienzymecomplexes, which interact or co-operate with each other to regulate themselves. 
defaultReverse engineering in this case is almost impossible. The Multienzymeco
defaultm
defaultplex is “encapsulated” into LLDPE, which serves as a carrier for the further processing of polyethylene products.
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPolyethylene is difficult to biodegrade mainly due to its high molecular weight and the non-polar C-C and C-H bonds. Furthermore the macromolecular pol
defaulty
defaultmer chains have a very dense branch, which results in a low total surface area. Thus, no water or oxygen can normally penetrate into the interior of the basic material. In addition, antioxidants may be added during the manufacturing pro
defaultc
defaultess to prevent an oxygenation reaction.
default 
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOnce the enzymes are activated in the polyethylene, the biological degradation starts at the weakest link in the polymer chain. Thus, the molecular mass is r
defaulte
defaultduced and other microorganisms and fungi can start to decompose the modified polyethylene. The incorporated enzymes promote the growth of the correspon
defaultd
defaulting organisms and cultures, which further accelerate the process until all pol
defaulty
defaultethylene chains are divided into the original substances, Carbon and Hydrogen and then CO
default2
default and water are produced. The aforementioned process is only a
defaultc
defaulttivated under certain environmental conditions. This prevents premature biode
defaultg
defaultradation, thus allowing the reuse of the product. Listed below are the required criteria similar to any compost or biodegradation process:
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShould any one of these parameters be lacking, the process is not initiated and the polyethylene retains its usual properties. The number of microorganisms on the hands, shelf or in a warehouse is not enough to initiate the process.
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA further challenge is how to keep the enzyme alive at high temperatures. E
defaultn
defaultzymes normally start to die from a temperature of about 100°C. 
defaultTherefore the enzymes are especially encapsulated during the production pro
defaultc
defaultess to withstand temperatures in extrusion of up to 300°
defaultC
default. The precise process of 
defaultencapsulation 
defaultforms part of the IP.
default3.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe enzymes used do not have a negative influence on the mechanical chara
defaultc
defaultteristics of the end products. According to third party tests the characteristics show improvement by as much as 2-3%. However, these values cannot be standardised due to the variety of and types of polyolefin and therefore serves only as a rough guideline.
defaultFact 1. Because Enzymoplast is mixed with pure Polyethylene it is possible to recycle ENZO-PE films with other polyethylene products without contaminating the esta
defaultb
defaultlished standard polymer recycling stream. Due to the possibility of improvement of the mechanical strength the number of recycling processes may increase. Furthe
defaultr
defaultmore, Enzymoplast does not use any stabilizers to handle the timeframe of biodegr
defaulta
defaultdation. Hence, there is no negative effect as stabilisers weaken polyethylene after a determined time.
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe applications are as diverse as the use of polyethylene itself. AESL markets two main master batches, namely ENZO0001 Compostable Grade and ENZO0900 Biodegradable Grade. ENZO0001 usually is for applications where the “End of Life” of the finished product is an Industrial Composting Facility and ENZO0900 for all other applications where no guarantee can be given that the 
defaultwaste collecting system does not fail. 
defaultThe exemption being proposed by go
defaultv
defaulternment is for Biodegradable plastic bags. For the purpose of this evidence, the technology that is being proposed by AESL is ENZO0900. Table 1 shows an example of applications for both ENZO001 and ENZO0900.

defaultFact 2. A biodegradable carrier bag manufactured using Enzymoplast will pose no risk plastic film or bag recycling in the UK and or recyclers overseas.
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA positive message can continue to reduce, reuse and recycle carrier bags that contain Enzymoplast biodegradable master batch.
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe majority of carrier bags are reused either for shopping or for a secondary purpose; the term single-use is misleading.
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOnly a small percentage of carrier bags are recycled due to:
defaulta)
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany carrier bags are reused for a secondary purpose such as bin liners. A study in Wales and Scotland estimated this be as much as 50%
defaultb)
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor retailers, there can be a lack of recycling facilities and no communicated message about recycling carrier bags and communication
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLack of facilities around the UK and home-recycling collection facilities
defaultFact 3. A carrier bag that is made with Enzymoplast can be recycled with no cross-contamination of recycled feed-stock.
defaultFact 4. A carrier bag that is made with Enzymoplast technology will fall into the government’s legislative framework for a biodegradable bag to be exempt. The six requirements are:

defaulte)
default&#xa0; 
defaultWill not generate methane in landfill
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default  Will cost little or no more than ordinary plastic bags
defaultFact 5. Over 80% of marine littering comes from land. The rest is mainly from fish
defaulting. 
defaultA carrier bag containing Enzymoplast will be in contact with soil first and the biodegradable reaction will start. Once the reaction has started, it will continue in the event the bag enters a marine environment. The bag wills biodegrade safely with no contamination to the marine environment.
defaultFact 6. Carrier bags made with 50% recycled material with Enzymoplast will biodegrade safely and can be recycled. This is providing the 50% recycled material is from a known source with no contamination. 
defaultFact 7. Under the proposed exemptions a carrier bag made with Enzymoplast will be ‘Biodegradable’ and not ‘Oxo-degradable’. The term Oxo-Biodegradable is misleading.
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is concern within the packaging industry on the tender that was issued by DEFRA “Biodegradable Plastic Carrier Bags – Solutions through Innovation”. 
defaultAn award was made by DEFRA in January 2014 to two companies to complete their research by 31
defaultst
default March 2014. Under the framework, the government seeks to have a clearer indication for exemptions and biodegradable technologies. Contracts given to two companies will not give enough scope to make a final decision.
default7.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence presented to the Environmental Audit Committee on the 18
defaultth
default December 2013 shows that there would be a negative impact on jobs from the suppliers of carrier bags. An exempted biodegradable carrier bag will protect the packaging suppliers, securing jobs in the UK although it is noted that there would still be a likely fall in bag consumption.
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvidence was heard on the 9
defaultth
default January 2014 at Environmental Audit Committee that exempting a carrier bag with Biodegradable technology would cost the recycling industry thousands of jobs. A Biodegradable carrier bag made with Enzymoplast will safeguard jobs in the recycling industry and ensure that there is continued feedsto
defaultck of plastic bags to recycle. 
default8.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn imposed levy on carrier bags is expected to reduce the usage by 85%. The reduction will cost the packaging industry hundreds of millions of pounds in lost revenue from the sale of plastic bags. This will put UK packaging suppliers out of business that invest in innovation and skills. There will be direct losses to H M Treasury in corporation taxes, import VAT, duty and VAT on the sale of the plastic bags from the packaging suppliers to retailers. The losses to H M Treasure will equate to tens of millions of pounds.
