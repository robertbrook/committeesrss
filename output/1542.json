"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nPeter G Rayner\n (SLC 003)\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have many \nyears’ experience\n of Level Crossing design, maintenance and operation and we have both given evidence at a number of Inquiries \nconcerning\n rail safety.  \nNotably\n Lord Cullens Inquiries into the Paddington Accident and \nProfessor\n Uff’s Inquiry into the Southall train crash, an\nd many others.  Additionally have \nchaired or\n been members of countless Inquiries into railway accidents.  Our CV’s are available if required.\n1.2 We are offering this evidence because we have been involved in two recent accidents which        concern level\n crossing operation.  In addition we expressed concerns regarding the safety of a level \ncrossing\n in Nottingham in a detailed private correspondence with the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) which correspondence others chose to put in the public domain.\n1.3 \nWe are aware reference to our involvement has been mentioned by the Union TSSA in a  written submission from the General Secretary Manuel Cortes\n.  Also that our correspondence with the ORR has been forwarded to the Rail Accident and Inquiry Bureau (RAIB) i\nn connection with yet another Level Crossing Incident.\n1.4 It should be known we have not written this submission on behalf of nor in collusion with any other party and do so only in the interests of railway safety.\n&#xa0;\n 2.1 \nAre current safety measures at Level Crossings adequate?  How should they be improved?2.1.1 \nThe regulations presently in place for signalled level crossings of various specified types is adequate.  The position could be improved by a review to ensure all crossings are in fact signalled \nin accordance with the regulations\n and that \nthe required \nelec\ntrical or mechanical locking is in place.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.2 Examples exist, notably illustrated by the Moreton on Lugg\n accident where adequate protection was not in place.  This is a key issue and our concern is the culture that is now developing in the railway industry.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.3 \nFollowing the Clapham Accident\n on 12\nth\n Dec 1988 Antony Hidden QC made recommendations that were\n accepted by the industry.  One of the most important was No 50 which stated:  \n“BR\n shall ensure that the organisational framework exists to prevent commercial considerations of a business led railway from compromising safety”\n&#xa0;\nIt is our view that commercia\nl considerations surrounding the installation of Approach Locking, a standard procedure, prevented\n that safe system being applied \nd\nespite knowledge within the industry that it was missing.\n2.2 In addition to Bridges and underpasses what other cost effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at Level Crossings?2.2.1 \nThe safety of footpath crossings remains an area of concern.  Modern trains are faster and qu\niet\ner as investment takes place in new rolling stock.  Commercial consideration\ns must not inhibit the provision of\n Red\n/\n Green\n warning lights and audible warnings \nbeing provided.  Complaints of noise from local residents should not result in audible warnings being reduced.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.2 In the case of Bayles and Wylies Crossing on Nottingham\n Tramway, due to public complaints and indeed commercial considerations a contrived Risk Assessment allowed a deeply flawed arrangement to be put in place.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.3 Elsewhere on the Tramway\n,\n \nc\nrossings have been dealt with correctly and safely.  This Crossing\n could have remain\ned \n a crossing, provided it \nwas\n correctly signed and installed.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.4 The correspondence surrounding this case is referred to in 1.2 of this evidence.  (We assume the Committee has the correspondence from others.)\n&#xa0;\n2.3 How should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?2.3.1 We have no views to express on this difficult issue other than to acknowledge the problem and be thankful that we no longer have to address it\n.  However the situation might be improved if the costs of improving or removing level crossings could be shared by road budgets if the net effect of bridges or underpasses reflected improvements to vehicle and pedestrian flows.\n2.3.2 It might be possible \nfor the provision of basic safety interlockings to be installed in a less costly way by not using expensive high technology solutions.\n2.3.3 Too often assessments for simple procedures produce prohibitive costs to the overall detriment\n of a safe railway.  However, to attempt to now “turn the clock back” is to expose oneself to criticism and being “out of touch”.\n2.4 Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority at level crossings?2.4.1 \nFirstly we accept the historical practices and acknowledge Level Crossings for pedestrians in particular are a difficult area because custom and practice, design and installation has grown up over more than 100 years.  Thus an arrangement in one part of th\ne country is different from that in another location particularly with methods of locking wicket gates and other devices.\n2.4.2 The accident at Elsenham in 2005 and more recent examples indicate there is a need for the safe bringing together of systems to \nensure safety is paramount.  The Elsenham case points to a cost cutting \nexercise\n in that only one side of the line was it possible to purchase \ntickets.  Thus the children crossed the line \nto purchase tickets before boarding the train\n \nresulting in their dea\nth.\n2.4.3 An in house review of different geographical locations, the history and position of level crossings in those different locations with a view to best procedure would be sensible.\n2.4.4 Network Rail we believe is addressing this problem, details ar\ne not \nknown\n to us but we would not \nrecommend the employment of Consultants.  Expertise exists within Network Rail to address the issue which in view \no\nf the different types in existence is a difficult one to address.\n2.4.5 In this context we believe the pre\nsent risks model used by the Industry (ORR and NR) called ACRAM (All Level Crossing Risk Model) is flawed in that it covers in great detail road and pedestrian user but pays little attention to Rail levels of traffic, frequency and speed of trains.\n2.5 Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety and level crossings adequate?  What more should the Government and ORR do?2.5.1 Care must be taken to ensure there is clear water between the Engineers of\n similar professions employed within each organisation.\n2.5.2 One of the problems arising more and more is the lessening of the role of Railway Operator.  The Engineering culture is paramount and it has been forgotten that traditionally railway safety was \nvested in the Superintendent of the Line, latterly known as the Chief Operating Manager, a qualified operator with the equivalent knowledge comparable with the ticket of a Master Mariner at sea.\n2.5.3 That office had to work with three engi\nneering disci\npli\nnes, Mechanical and Electrical Engineers, Civil Engineers and Signalling Engineers, all of whom are different and equally important.\n2.5.4 \nThat culture has to a great extent has been lost\n.  For example the decision not to provide vital interlocking at More\nton on Lugg was taken without any discussions with railway operating experts.  It was also taken without any detailed knowledge on the risks of human error.\n  \nWe believe both organisations \ni.e.\n ORR and NR are fit for purpose and have difficult but different\n tasks.\n2.5.5 It is our view\n that operating expertise should reside within NR and not be left to the ORR to pick up.  Historically the industry \nprided itself in its professionalism and felt shame if found wanting  \nby the Railway Inspectorate, the predecess\nors of the ORR.\n 2.6 How should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?2.6.1 \nThere is\n no need for further legislation \nunless\n it is thought extra powers should be given to ensure land owners give up little used farm crossings if sensible al\nternative routes exist for them to use their land.  Many of these crossings date back to the late nineteenth century.\n2.7 How should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?2.7.1 \nOn-going\n publicity such as school visits, posters, adverts\n \netc.\n and perhaps television campaigns regarding reckless motoring.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
