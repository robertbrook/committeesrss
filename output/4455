defaultCBM’s work is 
defaultaligned to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and explicitly promotes inclusive development in relation to all articles, and with specific emphasis on articles 11 (humanitarian assistance) and article 33 (international cooperation

default&#xa0;
defaultCBM and Livelihoodsdefault&#xa0;
defaultCBM’s strategic framework for livelihood development stresses the importance of inclusive approache
defaults to skills development, access to financial services, and paid employment, with the underlying aim of enabling persons with disabilities to become productive contributors to social insurance systems. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCBM is working actively with the Centre for Financial
default Inclusion, an industry-facing think tank, at Accion (a global microfinance pioneer) on inclusive livelihood development and access to financial services. CBM is also in dialogue with the Village Savings and Loans organisation (VSL), with a view to includi
defaultng persons with disabilities. VSL is a pioneer in village savings and loans, and has nearly 
defaultnine
default million members, mostly in Africa.
default&#xa0;defaultIn recent years there has been marked growth in the number of persons with disabilities becoming involved in open employment, cooperatives, micro-finance and savings &amp; loans schemes. Last year, CBM skills development and work creation programmes reach over
default 100,000 people with disabilities. 
default&#xa0;
defaultParticipatory planning is used to involve the individual with a disability and his or her family, together with the economic realities of the community in which the individual lives, taking into account what products an
defaultd services are in high demand and short supply. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA twin-track approach of economic empowerment of persons with disabilities, together with sustained advocacy for inclusive livelihood development at local, national and international levels has been shown t
defaulto be a successful model of engagement.

defaultCase Study: Inclusive Development through Organic Farming default&#xa0;
default“Inclusive Development through Organic Farming” is a five
default-
defaultyear project
default and initiative of 
defaultCBM
default partner Naman
default Seva Samiti
default, with the aim of providing livelihood
default opportunities for a total of 1,500 farmers with disabilities and their families in Madhya Pradesh
default,
default central India. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is the first project in India which trains people with disabilities in organic farming in their local language. Participants in the pr
defaultogramme include people with physical, hearing and visual impairments as well as parents of children with disabilities. During the project, farmers will develop a cooperative movement where they are responsible for the entire production and marketing cycle.
default&#xa0;defaultEach year, 300-350 farmers receive training in soil testing, the production of organic manure, crop selection and processing of products through a mix of both theory lessons at the training centre and practical sessions in the fields. Farmers also take p
defaultart in exposure visits to learn from the experiences of other farmers’ 
defaultgroups and organisations in different parts of the country. In addition to training, Naman provides transportation, promotion and marketing support and reaches out to larger markets and
default suppliers of bigger supermarkets wherever feasible.
default&#xa0;
defaultNaman’s advocacy activities at government level in Madhya Pradesh have led to the state government providing technical support for the project and declaring Athner block as an ‘organic block’. 
defaultAlready,
default other 
defaultorganis
defaultations
default are approaching Naman to share its experiences and gain help in establishing 
defaultpilot projects
default 
defaultin other parts of India.

defaultabilities in rural India. 
default&#xa0;defaultCBM and Inclusive Educationdefault&#xa0;
defaultThere is a growing recognition that the inclusion of children with disability in mainstream schools builds self-confidence and self-respect through social inclusion, as well as increasing employment choices. Governments around the world are therefore start
defaulting to introduce inclusive education as a strategy in their mainstream education programmes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCBM is working with our partners to forward the inclusive education agenda through targeted programme work and advocacy initiatives in a number of inclusive educ
defaultation projects.

default&#xa0;defaultCase Study: defaultA voice for mental health in Sierra Leonedefault&#xa0;
defaultIn Sierra Leone, mental health needs are especially great as 
defaulta result of the 1991-2002 civil war that left deep scars on the nation's psychological well-being and its social capital. 
defaultA whole generation of young people missed out on education, and continues
default to struggle to participate in the economy. 
defaultPeople with psychosocial disabilities in
default Sierra Leone are often ostracis
defaulted
default from their communities and human rights violations are common. This may be due to traditional beliefs that attribute mental illness to spiritual causes and often blame the person with the problem. A lack of public health awareness and negative attitudes s
defaulturrounding mental illness has contributed to high levels of stigma and discrimination.  
default&#xa0;
defaultExisting services consist of a single national psychiatric hospital, which has shortages of staff, medication, and other essential resources, resulting in 
defaultchallenging
default conditions
default, including routine chaining of patients. The few civil society services that started after the war are now closed. With no 
defaultdecentralized
default mental health services available through government health services, people must rely on traditional treatm
defaultent or travel to the hospital in 
defaultthe capital 
defaultFreetown.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Mental Health Coalition of Sierra Leonedefault&#xa0;defaultThe Mental Health Coalition of Sierra
default Leone was founded in September

defaultCBM and Disaster Preparednessdefault&#xa0;
defaultCBM knows that the involvement of pe
defaultrsons
default with disabilit
defaulties
default disaster management planning saves lives.  
defaultDisasters have a huge impact on human infrastructure, and livelihoods. The key 
defaultto
default diminishing their impact is to reduce people’s vulnerability. Through inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programmes, incorporated in human development plans and poverty 
defaultreduction programmes, risks can be reduced and communities’ resilience to disasters can be strengthened.
defaultPersons with disabilities are often overlooked throughout the disaster management cycle and especially during relief operations, and are seldom 
defaultconsidered as important actors in conflict prevention even though they are often more exposed during conflicts and displacement
default. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), in its articles 11 and 32
default, requires that persons with di
defaultsabilities benefit from and participate in disaster relief, emergency response and disaster risk reduction strategies 
defaultas pe
defaultrsons
default with disabilit
defaulties
default are the most vulnerable in a disaster situation. The disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction traini
defaultng run by CBM partners in 
defaultt
defaulthe Philippines before Typhoon Haiyan struck has shown how effective this can be through the number of lives saved.  
default&#xa0;

defaultThe rehabi
defaultlitation and reconstruction phases after a disaster provide a good starting point for building a better and a more inclusive society for all. If disability is taken into account in reconstruction of physical infrastructures (schools, hospitals, clinics, pu
defaultblic buildings, roads etc.), in community planning, in workforces, in monitoring and evaluation, a solid ground for a more equitable society can be built.
