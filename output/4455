[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]CBM[bold]&#xa0;[bold]CBM recognises that 
[normal]disability and
[normal] poverty are inextricably linked in a 
[normal]cycle 
[normal]-
[normal] disability
[normal] 
[normal]contributes to and deepens
[normal] poverty on an individual, family and community level
[normal],
[normal] and poverty 
[normal]is often a cause of disability
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This means that poverty cannot be addressed without addressing disability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CBM’s work is 
[normal]aligned to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and explicitly promotes inclusive development in relation to all articles, and with specific emphasis on articles 11 (humanitarian assistance) and article 33 (international cooperation
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CBM and Livelihoods[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]CBM’s strategic framework for livelihood development stresses the importance of inclusive approache
[normal]s to skills development, access to financial services, and paid employment, with the underlying aim of enabling persons with disabilities to become productive contributors to social insurance systems. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CBM is working actively with the Centre for Financial
[normal] Inclusion, an industry-facing think tank, at Accion (a global microfinance pioneer) on inclusive livelihood development and access to financial services. CBM is also in dialogue with the Village Savings and Loans organisation (VSL), with a view to includi
[normal]ng persons with disabilities. VSL is a pioneer in village savings and loans, and has nearly 
[normal]nine
[normal] million members, mostly in Africa.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]In recent years there has been marked growth in the number of persons with disabilities becoming involved in open employment, cooperatives, micro-finance and savings &amp; loans schemes. Last year, CBM skills development and work creation programmes reach over
[normal] 100,000 people with disabilities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Participatory planning is used to involve the individual with a disability and his or her family, together with the economic realities of the community in which the individual lives, taking into account what products an
[normal]d services are in high demand and short supply. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A twin-track approach of economic empowerment of persons with disabilities, together with sustained advocacy for inclusive livelihood development at local, national and international levels has been shown t
[normal]o be a successful model of engagement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case Study: Inclusive Development through Organic Farming [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“Inclusive Development through Organic Farming” is a five
[normal]-
[normal]year project
[normal] and initiative of 
[normal]CBM
[normal] partner Naman
[normal] Seva Samiti
[normal], with the aim of providing livelihood
[normal] opportunities for a total of 1,500 farmers with disabilities and their families in Madhya Pradesh
[normal],
[normal] central India. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is the first project in India which trains people with disabilities in organic farming in their local language. Participants in the pr
[normal]ogramme include people with physical, hearing and visual impairments as well as parents of children with disabilities. During the project, farmers will develop a cooperative movement where they are responsible for the entire production and marketing cycle.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Each year, 300-350 farmers receive training in soil testing, the production of organic manure, crop selection and processing of products through a mix of both theory lessons at the training centre and practical sessions in the fields. Farmers also take p
[normal]art in exposure visits to learn from the experiences of other farmers’ 
[normal]groups and organisations in different parts of the country. In addition to training, Naman provides transportation, promotion and marketing support and reaches out to larger markets and
[normal] suppliers of bigger supermarkets wherever feasible.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Naman’s advocacy activities at government level in Madhya Pradesh have led to the state government providing technical support for the project and declaring Athner block as an ‘organic block’. 
[normal]Already,
[normal] other 
[normal]organis
[normal]ations
[normal] are approaching Naman to share its experiences and gain help in establishing 
[normal]pilot projects
[normal] 
[normal]in other parts of India.

[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Most importantly, the project is bringing significant change 
[normal]to the lives of persons with disabilities and their families. Pe
[normal]rsons
[normal] with disabilities are leading a process of economic empowerment and agricultural innovation, changing perceptions within the wider community, giving hope to thousands of persons with dis
[normal]abilities in rural India. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]CBM and Inclusive Education[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]There is a growing recognition that the inclusion of children with disability in mainstream schools builds self-confidence and self-respect through social inclusion, as well as increasing employment choices. Governments around the world are therefore start
[normal]ing to introduce inclusive education as a strategy in their mainstream education programmes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CBM is working with our partners to forward the inclusive education agenda through targeted programme work and advocacy initiatives in a number of inclusive educ
[normal]ation projects.

[normal]are persons with disabilites 
[normal]themselves
[normal], 
[normal]so they bring their own valuable exper
[normal]ience
[normal] to their work.
[normal] [bold]In addition
[normal], government
[normal] teachers are trained on inclusive approaches to their classroom practise and how to develop individual education plans for children with disabilit
[normal]ies
[normal] and special educational needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The after
[normal]-
[normal]school clubs and school teachers work together to meet the needs of the children and ensure that the individual education plans provide a framework for 
[normal]each
[normal] child to 
[normal]progress towards 
[normal]reach
[normal]ing
[normal] his or her full potential.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local advocacy initiatives are starting to grow as the inclusive education trained teachers and after school club 
[normal]coordinators raise
[normal] awareness of disability
[normal]-
[normal]related issues.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]CBM and Mental Health[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1 in 4 p
[normal]eople will experience an episode of mental illness in their lifetime, and that 300-400 million people worldwide are disabled as a consequence. 85% of these people are in 
[normal]l
[normal]ow and

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Case Study: [bold]A voice for mental health in Sierra Leone[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In Sierra Leone, mental health needs are especially great as 
[normal]a result of the 1991-2002 civil war that left deep scars on the nation's psychological well-being and its social capital. 
[normal]A whole generation of young people missed out on education, and continues
[normal] to struggle to participate in the economy. 
[normal]People with psychosocial disabilities in
[normal] Sierra Leone are often ostracis
[normal]ed
[normal] from their communities and human rights violations are common. This may be due to traditional beliefs that attribute mental illness to spiritual causes and often blame the person with the problem. A lack of public health awareness and negative attitudes s
[normal]urrounding mental illness has contributed to high levels of stigma and discrimination.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Existing services consist of a single national psychiatric hospital, which has shortages of staff, medication, and other essential resources, resulting in 
[normal]challenging
[normal] conditions
[normal], including routine chaining of patients. The few civil society services that started after the war are now closed. With no 
[normal]decentralized
[normal] mental health services available through government health services, people must rely on traditional treatm
[normal]ent or travel to the hospital in 
[normal]the capital 
[normal]Freetown.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Mental Health Coalition of Sierra Leone[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Mental Health Coalition of Sierra
[normal] Leone was founded in September
[normal] 2010
[normal] with the purpose of creating a body that empowers stakeholders to advocate for t
[normal]heir rights, promoting practical change that will improve quality of life and inclusion in society.

[normal]CBM and Disaster Preparedness[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]CBM knows that the involvement of pe
[normal]rsons
[normal] with disabilit
[normal]ies
[normal] disaster management planning saves lives.  
[normal]Disasters have a huge impact on human infrastructure, and livelihoods. The key 
[normal]to
[normal] diminishing their impact is to reduce people’s vulnerability. Through inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programmes, incorporated in human development plans and poverty 
[normal]reduction programmes, risks can be reduced and communities’ resilience to disasters can be strengthened.
[normal]Persons with disabilities are often overlooked throughout the disaster management cycle and especially during relief operations, and are seldom 
[normal]considered as important actors in conflict prevention even though they are often more exposed during conflicts and displacement
[normal]. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), in its articles 11 and 32
[normal], requires that persons with di
[normal]sabilities benefit from and participate in disaster relief, emergency response and disaster risk reduction strategies 
[normal]as pe
[normal]rsons
[normal] with disabilit
[normal]ies
[normal] are the most vulnerable in a disaster situation. The disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction traini
[normal]ng run by CBM partners in 
[normal]t
[normal]he Philippines before Typhoon Haiyan struck has shown how effective this can be through the number of lives saved.  
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]k

[normal]and working towards a disability
[normal]-
[normal]inclusive post Hyogo Framework for Action. For the first time disability was included in the outcome document. 
[normal]“Even the best early warning systems and prepar
[normal]edness efforts to evacuate populations in dangers do not address fully the diversity of disabilities that we have in our societies. The only way to address this is to ensure that persons with disability are involved in the deism and planning of the systems
[normal] that are designed to protect the safety of the population in all countries.”

[normal] States Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law,… all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian e

[normal]The rehabi
[normal]litation and reconstruction phases after a disaster provide a good starting point for building a better and a more inclusive society for all. If disability is taken into account in reconstruction of physical infrastructures (schools, hospitals, clinics, pu
[normal]blic buildings, roads etc.), in community planning, in workforces, in monitoring and evaluation, a solid ground for a more equitable society can be built.
