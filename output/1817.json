"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the National Outsourcing Association (LPG 21)&#xa0;Executive SummaryIt is the \nNational Outsourcing Association’s (\nNOA\n)\n contention that an entirely new approach\n to outsourcing \nneeds to be established within the public sector to bring about significant improvements in procured services over the long term\n, as well as to aid the UK economy\n.\nAlthough outsourcing is not directly mentioned in the Committee’s call for evidence, £82bn of outsourced services are provided to the public sector each year, which we believe makes outsourcing highly relevant.\n Further to that, \nOxford Economics in April 2011 estimated that turnover across all ‘outsourced’ markets amounts to some £207 billion per annum, equivalent to some 8.0% of economy-wide output. The private/public sector split is approx\nimately\n 60%/40%.\n The UK outsourcing industry supports 3.3 million jobs and \ncontributes £28.5 billion to the Treasury each year.\n It is a significant and growing industry in the UK, yet it gets castigated more than praised, oft because it becomes the scapegoat for some other failure.\n&#xa0;\nThe truth is ‘outsourcing works’, when done right. E\nvidence\n suggests\n that outsourcing can lead to savings of between 15\n%\n and 30%.  If we conservatively assume effective outsourcing delivers savings of 10\n% that amounts to a saving on £82bn of services, of £8\n.2bn\n per annum\n.\nBut it only works, when it’s the right solution for the given scenario and when it’s done\n well\n. \nIt seems clear to many that the skills and culture that are required for outsourcing to work consistently well in the public sector simply do not exist.\n The NOA’s recommendations are:\nThe NOA can help through qualification and accreditation and we propose \nall public bodies review their sourcing practices against the NOA best practice Life Cycle and \nover time\n \nachieve and \nmaintain \naccreditation for \ntheir practices.\n We also promote the development of shared best practice and call on Government to start voicing support for this essential and burgeoning industry.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;ADDRESSING THE SKILLS DEFICIT\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTRUE PARTNERSHIP WORKING\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nOUTCOME-BASED SOLUTIONS\n&#xa0;\nPROMOTING BEST PRACTICE\n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSION\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;"
