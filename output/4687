defaultis 
defaultthe national membership organisation for leaders of academies. 
default 
defaultWe are a non-partisan representative organisation committed to supporting our members in the advancement of the education and life chances of all pupils and students in our care. 
default 
defaultAn acknowledged and respected national body, we are ‘the voice of academies’
default, run by and on behalf of our continually growing membership. We play a leading role in the development of the wider academy movement, providing help, support and advice to existing, new and converting academies. 
default 
defaultWe are the only independent organisation d
defaultedicated to supporting academies and have a track record of over 20 years’ experience in providing leadership to all types of state-funded independent schools.
default 
default 
defaultOur work includes lobbying 
defaultgovernment and opposition on matters relating to education policy
default as
default it affects academies.
default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe IAA (Independent Academies Association
default) firmly believes that the overarching principle and foremost priority of the academies 
defaultmovement
default is the urgent need to deliver high quality education to all students and pupils.  
default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultEvidential data demonstrates that the 
defaultacademies 
defaultprogramme has been effective in 
defaultraising standards
default, with the impact being greatest among sponsored academies
default.
default 
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMore could be 
defaultdone to incentivise increased numbers of good and outstanding converter academies to sponsor failing schools, particularly those that predominantly serve disadvantaged children.
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultaccelerated pace of
default academisation
default has caused some issues, most notably in 
defaultthe variable quality of sponsors and governing bodies.
default 
defaultWhen problems occur in this area, they must be resolved more quickly than hitherto. Further reform of 
defaultschool 
defaultgovernance
default 
defaultis recommended.
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAny temptation to reinvent the ‘middle tier’ along 
defaultprevious 
defaultlocal
default authority lines should be 
defaultresisted
default: instead, greater impetus should be provided to system leadership 
defaulton a sub-regional basis 
defaultas part of a truly self-improving system.
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities 
defaultcould
default continue to 
defaulthave strategic and statutory roles to play but they 
defaultmust not be at the expense of academy independence or autonomy.
default2.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe IAA welcomes the introduction of sub-regional Schools Commissioners and Headteacher Boards as a proportionate response to 
defaultthe ongoing expansion of the academies programme
default.
default2.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAcademy chains have a crucial role to play in the new educational landscape, with 
defaultmany demonstrating outstanding ability to transform education
default.   
default2.9.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAcademy status is equally relevant to primary schools as it is to secondary schools and growth in the number
defaults of primary academies should be supported and encouraged.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2010, the NAO noted that, o
defaultverall, academies 
defaultincrease
default the rate of improvement in GCSE results when compared wi
defaultth their predecessor schools. 
default Furthermore
default, the proportion of 
defaultacademy students
default achieving five or more A*-C 
defaultat GCSE
default 
defaulthad
default improved
default at a faster rate than in maintained schools
default, particularly those
default with similar intakes
default.
default  
defaultIn 2011 and 2012 schools with academy st
defaultatus made, on average, more progress between KS2 and GCSE than schools without academy status
default.
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThose sponsored academies
default that were established early on in the programme replaced the worst schools in the country and, in nearly every case, transformed provision and dramatically and very rapidly improved outcomes. The focus was on removing 
defaultfrom the system 
defaultthe rump of the 200 
defaultl
defaultowest
default performing schools
default, where underperformance was historically endemic and stubbornly ingrained and which were situated in some of the most disadvantaged and challenged areas of the UK. 
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe fact that the early academy sponsors turned around these schoo
defaultls in the most 
defaultdifficult
default of circumstances, with few very failures, is testament to the efficacy of the programme and it is, therefore, no surprise that we have recently witnessed 
defaulta 
defaultresurgence in this approach
default, which is welcomed by our association.
default3.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt can also be no accident that the 
defaultsuccess of initiatives such as London Challenge was
default contemporaneous with
default a period of mass academisation of schools within the area.
default3.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe most compelling evidence for the effectiveness of academies has come in the recently
default published Ofsted Annual Report, which notes that: 
defaultSponsor-led academies are delivering a step change in performance for chronically
default underperforming schools. Academies established in 2007 have narrowed the attainment gap of five or 
defaultmore A* to C grades at 
defaultGCSE, including English and 
defaultmathematics, by eight percentage points.
default 
default3.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe report also goes on to state that “
defaultAcademy converters are outperforming all non-academy schools” and that “Sponsor-led academies that have been open since 2007 have made the most im
defaultprovement at Key Stage 4”, suggesting that the longer an academy is established, the greater its impact
default over time
default.
default￼
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe IAA acknowledges
default and welcomes the moves made by Ministers in recent times to increase the rigour in selecting academy sponsors / free school proposers, in assessing the capacity of existing sponsors to take on additional academies
default,
default and in pausing or halting the expansion 
defaultof chains where there have been concerns about academic performance or financial management.
default 
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever
default, the process 
defaultleading to
default ministerial approval and subsequent academisation remains unwieldy and can be painfully slow
default,
default not only for the prospective sponsor
default but for the children attending 
defaultfailing schools, their parents 
defaultand 
defaultthe 
defaultstaff working in
default them
default.
default 
default Schools can find themselves in a protracted state of limbo, where uncertainty and the inability to move forward can impact detrimentally on stakeholder confidenc
defaulte, the quality of provision and sometimes on outcomes.
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe DfE might usefully consider further refinements to the two approaches to academisation, the so-called ‘fast-track’ and ‘fully sponsored’ routes, which are rightly based on assessments of potential 
defaultrisk, in order to ensure that, where necessary, children’s education can be transformed without delay. 
default4.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWith regard to the programme as a whole, however, in some ways the converse is true, as t
defaulthe 
defaultaccelerated pace of
default academisation
default has caused some issues, mo
defaultst notably in the variable quality of sponsors and governing bodies.
default 
default4.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhen problems occur in this area, they must be resolved more 
defaultreadily
default than hitherto. 
defaultThe Department should act more quickly to reassign a sponsor/trust where a mistake has been made
default.
default4.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultExisting governing bodies of schools rated less than good by Ofsted should not be involved in choos
defaulting their own academy sponsor. 
defaultIt is appropriate that, where a local authority has worked closely with a school and knows it well, they should have a voice i
defaultn respect of the choice of sponsor but the local authority should not have any power of veto.  
default4.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe acknowledge that there is less “soft sponsorship” of schools than was the case at one time, but more can still be done and similar ‘tightening up’ may be nee
defaultded in the free schools programme. 
default4.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTo support sponsor selection and to ensure rigorous accountability, we
default need a transparent, easy to access register of sponsors 
defaultthat
default for each sponsor
default includes
default:
default a list of schools they run
default;
default the
default Ofsted
default judgments of each of t
defaulthose schools
default;
default and
default the
default improvement
defaults in progress and attainment that have
default been achieved
default.
default 
default4.9.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFurther reform of 
defaultschool 
defaultgovernance, 
defaultfor example
default to align it more with
default the most successful practice in
default the business sector, is recommended
default, 
defaultwith 
defaultvery clear and transpar
defaultent accountability, 
defaultmuch smaller boards of non-executive directors, fewer committees and more performance management of governors than is currently the case in the majority of schools and academies.  Within a group setting, the role of the Executive Princi
defaultpal / Chief Executive Officer with regard to governance should be more clearly defined and emphasised, as should that of other Executive Directors.  I
defaultt may be that radical 
defaulttransformation
default 
defaultof governance 
defaultis required in order to help bring about the next step 
defaultchange in the education system as a whole
default.
default4.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCertainly there remain issues with the recruitment and retention of governors, directors and trustees of sufficient calibre and with adequate capacity 
defaultto fulfil the roles and duties as currently defined and govern
defaultment would do well to consider means of incentivising the best people to take up these positions
default and to encourage businesses to promote them amongst their workforce
default.
default4.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe IAA s

default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur association would defend 
defaultcompulsion
default as a route to academisation
default, but 
defaultit should always 
defaultbe 
defaultbased on 
defaultsound 
defaultevidence
default and 
defaultsophisticated

defaults about 
defaulta school’s
default performance and capacity to improve (or otherwise).
default4.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important that academisation is not seen as a punishment but is viewed as being of benefit to children, young people and a lo
defaultcal community. The DfE may wish to review what messages are communicated to schools ‘in scope’.
default4.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHitherto, conversion to academy status has involved the closing of the predecessor school/s and reopening as a new school: this process should be maintained as 
defaultthere needs to be every opportunity to rebrand, ‘re-culture’
default and adopt new approaches.
default4.15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Free S
defaultchool
defaults
default programme should be more systematically targeted
default in areas of basic need
default (i.e. where there is a significant shortage of school places).
default4.16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also believe t
defaulthat
default 
defaultit is appropriate to open free schools
default where 
defaultthe 
defaultexisting 
defaultquality of 
defaultprovision is poor
default and standards are low.
default4.17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA
defaultny
default mechanism for opening 
defaultnew 
defaultschools must be 
defaultbalanced
default by a mechanism for closing schools
default that suffer from endemic poor performance.
default  The option of closure should 
defaultbe a mandatory consideration every time a school faces compulsory conversion 
defaultto academy status 
defaultor is 
defaultunder threat of being moved
default to another sponsor
default.
default4.18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAt the opposite end of the spectrum, an outstanding school that is a member 
defaultof an academy chain should have the option to leave its group and set up as a separate sponsor and take on one or more failing schools, providing that doing so will demonstrably not impact negatively on the capacity of the existing sponsor.
default&#xa0;
default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe number of academies whose performance causes concern is a very small percentage of the total.
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe current mechanism of issui
defaultng sponsors with pre warning notices and, if subsequently necessary, warning letters, has led to considerable and quick improvements in these academies.
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn extreme circumstances, where it is considered that standards are unlikely to rise quickly enough, it
default is right and proper that the Secretary of State direct a
default change
default of s
defaultponsor
default.
default5.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important, however, that 
defaultaction 
defaultis d
defaultecisive 
defaultand taken without undue delay, in order that children do not miss the opportunity of a good quality education.
default5.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs the programme expands further, 
defaultthe systematic growth of school-to-
defaultschool support
default will be essential, especially as the Secretary of State implements 
defaulta model of 
defaultdevolution to regional regulatory and advisory bodies, as described below, founded on the work
default of successful system leaders and the Office of the Schools Commissioner.  
default5.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt will be a vital corollary to such a framework that the identification and development of these system leaders is accurate and valid.  Therefore, schools and academies should onl
defaulty be judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted if they can demonstrate that they are outward-
defaultfacing
default and that they have successfully led school improvement beyond their individual institution.
default5.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe 
defaultalso 
defaulthope that the introduction of 
defaultthe ‘P
defaultrogress 8
default’ measure
default will lead to
default a better understanding of what is
default an outstanding
default school
default in terms of making a difference to children’s learning
default and development
default, and 
defaultof 
defaultwhat makes an
default outstanding
default school
default leader
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities should: 
defaultprovide the 
defaultstrategic 
defaultvision for the 
defaulteconomic and social 
defaultdevelopment of their defined local area; set key goals; identify challenges
default;
default and provide the framework within which all education and training providers can eff
defaultectively operate in partnership
default.
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClarit
defaulty is needed regarding the duties of local authorities with regard to education, which should be limited to a narrow set of statutory functions, e.g. safeguarding children, admissions and special educational needs.
default 
default I
defaultt is important that all statutory servic
defaultes that local authorities provide are of high quality
default. 
default6.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, any local authority powers, including 
defaultany
default that 
defaultmay 
defaultrelate to promoting high standards in schools, should not impinge on academy independence or autonomy: to do so would undermine a fundamenta
defaultl premise of the academies movement, namely that with greater freedoms come greater responsibilities. 
default6.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWithin this context, it is inappropriate for local authorities or, indeed, the Department for Education (DfE) to have a role in ‘supporting’ academies an
defaultd free schools. It is far more fitting and sustainable in the long term to seek to promote a self-improving system
default where the very best practitioners are always 
defaultoutward looking
default and help others to improve rapidly through a school-to-school model.
default 
default6.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe IAA we
defaultlcomes recent statements from Ministers and officials regarding the intention to regionalise more of the DfE’s work and to devolve certain functions and powers to sub-regional Schools Commissioners and Headteacher Boards.  It is wholly appropriate to 
defaultmake 
defaultmore use of 
defaultsuccessful 
defaultsystem leaders 
defaultin this way and to exploit the local knowledge of those closer to the chalk face than officials in Whitehall
default by devolving as many powers as possible
default.
default  
default6.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIf, as has been suggested, these new bodies are to be responsible 
defaultfor the early identification of underperformance and for brokering improvement and/or structural solutions, then they should also carry overarching duties in respect of overall performance within their sub-regions. 
default6.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn conjunction with the sub-regional 
defaultHeadteacher Boards, i
defaultt may be appropriate to consider a
defaultn expanded
default 
defaultrole
default for NLGs (National Leaders of Governance), perhaps in an advisory capacity and/or by establishing regional panels of NLGs 
defaultas a resource to assist with the devolved system leadership fun
defaultctions.  For instance, outstanding Chairs of Governors might be able to advise on sponsor selection. 
default&#xa0;
default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAcademy chains have a crucial role to play in the new educational landscape, 
defaultwith many demonstrating outstanding a
defaultbility to transform education. 
defaultT

defaulte
default outstanding governance, leadership
default and financial management and have
default rapidly and dramatically improved
default provision and outcomes
default in schools where previously there was endemic failure
default.
default7.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe very best chains focus on a particular local area, where they maximise the benefits of joint staffing, CPD and economies of scale wit
defaulthin a 
defaultshared vision and ethos. 
defaultThey expand in a measure
defaultd
default manner, building capacity just ahead of need and ensure an unrelenting focus on the core purposes of teaching, learning and achievement.
default7.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs an association, we support and encourage the regionalisation of l
defaultarge national chains in order to achieve the benefits outlined above.
default7.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe IAA is in favour of strong

defaultaccountability and s

defaults
default the inspection
default by Ofsted
default of 
defaultacademy 
defaultchains
default.
default7.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultChains should be subject to a desktop data dashboard
default exercise
default highlighting the performance of schools within the group. 
default7.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhere the desktop 
defaultanalysis 
defaultshows a chain’s performance 
defaultto be
default less than good, they will be subject to inspection.
default 
default7.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis exercise should NOT be based on an aggregate average of the academies’ perfor
defaultmance within the chain but where there is any individual academy facing performance problems, they should be identified and 
defaultthe sponsor 
defaultquestioned.
default7.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to 
defaultthe establishment, structure or modus operandi of multi-academy 
defaulttrusts or 
defaultchains, meaning that 
defaultthe framework
default will need 
defaultto be flexible and inspections differentiated
default 
defaultfor 
defaultvarying contexts
default.
default7.9.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe also see a place for a searchable directory of academy sponsors / free school operators (see 
default4
default.7
default above) which, as with the inspect
defaultion of chains, should include intelligent, sophisticated and contextualised judgments that take into account improvement trajectories, for example the time taken by a sponsor to move a predecessor school in special measures to a good or outstanding academy
default.  
default7.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultfinancial 
default‘top slice’ 
defaultlevied by a chain 
defaultshould be more transparent and included in 
defaultthis directory (or

default)
default, comparing like for like and detailing the services that are provided for this fee. 
default7.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, it is appropriate for 
defaultEFA to audit c
defaulthains
default to ensure sound financial management and governance and value for money use of public funds.
default7.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn respect of governance arrangements, c
defaulthains 
defaultmust be free 
defaultto decide what is appropriate for them and the communities they serve. 
default There
default should be transparency about structure, resources and decisions, and a clear expectation that 
defaultthe 
defaultcommunity voice will be heard
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAcademy status is equally relevant to primary schools as it is to secondary schools and growth in the numbers of primary academies should be supported 
defaultand encouraged.
default8.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAcademy status represents a particular mind-set and approach to leadership and management, 
defaultwhere 
defaultcomplete responsibility for the performance of one’s own organisation is adopted and therefore 
defaultacademisation
default is appropriate for any school, irr
defaultespective of age phase or size.
default8.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, there are certain challenges that can be faced by small schools in respect of the additional responsibilitie
defaults that come with academy status, difficulties in creating a high reliability organisation (given the increa
defaultsed likelihood of key person dependency) and the sustainability of leadership
default. 
default8.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultTherefore, cluster arrangements are sometimes appropriate and are often most effective when one or more outstanding school is part of the group.
