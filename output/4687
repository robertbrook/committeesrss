[normal]AFS0090[bold]Written Evidence[bold] [bold]submitted by the [bold]IAA[bold]The IAA (Independent Academies Association) 
[normal]is 
[normal]the national membership organisation for leaders of academies. 
[normal] 
[normal]We are a non-partisan representative organisation committed to supporting our members in the advancement of the education and life chances of all pupils and students in our care. 
[normal] 
[normal]An acknowledged and respected national body, we are ‘the voice of academies’
[normal], run by and on behalf of our continually growing membership. We play a leading role in the development of the wider academy movement, providing help, support and advice to existing, new and converting academies. 
[normal] 
[normal]We are the only independent organisation d
[normal]edicated to supporting academies and have a track record of over 20 years’ experience in providing leadership to all types of state-funded independent schools.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Our work includes lobbying 
[normal]government and opposition on matters relating to education policy
[normal] as
[normal] it affects academies.
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The IAA (Independent Academies Association
[normal]) firmly believes that the overarching principle and foremost priority of the academies 
[normal]movement
[normal] is the urgent need to deliver high quality education to all students and pupils.  
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Evidential data demonstrates that the 
[normal]academies 
[normal]programme has been effective in 
[normal]raising standards
[normal], with the impact being greatest among sponsored academies
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]More could be 
[normal]done to incentivise increased numbers of good and outstanding converter academies to sponsor failing schools, particularly those that predominantly serve disadvantaged children.
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]accelerated pace of
[normal] academisation
[normal] has caused some issues, most notably in 
[normal]the variable quality of sponsors and governing bodies.
[normal] 
[normal]When problems occur in this area, they must be resolved more quickly than hitherto. Further reform of 
[normal]school 
[normal]governance
[normal] 
[normal]is recommended.
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Any temptation to reinvent the ‘middle tier’ along 
[normal]previous 
[normal]local
[normal] authority lines should be 
[normal]resisted
[normal]: instead, greater impetus should be provided to system leadership 
[normal]on a sub-regional basis 
[normal]as part of a truly self-improving system.
[normal]2.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities 
[normal]could
[normal] continue to 
[normal]have strategic and statutory roles to play but they 
[normal]must not be at the expense of academy independence or autonomy.
[normal]2.7.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The IAA welcomes the introduction of sub-regional Schools Commissioners and Headteacher Boards as a proportionate response to 
[normal]the ongoing expansion of the academies programme
[normal].
[normal]2.8.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Academy chains have a crucial role to play in the new educational landscape, with 
[normal]many demonstrating outstanding ability to transform education
[normal].   
[normal]2.9.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Academy status is equally relevant to primary schools as it is to secondary schools and growth in the number
[normal]s of primary academies should be supported and encouraged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2010, the NAO noted that, o
[normal]verall, academies 
[normal]increase
[normal] the rate of improvement in GCSE results when compared wi
[normal]th their predecessor schools. 
[normal] Furthermore
[normal], the proportion of 
[normal]academy students
[normal] achieving five or more A*-C 
[normal]at GCSE
[normal] 
[normal]had
[normal] improved
[normal] at a faster rate than in maintained schools
[normal], particularly those
[normal] with similar intakes
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]In 2011 and 2012 schools with academy st
[normal]atus made, on average, more progress between KS2 and GCSE than schools without academy status
[normal].
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Those sponsored academies
[normal] that were established early on in the programme replaced the worst schools in the country and, in nearly every case, transformed provision and dramatically and very rapidly improved outcomes. The focus was on removing 
[normal]from the system 
[normal]the rump of the 200 
[normal]l
[normal]owest
[normal] performing schools
[normal], where underperformance was historically endemic and stubbornly ingrained and which were situated in some of the most disadvantaged and challenged areas of the UK. 
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The fact that the early academy sponsors turned around these schoo
[normal]ls in the most 
[normal]difficult
[normal] of circumstances, with few very failures, is testament to the efficacy of the programme and it is, therefore, no surprise that we have recently witnessed 
[normal]a 
[normal]resurgence in this approach
[normal], which is welcomed by our association.
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It can also be no accident that the 
[normal]success of initiatives such as London Challenge was
[normal] contemporaneous with
[normal] a period of mass academisation of schools within the area.
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The most compelling evidence for the effectiveness of academies has come in the recently
[normal] published Ofsted Annual Report, which notes that: 
[normal]Sponsor-led academies are delivering a step change in performance for chronically
[normal] underperforming schools. Academies established in 2007 have narrowed the attainment gap of five or 
[normal]more A* to C grades at 
[normal]GCSE, including English and 
[normal]mathematics, by eight percentage points.
[normal] 
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The report also goes on to state that “
[normal]Academy converters are outperforming all non-academy schools” and that “Sponsor-led academies that have been open since 2007 have made the most im
[normal]provement at Key Stage 4”, suggesting that the longer an academy is established, the greater its impact
[normal] over time
[normal].
[normal]￼
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The IAA acknowledges
[normal] and welcomes the moves made by Ministers in recent times to increase the rigour in selecting academy sponsors / free school proposers, in assessing the capacity of existing sponsors to take on additional academies
[normal],
[normal] and in pausing or halting the expansion 
[normal]of chains where there have been concerns about academic performance or financial management.
[normal] 
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]However
[normal], the process 
[normal]leading to
[normal] ministerial approval and subsequent academisation remains unwieldy and can be painfully slow
[normal],
[normal] not only for the prospective sponsor
[normal] but for the children attending 
[normal]failing schools, their parents 
[normal]and 
[normal]the 
[normal]staff working in
[normal] them
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] Schools can find themselves in a protracted state of limbo, where uncertainty and the inability to move forward can impact detrimentally on stakeholder confidenc
[normal]e, the quality of provision and sometimes on outcomes.
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he DfE might usefully consider further refinements to the two approaches to academisation, the so-called ‘fast-track’ and ‘fully sponsored’ routes, which are rightly based on assessments of potential 
[normal]risk, in order to ensure that, where necessary, children’s education can be transformed without delay. 
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]With regard to the programme as a whole, however, in some ways the converse is true, as t
[normal]he 
[normal]accelerated pace of
[normal] academisation
[normal] has caused some issues, mo
[normal]st notably in the variable quality of sponsors and governing bodies.
[normal] 
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]When problems occur in this area, they must be resolved more 
[normal]readily
[normal] than hitherto. 
[normal]The Department should act more quickly to reassign a sponsor/trust where a mistake has been made
[normal].
[normal]4.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Existing governing bodies of schools rated less than good by Ofsted should not be involved in choos
[normal]ing their own academy sponsor. 
[normal]It is appropriate that, where a local authority has worked closely with a school and knows it well, they should have a voice i
[normal]n respect of the choice of sponsor but the local authority should not have any power of veto.  
[normal]4.7.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We acknowledge that there is less “soft sponsorship” of schools than was the case at one time, but more can still be done and similar ‘tightening up’ may be nee
[normal]ded in the free schools programme. 
[normal]4.8.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]To support sponsor selection and to ensure rigorous accountability, we
[normal] need a transparent, easy to access register of sponsors 
[normal]that
[normal] for each sponsor
[normal] includes
[normal]:
[normal] a list of schools they run
[normal];
[normal] the
[normal] Ofsted
[normal] judgments of each of t
[normal]hose schools
[normal];
[normal] and
[normal] the
[normal] improvement
[normal]s in progress and attainment that have
[normal] been achieved
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]4.9.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Further reform of 
[normal]school 
[normal]governance, 
[normal]for example
[normal] to align it more with
[normal] the most successful practice in
[normal] the business sector, is recommended
[normal], 
[normal]with 
[normal]very clear and transpar
[normal]ent accountability, 
[normal]much smaller boards of non-executive directors, fewer committees and more performance management of governors than is currently the case in the majority of schools and academies.  Within a group setting, the role of the Executive Princi
[normal]pal / Chief Executive Officer with regard to governance should be more clearly defined and emphasised, as should that of other Executive Directors.  I
[normal]t may be that radical 
[normal]transformation
[normal] 
[normal]of governance 
[normal]is required in order to help bring about the next step 
[normal]change in the education system as a whole
[normal].
[normal]4.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Certainly there remain issues with the recruitment and retention of governors, directors and trustees of sufficient calibre and with adequate capacity 
[normal]to fulfil the roles and duties as currently defined and govern
[normal]ment would do well to consider means of incentivising the best people to take up these positions
[normal] and to encourage businesses to promote them amongst their workforce
[normal].
[normal]4.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The IAA s
[normal]upport
[normal]s
[normal] the benchmarking of 
[normal]existing 
[normal]Headteachers 
[normal]of failing schools
[normal], recognising
[normal] that in some cases, for instance where the Headteacher is a recent appointment, a change in leadership may not necessarily be the most appropriate course of action
[normal].
[normal]4.12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our association would defend 
[normal]compulsion
[normal] as a route to academisation
[normal], but 
[normal]it should always 
[normal]be 
[normal]based on 
[normal]sound 
[normal]evidence
[normal] and 
[normal]sophisticated
[normal] judgement
[normal]s about 
[normal]a school’s
[normal] performance and capacity to improve (or otherwise).
[normal]4.13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important that academisation is not seen as a punishment but is viewed as being of benefit to children, young people and a lo
[normal]cal community. The DfE may wish to review what messages are communicated to schools ‘in scope’.
[normal]4.14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Hitherto, conversion to academy status has involved the closing of the predecessor school/s and reopening as a new school: this process should be maintained as 
[normal]there needs to be every opportunity to rebrand, ‘re-culture’
[normal] and adopt new approaches.
[normal]4.15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Free S
[normal]chool
[normal]s
[normal] programme should be more systematically targeted
[normal] in areas of basic need
[normal] (i.e. where there is a significant shortage of school places).
[normal]4.16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also believe t
[normal]hat
[normal] 
[normal]it is appropriate to open free schools
[normal] where 
[normal]the 
[normal]existing 
[normal]quality of 
[normal]provision is poor
[normal] and standards are low.
[normal]4.17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal]ny
[normal] mechanism for opening 
[normal]new 
[normal]schools must be 
[normal]balanced
[normal] by a mechanism for closing schools
[normal] that suffer from endemic poor performance.
[normal]  The option of closure should 
[normal]be a mandatory consideration every time a school faces compulsory conversion 
[normal]to academy status 
[normal]or is 
[normal]under threat of being moved
[normal] to another sponsor
[normal].
[normal]4.18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]At the opposite end of the spectrum, an outstanding school that is a member 
[normal]of an academy chain should have the option to leave its group and set up as a separate sponsor and take on one or more failing schools, providing that doing so will demonstrably not impact negatively on the capacity of the existing sponsor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The number of academies whose performance causes concern is a very small percentage of the total.
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The current mechanism of issui
[normal]ng sponsors with pre warning notices and, if subsequently necessary, warning letters, has led to considerable and quick improvements in these academies.
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In extreme circumstances, where it is considered that standards are unlikely to rise quickly enough, it
[normal] is right and proper that the Secretary of State direct a
[normal] change
[normal] of s
[normal]ponsor
[normal].
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important, however, that 
[normal]action 
[normal]is d
[normal]ecisive 
[normal]and taken without undue delay, in order that children do not miss the opportunity of a good quality education.
[normal]5.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As the programme expands further, 
[normal]the systematic growth of school-to-
[normal]school support
[normal] will be essential, especially as the Secretary of State implements 
[normal]a model of 
[normal]devolution to regional regulatory and advisory bodies, as described below, founded on the work
[normal] of successful system leaders and the Office of the Schools Commissioner.  
[normal]5.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It will be a vital corollary to such a framework that the identification and development of these system leaders is accurate and valid.  Therefore, schools and academies should onl
[normal]y be judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted if they can demonstrate that they are outward-
[normal]facing
[normal] and that they have successfully led school improvement beyond their individual institution.
[normal]5.7.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We 
[normal]also 
[normal]hope that the introduction of 
[normal]the ‘P
[normal]rogress 8
[normal]’ measure
[normal] will lead to
[normal] a better understanding of what is
[normal] an outstanding
[normal] school
[normal] in terms of making a difference to children’s learning
[normal] and development
[normal], and 
[normal]of 
[normal]what makes an
[normal] outstanding
[normal] school
[normal] leader
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities should: 
[normal]provide the 
[normal]strategic 
[normal]vision for the 
[normal]economic and social 
[normal]development of their defined local area; set key goals; identify challenges
[normal];
[normal] and provide the framework within which all education and training providers can eff
[normal]ectively operate in partnership
[normal].
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Clarit
[normal]y is needed regarding the duties of local authorities with regard to education, which should be limited to a narrow set of statutory functions, e.g. safeguarding children, admissions and special educational needs.
[normal] 
[normal] I
[normal]t is important that all statutory servic
[normal]es that local authorities provide are of high quality
[normal]. 
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]However, any local authority powers, including 
[normal]any
[normal] that 
[normal]may 
[normal]relate to promoting high standards in schools, should not impinge on academy independence or autonomy: to do so would undermine a fundamenta
[normal]l premise of the academies movement, namely that with greater freedoms come greater responsibilities. 
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Within this context, it is inappropriate for local authorities or, indeed, the Department for Education (DfE) to have a role in ‘supporting’ academies an
[normal]d free schools. It is far more fitting and sustainable in the long term to seek to promote a self-improving system
[normal] where the very best practitioners are always 
[normal]outward looking
[normal] and help others to improve rapidly through a school-to-school model.
[normal] 
[normal]6.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The IAA we
[normal]lcomes recent statements from Ministers and officials regarding the intention to regionalise more of the DfE’s work and to devolve certain functions and powers to sub-regional Schools Commissioners and Headteacher Boards.  It is wholly appropriate to 
[normal]make 
[normal]more use of 
[normal]successful 
[normal]system leaders 
[normal]in this way and to exploit the local knowledge of those closer to the chalk face than officials in Whitehall
[normal] by devolving as many powers as possible
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]6.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]If, as has been suggested, these new bodies are to be responsible 
[normal]for the early identification of underperformance and for brokering improvement and/or structural solutions, then they should also carry overarching duties in respect of overall performance within their sub-regions. 
[normal]6.7.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In conjunction with the sub-regional 
[normal]Headteacher Boards, i
[normal]t may be appropriate to consider a
[normal]n expanded
[normal] 
[normal]role
[normal] for NLGs (National Leaders of Governance), perhaps in an advisory capacity and/or by establishing regional panels of NLGs 
[normal]as a resource to assist with the devolved system leadership fun
[normal]ctions.  For instance, outstanding Chairs of Governors might be able to advise on sponsor selection. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Academy chains have a crucial role to play in the new educational landscape, 
[normal]with many demonstrating outstanding a
[normal]bility to transform education. 
[normal]T
[normal]he most successful epitomis
[normal]e
[normal] outstanding governance, leadership
[normal] and financial management and have
[normal] rapidly and dramatically improved
[normal] provision and outcomes
[normal] in schools where previously there was endemic failure
[normal].
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The very best chains focus on a particular local area, where they maximise the benefits of joint staffing, CPD and economies of scale wit
[normal]hin a 
[normal]shared vision and ethos. 
[normal]They expand in a measure
[normal]d
[normal] manner, building capacity just ahead of need and ensure an unrelenting focus on the core purposes of teaching, learning and achievement.
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As an association, we support and encourage the regionalisation of l
[normal]arge national chains in order to achieve the benefits outlined above.
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The IAA is in favour of strong 
[normal]public 
[normal]accountability and s
[normal]upport
[normal]s
[normal] the inspection
[normal] by Ofsted
[normal] of 
[normal]academy 
[normal]chains
[normal].
[normal]7.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chains should be subject to a desktop data dashboard
[normal] exercise
[normal] highlighting the performance of schools within the group. 
[normal]7.6.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Where the desktop 
[normal]analysis 
[normal]shows a chain’s performance 
[normal]to be
[normal] less than good, they will be subject to inspection.
[normal] 
[normal]7.7.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This exercise should NOT be based on an aggregate average of the academies’ perfor
[normal]mance within the chain but where there is any individual academy facing performance problems, they should be identified and 
[normal]the sponsor 
[normal]questioned.
[normal]7.8.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to 
[normal]the establishment, structure or modus operandi of multi-academy 
[normal]trusts or 
[normal]chains, meaning that 
[normal]the framework
[normal] will need 
[normal]to be flexible and inspections differentiated
[normal] 
[normal]for 
[normal]varying contexts
[normal].
[normal]7.9.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We also see a place for a searchable directory of academy sponsors / free school operators (see 
[normal]4
[normal].7
[normal] above) which, as with the inspect
[normal]ion of chains, should include intelligent, sophisticated and contextualised judgments that take into account improvement trajectories, for example the time taken by a sponsor to move a predecessor school in special measures to a good or outstanding academy
[normal].  
[normal]7.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]financial 
[normal]‘top slice’ 
[normal]levied by a chain 
[normal]should be more transparent and included in 
[normal]this directory (or 
[normal]chain performance tables
[normal])
[normal], comparing like for like and detailing the services that are provided for this fee. 
[normal]7.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Furthermore, it is appropriate for 
[normal]EFA to audit c
[normal]hains
[normal] to ensure sound financial management and governance and value for money use of public funds.
[normal]7.12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In respect of governance arrangements, c
[normal]hains 
[normal]must be free 
[normal]to decide what is appropriate for them and the communities they serve. 
[normal] There
[normal] should be transparency about structure, resources and decisions, and a clear expectation that 
[normal]the 
[normal]community voice will be heard
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Academy status is equally relevant to primary schools as it is to secondary schools and growth in the numbers of primary academies should be supported 
[normal]and encouraged.
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Academy status represents a particular mind-set and approach to leadership and management, 
[normal]where 
[normal]complete responsibility for the performance of one’s own organisation is adopted and therefore 
[normal]academisation
[normal] is appropriate for any school, irr
[normal]espective of age phase or size.
[normal]8.3.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]However, there are certain challenges that can be faced by small schools in respect of the additional responsibilitie
[normal]s that come with academy status, difficulties in creating a high reliability organisation (given the increa
[normal]sed likelihood of key person dependency) and the sustainability of leadership
[normal]. 
[normal]8.4.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Therefore, cluster arrangements are sometimes appropriate and are often most effective when one or more outstanding school is part of the group.
[normal]8.5.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Whether such arrangements are o
[normal]n the basis of a primary only collaborative, ‘a
[normal]ll through
[normal]’ structures or otherwise cross-phase, 
[normal]greater v
[normal]alue for money 
[normal]can be achieved
[normal] through 
[normal]economies of scale
[normal], the group can recruit and retain
[normal] 
[normal]high
[normal]er
[normal] quality staff 
[normal]committed to 
[normal]the cluster
[normal], new career pathways can be developed 
[normal]and 
[normal]the opportunities to share staff, best practice and CPD across and between schools within the group 
[normal]are beneficial to the raising of standards.
