"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Electoral Commission (DWB 09)Introduction 1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Electoral Commission is an independent body which reports directly to the UK Parliament. We regulate political party and \nelection finance and set standards for well-run elections. We put voters first by working to support a healthy democracy, where elections and referendums are based on our principles of trust, participation, and no undue influence. We are responsible for pu\nblishing reports on the administration of elections\n and referendums\n. \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nur comments on the \ndraft \nBill relate to matters concerning referendums and \nelectoral arrangements\n.\n \nReferendum about commencement of income tax provisions1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have specific responsibilit\nies\n in relation to the conduct of\n \nreferendums held under the framework of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA). The proposed \nreferendum included within the D\nraft Wales Bill\n will\n be \nconducted under that framework.\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn any such\n referendum,\n our role includes:\n \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Chair of the Commission, or someone she appoints, is Chief Counting\n Officer,\n responsible for the conduct of the referendum and ensur\ning the accuracy of the overall result. \n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA well-run referendum which has the confidence of voters and campaigners is underpinned by a clear and certain legal framework. Good legislation provides absolute clarity on the roles and responsibilities of those a\ndministering the referendum and sets out fair rules governing cam\npaign spending and fundraising.\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Commission’s comments \non the draft Bill\n \ndraw\n on lessons learnt from the \nWales and\n the UK-wide referendum\ns\n held in \n2011\n.\n \nWe published reports on the two \nreferendums in 2011\n. \n1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legislation for the\n forthcoming\n Scottish independence referendum addresses a number of our recommendations from 2011 and also contains provisions specific to that referendum. After the independence referendum, we will reflect on \nhow those provisions have worked in practice and consider whether and how such provisions should apply to all referendums held under PPERA. \nRules for the conduct of the referendum1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe draft Bill provides f\nor the referendum rules\n to be contained in\n an\n Orde\nr in Council\n. The provision in the draft Bill is the same as that in the Government of Wales Act 2006\n (GOWA\n). \n1.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the referendums in 2011, \nwe recommended\n that the UK Government should use the powers pro\nvided \nin the Political Parties, Elections and\n Referendums Act 2000\n (PPERA) to make a generic order providing for the conduct of any future referendum\n.\n We said that i\nntroducing generic rules would:\n&#xa0;\n1.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK Government responded to our recommendation in December 2012\n, recog\nnising\n the benefits that a generic conduct order for refe\nrendums would bring, and undertaking to consider this\n further, including through discussion with the Law Commission in the context of their revi\new of electoral law as a whole.\n1.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe continue to urge the\n Government to make such an Order, which\n in relation to\n the draft Wales Bill would obvia\nte the need for rules to be made in the\n Order in Council\n after the referendum h\nas been triggered. \n1.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving a generic conduct Order in place would also ensure that the \nrules for the referendum are in place at least six months before t\nhe referendum takes place, as\n should be t\nhe case for all polls\n.\n We have already seen the benefit of this for the Scottish independence referendum, where the relevant legislation is in place \nnine months in advance of the poll.\n1.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that the rules that apply to the conduct of a referendum under the provisions of the draft Bill are in place at least six months before the referendum is held.Scope of the Order-making power1.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNotwithstanding\n our recommendation for a generic conduct order, we are concerned that t\nhe Order-making power in the draft Bill \nmay not be sufficient in scope to allow for lessons learnt fr\nom other referendums\n to be applied\n.\n \nOur concern is based on experience in the previ\nous referendum in Wales in 2011.\n1.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe detailed rules \nfor the referendum \nheld under\n the Parliamentary Voting Systems \nand Constituencies \nAct\n 2011\n (PVS\nC\n) \nwere very similar to the rules used for the Wales referendum in March 2011, but with some notable differe\nnces. The two sets of referendum rules could not be fully aligned at the time\n, \nbecause of limitations to the scope of\n the Order-making power in in GOWA\n.\n \n1.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have \nrecommended that \nchanges should be made to the ge\nneric\n controls \non campaigning at\n any referendum held under the provisions of PPERA\n, to provide a robust and proportionate regulatory regime\n. \nWe recommend, therefore, that these should\n apply to any referendum held under the\n provisions of the draft Bill. \n \nAgain b\nased on experience from \nthe\n Wales referendum in 2011\n, \nit may not be possible for these\n changes\n to be introduced under the O\nrder-making power in its current form.\n1.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo illustrate the scope of the Order-making power\n that will be needed, \nspecific examples that the rules for the referendu\nm should include\n and the changes that need to be made to the regulatory controls of the referendum are set out in \nAnnex 1.\n1.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that the Order-making power for a referendum in the draft Wales Bill should be sufficiently broad in scope to enable any recommendations about the conduct and regulation of referendums held under PPERA to apply to a referendum held under the provisions of the Bill. 1.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf there is any \ndoubt about whether the changes that are needed can be achieved through an \nO\nrder\n in Council, t\nhen we suggest that amendments are incorporated in the \nprimary legislation.\nDesignation and putting campaign arguments to voters1.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe issue of \nwhether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and a\nble applicants for designation\n \nas lead campaigner\ns\n on both sides \nof the argument \nis one that needs early consideration. \n1.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe generic \nstatutory designation process \nin PPERA \nrelies on the assumption that there will be campaign groups on either side of the re\nferendum question which are willing and able to use the benefits of designation to mount a lead campaign. If that is not the case – either because most prospective campaigners are on one side of the debate, or because a campaigner sees tactical advantage i\nn not seeking designation – then the referendum campaign, and the process of putting the campaign arguments to voters, \nis likely to\n suffer.\n1.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nt the 2011 referendum in\n Wales, we were unable to designate lead campaigners because there was no willing and able \napplicant for the \n‘no’ outcome.  \n1.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommended in 2011 that when considering the case for future referendums, legislators should take into account whether the referendum is likely to stimulate a level of debate which would generate willing and able appli\ncants for designation. We would of \ncourse be happy to work with the Government to consider how to take th\nis recommendation into account.\n1.25\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also recommended\n in 2011 \nthat t\nhe Government should take steps to reduce the potential advantages to a prospective l\nead campaigner of deciding not to apply for designation. In 2012, the Government responded to this recommendation by saying\n:\n‘\nDesignated organisations are important to the referendum process as they are a source of public awareness about the issues at hand\n. It is important that support be provided for them through the legislative framework. Clearly, it runs counter to the interests of voters if there is any incentive for campaigners to refrain from applying to become designated organisations, as this may im\npede the proper development of public understanding during a referendum campaign…… The Government is therefore considering carefully how the designation process might be improved\n’\n1.26\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Scottish Government has addressed this recommendation \nin the \nScottish \nIndependence Referendum Act 2013 by providing for the Commission to designate for only one outcome if there are not willing and abl\ne applicants for both outcomes.\n180-day timetable for the Order in Council\n1.27\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe draft \nBill\n provides for a 180-day period from\n receipt by t\nhe Secretary of State \nof a notice from the First Mi\nnister \nt\no the draft Order \nbeing laid\n in Parliament\n. This compares with \na \n120-\nday period \nin \nGOWA\n, which\n was \nin practice suspended after\n \nthe\n UK Parliamentary\n general election\n was held\n in\n Ma\ny 201\n0\n.\n \n1.28\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs described earlier, generic referendum rules would obviate the need for referendum rules to be made by Order in Council. Without generic rules, however, advance drafting of the rules will be essential to enable\n \nstatutory consultation\n \nwith the \nCommission\n and others, as well as\n scrutiny,\n within the 180-day timetable.  \n1.29\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe 1\n80-\nday period will include\n the time the \nC\nommission needs to undertake our\n statutory assessmen\nt \nof \nthe intelligibility of the referendum question\n.\n \nOur approach to \nassessing ref\nerendum questio\nns \ntake\ns\n around \n10 weeks\n to complete, which includes time\n to undertake public opinion research to see what people think of the question\n. We need time to undertake any necessary procurement and about two weeks’ notice \nto \nstart \ntest\ning\n the que\nstion\n. \n1.30\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\noll\nowing receipt of our assessment\n the referendum question, the Secretary of State wi\nll need time to consider our recommendations. It is possible that further iterations will be required \nbefore the question\n can be finalised for inclusion in\n the Or\nder in Council\n.\n1.31\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 180-day period should allow sufficient time for assessing and finalising the referendum question for inclusion in the Order in Counci\nl, providing advance preparation \nis undertaken. \nLegislative timetable1.32\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor completeness\n,\n we \nhighlight\n the need for early consideration of the\n timetable\n for the referendum itself\n. \nWe recommended after the referendums held\n in 2011\n that there \nshould be\n at least 12 weeks between the campaign rules being finalised and the start of the \nregulated referendum peri\nod. This period is important to enable the Commission to publish and disseminate guidance in time to allow campaigners to understand the rules before they come into force. \nVoter information1.33\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe Draft Wales Bill\n provides for the Commission to have\n respons\nibi\nlity for \nproviding informatio\nn to voters. The provisions\n mirror\n those\n of GOWA\n \n2006 and we are content with their\n inclusion\n.\nNational Assembly for Wales electoral arrangementsFive year fixed terms1.34\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe draft Bill\n would lengthen\n Assembly terms from four to five years. \nWhilst the C\nommission does not have a \nspecific \nview on the question of whether an Assembly term should be a four or five year fixed term, we \ndo\n \ngive\n \nour \nviews on particular combinations of elections.\n \nThe Commission’\ns position is that each individual proposal should b\ne considered on its merits and w\ne advise on the particular risks and how they could be managed.\n \nOur priority is that a poll\n is well-run and delivered in a way that is easy for voters to \nunderstand and par\nticipate in.\n1.35\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe election schedule is\n:\n&#xa0;\n1.36\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe combination of a UK Parliamentary general election, Welsh general election and Police and Crime Commissioner elections in 2020 would present significan\nt challenges for voters. I\nt would mea\nn each voter\n \ncasting ballots\n in up to three differently-drawn constituencies\n and\n \nan electoral region;\n on four separate ballot papers and using\n \nthree different electoral systems\n.\n It would also prove challenging for political parties and candidates, not least because of the risk of one campaign overshadowing another and the communication issues that campaigning across multiple elections presents. \nThere would also be \na\ndministrative \nchallenges\n for\n Ret\nurning Off\nicers\n. Overall, these\n issues would bring significant risks to ensuring well-run elections.\n \n1.37\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMoving \nthe Assembly term to five years avoids \nthe risks inherent in \ncombining three sets of elections i\nn 2020\n, although \nit \ndoes then bri\nng\n \ncombination with local government elections\n in Wales\n \nin 2021\n.\n \nIn th\nat combination, each voter would cast ballots\n in \na constituency\n, \nan electoral region\n and \na local ward\n, on three ballot papers and using two electoral systems. There would be \nrisks\n to add\nress\n, but less so\n than \nin \n2020.\nRestore the right for candidates to stand on both a constituency and regional list during the Assembly elections1.38\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe draft \nBill\n provides for\n the removal of the restriction on standing for election for both cons\ntituency\n and \nelectoral regions.\n It\n should be straightforward for people to participate \nin elections, whether voting or campaigning. This means there should be no unnecessary barriers to standing for election. We made our view clear when the initial proposals to prohibit dual candidacy in W\nales were published as part of the Government of Wales Bill 2006 that we did not believe that the case for introducing the change had been made, on the evidence available at the time. \n1.39\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo our knowledge, no further evidence has become available that would s\nuggest that the prohibition should be retained. It continues to be the case that there is no similar prohibition for candidates in Scottish Parliament elections, where the same electoral system is in use\n.\n  We agree, therefore, that candidates should be abl\ne to stand in a constituency and a region in the same Assembly election. \nEnsure that Assembly Members cannot be MPs at the same time1.40\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe draft \nBill\n provides for\n the disqualification of MPs from membership of the Assembly. \nWhile we do\n not have a specific \nview on the question\n of multiple mandates, issues to be considered are what the electorate\n expect\ns of their representatives and how \nrepresentative\ns\n ensure the best possible leve\nl\n of service\n.\n Can this be\n achieved by representing the electorate\n at a variety \nof different levels (for example at the UK Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales) and the experience which this brings about or should the focus be\n entirely on one legislature?\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;Annex 1\nRecommended changes to the \nconduct and \nregulation of PPERA referendums\n1.41\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo illustrate the scope of the Order-making power\n that will be needed, below are \nspecific examples \nof what\n \nthe rules for the referendum should include\n and the changes that we recommend \nto \nthe regulatory controls \nin PPERA \nfor \nreferendum campaigns.\nRules for the conduct of the referendumThe rules should be as contained in the Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Act 2011, including:\n&#xa0;\nRegulation of referendum campaigns&#xa0;\n1.42\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, our 2011 referendum report, \nand the Scott\nish Independence Referendum Act\n 2013 also contained a number of other proposed amendments to the generic PPERA controls which reduce the burdens on campaigners and improve the workability and clarity of the rules. There would be considerable b\nenefit in these amendments also applying at future PPERA referendums to:\n&#xa0;\nIf a designation process is to be used, then it will also be important to consider:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNew recommendations1.43\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring 2011-12 the Commission undertook a review of the of the UK’s party and election finance laws\n. \nWe recommended new measures\n to simplify the registration process, provide more detailed reporting of pre-registration spending, requiring imprints on electronic material and improvements to the workability of the provisions around sanctioning and late payment of fines. We would of c\nourse be happy to work with the Government to take these new recommendations forward.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n Part 2, sections 10 and 11; Schedule 1\n Reports on the Referendum on the voting system for UK Parliamentary elections (\nhttp://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/141\n328/Final-PVS-report.pdf\n) and the Referendum on the law-making powers of the National Assembly for Wales (\nhttp://www.electoralcommi\nssion.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/118603/Wales-ref-report-FINAL-web-mail.pdf\n)\n Schedule 1 paragraph 2.\n Schedule 5 paragraph 2.\n Section 129\n Reports on the Referendum on the voting system for UK Parliamentary elections (\nhttp://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/141328/Final-PVS-report.pdf\n) and the Referendum on the law-making powers of the National Assembly for\n Wales (\nhttp://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/118603/Wales-ref-report-FINAL-web-mail.pdf\n)\n \nThe UK Gove\nrnment’s Response to the Electoral Commission’s Report on the 2011 Referendums (December 2012)\n Schedule 2.\n The UK Government’s Response to the Electoral Commission’s Report on the 2011 Referendums (December 2012)\n Section 11.\n Schedule 1 Parts 7 and \n8\n Government of Wales Act 2006, Schedule 6, Parts 7 and 8.\n Part 1, section 1\n Part 1, Section 2\n Part 1, Section 3\n \nA regulatory review of the UK’s party and election finance laws.
