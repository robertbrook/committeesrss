[[[Written evidence submitted by Paul Fuller]]]I would like to let the Education Select Committee know about how our village has been ridden roughshod over by the Department for Education for the past 11 months, how we do not need or require a school in Stoke Poges and the flawed process to which we have been subjected that has allowed a Free School to open in a local community that has no requirement.As part of the Education Select Committee desire to investigate the process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors; It would be helpful to investigate and understand why was a Free School that was given approval to open in Slough Berkshire can be allowed to open in Stoke Poges South Buckinghamshire in an area that has no need for school places and a community that does not require a school or have the infrastructure to support an 850 pupil school?“………early indications show that there are more ‘No’ votes from local community opposed to the school than there are ‘Yes’ votes from the Sikh community…Please please can you forward or inform as many friends and family about the importance of filling in the online form. You could also do it on behalf of friends and relatives…”There are 6087 responses in total, 4087 supporting and 2002 not supporting the proposal the authors admit that 1707 (28%) of the responses had no identifiable address. There are no hard number breakdowns provided of the actual responses to the consultation questions, yet seemingly firm conclusions about responses are presented as facts. There is also no hard number breakdown of question response by responder address, town or postcode, making any demographic analysis of responses highly questionable. There are no hard numbers or graphical data provided to support the various “Key Outcomes” statementsStoke Poges Primary School conducts a survey of to assess the level of demand for places at KSA if it were to open in the village. Over 95% responded that they would not send their children, including a high proportion of Sikh families with children at Stoke Poges Primary&#xa0; November 2013&#xa0;
