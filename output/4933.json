"&#xa0;\nSubmission from Sunderland City Council (FDC22)&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.0\n              \nIntroduction\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nSunderland City Council welcomes the opportunity to provide \nto the Committee \ncomments \non \nhow f\niscal and financial powers could be devolved to cities and City Regions\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nThese comments are provided in addition to the comments of the Key Cities Group (of which the council is a founder member) submitted on behalf of the Group by Wakefield City \nCouncil\n \nand which the City Council fully supports\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThe\n City Council considers that\n \nthe \npotential implications\n from greater Scottish autonomy should be borne in mind as part of \nany \nfurther considerations on\n how fiscal and financial powers could be devo\nlved to \nand beyond \ncities and City Regions\n in England\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.0\n              \nEvidence\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nThe scale of economic competit\nion \ncurrently provided by Scotland is an issue which the cou\nncil wishes to respond to\n.  R\nesearch \nhas already been undertaken by organisations\n such as the Association of North\n East Council\ns in this regard,\n in terms of \nboth competing\n and \nengagi\nng with Scotland\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nAn un-level playing field currently exists between England and Scotland in respect of devolved fiscal and financial powers.  \nScotlan\nd already has power over many of the key determinants of economic development including infrastructure, skills, education and industrial development and could become more attractive for inward investment if it acquires greater fiscal powers, to the detrime\nnt of areas in the North East and Cumbria\n in particular\n.\n  For example, Scotland has the ability to vary taxes and incentives to its advantage but the North East and Cumbria doesn’t have the ability to take countervailing measures.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nT\nhe different instit\nutional frameworks and capacities \non each side of the border \n(particularly\n \nsince the abolition of \nthe \nR\negional \nD\nevelopment \nA\ngencies \n and the Government Offices) place the North East and Cumbria at a\n disadvantage.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nBoth are\n institutional\nly weaker \nfollow\ning the abolition of regional structures leaving them \nwith reduced power and autonomy\n.  Scotland, in contrast, \nalready has\n powerful political and eco\nnomic \nd\nevelopment organisations \n(\nincluding \nScottish Local Authorities, Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish \nFunding Council and Skills Scotland)\n forming a more effective institutional framework with the capacity to \nspeak with a single voice\n directly to the First Minister for Scotland and colleagues on a regular basis\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nThe Scottish Independence Referendum to\n be held on 18 September 2014 and is \nvery \nlikely to result in Scotland acquiring substantial new powers either through independence, or the ‘Devo Plus’ or ‘Devo Max’ options.  Regardless of the actual result, the acquisition of new powers by Scotland \ncan b\ne ex\npected to have substantial economic development impl\nications for the rest of the UK, and especially \nfor the North East and Cumbria.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nIncreased autonomy for Scotland, is therefore not just a matter for Scotland.  A\n resurgent Scotland \nwill pose\n a thr\neat to economic de\nvelopment south of the border, but there is also the potential for\n economic development in the North East and Cumbria \nto \nb\nenefit from a more autonomous Scotland.  \nThe City Council \nrecognis\nes that t\nhere are both potential threats and oppor\ntunities\n but they do not necessarily balance out\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n              \nIt is Sunderland\n City Council’s consideration that \nwithout greater fiscal devolution to and beyond cities and City Regions \na\nreas like Sunderland are at risk of being caught between “a rock and a hard p\nlace”\n,\n between an increasing autonomous and confident Scotland and a\nn increasingly\n prosperous and powerful London an\nd the South East\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nAn example of the type of incentives for growth which the City Council would seek to have devolved to relevant local authorities would include the ability to \nput together a package of incentives that would be equivalent (but not identical) in financial ter\nms to that which Scotland/Scottish authorities would be able to muster.  The City Council \nrecognis\nes that for instance, varying Corporation Tax within the rest of the United Kingdom would not be possible, financial devolution could allow the North East and\n Cumbria to assemble a competitive financial offer.\n&#xa0;\n3.0\n              \nConclusion\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n              \nThe issue of Scotland’s competitive advantag\ne now \nand after the \ni\nndependence referendum \nmust\n i\nnform considerations by \ngovernment\n \nin respect of maxi\nmizing economic impact and the \npoten\ntial to improve services and reduce costs through fiscal devolution to and beyond cities and City Regions in England.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
