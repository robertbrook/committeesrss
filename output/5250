default&#xa0;
defaultDear Mr Stringer,
defaultI was watching the Select Committee meeting on 7th January 2013 where you were asking questions of Stewart Wingate CEO of Gatwick Airport - I didn't catch it all but at about 15:18, he claimed that 
defaulthe had over 500 of his staff dealing with the customers in the airport. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a witness on the check in desk side at Gatwick airport North terminal I can verify that he had only 4 of his staff at the check in desk area and 1 of his staff down below at the 
defaultarrivals section, none of them had any useful information and could not contact anyone that was able to help. 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy father in law was trapped the other side of security and he told me that there were similar numbers that side. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNot sure where the other 490 o
defaultf his staff were but they were not dealing with customers / passengers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI would suggest calling one of those 4 assistants to give evidence they may be more accurate.
