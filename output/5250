[normal]tten evidence from Charles Ellis (TWR0004)

[normal]Dear Mr Stringer,
[normal]I was watching the Select Committee meeting on 7th January 2013 where you were asking questions of Stewart Wingate CEO of Gatwick Airport - I didn't catch it all but at about 15:18, he claimed that 
[normal]he had over 500 of his staff dealing with the customers in the airport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a witness on the check in desk side at Gatwick airport North terminal I can verify that he had only 4 of his staff at the check in desk area and 1 of his staff down below at the 
[normal]arrivals section, none of them had any useful information and could not contact anyone that was able to help. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My father in law was trapped the other side of security and he told me that there were similar numbers that side. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Not sure where the other 490 o
[normal]f his staff were but they were not dealing with customers / passengers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would suggest calling one of those 4 assistants to give evidence they may be more accurate.
