[normal]Written submission from RoSPA (BRC 56)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]I would like to take this opportunity to respond to your committee’s 
[normal]call for evidence on the Building Regulations certification of electrical installation and repairs in dwellings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to lend my support to the value of electrical competent persons schemes, and in particular, to the efforts of the Electrical Saf
[normal]ety Council (ESC) to raise awareness of electrical safety among the general public.
[normal] 
[normal]As Deputy CEO of a charity that works closely with the ESC, I am well acquainted with the ESC's work, and therefore feel that I am qualified to comment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since it began as
[normal] an independent charity, the ESC has devoted considerable resources to raise awareness of the dangers of electrical accidents, and how to avoid them. This includes grants to community groups throughout the UK, media and public information campaigns that ha
[normal]ve reached tens of millions of people, and policy interventions - like the one on Part P - which have helped ensure that consumers are protected from deregulatory
[normal] and 
[normal]potentially 
[normal]harmful 
[normal]agendas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Despite this tremendous effort they accept that public awa
[normal]reness of Part P is not as high as they would like. However, the regulations have been in place for just eight years and information on home safety often takes many years to embed in the public consciousness. The ‘Fire Kills’ campaign has been successfully
[normal] promoting the benefits of smoke alarms for over twenty years, and still campaigners tell us there is more to do to raise awareness.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This April, significant changes were made to notification and sign off requirements under Part P along with the introduct
[normal]ion of an improved code of practice covering scheme operators, which included additional stipulations for UKAS accreditation and public promotion of competent persons. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to join in the call to urge you and your committee to take account of tho
[normal]se changes, and the large body of evidence sitting behind them contained in the Government’s impact assessment, before recommending any changes to the system which may once again create uncertainty among contractors and risk giving cowboys a fresh opportun
[normal]ity to trick consumers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I believe in the value of a single access point for consumers to engage electricians. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, I do not subscribe to the view that it is too easy to become a Part P accredited electrician or that the industry doesn’t care about 
[normal]standards. The criteria for entry onto a scheme was recently raised by the industry to ensure those applying must have NVQ level 3 certificate at least, this would not have happened if the schemes were simply out for financial gain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the moment there a
[normal]re over 40,000 electricians registered by the Part P competent persons schemes, the vast majority of whom have not provided evidence to this inquiry and thus, it must be assumed, see no immediate imperative to change the present Part P arrangements. 
[normal]Given 
[normal]this, it would be a pity if the views of the small vociferous minority of contractors who have written to you to express their dissatisfaction are given precedence in shaping your positions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this is helpful to you in the context of your inquiry, b
[normal]ecause competent persons schemes make a significant contribution to saving lives and reducing injuries.
[normal]&#xa0;
