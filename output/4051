defaultThe following paper has been prepared by British Gas Services Ltd. in response to the questions raised by the Communities and local Government (CLG) Select Committee regarding electrical safety in the home and the operation of Competent Persons Schemes.
default&#xa0;defaultPrior to the introduction of Part P there was no formal requirement for electrical work to be assessed or registered in any way.  The safety of the publ
defaultic in relation to electrical installation work was reliant upon the employment of competent contractors.  The only validation of the technical competence of those contractors was via voluntary registration with one of a number of trade organisations such a
defaults the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA) or the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installing Contractors (NICEIC).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of Part P in 2005 improved electrical safety standards by forcing contractors operating in the domestic secto
defaultr to follow the industry standards and regulations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever following the review of Part P in 2013 and subsequent concerns raised about the scheme, The CLG Select Committee has requested responses to a number of issues.  The following document details the
default view of British Gas Services ltd. with regards to these issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultBritish Gas carry
default 
defaultout electrical contracting work throughout England (Scotland and Wales) across a number of specific markets.  We operate within the 
defaultindustrial, commercial, 
defaultdomestic and resi
defaultdential sector
defaults
default via our Electrical Services contracting business, carrying out electrical installation and maintenance work for domestic customers, Central Heating Installation business undertaking gas heating installations and upgrades and through our Bri
defaulttish Gas Business contracting teams undertaking installation work, renewable technology installation work, 
defaultmaintenance, repair, test and inspection services.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe support the introduction of electrical installations as a controlled service as defined within 
defaultthe Building Regulations for England and any scheme aimed at improving electrical safety in domestic properties and raising awareness of the requirements for electrical safety in this sector.  As such we believe:

defaultThe Committee is keen to establish: the extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations;
defaultThe general awareness of the requirements for electrical work to be notified in England (Wales and Scotland operate a differing scheme) is poor.
default&#xa0;
default The proliferation of electrical accessories availability via DIY sheds like B&amp;Q, Screwfix, and Wickes adds to 
defaultthe belief that electrical work 
defaultis predominantly
default a DIY activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultThose members of the public that are aware of the requirements to use competent electrical installers and report certain electrical work employ contractors registered with an organisation suc
defaulth as the NICEIC or ECA as their brands are well established and respected.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe publicity on Part P 
defaultand the requirements has 
defaulttend
defaulted
default to be aimed at the trade not the general public.
default  This has educated the electrical contractors who want to operate 
defaultlegitimate
defaultly and want to promote electrical safety but appears to have little impact on the general public’s awareness.
defaultPart P work is only a fraction of the electrical installation work carried out in homes across England, the main issue is that many home owners be
defaultlieve electrical installation work is a low risk activity.  Educating the general public on electrical safety and the risks associated with poor installation work 
defaultand encouraging them to use competent registered electrical installers on all electrical work
default not just that deemed to be reportable under Part P should be a priority.

defaultthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a 
defaultcompany are brought up to the same level of skills;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of Part P into the building regulations in 2005 created a split in the electrical trades.
default&#xa0;
default For the first time it was recognised that the full skill sets delivered via a recognised trade a
defaultpprenticeship of 4 -5 years were not necessary if the person was only training to operate in a small sector of the industry known as domestic installations.
default&#xa0;
default For many years electricians had been operating in this sector that migrated from similar trades, w
defaultere self taught or never completed their formal training.
default&#xa0;
default As electrical work was previously an uncontrolled service (not notifiable to building control) there was no requirement for any formal qualifications.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultPart P introduced a necessity for any instal
defaultler carrying out work that is “reportable” under the building regulation scheme to register with a Competent Person Scheme.  This had the effect that existing installers and previously “unqualified” installers had to take recognised qualifications, improvi
defaultng their awareness of the wiring regulations and as a result improving the electrical installation standards and safety.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, in some cases
default new “
defaultlimited
default competency” qualifications were developed to allow those operating in this sector without formal qualifications to attain a recognised qualification quickly.
default&#xa0;
default These training courses ran from as little as 3 days, however their scope expanded from the provi
defaultsion of a recognised qualification for people already experienced to a new skill training scheme.
default&#xa0;
default The
default 
defaultschemes became popular amongst people who never worked in the sector, they could attend a short duration course and then hold the necessary qualification
defaults to become registered on a competent persons scheme and rewire domestic houses!
default  The quality of these training schemes needs to be carefully considered.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe competent person scheme providers rule
defaults
default demand that the “Qualifying Supervisor” 
default(QS) 
defaultholds the t
defaultechnical qualifications and are assessed carrying out work such as testing.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe QS is then responsible for the work undertaken by the installers he is responsible for. 
defaultA QS can supervise a n
defaultumber of unqualified installers
default, the
default individuals
default may never need t
defaulto be assessed.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe two main issues with this scheme are:
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoor levels of initial training to qualify as a Part P QS.
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNot everyone who carryout installation works on behalf of the company need hold the qualifications.
default&#xa0;
defaultA more robust mechanism fo
defaultr
default protection is the demand for minimum levels of competence in the form of a robust qualification along with individual registration with the 
defaultCP
defaultS providers for 
defaultalldefault operatives similar to that adopted by the gas industry would improve safety and quality of do
defaultmestic installations.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have been great strides to improve electrical competencies in the sector over the period that Part P has been in force with the 
defaultE
defaultlectrotechnical 
defaultA
defaultssessment 
defaultS
defaultcheme (EAS) and
default the requirements of the M
defaultT
defaultC document published on the D
defaultCLG website, 
default(
defaultin particular Appendix 4 of the MTC
default)
default which has been developed and strengthened over the last few years.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to 
defaultensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations;

defaultThe Part P 
defaultcompetent persons 
defaultscheme requires that
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe an
defaultnual 
defaultassessment of contractors is designed to ensure standar
defaultds are maintained and also helps build relationships between the contractors and CPS provider.  However, there is a case for risk based assessments to be considered.  That is where a contractor has demonstrated that they work to the standards expected cons
defaultistently and no issues have been identified during their annual assessments, the frequency of the assessments could be reduced.  Thus reducing the assessment burden for organisations operating in sectors with numerous annual assessment requirements.

defaultcarried out by ELECSA and the NICEIC (the CPS provider of our organisation) 
defaultare conducted by assessors who are 
defaultknowledgeable and highly competent.  This builds the confidence of the contractor in the CPS provider and should provide custome
defaultrs with assurances that the assessment process is robust.

defaultthe adequacy of the review of electrical works carried out by Competent Persons;
defaultThe 
defaultcurrent 
defaultannual assessment of contractors is 
defaultin line with similar competence schemes and electrical safety schemes
default in other parts of the UK.  E.g. Scotland 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, 
defaultas previously stated contractors such as ourselves would welcome a regime of assessments that are 
defaultbased 
defaulton risk and past performance under the assessment regimes.
default  
defaultThus reducing the assessment burden for 
defaultorganisations operating in sectors with numerous annual assessment requirements.

defaultthe effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work; and
default&#xa0;
defaultCompetiti
defaulton is healthy in any sector.  It provides a mechanism for self regulation and keeps operational costs down.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere have always been a number of CPS providers that any contractor could choose from.  The development of the two electrical contractor registers 
defaultshould in effect provide the same competition.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt should be noted that 
defaultthe Electrical Safety Register recently launched by the ESC &amp; ECA, for the contractors, consumers, clients and specifier
default’
defaults
default has provided a valuable platform for anyone requiring a competent installer to utilise
default,
default safe in the knowledge that the organisations registered with those bodies 
defaultare
default competent and offer the safe guards the schemes provide.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that 
defaultthe initial publ
defaulticity to the general public was poor with 
defaultmost householders unaware of the schemes
default.  The two registration schemes need to work together closely to avoid the 
defaultdilut
defaultion of
default the safety messages and
default potentially confus
defaultion to
default the public.

defaultthe
default adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes.
defaultWe have 
defaultlittle
default visibility of any supervision of the 
defaultCPS
default providers via the DCLG.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are aware that each scheme operator now has to be UKAS accredited.  Our understanding of UKAS and their as
defaultsessment processes provides assurance that this requirement ensures consistency and robust support processes to be in place by the CPS providers.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis further enhances the case for scheme providers like the Certsure Ltd. (NICEIC and ECA/ ELECSA) who have a
defaultchieved UKAS approval for their schemes.
