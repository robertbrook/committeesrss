[normal] 
[normal](an overview of different polls and analyses on the public’s attitude towards climate change and the environment)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent years?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There’s no question that, when asked to choose which issue is most important, more people now say “the economy” and fewer say “environmental issues” than before the financial crisis. At its January 2007 peak, 19 per cent of the population rated the environment as the most important issue facing the country. In the face of the economic downturn, this has slid to below four per cent.
[normal] However the true story of this decline is more complex, as our report 
[normal]What people re
[normal]a
[normal]lly think about the environment: an analysis of public opinion 
[normal]has argued.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the dramatic nature of the economic crisis, the direct effects felt by many, and the sustained media focus, it is hardly surprising that, when asked to choose one issue, people choose this. But, as Paul Flattery, managing partner at trend analysts Trajectory has said, “this doesn’t mean that people don’t care” about the environment and climate change. In fact, in 2010, 71 per cent of people were still very concerned or fairly concerned about climate change, and two thirds believe that it poses risks to people in Britain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And the number of people who think climate change is a ‘very serious’ problem has begun to rise again from 43 per cent in 2010 to 49 per cent in 2011. When asked about the greatest problems facing the world (rather than just Britain) people in the UK are more concerned about climate change than the economy. Forty four per cent of respondents to a 2011 Eurobarometer survey said that climate change was the single biggest problem facing the world, while 39 per cent said the economic situation. This represents a shift from 2008 (when 57 per cent said climate change and 24 per cent the economy), but shows that UK citizens still view climate change as the greater global priority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Pa
[normal]rt of, not against, the economy
[normal]However, framing the question in terms of absolutes and asking people to choose which single issue matters most will always provide overly simplistic answers. Asking people to rate the importance of the economy vs environment is likely to underplay the seriousness of environmental challenges. In reality, they are indivisible, as a successful economy is fundamentally dependent on a healthy environment for raw materials, resources such as water, and a stable climate
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In terms of UK policy decisions, abstract concern about climate change is not as relevant as people’s feelings about solutions. When it comes to green behaviours, we can see that interest and action is growing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The number of people in the UK claiming to take energy efficiency measures has steadily increased in recent years, from 41 per cent in 2004 to 61 per cent
[normal] in 2009.
[normal] DECC figures show that the number of homes with loft insulation thicker than 125mm increased from 9.5 million in April 2007 to 13.4 million in July 2011, largely due to DIY and professional installations in existing homes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After a nationwide series of deliberative forums about micro-renewables and energy efficiency in 2009, Ipsos MORI concluded that “Householders are excited by the new technologies, considering them technologies of the future and, in general terms, a ‘no brainer’”.
[normal] 
[normal]There is also enthusiasm for a shift in the way we pay for energy, with 61 per cent of UK respondents to a 2011 Eurobarometer survey a
[normal]greeing with the statement that 
[normal]“taxation should be based more on the way we use energy.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recycling has become normal practice in the last decade thanks to a mixture of better infrastructure and education (driven by the landfill tax and EU directives). Forty per cent of household was
[normal]te in England is now recycled.
[normal] In 2004, 45 per cent of English householders classed themselves as “committed recyclers”; by 2011 this had risen to 70 per cent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Not just a luxury
[normal]It would be wrong to assume that it is just the middle classes who care about sustainability and are taking these green actions. In fact, in an Asda survey, their customers on the lowest incomes, from socio-economic categories D and E, were the most likely of all groups to say they ‘care very much indeed’ about being green.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Many sustainable behaviours have become normal even in households that are struggling financially. The Asda survey respondents on lower incomes were as likely as the wealthiest groups to say that using less energy and water at home was “normal” or “intelligent”, with
[normal] 67 per cent holding this view. 
[normal]Lower income customers were also as likely as their wealthier counterparts to say that it is “intelligent” to drive a greener car and avoid flying on holiday (20 per cent and ten per cent respectively).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This interest in sustainable living from people who are less well-off clearly derives, to some extent, from an interest in saving money. Many behaviours that have a lower impact on the planet also make less of a dent in people’s finances. As the Asda report says “Austerity Britain hasn’t pushed green issues off the agenda, instead it’s made saving energy and cutting waste…the new normal.” But this is not the only motivation. Wanting to ‘do the right thing’ is the main reason that Asda customers gave for buying green products, across all income brackets. On average 79 per cent said this was their primary motivation. And this feel good factor is most powerful for lower income households (83 per cent). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Interest in green living also extends to the half of the population who belong to socio-economic categories C1 (lower end white collar workers) and C2 (skilled manual workers). They are only marginally less interested in sustainable living than their poorer and wealthier counterparts. This is important politically as, according to The Economist, this “misinterpreted middle” is crucial to deciding elections
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Opinion polls and surveys also show that people are largely willing for, and actually expect, government and businesses to take a bigger role in moving them towards green living. Specifically, they expect government to set out a vision of a sustainable future that their policies will help to build, and to help citizens to play their part by making greener choices easier. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, it is not clear that government policies are responding to these messages. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our report 
[normal]From hot air to hap
[normal]p
[normal]y endings 
[normal]identified the most effective ways for politicians to communicate the possibilities of a low carbon society.
[normal] These were
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This means going beyond the words of scientific advisers and looking into how to portray their messages in a way that shows the opportunity, that the public can understand and which they can apply to their own lives.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our work on 
[normal]Green E
[normal]c
[normal]onomy: A UK Success Story
[normal] 
[normal]focused on communicating the economic benefits the UK is currently receiving from its transition to a low carbon society.
[normal] While the costs of transition are often debated in the public eye, and the risks of not adapting are clear, government could do more to champion the advantages of moving to an economy that sees us doing more with less and in which we export more green goods to China, Brazil, India and Germany than we import from them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There have been vast strides in the understanding of behaviour change theory and its application to policy design and delivery over the past few years. The inability to shift behaviour through information alone is now well understood. As a result, broad brush environmental campaigns, unsupported by enabling policy, are a thing of the past. Instead, government has focused on developing a range of consumer facing policies that will support householders in reducing their energy use. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]They include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These schemes provide people with valuable practical support. But they are missing a vital ingredient, as their communication has not been properly thought through. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All of these schemes encourage changes in behaviour, or to the home’s fabric or source of energy, with the objectives of reducing carbon emissions, tackling fuel poverty and improving energy security. The rate of uptake needed to meet government targets is highly ambitious. It requires one home a minute to upgrade its energy efficiency between now and 2050, just under two homes an hour to install renewable heat between now and 2020 and ten homes a minute to have smart meters installed between 2014 and 2019. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Achieving this will depend on the public actively engaging with the schemes and taking actions, which include spending their own money. A range of approaches and interventions will be needed to drive uptake and to secure sustained changes in people’s behaviour around energy. These include fiscal and regulatory levers and incentives. But policies will fail if the public does not respond to them in sufficient numbers. Effective communication is therefore central to ensuring success. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are behavioural barriers to uptake and the track record of demand for energy efficiency measures is low, even when they are being heavily subsidised or given away. So, the availability of new schemes will not automatically re
[normal]sult in high levels of uptake. 
[normal]Co-ordinated communications are needed that are visible, consistent, provide context, are trusted and help to change social norms
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our report 
[normal]Neither sermons nor silence: the case for 
[normal]n
[normal]ational communication on energy use,
[normal] argues that only national level communications can achieve this and that current government plans for multiple and dispersed communications will not be effective.
[normal] It draws on the learning from national campaigns in the UK and abroad.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Why national communications are necessary
[normal]The need for national communications is further evident when assumptions about trust and building consumer acceptance are interrogated in more depth. Energy suppliers will be leading
[normal] 
[normal]the smart meter roll-out and many of them will be Green Deal providers as well. Yet only 16 per cent of people trust energy companies to deliver messages on energy efficiency. Consumer Focus has also found a “lack of trust and a widespread negativity” amongst consumers towards energy companies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government research into consumer views on the Green Deal noted that “in order for the Green Deal to enjoy widespread acceptance it was felt that endorsement by a trusted source was needed.” Participants in the research had made an “automatic assumption” that the government would p
[normal]lay this visible, trusted role.
[normal] Green Alliance research on the Green Deal reinforces this, with local authorities and civil society organisations saying they would be hesitant to align themselves with a private initiative and to be seen to be endorsing a particular brand or product rather than an overall scheme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]From a purely practical point of view, it is unrealistic to assume that community organisations, or even bigger charities, will be able to work simultaneously with a range of providers. The digital switchover campaign, for example, worked closely and intensely with a range of organisations over defined periods of time, and all of our featured case study campaigns were better able to engage trusted partners by virtue of having a single point of contact.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Green Deal
[normal]Our look at the Green Deal ahead of its launch
[normal] (
[normal]Getting a
[normal] 
[normal]good deal from the Green Deal)
[normal] 
[normal]involved working with three MPs in their constituencies on likely barriers to the Green Deal’s deployment that could be easily rectified.
[normal] Local people’s issues had less to do with their understanding of climate science and more to seeing how the broader benefits of energy efficiency could appeal to them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The f
[normal]ive
[normal] main ways of ensuring success were 
[normal]identified as
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our report concluded that the Green Deal certainly has great potential to reduce the amount of energy we use in our homes and businesses, but our workshop participants were not convinced that it could be the whole solution to reducing energy use and creating warmer homes in their areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For local groups and businesses to support the proposals they needed to see a tangible local benefit, feel supported in their engagement, and know that the delivery of the scheme is fair and will help all sectors of society. They also needed to see that their action is part of a broader programme and receive clear support from central government through incentives and messaging.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our report, 
[normal]Bringing 
[normal]i
[normal]t Home,
[normal] 
[normal]looked at how government policies on energy, water and waste were acted upon in the home.
[normal] Through case studies and consumer analysis 
[normal]in
[normal] real homes, it examined
[normal] whether
[normal] householders’ behaviour
[normal]s
[normal] are changing
[normal], and what could make them better. 
[normal]Amongst our households it 
[normal]was
[normal] clear that some green behaviours are much more common than others. Recycling 
[normal]wa
[normal]s the greatest success story, although there is still a way to go on reducing or separating out food waste. There 
[normal]wa
[normal]s a broad awareness of the need to save energy, even if there is less actual action. But the householders had almost no knowledge of the need to save water and were confused about how this could be done. On a national level, we found that more effort is needed on every front to help householders play their part in the transition to a low carbon, resource efficient society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The report concluded with three principles for greener living:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Set out the vision [bold]For a change strategy to succeed, the target audience needs to believe in it and understand how they fit into the plan. The perceived benefits of action to protect and improve the environment are not always evident at an individual or local level. The onus is on government to provide a clear vision and bold leadership. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A lesson from the behavioural sciences is that people will take action if they see others also doing so and feel a sense of fairness. Policy will be most effective if people believe that national government has a credible vision and a plan to support their own efforts. They also need to see the government putting in corresponding effort, and receive benefits from doing the ‘right’ thing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Transform the ‘choice architecture’ [bold]The magnitude of the environmental challenge and, specifically, the imperative to tackle climate change within a relatively short timescale, requires a step change in how we manage resources in our homes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The structures within which we operate need to change to ensure this can be achieved. Otherwise incremental improvements in the environmental performance of products and services, and efforts to nudge us in the right direction, will be drowned out by increasing consumption. Systemic problems need a systemic approach, rethinking the markets within which people are making their choices about their use of energy, waste and water, and
[normal] 
[normal]the products and services available to them. These changes will not come about without clear leadership from government.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The effectiveness of recycling policy has demonstrated the importance of structural change. Changing the structure within which businesses and local authorities operated through the landfill tax and tough targets has resulted in the uptake of recycling across the country, amongst different sectors of society and values groups. It has led to the introduction of new infrastructure, behaviours and social norms, which have contributed to meeting ambitious targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. Apply behavioural insights for smarter policy [bold]A more sophisticated understanding of how people behave enables the development of more intelligent, more effective policy. Nudge will be helpful in encouraging pro-environment
[normal]al
[normal] action but it will be insufficient on its own. Without a reappraisal of existing approaches and the application of behavioural insights to a broad set of policies, government will not be able to reach its stated ambitions within the necessary timescale.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Policies aimed at driving greener living should be re-examined through the lens of behavioural science. The aim of such policy measures should be to use the best of the evidence base to encourage desirable behaviours and to discourage undesirable ones. While the nudge approach has something to offer this process, it cannot replace policy which helps to create new choices or makes damaging behaviour difficult or impossible to pursue. Successful initiatives are likely to need all the policy tools available; a mix of well-designed information, incentives, regulation, services and nudges to encourage the desired actions and outcomes.
