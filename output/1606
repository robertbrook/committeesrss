[normal]This paper focuses solely on domestic heating.  
[normal]It 
[normal]shows
[normal] that in order to meet the obligations of the Climate Change Act, and also the policy objectives for aviation by 2050, the UK’s domestic heating has to be completely decarbonised.  This can either be done by electricity, or perhaps using new technologies to synthesise methane
[normal] or hydrogen
[normal] using spare summer electricity.
[normal]  No other renewable resources, such as biomass or biogas, can make other than marginal contributions.
[normal]The fundamental problems are twofold – generating the required energy, and meeting the peak power demands.  
[normal]The solutions dwarf
[normal] the challenge of decarbonising the existing electricity grid.  
[normal]Both of these problems are essentially intractable with current technology
[normal].
[normal]The problems can be alleviated by the extensive, and expensive, use of insulation and heat pumps – no other current technology will make other than a very marginal contribution.  However even the most optimistic assessment of the potential savings leaves a new carbon free power requirement that is greater than the entire current generating capacity of the UK.  European connection is unlikely to help.
[normal]There are ways to approach the solution, but they involve intense, well funded, research programs that consider the entire energy system as a whole unit – from power source to house
[normal] thermostat
[normal].  The market alone cannot deliver the degree of 
[normal]cohenernce
[normal] needed – it will require substantial Government involvement and support.
[normal]There are also policy measures which could be implemented quickly and cheaply that would be more effective than the existing RHI and Green Deal in the domestic sector, and would help accelerate substantially the decarbonisation of heat.

[normal] UK GHG emissions in 1990 were about 766 million tonnes CO
[normal]2
[normal](e).  The UK population in 2050 is expected to be 78 million.  1.8 tonnes per person reflects a national emission limit of 140 million tonnes CO
[normal]2
[normal](e), or 18% of 1990 emissions.

[normal] emissions from aviation to the accounts increases the baseline GHG emissions in 1990 by 37.5Mt, and also increases the allowance in 2050 - 
[normal]by 2
[normal]0% of 37.5 or 7.5 Mt
[normal] a year.
[normal]  However because these 37.5 Mt of emissions will continue through 2050, the emissions from sectors other than aviation must be reduced by an extra 30 Mt (37.5-7.5).

[normal] Cavity wall insulation is ignored in this assessment as it makes savings that are insufficient to achieve anything close to the requirements – all houses will have to have additional insulation.
