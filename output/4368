defaultWritten evidence from the 
defaultCivil Engineering Contractors Association
default (LTD0008)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Civil Engineering Contractors Association (CECA) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the above named call for evidence. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCECA provides the voice for those companies who create, improve and maintain th
defaulte UK’s vital transport and utility networks. Our membership of more than 300 companies together delivers an estimated 70-80 per cent of all infrastructure construction work carried out nationwide. Our industry supports the employment of around 200,000 peop
defaultle with annual activity worth up to £25 billion.
default&#xa0;
defaultCECA cautiously welcomes the introduction of local decision making on transport expenditure. While there is a long way to go before the success of the policy can be measured, it is clear that greater integr
defaultation between bodies operating at local and regional level is required
default to enable effective delivery
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultCECA is concerned that there is a lack of clarity as to how the funding will be allocated and how local bodies are expected to work together to deliver 
defaultmajor transport projects. We call on Government to work with all 
defaultbodies 
defaultinvolved in 
defaultthe 
defaultfuture delivery of 
defaultlocal transport 
defaultprojects to address this to ensure that any proposed developments are not burdened from the start by confusion.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn our response, we 
defaulthave focused on the areas in which we believe we can add the most value. We trust that you find our comments helpful and that they will be taken into consideration.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultRationaledefault&#xa0;
defaultThe 2010 Coalition Agreement clearly set out the current Government’s localist intentions and the Localism Act devolved decision making powers from central government to individuals, communities and councils.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2010 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) w
defaultere announced taking over the role of Regional Development Agencies in terms of promoting local economic growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultCECA believes that good transport is key to local economic growth and acknowledge
defaults
default 
defaultt
defaulthe view that only local 
defaultbodies
default 
defaultcan identify transport need
defaults 
defaultin their area 
defaultand deliver 
defaultappropriate 
defaultsolutions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOver the past few years 
defaultresponsibility
default for funding and decision making for 
defaultlocal major transport schemes 
defaultand the regional rail network 
defaulthave been devolved. T
defaultransport has 
defaultplayed a key role in the City Deal
defaults and funding for transport majors is being devolved 
defaultto Local Transport Bodies
default via 
defaultLEPs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultAdvantages and disadvantagesdefault&#xa0;
defaultCECA believes that the introduction of Local Transport Bodies 
default(LTBs) 
defaultcould play a key role in improving 
defaultdecision-making on local 
defaulttransport expenditure
default. LTBs remove 
defaultthe need for a centralised bidding process and monetary
default bidding thresholds and ensure
default 
defaultdecisions are made locally
default rather than introducing centralised 
defaultand one-sized fits all 
defaultsolutions
default from Westminster
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, CECA remains concerned that the proposals to devol
defaultve funding for transport to 
defaultlocal bodies
default 
defaultmay lead to a lack of strategic decision-making in local communities. CECA supports the proposal for local communities to be able to make decisions in relat
defaultion to their 
defaultarea. However we remain concerned about a potential lack of collaborative working between LEPs
default and other local bodies
default to deliver significant projects across their geographical boundaries.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAre there better models?default&#xa0;
defaultGiven that 
defaultLTBs are not yet
default in full operation
default, it is hard to tell whether 
defaultthey will be effective solutions
default. However, CECA notes that there 
defaultare already some 
defaultexamples of how local decision making on transport expenditure is proving to be a success. 
default&#xa0;
defaultLondon transport is perhaps the best example of effective local decision making. In London all transport 
defaultpolicy and funding 
defaultis decided by the Mayor’s Office and put into place by Transport for London (TfL). Transport policies developed by TfL have improved
default services, reduced journey times and reduced congestion within Greater London. 
defaultHowever, it is important to note that London is the only city in the UK to have developed such an integrated, locally focused and locally delivered transport system. 
default&#xa0;
defaultDesk based research has suggested that the model adopted in Barcelona is a good 
defaultinternational 
defaultexample of organisation and innovation. In this case governance takes the form of a joint management board and joint executive committee with equal membership bet
defaultween the Catalonian Government and local authorities. Notably the Barcelona model is funded by the state government, the Catalonian government and by local authorities. As a result of collaborative working, Barcelona has gained a reputation for transport i
defaultnnovatio
defaultn. Furthermore, there have been i
defaultmprovements in customer satisfaction and passenger growth.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultCECA believes that while the bodies referenced above will have excellent knowledge of their individual organisation
defaultal challenges, they may need assistance in working together effectively 
defaultas a
default delivery body. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe believe that local bodies are best placed to decide what the transport priorities are in their area, although they should be supported in their decision-making
default process through the availability of 
defaultrobust
default evaluation models 
defaultthat have been developed by the Department of Transport. This will build confidence that 
defaultany decisions taken are evidence-based rather than politically motiovated. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen it comes to the delivery of schemes 
defaultmany local authorities 
defaultface limitations on the resources available to them, with limited experience of the challeneges associated with the delivery of occasional lar
defaultg
defaulte projects
default, CECA proposes the creation of a trans
defaultport ‘Flying Squad’ to assist local bodies 
defaultin
default the development of
default such
default major infrastructure projects. Such a group could include, for example, representatives from industry and central Government working in partnership with local bodies to ensure that the m
defaultost effective and beneficial projects are developed. The flying squad could also provide expertise on procurement practice to minimise cost and delay.
default&#xa0;
defaultAn example of collaborative working can also be found in the Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots p
defaultrogramme.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBox 1: Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programmedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Local Infrastructure Demonstrators Pilots programme is a private-led partnership (comprising CECA, the Royal Town Planning Institute, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
default and local project co-ordinators). The partnership aims to progress stalled local infrastructure projects with potential to release economic growth by resolving barriers to progress.
default&#xa0;
defaultMultidisciplinary teams of experts (working on a pro-bono basis) nominat
defaulted by the partnership have been invited by local authorities to assist a small number of local projects in the first wave.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe partnership approach involves face-to-face interaction with local partners to uncover and understand barriers to progress. 
defaultTypical barriers include local co-ordination and capacity issues as much as, or rather than, access to finance.

default&#xa0;
defaultCECA’s primary concern with regard to the devolution of transport decision-making to local bodies relates to how such organisations deal with opportunities to invest in infrastructure where doing so crossed boundaries. 
defaultEffective long-term planning with cro
defaultss-authority support and cooperation is essential to delivering projects to time and to budget. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA case in point can be seen in the Atlantic Gateway redevelopment in North West England which highlights the need for greater integration at local and regiona
defaultl level. The redevelopment project crosses three LEP areas and over a dozen local authorities. A small steering group has been established, but CECA feels that its focus is more on promoting the project rather than programme management, funding, co-ordinat
defaultion, joining up employment and training. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn order to further ensure delivery of cross-boundary projects, CECA calls on Government to intervene when it becomes apparent that local bodies are not working together effectively. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe effectiveness of collaborative working varies across the UK. To ensure that these variations do not continue after 2015, CECA calls on Government to ensure th
defaultat LEPs in partnership with local bodies give and demonstrate real consideration as to what will be best for their local community. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is essential that the right evidence based approach is adopte
defaultd for all
default local decision making. Transport solutions must 
defaultcome from solid, independent, research rather than tailoring evidence to
default develop a project
default. In this regard, CECA recommends that local communities continue to work closely with the Department for Transport 
default(DfT) 
defaultto develop an approved evidence collection a
defaultnd transport solution model. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCECA would not wish to see a scenario where local bodies attempt to ensure that every areas gets its “share” of funding if this stands in the way of delivering the most economical and socially beneficial projects. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe way that Government funds major local transport projects will radically change from 2015 when major transport scheme 
defaultfunding is devolved to LEPs as part of the Single Local Growth Fund.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe funding, taken from existing Whitehall funds will enable LEPs to bid for funding from a “single pot”. CECA believes that the funding, if used effectively, has the potential to rebala
defaultnce the economy through the development of ambitious local transport schemes and 
defaultwill enable LEPs and Local Transport Bodies to show what real added value they can bring. CECA anticipates that if the devolution of funding is successful, more will follow fo
defaultr further projects. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, we remain concerned that money allocated through the Growth 
defaultFund for transport projects could be diverted to other, non-transport projects. C
defaultECA 
defaultsuggests that once
default funding is
default allocated to a particular project, 
defaultit 
defaultremains ring
default-fenced specifically for that project. 
defaultWe hope that clear guidance will be provided to those in receipt of Growth Deal funding. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe provision of major project funding devolution and the Single Local Growth fund opens up the potential of improved visibility of future investment. 
default&#xa0;
defaultClear pipeline visibility is essential to ensure that cross boundary transport schemes are delivered ef
defaultfectively. Significant benefits and efficiencies will arise where greater forward visibility is available to the supply chain in terms of future investment. The key benefits associated with pipeline visibility are listed below, but CECA remains concerned t
defaulthat there is no pipeline visibility for local transport after 2015. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFor these reasons we believe that a condition should be placed on those receiving Single Local Growth Fund  that they publish and maintain 
defaulta forward pipeline of the infrastructure investments that they anticipate supporting. In doing so they will ensure the best possible response from industry, securing efficient delivery and local job creation.
