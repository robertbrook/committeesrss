"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nEnvironment Agency is the principal environmental regulator in England. As part\n of our role we consider the impacts\n of climate risks in our work including\n manage \nflood risk and coastal erosion management, \nsafeguard\ning\n water resources and protect\ning\n the water and wetland environment. \nWe have a new role to provide advice and support t\no help businesses, public sector and other organisations adapt to a changing climate (this is known as the Climate Ready Support Service). The role is for England but the products generated are available across the UK.\nWe also\n administrate\n \nthe economic in\nc\nentive schemes such as the EU Emissions Trading System, the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and Climate Change Agreements. We do not have any direct influence over the remaining emissions from homes and surface transport such as cars and trains.\nOur engagemen\nt is generally with and through partners and trusted inter\nmediaries. We work \nclosely with Government bodies such as Natural England, Public Health England and the Met Office, through trade and professional bodies, and with local authorities and local resil\nience fora. \nA\nudience \nneeds vary considerably and we\n adjust our messages\n accordingly\n. Messages that focus on climate impacts such as flooding \nare better understood \nthan those concerned with climate science.  We have found that using more active language, \nsuch as ‘adapting to a changing climate’ and being ‘Climate Ready’ helps audiences to move on from the idea of climate change being remote and something they need to believe in, to needing to take action now.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Our Climate Ready Support Service\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur Climate Ready Support Service provides\n online advice, a help desk and \ntailored support to help organisati\nons adapt to \nextremes of weather and \nthe changing climate. We operate the service for England only, but our tools and resources are available online for use across the UK.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe service focuses on priority risks and sectors in the National Adaptation Programme, published by government in July 2013. It is therefore aimed at organisations rather than the general public. The priority sectors for the service are: local government,\n the built environment, the natural environment, infrastructure, health and wellbeing, agriculture and forestry, business and services. \n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe service aims to build climate resilience in these sectors and organisations. We are clear that that the purpose of our advice is \nto help organisations\n understand how a changing climate affects their interest\ns and how they can take actions to avoid and \nreduce the consequences.\n   \n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur advice is delivered with and through other government delivery bodies, service providers and sector representatives. We use existing communication channels and networks where possible to ensure that customers can readily fin\nd advice from trusted and familiar sources in a language that they understand.  Our approach is to build capacity in those other organisations rather than to create a dependency on the services of the Environment Agency.  Our advice is tailored to customer\n needs to help them take appropriate action. For the majority of \norganisations\n, this means thinking first and foremost about their organisation rather than climate science.\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe provide access on behalf of Defra to the UK Climate Projections, which provide t\nhe latest information on how the UK climate may change. We \nalso work with researchers and R\nesearch Councils through the ‘Living With Environmental \nChange’\n (\nLWEC)\n programme to summarise \nevidence on future climate impacts. \nLWEC\n is producing a series of repor\nts that summarise impacts for policy makers and businesses. These are designed to be accessible to lay audiences, though are not specifically aimed at the general public.\n&#xa0;\nInteractions with Local Government\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe work closely wit\nh local government through \nour\n Climate Ready Support Service and \nour \nwider roles. We have supported the Local Government Association’s ‘Climate Local’ initiative with staff secondments. The initiative supports councils’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to improve their resilience\n to future climate through sharing information and developing action plans. Seventy-three councils have joined the initiative to date.\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe provide adaptation training to councils, including a learning aid for councillors on the roles, opportunities and driv\ners for council led action\n on climate change. We will\n run training events in the autumn/winter \n2013/14 \nfor local authorities to promote available information and resources.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe support the Local Adaptation Advisory Panel, which brings together local authori\nties, government departments and delivery bodies to understand what support councils need to adapt to future climate. This is a key mechanism for local government to feedback to central government on adaptation legislation, policy and delivery programmes. \n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are helping to develop practical tools to promote local adaptation. This includes working with Climate UK to make Kent County Council’s ‘Severe Weather Impacts Monitoring System’ available to all local authorities, helping them to record the impacts of\n severe weather on their services and aid future service planning.\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also provide\n support to councils and their partnerships through our local advisory and statutory planning role. This includes Local Nature Partnerships and Local Enterprise Partnerships,\n who we work with on major developments and support in producing European Structural and Investment Fund Strategies.\n&#xa0;\nWorking through Climate Change Partnerships\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal delivery of our Climate Ready Support Service is provided by working in partnership with a network of Climate Change Partnerships, through their Climate UK umbrella organisation. The Partnerships work through stakeholder networks to share learning an\nd build local climate resilience in businesses, local government, and communities. They have close relationships with business organisations such as Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, as well as with utilities, banks, insurers, lo\ncal authorities, community engagement groups, tourism bodies, universities, and industry associations. \n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Partnerships promote and support practical adaptation action. Recent examples include: \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking with local communities to map vulnerable and resilie\nnt road networks.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProviding county councils and their local partners with an online system for logging the costs (in money and reputation) of extreme weather on an ongoing basis.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloping an accredited qualification in Business Resilience, and testing it\n with 150 small businesses.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRunning business resilience training days, including a Business Resilience Health Check, for businesses regulated by the Environment Agency.\n&#xa0;\nWorking with other government bodies\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have worked closely with lead government departments to develop the aims of the Climate Ready programme, particularly the Departments of Health; Business Innovation and Skills; Communities and Local Government; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and t\nhe Cabinet Office. \n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn delivering the programme we work closely with other agencies and delivery bodies, especially the Met Office, Natural England and the Forestry Commission. Examples of working with other Government bodies include:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEstablishing a delive\nry group f\nor \nhealth sector resilience with \nthe \nNHS Sustainable Development Unit, Public Health England and \nthe \nDepartment of Health, which is supporting Health and Wellbeing Boards to develop local climate risk assessment and action plans.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorking with the\n National Flood Forum and Cabinet Office to develop local resilience case studies. These document the actions of four community groups to help increase their resilience ag\nainst flooding and other weather\n events. The group in Calderdale use social media and\n web content to engage the local community and increase resilience during extreme events. \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRunning workshops for local transport authorities, such as local authority highways teams and ambulance services, to understand and manage risks to their services fr\nom extreme weather.\n&#xa0;\nCommunication through our wider flood and coastal management role\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe work with our partners to help the public and communities understand their risk of flooding, which can involve consideration of climate change when thinking over the \nlong term.\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe aim to raise their awareness of flood risk and encourage people to take action to protect themselves and their property so they are better prepared for flooding. This may include them checking their flood risk on our flood map, signing up to \nour free warning service - Floodline Warnings Direct - or preparing a personal flood plan. We also look to improve flood response at a community level by holding community meetings and workshops, promoting community led flood action groups, and working wit\nh communities to establish community flood plans.\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe issue flood warnings to the public, businesses and the emergency services to help them prepare and respond to floods. In March 2013, 62% of properties in the highest flood risk areas received our direct \nflood warnings, up from 60% at the end of 2011/12. Research carried out in 2013 found that our communications are effective in helping people to understand that preparing for flooding is worthwhile. Almost nine out of ten customers who are signed up to our\n free flood warning service and who had previously received a flood warning said that flood warnings are easy to understand, two-thirds agreed that flood warnings are accurate and half take action when a flood warning is issued.\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom October to November 20\n12 we ran a flood action campaign which aimed to change behaviours and encourage people to accept risk and take action\n:\n \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur website had 650,000 unique users during the campaign – a 150% increase compared to the same period in 2011/12.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver 4,000 people si\ngned up for flood warnings as a result of the campaign\n.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlmost 2,000 people downloaded flood plans in direct response to the campaign adverts.\n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClimate change projections indicate rising sea levels and increasingly severe and frequent rainstorms, resulting in a greater risk of flooding.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCoastal Communities 2150 \n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Coastal Communities 2150 project helps \ncommunities to \ndevelop visions for \nmanaging their long term risks from coastal\n and climate change to\n 2150 and beyond. The project is a partnership between the Environment Agency, Kent and Hampshire County Councils and partners in Belgium and Holland. It is funded by the European INTERREG bo\ndy.\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Environment Agency is working in Newhaven, Seaford and Lewes in East Sussex, and has developed successful local engagement groups that are supported by town and parish councils. Kent County Council is working in Margate, the Isle Sheppey and the Ro\nmney Marshes. Hampshire County Council is engaging at 6 sites around the Solent.  \n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic interest has been higher than expected and is driven by the desire to shape long term community plans. The UK partners have found it easier to form local public engag\nement groups than the Dutch or Belgians, who have encountered a public attitude that ‘the government have always dealt with this - so why should I get involved?’\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent extreme weather events such as the droughts and floods in 2012 and Hurricane Sandy in N\new York seem to have contributed to general public acceptance that weather events have become more extreme and communities should prepare for more to come.\n \nThe 150 year time frame has not been a problem for the public or businesses, who seem generally conc\nerned with leaving a sustainable legacy for future generations.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe a\nudiences are\n usually \ninterested in clim\nate change only to the extent that it affects their interests. They find it easier and more worthwhile to engage when risks are\n framed in familiar terms. We find it is\n more producti\nve to focus on relevant impacts such as flooding and drought.\n \n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe find it h\nelpful to take a people-first or organisation-first perspective\n.\n \n \nThis involves thinking about how they are affected by current weather, and then how such vulnerabilities could increase in the future. This allows them to consider their adaptation needs wit\nhout having to engage with complex science\n.\n \n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore expert audiences such as utilities are comfortable talking about climate change and appreciate to the need to adapt. However, they \nare \nalso primarily interested in the impacts of climate change rather than \nthe climate itself. \n \nA lack of relevant information is often cited as a barrier to action, with organisations finding it difficult to translate climate projections into the more relevant impact assessments that they need to inform adaptation decisions. \n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n have undertaken market surveys to understand how potential customers for our Climate Ready Support Service\n,\n \nincluding\n \norganisations in the\n, business, local government, infrastructure, built environment, health, natural environ\nment, agriculture and \nforestry sectors,\n \nengage with climate adaptation, and what language resonates with them. In summary, this shows that:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOrganisations are more familiar with climate cha\nnge mitigation than adaptation \nand are more likely to be acting to mitigate climate change\n.  The reasons for this include: greater understanding of how to act; actions are associated with cost savings; they can apply tangible, measurable, specific targets; and existing regulation.  By contrast adaptation tends to have a lower profile and is ass\nociated with more barriers to action.  \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen thinking specifically about environmental risks there is relatively high awareness of climate change among the target audience and organisations perceive it to be the top environmental risk (as important as envi\nronmental regulation/compliance).  Organisations also identify the impacts of climate change as key risks (e.g. flooding, droughts, heat-wave\ns, \nand extreme weather).  29%\n of organisations believe they have already been affected by climate change a great de\nal and a further \n39% \nbelieve that they have been affected a little. The target audience are most likely to think they will be affected by disruptions to staff (63%), \nall\n \nimpact on logistics (60%), and all\n impact on premises or infrastructure (58%).\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe m\naj\nority of organisations have\n a strategic approach \nto \nrisk management as part of their normal business planning, and so can manage climate risks within that process rather than separately.\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOrganisations commonly cite barriers to adaptation that include: miti\ngation taking priority over adaptation; \nshort-term focus is prioritised\n \n(\nadaptation is perceived to be long-term); a lack of understanding of the business case (the financial argument); economic pressures; lack of knowledge, capacity, finances and time; la\nck of confidence in the science and difficulty dealing with probabilities.\n28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt can also be effective to focus on adaptation actions (solutions) rather than climate (uncertain problems). In many cases, no- or low-regret actions can be taken that make sense r\negardless of future climate. For example, businesses can benefit from simple water efficiency measures or registering for our flood warning service irrespective of how the climate changes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
