[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]NAT is the UK's leading charity dedicated to transforming society's response to HIV. We provide fresh thinking, expertise and practical resources. We champion the rights of people living with HIV and campaign for change. &#xa0;NAT welcomes the opportunity to respond to the draft Deregulation Bill and the chance to raise our concerns about the clauses of the bill that might affect people living with HIV. These include clause 2 which affects Employment Tribunal's power to make recommendations and clause 35 which relates to the Government's intention to remove the duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP. We have also commented on clause 58 which gives a new duty for regulators to have regard for promoting economic growth. &#xa0;We believe none of these clauses will achieve the primary purpose of the draft Bill: to reduce the burden of regulation on business, civil society, other organisations (including public sector bodies) and individuals.  Rather, we believe these amendments may be more costly and burdensome in the long term. They will also diminish transparency and reduce the mechanisms in place to hold organisations to account and protect vulnerable groups in society, including people living with HIV. The evidence for this is set out below. &#xa0;

[[[Clause 2- Employment Tribunal's power to make recommendations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]NAT strongly disagrees with the proposals to remove Employment Tribunal's power to make recommendations to an employer in a case where unlawful discrimination occurred. As we stated in our previous consultation on this change to the Equality Act 2010 we believe this power is extremely important to ensure discrimination towards people living with HIV in the workplace does not occur again.  For example, our own experience shows once a case is taken to Tribunal, the employee very rarely wants to return to work for this employer. The Employment Tribunal's power to make an appropriate recommendation when it has made a finding of unlawful discrimination is one crucial mechanism to incentivise employers to change their current practice to ensure HIV discrimination is eradicated. &#xa0;The proposed change is also not evidence-based as there is no research to show this Tribunal power is an unnecessary burden to employers.  We believe the current provision is actually beneficial and cost effective as it avoids future cases being taken to Tribunal. The system is funded by the public and so any steps that can be taken to avoid future cases and improve Tribunal employers employment practice has to be beneficial for all parties involved.&#xa0;Preventing further discrimination cases is not only cost effective but will also benefit disabled people (people living with HIV are considered disabled from the point of diagnosis under the Equality Act 2010) and others who may otherwise face discrimination at work.  Our report ' Working with HIV' showed a fifth of men who had disclosed their HIV positive status at work reported experiencing HIV discrimination in a current or previous job.  An additional 8% were uncertain about whether poor treatment was related to HIV discrimination. People living with HIV who are from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background and/or who are LGBT may also face associated or double discrimination which again could be caused by wider issues at an organisation on which the Tribunal may wish to comment. Removing this power will therefore disproportionately impact on people living with HIV.&#xa0;We recommend that the current powers are retained as they have the potential to save vital resources in the current economic climate, assisting employers totake appropriate steps to avoid future tribunal cases and delivering an overall benefit for the business as a whole.&#xa0;

[[[Clause 35 - Removal of the duty on the senior President of tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Clause 35 relates specifically to the Government's intention to remove the duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to prepare and publish an annual report on the standards of decision making by the DWP.&#xa0;We oppose the change as we believe the annual report on DWP decision-making is an important means to ensure transparency and accountability in the assessment of decision-making in relation to key benefits. One example is the decision-making around Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), including the outcomes of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA).  According to DWP 37% of those who appealed their ESA decision between October 2008 and February 2012

[[[ ]]]were successful. This high rate of success indicates serious issues in the quality of the initial assessment process. In addition, the most recent Senior President annual report shows that the number of appeals under the Social Security and Child Support (SSCS) jurisdiction has risen from 250,000 in 2008/09 to an estimated 515,000 in 2012/13.  This is almost certainly linked to recent changes to benefits assessment processes, including the introduction of ESA and the WCA from 2008, and would only be likely to increase as another new benefit - Personal Independence Payment (PIP) - is rolled out over the next few years.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;A key theme of the first three Independent Reviews of the WCA (chaired by Professor Harrington) was the importance of feedback from first-tier tribunals to the DWP about the decisions they had overturned, and why. While the annual report is not the sole solution to the wider problem of poor initial decision-making (and the Independent Review made a range of specific suggestions to improve feedback mechanisms) it does provide the only statutory mechanism currently in place by which to identify serious and systemic problems with DWP decision-making.&#xa0;In July this year the new benefit Personal Independence Payment (PIP) was introduced to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for new claimants. While it is too early to know how many decisions will be appealed at Tribunal, the removal of the duty would mean a lost opportunity for vital feedback on the quality of early decision making. &#xa0;At a more basic level, it also seems inappropriate to remove this duty at a time when such a large number of DWP decision are being appealed and a high proportion of those appeals are successful. &#xa0;We therefore recommend improving, not weakening feedback mechanisms between First - tier Tribunal Judges and DWP Decision makers through maintaining the duty on the Senior President of Tribunals to report on the standards of decision making by the DWP. We also feel that given the level of Parliamentary interest in DWP decision making the impact of the draft Bill in this area should be brought to the attention of the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill.

[[[Clause 58- new duty for regulators to have regard for promoting economic growth when they reach decisions ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Given that regulators already work within a number of well recognised frameworks - such as the Hampton Principles- it is difficult to understand why the Government needs to impose an additional duty on regulators.  The Government has not provided any evidence or information as to why these frameworks are not working nor why an additional duty for regulators to promote economic growth is needed. We don't believe that having a strong system of regulatory bodies is incompatible with economic growth and that this clause is necessary.&#xa0;We are concerned that the duty to promote economic growth will compromise and confuse the core role of a number of non-economic regulators that deal with equality and human rights.  The Children's Commissioner, the EHRC, Health and Safety Executive, and the Information Commissioner are examples of such regulators. Moreover, the duty may even undermine their role to promote people's rights, such as the right to data protection, enforcement of rights at work and the duties under the Equality Act 2010. It would be wrong to substitute promoting economic growth for the important functions that Parliament has already given these regulators. &#xa0;We recommend that this new duty be removed or qualified to ensure that a regulator’s duty to achieve sustainable economic growth does not interfere with or undermine any existing duty they have to protect and promote equality and human rights.  &#xa0;
