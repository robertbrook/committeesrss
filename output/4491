[normal]Given its focus on partnership-building, knowledge creation and value for money, and taking into account its [bold]potential for fostering UN system-wide coherence in the promotion of disability rights as well as its on-going close collaboration with civil society and organizations of persons with disabilities, the UNPRPD represents a natural partner for UK’s work on d[bold]isability and development.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A number of principles will have to be taken into account in order to fully integrate disability into development[bold] in the context of the post-2015 development agenda[bold]. These include among others: the disability-disaggregation of c[bold]ritical socio-economic data; the application of accessibility standards to the physical environment, transportation, information and communication infrastructure; and the realization of the principle of meaningful involvement of persons with disabilities -[bold] [bold]“Nothing about us without us”.[bold]The United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities[bold]Overview

[normal]Development of the UNPRPD Stra[bold]tegic and Operational Framework. [bold]The UNPRPD Strategic and Oper
[normal]ational Framework, which outlines the UNPRPD overall objectives, strategic priorities and operating modalities was finalized in April 2012 following a broad consultative process that included the organization of a Partners’ Meeting in March 2012, with part
[normal]icipation of all the UNPRPD constituencies.

[normal]Development of the UNPRPD Quality Assurance Framework[bold].[bold] [bold] [bold]A Quality Assurance Framework was developed in December 2012 to clearly identify the quality control mechanisms that would ensure the efficient and effect
[normal]ive implementation of projects as well as the monitoring and evaluation strategies to be adopted in order to maximize the learning potential of the UNPRPD’s work.

[normal]Launch of the first UNPRPD Funding Round. [bold]A call for proposals launched in May 2012 led to 
[normal]the identification of eleven joint UN programmes benefiting a total of 14 countries in multiple areas of CRPD implementation. The projects identified for funding under the first UNPRPD Funding Round were selected from among 35 proposals received from UN Co
[normal]untry Teams across all regions. These UN Country Teams were invited to submit proposals after a call for expressions of interest issued in February 2012, under which more than 60 applications were received.
[normal] The countries and territories that were support u
[normal]nder the first UNPRPD funding round are: Costa Rica, Indonesia, Moldova, Mozambique, Palestine, Pacific Islands (
[normal]Cook Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea
[normal]), South Africa, Togo, Tunisia, Viet Nam and Ukraine.

[normal]In 
[normal]Moldova, [bold]OHCHR, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO are working closely with the National Governmental Body on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to promote the full 
[normal]inclusion in society of persons with intellectual and mental disabilities. As a result of this project, significant advances have been made in establishing justice oversight over previously closed institutions and there is much greater awareness, in Moldov
[normal]an psychiatry, about CRPD provisions. At the same time, policy dialogue has advanced significantly on issues such as legal capacity reform, adult deinstitutionalization and the formal establishment, under the state budget, of an Ombudsperson for Psychiatry
[normal]. Commenting the work of the Pilot Ombudsperson for Psychiatry, currently supported by the project, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Magdalena Sepulveda, stated: “I was favorably impressed with the pilot Ombudsperson for Psychiatr
[normal]y arrangement, as well as with the positive changes and human rights scrutiny provided by the arrangement. I urge the Government to swiftly formalize and fully institutionalize the position of Ombudsperson for Psychiatry.”

[normal]In 
[normal]Costa Rica[bold], ILO and UNDP are collaborating with the Ministry of Labour and social partners to promote the right to work of persons with disabilities. With support from this project, the Costa Rican National Business Association has established a Network of Inclusive
[normal] Enterprises, which can already count on a membership of 37 businesses with a total workforce of more than 15,000 employees across Costa Rica. In collaboration with key public sector institutions and civil society organizations, the members of the Network 
[normal]are working to create job opportunities for persons with disabilities and will take steps to make their business processes more inclusive and accessible.

[normal]In 
[normal]Indonesia[bold], ILO and WHO, together with UNESCO and UNFPA, are implementing a project aimed at stren
[normal]gthening the capacity of the national institutions in charge of coordinating the implementation of the CRPD. This initiative supported nationwide high-level policy dialogues with Mayors and the creation of a Network of Inclusive Cities which will facilitat
[normal]e the exchange of knowledge and resources on the inclusion of persons with disabilities. Memoranda of Understanding have already been signed with the governments of Banda Aceh City and Yogyakarta City and six more will be signed over the next months. A fra
[normal]mework for identifying key criteria in the process of building inclusive cities for persons with disabilities has been drafted with support from the project. The framework has been tested and applied in 4 cities resulting in the drafting of strategic plans
[normal] and budgets addressing social inclusion of people living with disabilities. This work will provide the basis for a yearly appraisal of Indonesia’s cities that is expected to eventually include a disability inclusion award.

[normal]In 
[normal]Togo, [bold]OHCHR, UNICEF and WHO
[normal] have been implementing a joint programme on inclusive education in the Savanes and Kara regions. Under this programme, Braille and sign language manuals were developed and tested together with a training manual on inclusive education endorsed by the Minis
[normal]try of Education in 2012 and used to train a total of 244 teachers and administrators to date. As a result of the support provided by the project, 539 children living with a disability out of the 640 identified in Kara and Savanes took their exams and 388 
[normal]were successful (71 percent).
