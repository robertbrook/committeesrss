"Written evidence from The Society of Homeopaths (LTC 65)1. SummaryThe Society of Homeopaths \n(hereafter ‘the Society’) \nis composed of \napproximately \n1300 practicing homeopaths and represents the majority of \nprofessional \nhomeopaths practicing in th\ne UK\n. \nThere is a \nsignificant trend for homeopaths \nworking privately and in NHS settings \nto see \nmany \npatients suffering from \nlong-term\n conditions\n that \nhave failed to \nrespond to conventional medicine.\n T\nh\nis document will \ntherefore \noutline\n:\nTh\nis\n document will \nalso \nhighlight \nthe \npotential for homeopathy as a medical system\n,\n treatment option \nand philosophy \nto address the following issues of interest to the Health Committee: \n2. The homeopathic approachHomeopaths often see patients \nafter they have received a medical diagnosis from their doctor and many of these patients have \nlong-term\n health\n \nproblems that \nfail to respond to conventional medicine. \nSome individuals seek a homeopath because they are experiencing side effects from conventional drugs and others because conventional tests have failed to find the cause of their problem. \nAs a system of medicine, homeopathy aim\ns to treat patients as whole people\n, rather than \nfocusing on a course of action for each \ndisease diagnosis\n, thus\n offering a different approach\n. A\ns such\n, homeopathic treatment\n can be considered \nas a supportive option \nin almost any \ncondition\n where tissue has not been irrevocably damaged.\n Homeopaths working according to the Society’s code of ethics \nencourage\n their patients \nto keep \ntheir appropriate\n \nmedical practitioners informed when they seek homeopathic treatment and as treatment progresses. When necessary homeopathic and conventional approaches can be used alongside one another to give the most appropriate care\n to each individual patient, thus integrating all medical approaches and adjunctive advice the patient has been given to manage their health.\n3. What is homeopathy?The \nMeSH\n \ndefinition of homeopathy \nis\n:\n“A system of therapeutics founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), based on the Law of Similars where ‘like cures like’. Diseases are treated by highly diluted substances that cause, in healthy persons, symptoms like those to be treated. The dilutions are repeated so many times that there is less than one molecule per dose and it is suggested that benefit is from the energetic life force of the original substance”\n.\nH\nomeop\nathy \ncan therefore be seen as \na \n‘\nholistic\n’\n therapy\n, such that homeopathic care \ntakes into account all aspects of th\ne \npatient as an \nindividual \nassessing \ntheir symptoms\n on \nmental, emotional, physical and general\n levels\n. \nDuring a consultation the professional homeopath\n \nwill focus\n on building up a complete picture of \nan \nindividual’s unique make up considering all aspects of the patient’s health including diet, medical history, \nlife events, \nlifestyle and personality. \nHomeopathic p\nrescription\ns are\n based on the \nprocess of \nmatching this unique collection of symptoms \nas closely as possible \nwith\n those of an appropriate \nhomeopathic medicine (called a ‘\nremedy\n’), rather than automatically prescribing the same medicine for a named \ncondition. This \napproach to understanding patients’ cases \nmakes homeopathy well placed to treat those people with a diversity of complaints \nthat\n would \nconventionally \nbe given a different medication for each condition. For example\n,\n a \nperson\n with asthma\n, allergies and constipation would typically\n require thre\ne different medications, but would \nbe most likely to \nrequire only\n one homeopathic remedy\n that covers the totality of the\nir\n case\n.\n4. Homeopathic philosophyThe \nphilosophy\n \nthat underpins the homeopathic medical system \nconsiders that physical \nill \nhealth \n(in the absence of inherited disorders, accidents or physical trauma) \ncan \nreflec\nt\n unresolved life events\n, leading to \nprolonged underlying \nemotional stress\n. The \nprofessional \nhomeopath \nwill always ask \na\n patient what was \nhappening\n \nin their lives \nwhen the symptoms\n start\ned\n or worsen\ned\n. In this way, homeopathic philosophy places an equal\n \nimportance on \nboth \nemotional \nand physical wellbeing.\n \nFor example\n,\n a patient who developed hypertension following a \nsignificant \ngrief would receive a homeopathic remedy \nthat aimed to support resolution of this grief to \nfirst \nreduce emotional stress, \nthen \nreducing physiological stress and ultimately reducing the hypertension. This would be done alongside conventional medical care and any other adjunctive treatment required, \nensuring\n that each patient is appropriately supported on all fronts. \nPatients’ experience of successful homeopathic treatment is \noften that they\n first feel better \n‘\nin themselves\n’\n and then \nthat \ntheir \nphysical symptoms \nstart to improve\n, or become more manageable\n. \n5. The therapeutic encounterP\natients\n \noften \nfind the experience of telling their \nunique \nstory to \na sympathetic and supportive professional to \nbe therapeutic\n (\nEyles\n et al.\n, 2012)\n. T\nhere is some evidence \nto suggest \nthat this \naspect of the encounter with a professional homeopath \nmay explain homeopath\ny’s therapeutic \neffectiveness (Jacobs\n et al.\n,\n 2005; \nBrien et al.,\n \n2010\n)\n.\n Indeed, t\nhis\n can be considered as \nthe \nmost \nparsimonious explanation \nfor patient responses to homeopathic treatment while\n \nwe lack \na definitive explanation for \nthe \nmechanism of\n \naction of homeopathic remedies\n. However\n, \nthere is also evidence of the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in the absence of the consultation (\nFrei\n et al., 2005\n) \nsuggesting\n that patient benefit cannot simply be reduced to a therapeutic encounter\n.\n6. Why patients choose homeopathy: qualitative evidence from UK studiesA pre-audit study explor\ning the \nmotivation for patients \nto attend\n the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital \nfor homeopathic treatment \nfound that p\natient’s emphasised ‘treating the whole person’ and a ‘desire to look at illness in a more complex way’\n(Thompson et al., 2007\n). Additionally, a\n qualitative study \nof \npatients \nchoosing \ncomplementary therapies for asthma (Shaw et al., 2006) found that it ‘empowered them to take greater personal control over their condition rather than feel dependant on medication’ and ‘enabled exploration of a broader range of possible causes of their asthma than commonly discussed within NHS settings’. \nH\nomeopathy offers an approach to understanding illness that patients with \nlong-term\n conditions appreciate\n and appear to be paying for in the absence of access to NHS provision (Perry, 2013)\n.\n \nA 2013 audit of 100 \nrandomly selected patients at a privately run\n integ\nrated medicine clinic (\nwww.wellforce.co.uk\n) found that \nmany \npatients \nwith\n \nchronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis and multiple sclerosis\n \nwere attending\n:\n pain\n, \nfatigue\n,\n anxiety and depression \nrepresent\ned\n \nthe\nir\n most common \nsymptoms\n. \nA survey \nby \nThomas\n et al.\n (\n200\n3\n) \nalso \nfound that 90% of \ncomplementary and alternative medicine (\nCAM\n)\n provision is purchased privately\n with total expenditure est\nimated at £450 million for\n \n1998\n, \nwith\n 10% of the adult population contact\ning\n a CAM practitioner that year\n. \nIn addition to the \nclear\n \ndemand\n for CAM healthcare in supporting patients with \nlong-term\n conditions\n, a\n study carried out at the University of Sheffield on behalf of the Department of Health explored patient satisfaction with complementary therapies in the NHS and found them to be \n“overwhelmingly positive” \n(Luff \nand\n Thomas\n,\n 2000). \nSpecific aspects valued by patients included the development of a therapeutic relationship with their practitioner\n,\n the caring nature of the practitioner\n,\n being involved in the process of care\n and\n a significant improvement in the quality of their lives. \n7. Where patients access homeopathic treatmentPatients \ncurrently access \nhomeopathic tre\natment from a variety of source\ns\n within the NHS\n including:\n \n&#xa0;\nHowever\n,\n the majority of patients \nin the UK \naccess\n \nhomeopathic treatment\n \nprivately\n.\n Less than 10% of GPs report using homeopathy (Perry et al., 2013)\n and homeopathic prescribing in the NHS appears to have fallen sharply between 2000 and 2010 (\nBeckford, 2011).\n&#xa0;\n8. How patients with chronic conditions fare using homeopathy. An observational study at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital monitored treatment \nof &gt;\n6500 patients with \nchronic disease during a 6 year period\n (Spence at al., 2005)\n. \nThe aims of \nhomeopathic \ntreatment were to enhance general health and well-being, to improve symptom control and to reduce the \nimpact \nof exacerbations \nin \npatients’ \nchronic \nconditions\n: j\nust over 50% of patients \nself-\nrated their health as ‘better’ or ‘much better’ and over 70% expressed a degree of improvement. \nThese results concur with studies from other homeopathic hospitals: in Tunbridge Wells improvement was seen in 74% of 1372 patients (Clover, \n2000); and in Liverpool\n improvement was seen \nin 76.6\n% of 1100 patients (Richardson, 2001).\n&#xa0;\nAn 8 year longitudinal cohort study of over 3500 adults and \nchildren \n(97% of whom were diagnosed with a chronic complaint) also \nfound that patients\n \nreceiving \nh\nomeopathic treatment improve\nd\n considerably\n (Witt\n,\n 2008)\n. \nThat is, \n67% of adults and 80% of children achieved significa\nnt health improvements \nat 2 \nyear\ns after baseline, \nand \nthis improvement was \nsustained \nfor the following 6 \nyears \nof the study\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n9. How children with chronic conditions fare using homeopathy.Children with chronic conditions appear to respond particularly well to homeopathic treatment. In addition to the evidence above, 66% of children in the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital study \ndescribed rating\n their health as ‘better’ or ‘much better’ and 80% stated a degree of improvement. 68% of the children with eczema reported that it was ‘better’ or ‘much better’ (Spence at al., 2005). Parents appear to be turning to homeopathic treatment for their children: \n24% of c\nhildren with chronic conditions in an outpatient setting in south-west England \nwere found to be using some form of CAM, \nhomeopath\ny being one of the most common (Simpson and Roman, 2001). \nThe Avon longitudinal study\n found that children were using homeopathy for chronic conditions such as asthma, eczema, hay fever, epilepsy, and\n migraine (Thompson et al., 2010\n). \n&#xa0;\n10. Evidence for specific chronic conditions It is fair to say that c\nlinical trial evidence for the eff\nectiveness \nof homeopathic treatment\n for specific conditions\n \noverall \nis \nsparse\n, although t\nrials of \nhomeopathy in \nchronic condi\ntions such as\n \nfibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, eczema, asthma, depression, ADHD and chronic fatigue\n do exist\n. \nHowever\n,\n most trials \ndone to date focus \non \nassessing \nthe efficacy of \nspecific \nhomeopathic remedies\n compared to placebo\n and\n these trials provide\n little\n useful information about the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for patients\n in a real-world context\n. For example\n,\n two of \nfour studies on \nhomeopathic treatment of \nfibromyalgia \nfocus on the efficacy of specific homeopathic remedies\n (Fisher\n,\n 1986\n; Fisher\n,\n 1989)\n while \ntwo \nother \nstudies \nare\n closer to \nreal-\nworld homeopathic practice in \nallowing free\n choice of homeopathic \nremedies\n (Bell\n et al.\n, 2004; \nRelton\n, 2009)\n: i\nnterestingly, p\nositive results were recorded in both \ntrial types\n. \n&#xa0;\n11. Adverse effectsHomeopathy is generally considered to be a safe therapy, relatively free of adverse events\n when compared to the rate of side effects from conventional medications\n. \nThe highly-diluted nature of homeopathic medicines means that they a\nre unlikely to lead to toxicity-\nrelated adverse drug reactions (Kirby, 2002). \nSeveral studies have reviewed the evidence for \nhomeopathic \nadverse events\n and together the conclusion is that as long as homeopathy is correctly administered by a professional, qualified, registered homeopath (such as those registered with the Society) it is safe\n (\nBornhöft\n et al. 2006\n; \nDantas\n and \nRampes\n 2000;\n \nEndrizzi\n \net al., \n200\n5\n;\n \nMonk, 1986; \nThompson et al.\n,\n 2004\n).\n \n12. Cost effectivenessCost effectiveness studies indicate \nthat\n the use \nof homeopathy as a treatment option can reduce financial burden on patients and healthcare providers alike. \nIn Europe, a Health Technology Assessment of homeopathy commissioned by the Swiss government recently concluded that homeopathy is “clinically effective, cost effective and safe” (\nBornhöft\n et al.\n, 2006). \nAdditionally\n, a comparison of homeopathic and conventional treatment of 493 patients with chronic conditions in Germany found that homeopathy achieved better outcomes for similar costs (Witt \net al., \n2005) and \na study involving 499 ch\nildren \nwith recurrent upper respiratory tract infections showed that \nhomeopathic treatment was more clinically effective \n(fewer episodes of illness) \nand \nmore \ncost\n-effective than antibiotics (\nTri\nchard\n et al.\n, 2005).\n \nOther studies \nin the UK \nsuggest that \nhomeopathy can save money \nby reduc\ning the \nuse of\n conventional drugs, both in a \nhospital and \na \nGP setting.\n Specifically,\n a\n 500-patient survey at the Royal London Ho\nmeopathic Hospital showed that \nmany patients were able to reduce or stop conventional medication fo\nllowing homeopathic treatment (\nSharples\n et al., 2003) \nand a\n study examin\ning\n prescription costs of 22 GPs in the UK found\n that practices which included \na GP using homeopathy prescribed 12% fewer items of medicati\non per patient (including both \nconventional drugs and homeopathic medicines) compared with other l\nocal practices\n (Swayne, 1992)\n.\n Since \nlong-term\n conditions often require \nlong-term\n medication regimes, homeopathy has the potential to make a significantly positive impact on the NHS drug budget. \n13. SummaryA\ns\n described in this paper there is a compelling argument to be made that \nhomeopathic treatment is a clinical\nly\n and cost effective \noption to support patients with \nlong-term\n \nconditions\n. Importantly, \npatients who receive homeopathic treatment are \nalso \noverwhelmingly\n positive about the experience. \nOffering homeopathic treatment to patients with \nlong-term\n health conditions addresses many of the concerns described by the Health Committee as it\n:\n \nThe use of homeopathy in healthcare \nis increasing in other countries (\ne.g. \nIndia, Brazil and Japan\n)\n \nand from 1985 to 2001 CAM use in the UK also increased (Thomas and Coleman, 2003). However, \nUK \nsupport for homeopathy has recently seen an unfortunate decrease such that NHS-\ncommissioned services\n, like the Sheffield menopause clinic and the Manor Clinic (\nhttp://www.shsc.nhs.uk\n) and the Liverpool hospital\n have \nbeen closed\n despite \noffering \naward winning \nservices and fulfilling unmet needs. This may be due to NHS budget constraints\n;\n \nminimal\n education of doctors about CAM; \nand \na decrease in GPs opinions about the effectiveness of homeopathy (48.7-21.9% in t\nhe last 10 years (Perry, 2013). A change in GP opinions may \nbe a consequence of \nthe \nunprecedented attempts \nby the biomedical community \nto discredit homeopathy in recent years (\nAnonymous, 2005; \nBewley\n, 2011\n). \nAs outlined, h\nomeopathy has an emerging evidence base of clinical effectiveness for specific \nnamed \nconditions, but \nit is important to appreciate that \nthis \nremains \nin its infancy\n as most studies have focused on the efficacy of remedies in isolation: remedy efficacy is not \nrelevant to\n patients with complex \nlong-term\n health conditions\n, \nwho need information about\n what homeopathy as a therapeutic intervention can do for them as individuals\n. \nAs such, we would argue that t\nhere \nis a \ndisconnect\nion\n between \npatient \nperception and appreciation \nof\n homeopath\ny compared to medical, scientific and commissioner decision making. \nThe NHS is \ncurrently not \nproviding \nadequate homeopathic \nservice\ns\n that are \nclearly appreciated and needed by the public\n, especially those with \nlong-term\n health conditions\n. We \ntherefore \nsuggest \nthat the NHS could benefit from\n support\ning\n the \ncheap homeopathic treatment\ns\n already available at private homeopathy clinics across the country \nas well as commissioning specialist clinics to offer an integrated approach to health and wellbeing in order to benefit the \nlong-term\n management of \nhard to treat chronic conditions. \nMay 2013\n15.
