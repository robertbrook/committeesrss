"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Jenny E Marsden (WSC025)1. Background: I work as a registered Healthcare scientist \nwithin \na Radiation\n Physics\n department supporting Oncology and Radiotherapy Services\n. \nI \nam aware that my professional body is also preparing a response to this consultation\n but\n \nI would like\n \nto take this \nopportunity\n to submit evidence because it affects me directly\n at this very moment\n. \nI recently started a family and, up until then, progressed through my \nSTEM \ncareer\n for over 15 years\n with the minimum \nof \ngender related issues.\n I truly believed that there we\nre no boundaries for women carving out a career in science.\n The\n next step for me would be a \nmore senior role\n,\n such as a \ndepartment d\neputy or even leading a small department. Higher study in the form \nof a \nspecialised\n \nPh\nD is another option.\n2\n. \nHowever, I am \nnow acutely aware\n of the gender issues facing me\n a\ns a new mother\n in the workplace. \nI\nt appears I\n have a stark choice between promotion and spending time in the week with my children.\n \nThe two \nappear\n mutually exclusive at the moment \nwhilst\n my children are young\n and \nparticularly as \nI have chosen to breastfeed\n. I\nt\n is very difficult to \ndemonstrate\n dedication to\nwards\n work\n \nto managers,\n in terms of working long \nnon standard \nhours\n,\n as well as to the family.\n3\n. \nWhy do numbers of women in STEM acade\nmic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n \nI present my \nthoughts and \nexperiences\n \nto the committee in the hope that it will encourage discussion on some of the issues I have been exploring whilst trying to resolve my own personal question; Do I want \nto be a Scientist in a very Senior Role?\n \n&#xa0;\n4. Executive Summary:\n5. Discussion: It is generally assumed that women in science all want to achieve the highest position they can. \nI would like to dispute this claim. Women have to think very carefully about the choice they make when perusing senior roles and weigh up a number o\nf different conflicting demands. I expect I am one of the women in \nthe\n statistics who have fai\nled to take up\n a top role. My \nchoice \nnow \nis to continue in my current role, in effect halting my career rise. It is less of a ‘leaky pipe’ and more of a ‘boggy hill climb’ akin to the ‘sticky floor’ which many other career women face in other professions.\n Some women jus\nt prefer the view from the level they have reached!\n6\n. \nGirls\n entering \nthe world of work are \ngetting married or forming long term relationships\n and having children later. Women who have reached a reasonable position are older and may care for both children and parents\n.\n \nOne advantage of settling down later is that women may be receiving \nhigher salaries, but that in turn may present a problem because they may well become the main breadwinner for the household. I\nf the woman’s job is the main or only source of family income\n, the risk of pursuing high roles by moving around the country on \ncon\nsecutive \nshort term contracts or taking time out to study to further advance may be perceived as far too high.\n \nJob security at the moment is also in question so many people are looking to \nstabilise\n their \nwork lives\n rather than move on to temporary or short\n fixed term contracts. This would have been a way of progressing up the career ladder in previous years, or when there were no other responsibilities to consider except for oneself. Mobility to follow roles around the country is also perceived to be reduce\nd once family life is established. I think this option is still open for those with fewer ties, male or female, \nwho are \nwilling to move around to where the \nleading\n jobs are situated.\n7\n. \nChild care, flexible working and return to work from maternity leave\n a\nre governed by l\negislation to protect women having children \nin the workplace\n, \nbut \nthe application of this legislation to the policies and procedures within workplaces varies. The culture of long working hours and expectation of availability outside standar\nd working hours is still strong, especially in relation to more senior grades\n, where many believe it is not possible to perform these roles part time\n. \nWhen\n women consider applying for promotion they must weigh up the demands on their time with the higher s\nalary and status. Often the choice, especially when children are young, is to put off the promotion in \nfavour\n of more family friendly working hours which appear to be easier to \ngain\n at the lower roles. Whilst it is important to promote girls in STEM it is \nalso important to ensure that people have personal choice. I also would like to make the point that this applies to men who chose to have more family friendly work hours and is not distinct from the issue with women. It may be that the stereotypical role o\nf the mother at home prevails, but also, \nas \nwomen are consciously choosing to have children and \nhave more control over when to do it, many \nwould like to have some time with them, especially in the early years.\n8\n.\n Flexible working policies do exist but they are not always supported, on the ground, for higher roles. \nC\nhoice\ns\n between staying in current position\ns\n (\nfor example,\n I already work full time on week days with the occasional pre-planned evening shift) and goin\ng for a more senior post where the expectation would be to work beyond a regular working week. In practice this would mean seeing less of my children and having to find, costly, childcare. As a specialist in my role, at an already quite senior grade, there\n are no other staff who can share my responsibilities or workload so job share opportunities are al\nso not possible. \nSenior roles often involve more managerial aspects than ‘doing’ science. It may not be very appealing to take on the burden of managing a de\npartment when one is often also managing the home\n or children\n at the same time. In some ways this may be a success story for women in STEM; that they are cho\no\nsing to \npursue roles which involve the study or application of science rather than managing the pe\nople that do it. \nAlthough it is a right to apply for flexible working it is not a right to be given it. Applications for condensed hours \nor four day weeks do not seem to be granted easily in my experience.\n \nThere is an odd  dichotomy here as once a person i\ns in a senior role they may have more autonomy to arrange their work and office hours as they see fit (provided it \nget completed, of course) so surprisingly this can be an informal route to flexible working. I expect many women would not feel confident pla\nnning to exploit this option prior to them being in post and therefore if a job was not advertised with flexible working they may not consider applying.\nFinancially the \ncost of childcare is huge. Full time childcare can be as much as a quarter of a salary \nof £50k. The e\nquations do not balance\n and \nal\nthough \nI am \npersonally \naware this situation should only last a few years and that it should be feasible for me to catch up in the long run\n, it means that I cannot consider applying for the top roles within my \norg\nanisation\n at the moment. \nIt is possible that this realisation comes to other STEM mothers but they decide to continue in their lower roles rather than seek promotion and this then continues for the rest of their working lives. \nImproved change planning and \nrole development could be successful here.\n9. \nCertainly the country has seen a rise in working mothers \nhowever this report also demonstrates that between 66.5% of mothers and 67.3% of women without dependent children were in work.\n \nWomen are also having children later with more women aged 35-49\n \nwith pre-scho\nol children.  \nSo what are the other women doing? And what proportion of these could be skilled STEM advocates?\n My professional body, the IPEM, have some data on this question.\n10\n. \nIf we now a\nssume female and male applicants both apply for the top posts, wh\nat could be affecting women being employed? The\n interview\ners have e\nxpectations of the \nincumbent\n, which may be closely related to their own work and life experiences\n. If these are all men \n(or women) \nwho have succeeded by putting in many hours and who do not\n have families, it is hard for them to appreciate that a \nmother or carer\n can do just as a good a job within the working week. I was successful at an interview for a deputy head job elsewhere where the panel consisted of a female head with a family. I was s\nubsequently told that this \nlevel of role\n would not have been \naccessible\n to me within my current workplace.\n I am not supportive of women only shortlists but having at least one woman\n, or a person experienced with flexible working and successful work/life ba\nlance\n,\n \non the interview panel for senior jobs\n would, I believe, be massively beneficial\n.\n \nIt is worth pointing out that s\nome fathers and men could also suffer from this inequality if they are the main carer, (especially with the change in legislation \ngoverning sharing paternity and maternity leave or adoption leave).\n For me, the NHS \nHigher S\npecialist S\ncientific\n Training \nprogramme\n \ncould be a way into the top roles in the country but it is expected to \nbe \navailable \nfor only a small percentage of \nthe workforce.\n I\n wonder if there is a \nplace for positiv\ne discrimination o\nr at least, fewer perceived boundaries \nand encouragement \nfor women applying?\n It is my belief that if \na person is\n governing \nan \norganisation\n then they sho\nuld be \nrepresentative of the \nstaff\n they are governing\n \n(i.e. a balance and mix of genders, races and life experiences) \nbut if they are managing services then they should be\n the best people for the job\n, regardless of gender\n.\n The difficulty comes when the sen\nior role is a mixture of both.\n1\n1\n. \nAdvertising successful role models within science\n should be encouraged\n. This is not always achieved successfully because these women \noften \nappear as super-women and cannot be related to. It is not possible for the average\n STEM career women to have a live in nanny\n, au pair\n or a stay at home partner for example! Promoting the long haul of a career rather than the short term job prospects\n should be encouraged by professional bodies and the government. This is even more import\nant as the age of retirement increases.\n A woman may go through many and varying roles with different working patterns during her working life and this is to be encouraged.\n12\n. \nWith regard to uni\nversities and Higher Education Institutions\n retaining women gr\naduates and PhD students\n, this c\nould be encouraged by the use of \nclear \navenues into work. For example, \nby \ntying \na higher\n degree \nto\n a work pathway or \ncompany\n who encourage flexible working\n,\n \nSTEM subjects\n \ncould\n be made \ntailored\n for companies who require \nspec\nialist \npost graduates, thereby giving them \naccess\n to the \nhighest\n \ncalibre\n \nof candidates. \nOn completion of the degree the transition to work could be made\n with the knowledge that flexible working and maternity/paternity leave arrangements will not only be co\nnsidered but are encouraged for a healthy work/life balance. It is often highly frowned upon\n and discouraged to plan any significant life event during higher degree studies. For one year courses such as MSc, this might be \nunderstandable, but for three year\n PhDs, training schemes and longer or part time courses \nit is\n hig\nhly unlikely\n that a major life event won’t happen during that time\n. Higher Education I\nnstitutions must make provision for what might happen if women chose this time to start a \nfamily\n. How can\n they come\n back \ninto\n their degree, is there provision for childcare on \nsite\n for them to \ncontinue\n their studies, \nhow\n long can \nthey\n extend for? I \nrealise\n that this is already done on an individual basis but perhaps a clear policy might help girls\n or women\n ch\nose their higher education institution\n more carefully.\n13\n. \nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? The Government should promote career planning that includes personal goals as well as profession\nal \nachievements\n.\n Implementation of family friendly policies at work, not just the presence of a policy should be commended. Financial rewards for companies who actively promote flexible working could be considered.\nI have no conflicts of interest in relat\nion to this inquiry. I am a member of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine who have also provided evidence for this inquiry.\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nIPPR Report on ‘The Sandwich Generation: Older Women Balancing Work and Care Ref: http://www.ippr.org/images/media/files/publication/2013/08/sandwich-generati\non-August2013_11168_11168.pdf)\n \nOffice for National Statistics Report ‘Mothers in the Labour Market’, March 2011Ref: http://www.ons.\ngov.uk/ons/dcp171776_234036.pdf\n N\not yet fully developed at http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/healthcare-science/training/nhs-higher-special\nist-scientific-training-(hsst)/\n"
