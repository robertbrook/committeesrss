[[[Costs]]]I wrote to you on 28 October to follow up on our session on the 14 October. In that letter we reported that the costs incurred by the Department in preparing for and representation at Court for the check-off case amounted to £27,502.70.&#xa0;We have, however, now been advised by Treasury Solicitors that the cost information they provided to the Department was incorrect. They have now confirmed that the total legal costs incurred in connection with the case were £42,516.40. In the circumstances, they have decided not to recover the full additional cost from the Department and so the revised cost to the Department is £38,326.70.&#xa0;As stated previously, we estimate that the ongoing savings to facility time may in due course represent £400,000 a year of taxpayers' money, as well as delivering a clearer and healthier separation between trade unions and the state.&#xa0;4 December 2013&#xa0;
