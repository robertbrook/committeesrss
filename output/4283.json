"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (LCI0010)Background: We asked the NAO to review “Public funding for innovation in low carbon technologies in the UK” and we are publishing their report and launching our own inquiry. The NAO report highlights that that since June 2010, DECC have taken steps to improve co-ordination of innovation funding. DECC re-launched the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG) in late-2011 comprising all the bodies involved in funding low carbon innovation: BIS, DECC, DEFRA, MOD, DfT, DCLG, UKTI, the Welsh Government, the Scottish Government, the Energy Technology Institute, Crown Estate, Ofgem, Carbon Trust, Scottish Enterprise, Technology Strategy Board, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The LCICG is preparing a strategy for launch in early 2014, which should include an assessment of the opportunities for funding for different low carbon technologies. The LCICG should also report on the different stages of the innovation process where public investment could be most effective.However, the UK’s performance on funding for low carbon innovation to date has been mixed. UK expenditure on energy research and development doubled between 2006-2011 and DECC allocated £185m for 2011-2015 for low carbon innovation: but it under-spent its budget between 2011-2013 because of delays in agreeing and launching its projects. Furthermore, there is no commitment beyond 2015 to a low carbon innovation budget, leaving industry uncertain on support for their investment in long-term innovation initiatives.IntroductionThis paper\n provides the response from the UK Hydroge\nn and Fuel Cell Association to \nthe \n“Low carbon innovation” inquiry published by the Energy and Climate Change Committee in October 2013\n. \nThe UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (U\nK HFCA) aims to accelerate the \nc\nommercialization of fuel cell and hydrogen energy tech\nnologies. Through the breadth, \nexpertise and diversity of our membership, we work\n to trigger the policy changes \nrequired for the UK to fully realise the opportunities\n offered by these clean energy \nsolut\nions and associated elements of the supply chain. \nFuel cells and hydrogen are ‘game changing’ tec\nhnologies providing low-carbon \nsolutions across transport, stationary power and b\neyond. The growing industry is \nalready bringing benefits that the UK cannot a\nffo\nrd to miss: creating new jobs, \nsupporting UK economic growth and improved competi\ntiveness in the energy markets \nglobally. \nThis \nsubmission\n has been produced through consultation\n with our members and presents \nthe Association’s response to those aspects o\nf the consult\nation of most relevance to the \nsector. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Our key messages are:UK HFCA Feedback on terms of Reference: Whilst the\n current approach towards low carbon innovation undoubtedly \noffers some benefit\ns, \nthe Government could provide further incentives to stimulate long-term public and private investment\n into the low carbon sector\n to help achieve policy objectives and avoid costly long term challenges around the rising cost of conventional fuels, securit\ny of supply and cost of carbon adaptation. \nAdditionally,\n \nlowest cost is not the only factor to consider.\n \nT\nhe LCI\nC\nG website\n notes\n that \n“\nI\nn the period up to April 2015, core LCICG members expect to spend over £800 million of public sector funding on low car\nbon innovation\n”\n.\n \nWe observe that the members of LCICG include a wide range of government departments with a wide range of scope, timescales\n, varying levels of understanding of low carbon innovation technologies\n and \na wealth of \nother priorities.\n In \norder \nfor funding \nto \nbe focused on “legally binding targets” and “lowest possible cost”\n, \na consistent approach to assess\ning, prioritising\n and monitor\ning\n the progress o\nf the projects that are funded is \nrequired\n, \nand is\n not evident today\n. T\nhe LCI\nC\nG may be able to \nco-ordinate\n this activity.\n&#xa0;\nHowever\n,\n it\n is also \nimportant to \nhighlight \nthat:     \nFrom the members of UKHFCA experience\n,\n the two criteria being tested\n \nare \nnot \nthe\nrefore the\n only criteria by which innovation funding \nshould be \nassessed\n. \nFor instance\n, from a \nBIS perspective, ability to contribute t\no UK growth is \nincluded in funds that are administered through the Technology Strategy board, as well as allowing for applied research projects that may or may not deliver innovation that \ncan be deployed \nwithin the timescales of the legally binding targets\n, or within the UK alone.  For instance\n,\n \nt\nhe European\n \nFuel Cells and Hydrogen\n industry has seen annual turnover increase by 10% over the past five years\n1\n, t\nhe global fuel cell and hydrogen energy market is projected to be worth over $15 billion by 2017\n2\n, \ngrowing to $180 billion in 2050\n3\n, \nand r\nevenues in the fuel cell sector are projected to grow at a rate of 26% annually over the next decade\n3\n. This substantial \nopportunity should not be neglected by the UK.\n&#xa0;\nIt is our view that th\ne government’s approach towards low carbon innovation \ndoes not have the right balance as it \nis not structured to facilitate the introduction of new tech\nnologies (such as hydrogen and fuel cells)\n that do not fit “neatly”\n into existing policy schemes\n. Furthermore,\n \nthere are no planned policy schemes that could support the needs of a small scale and not fully market ready sector (such as hydrogen and fuel ce\nlls). For example, the next steps of the EMR (Capacity Market and Contracts for Difference) will address the needs of fully commercialised\n sectors\n.\n \nO\nn a similar basis, \nthe \nexisting Government structures\n \nfail to recognise the convergence of previously dive\nrse parts of the energy space (e.g. electricity for vehicles and heating)\n.\n&#xa0;\nIn \norder to maximise the options for the UK in delivering its carbon objectives, the scope of Government thinking, and support for innovation, needs to be extended beyond the ‘usual suspects’. This should include evaluations of technologies with significant p\notential which is not currently recognised by either Government thinking or support, such as fuel cells and hydrogen, so that new strategies can be developed to help the UK optimise its response to the opportunity. \nSpecifically for \nhydrogen and fuel cells\n,\n o\nutcomes from the LCI\nC\nG would therefore\n need to\n include a\nnalyses to support the sector\n, \nsuch as \nRoad mapping of future pathways and options (across all \nmarkets), and evaluation of the business case. These will help to define the best pan-application poli\ncies and support mechanisms to sit alongside those available for other low carbon technologies.\n \nIn addition, it would be most useful for the sector if the Energy and Climate Change Committee launched in the short-term a specific inquiry on hydrogen and fu\nel cells where written and / or oral submissions would provide the evidence required to stimulate Gove\nrnment’s thinking and support for\n the sector.\nSuch is the challenge of low carbon innovation that i\nnvestment needs to be targeted across all stages of the innovation process. \nFor innovative disruptive technology for which there is a small but growing industry opportunity\n, such as \nhydrogen and fuel cells\n,\n there is a need for on-going R&amp;D in all stages\n of the\n pipeline. Over the long term\n, the G\novernment can particularly play a role in defining market needs, risk mitigation, demonstration and scale. \n&#xa0;\nShort term funding timelines are not helpful in any aspect of low carbon innovation. Private sector investment needs to \nbe \ngiven \nconsistent long term strategies and risk mitigation support to h\nave confidence in \nmatch funding investment.  \n&#xa0;\nDECC should ensure\n that its remaining capital allocation is wisely spent by doing work to understand which technologies should be receiving funding. As mentioned above, in question 3, technologies with substantial potential\n, such as hydrogen and fuel cells,\n are currently ov\nerlooked. \nA more practical recommendation would be for DECC to identify ways to \naccelerate\n the process of getting contracts figured out.\nIt also debatable why the LCICG needed to have their own projects and couldn’t use existing funding providers with est\nablished contracts and competition processes already such as Carbon Trust, TSB etc. \n&#xa0;\nAt the moment, the Government is not maximi\nsing opportunities to learn from and partner with international players. Other countries\n \nhave understood the potential of the\n fuel cell and hydrogen\n sector\n and are investing to reap the benefits\n.\n For example, Germany\n has established\n a strategic alliance ca\nlled the National Innovation Programme Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP). NIP is \nintended to speed up the process of market preparation of products based on this technology. The total budget \nfor the 10 year \nperiod \nto\n 2016 amounts to € 1.4 billion. \nHa\nlf of this is provided by \nThe Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS) and the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi, Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie), while the balance is funded by participating \nindustry.\n \nNIP is divided into four programme areas to advance numerous hydrogen and fuel cell technology product and application options\n in parallel\n, and to be able to address in a targeted way the market-specific challenges of market preparation. The \nspec\nific\n programme areas are: “Transport and Hydrogen Infrastructure”, “Hydrogen Provision”, “Stationary Energy Supply”, and “Special Markets”. With \na view to\n series production of c\nomponents, the explicit focus of\n all programme areas is on the strengthening of\n the supply industry.\n More information can be found at: \nhttp://www.now-gmbh.de/en.html\n. \n  The UK could learn valuable lessons from the German experience.\n \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSources: 1.Fuel Cell and Hydrogen \nJoint Undertaking, Trends in Investment, jobs and turnover in the Fuel cells and Hydrogen sector, 2013\n2.
