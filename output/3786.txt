&#xa0;Written evidence from Greater Manchester Police (CYS0039)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.               Introduction.&#xa0;1.1                As in many cities Greater Manchester has some of the busiest roads in the country. The city is a major hub for commercial activity and has been affected by the national increase in road user traffic. Whilst it has an increase in its fair share of heavy goods vehicles and buses using these roads it does not contain the amount of continuous structural development that the capital is experiencing.&#xa0;1.2              It is clear that Manchester does not have the motoring infrastructure which requires the constant monitoring from TfL to allow free flow of traffic and use of road users within the capital.&#xa0;1.3                It has become apparent that cycling as a mode of transport is on the increase as more road users are switching to pedal cycles. This has been enhanced with the success of the British Cycling Team and as a more cost effective, sometimes quicker and greener way to commute to work and places of study.&#xa0;1.4              Greater Manchester is the home of British Cycling and has excellent facilities within the Velodrome. The roads are not, proportionately, as well developed.                &#xa0;1.3              National KSI statistics identify that whilst overall numbers of KSI’s have decreased the proportion of pedal cyclists KSI numbers has risen. &#xa0;1.4              Within Greater Manchester the highest number of KSI figures in relation to pedal cyclists was the main A34, B5117 and A6010 route from the south west of Manchester to the city centre. This route is used by students using pedal power attending the University of               Manchester and daily commuters. This route includes what is commonly known as ‘Curry Mile’ as the road is the centre of a plethora of late night eating houses used by all.  From January 2011 to August 2012 there were 43 pedal cyclists’ collisions on this road 4 of which were serious.&#xa0;1.5               In order to reduce the number of collisions on the roads within Greater Manchester officers above from Traffic Network Section developed an innovative approach named Operation ‘Grimaldi’ which underpins the force road safety initiative Operation ‘Dice’.&#xa0;2.              Phases&#xa0;2. 1               The first phase involves an educational interactive ‘walkthrough’ exhibition containing an articulated tractor unit with full sized curtain sided trailer and a bus. &#xa0;2.2              The second is a period of targeted enforcement.&#xa0;2.3              The third being road safety presentations with the offer of free cycle training.  &#xa0;3.               Walkthrough&#xa0;3.1                Initially Operation ‘Grimaldi’ staff  arrange a suitable place to hold an interactive walk through in specifically targeted areas such as town centre’s or outside the University buildings. This involves vehicles from a local haulage company ‘Fagan and Whalley’ and ‘Stagecoach’ bus company, who also provide their respective senior driving trainers. &#xa0;3.2                The HGV unit and articulated trailer is set at a slight angle as though the driver / vehicle was turning left (the most common manoeuvre involved in KSI’s) to highlight the blind spots. A member of the public then sits in the driver’s seat where the trainer points out the blind spots and difficulties that a HGV driver has especially when turning left. &#xa0;3.3              This also dispels the assumption that they can see the drivers mirror so the driver must be able to see them. The input also includes what mirrors on the vehicle can assist and that not all such vehicles have proximity mirrors.&#xa0;3.4              The bus company also provides a senior trainer who will also invite people to sit in the driving seat. The instructor then walks into the blind spots and asks if he can be seen. Whilst the member of the public sitting in the driving seat will often shift position by leaning back or forward in an attempt to see the instructor the fact that this is not practical whilst driving is pointed out by the trainer.  &#xa0;&#xa0;4.               Enforcement.&#xa0;4.1                Highlighted locations are carefully chosen and a full risk assessment is undertaken.&#xa0;4.2                One junction in particular was highlighted in the data as the centre of collision              hotspots for pedal cyclists. Observations at this junction by ‘Grimaldi’ staff revealed               that there were also a large number of near misses at this location.&#xa0;4.3                The main offences committed are careless and inconsiderate cycling, failing to comply with traffic signs, cycling with no lights fitted or illuminated and cycling on the footpath. A significant number of collisions take place when a cyclist rides from the pavement into the road.&#xa0;4.4                Failing to comply with traffic signs can be red lights or one way streets. Cycling with no lights fitted or illuminated is an offence, which can only be dealt with during the hours of darkness. Cycling on the footpath is dealt with on a common sense approach i.e.: busy footpaths in town centres. The previous three can be dealt with by way of a traffic offence report whilst careless and inconsiderate cycling is a summonsable offence and deemed more serious. The only offence a PCSO can enforce is cycling on the footpath all others have to be dealt with by a constable. &#xa0;4.5                Having chosen a suitable location the team of officers / staff working together to deliver the operation observe offenders, be it cyclists or               other road users, the details are forwarded to ‘stoppers’ who directs offenders to a safe location to stop.&#xa0;4.6              The offenders are spoken to by an officer. Vehicular offences are processed in the usual manner whilst the offending cyclist is issued with a traffic offence report (£50 fine).               As an alternative to the fine the cyclists are then given the opportunity to attend a force cycle safety presentation and informed upon conclusion of such the fine will be rescinded. &#xa0;4.7                This mirrors the current driver improvement scheme and is a onetime offer and at this stage is free.  Cyclists are informed that if they commit a further offence this will result in a fine or court appearance. &#xa0;4.8                It is clear that if the ticket is not issued cyclists would not attend the safety               presentation.&#xa0;5.               Presentations.&#xa0;5.1               The presentations are held in the local proximity to where the enforcement has happened, usually at community rooms in local Fire Stations. This is led by Gareth Walker a member of the team and includes a suitably qualified cycle trainer from TfGM.&#xa0;5.2                The intention of the presentation is to show the vulnerability of cyclists when using the               road.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The views of the cyclists vary throughout and the lack of knowledge and understanding of road safety legislation is concerning&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6.                 Figures.&#xa0;6.1                Since the operation began nine months there have been 17 enforcement days.               This equates to approximately 51 hours.&#xa0;6.2                The results are the results of cyclists that have been issued with traffic offence reports.              420 for failing to comply with traffic signs              107 for cycling with no lights fitted or illuminated              118 for cycling on the footpath               5 for careless and inconsiderate cycling              In total 650 cyclists.&#xa0;6.3                Of those cyclists 474 so far have attended a presentation and had their ticket rescinded. (There is still one series of presentations to run so this figure will be higher).&#xa0;&#xa0;6.4               Of those 650 cyclists 17 have been stopped twice and now face prosecution.  &#xa0;7              Other road users.&#xa0;7.1              The force has produced a leaflet based on ‘Sharing the Road’ in which it includes education for all road users. It is felt that this can be used at any event within the force and aimed at any members of the public.&#xa0;7.2              The force are also involved in the training of the drivers of HGV and bus companies on the correct setting of mirrors and the hazard perception of other road users including cyclists when using the road systems.&#xa0;7.3              The force have obtained the use of a Volvo D40 motor vehicle, supported and lent by Volvo, fitted with a unique cyclist and pedestrian safety system which includes auto braking, blind spot information system and 360o proximity sensors. This includes an under-bonnet airbag to protect vulnerable road users. This has been used as an aid at all static exhibits.&#xa0;              Conclusions&#xa0;&#xa0;  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;8              Recommendations&#xa0;8.1              Most of the offences committed by cyclists are seen as low level and as such are not dealt with robustly. Consideration must be given to expanding the powers of the PCSO to include such offences as lighting and fail to conform to traffic signs. Currently they can only issue a Traffic Offence Report for the offence of cycling on the footpath.  This would fit the new recommendations of increasing the use of neighbourhood policing model and allow more cyclists to be educated.&#xa0;8.2              Cycle retailers could do more to support the work of the local authorities, police and community groups by ensuring when they sell a cycle it is fitted with the respective lighting, security, (lock and cycle marking) fluorescent jacket and advice on the rules of the road for cyclists, cycle maintenance together with free cycling information in with the purchase price. &#xa0;8.3              An NDORS style course similar to the driver improvement scheme should be developed. (GMP is currently compiling such for TfGM to complete and offer of training for offences committed within the force). This leaves the force to deal with enforcement and the local authority to train. The aim eventually would be to look to a national course.  This would also follow with a training of police staff as to the new system in place.&#xa0;8.4              Whilst there are many areas within Greater Manchester that are relatively safe to cycle               there are a number of areas of concern. The area highlighted is one that has been given               government approval to change the road structure reducing the potential risk to               cyclists. However the traffic displaced may well create another potential ‘hot spot.’ &#xa0;8.5              Despite the number of HGV’s on the road system to prohibit such at peak times would               not be feasible for the following reasons.&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
