default is a small rural community situated in Eden valley in the east of Cumbria.
default&#xa0;
default The village is situated just off the main A66 trunk road approx 10 miles from Penrith
default and 5 miles from Appleby in Westmorland.
default&#xa0;
default The community is made up of approximately 350 dwellings, 60 of which are designated as social housing.
default&#xa0;
default The village has a small shop and post office.
default&#xa0;
default There is little local employment to which people would not hav
defaulte to use some form of transport.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe village is served by the 563 bus service which operates between Kirkby Stephen and Penrith.
default&#xa0;
default The route has 10 services in each direction during the week.
default&#xa0;
default The service generally stops at the bus stop situated on the A6
default6 which is at least 1 mile from the vast majority of properties.
default&#xa0;
default There are 4 services (2 in each direction) that call in to the village itself.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultKirkby Thore Parish Council successful campaigned to increase the number of services calling into the villa
defaultge from 2 to 4 in 2012.
default&#xa0;
default Although the Parish Council initially underwrote the cost of these extra services their popularity has deemed them to be self financing.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parish Council believes that the key to rural transport is the improvement of bus servic
defaultes and that to deliver transport
default&#xa0;
defaultimprovements a number of issues and authorities will need to work together.
default&#xa0;
default This is something that the Parish Council is actively trying to achieve. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parish Council is still campaigning for more bus services to call 
defaultin to the village and believes if a number of agencies worked together it would benefit the community as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default If more buses (Cumbria County Council) called into the village less people would need to cross the busy A66, near to a difficult junction wit
defaulth poor visibility, to get to the bus shelter (Highways Agency).
default&#xa0;
default If the all the bus services called in to the village and none stopped on the A66 the bus shelter and layby could be used as part of a junction improvement (Highways Agency).
default&#xa0;
default If more bus serv
defaultices called into the village more people would be able to access employment (Reduction in Benefits).
default&#xa0;
default If more bus services called in to the village the housing association would find it easier to fill properties being vacated as a result of the bedroom tax
default. (Eden Housing Association).
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition the Eden Local Development Plan has identified sites within the Parish where a potential 152 additional properties could be built - a 43% increase in the size of the village.
default&#xa0;
default This Plan however does not detail an
defaulty additional services or improvements that the community could expect if such an increase should occur.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Parish Council hopes that the example and issues described above relating to Kirkby Thore will help demonstrate that the issues rural communitie
defaults face are complex and many; with transport being at the centre of achieving many other benefits, however,
default&#xa0;
defaultaddressing issues in isolation will not deliver the results rural communities need to survive.
