[normal]Kirkby 
[normal]Thore
[normal] is a small rural community situated in Eden valley in the east of Cumbria.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The village is situated just off the main A66 trunk road approx 10 miles from Penrith
[normal] and 5 miles from Appleby in Westmorland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The community is made up of approximately 350 dwellings, 60 of which are designated as social housing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The village has a small shop and post office.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is little local employment to which people would not hav
[normal]e to use some form of transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The village is served by the 563 bus service which operates between Kirkby Stephen and Penrith.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The route has 10 services in each direction during the week.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The service generally stops at the bus stop situated on the A6
[normal]6 which is at least 1 mile from the vast majority of properties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There are 4 services (2 in each direction) that call in to the village itself.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Kirkby Thore Parish Council successful campaigned to increase the number of services calling into the villa
[normal]ge from 2 to 4 in 2012.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Although the Parish Council initially underwrote the cost of these extra services their popularity has deemed them to be self financing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Parish Council believes that the key to rural transport is the improvement of bus servic
[normal]es and that to deliver transport
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]improvements a number of issues and authorities will need to work together.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is something that the Parish Council is actively trying to achieve. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Parish Council is still campaigning for more bus services to call 
[normal]in to the village and believes if a number of agencies worked together it would benefit the community as a whole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If more buses (Cumbria County Council) called into the village less people would need to cross the busy A66, near to a difficult junction wit
[normal]h poor visibility, to get to the bus shelter (Highways Agency).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If the all the bus services called in to the village and none stopped on the A66 the bus shelter and layby could be used as part of a junction improvement (Highways Agency).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If more bus serv
[normal]ices called into the village more people would be able to access employment (Reduction in Benefits).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] If more bus services called in to the village the housing association would find it easier to fill properties being vacated as a result of the bedroom tax
[normal]. (Eden Housing Association).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition the Eden Local Development Plan has identified sites within the Parish where a potential 152 additional properties could be built - a 43% increase in the size of the village.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This Plan however does not detail an
[normal]y additional services or improvements that the community could expect if such an increase should occur.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Parish Council hopes that the example and issues described above relating to Kirkby Thore will help demonstrate that the issues rural communitie
[normal]s face are complex and many; with transport being at the centre of achieving many other benefits, however,
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]addressing issues in isolation will not deliver the results rural communities need to survive.
