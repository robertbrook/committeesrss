Further correspondence from Cllr Sharon

[normal]Taylor, Chair, Finance Panel, Local Government Association
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further to my letter dated 7 November 2013, I write, as promised, with an update on local welfare support following a focus group of councils convened by the Local Government Association 
[normal](LGA) 
[normal]to obtain qualitative research into local authority administration of welfare assistance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While the LGA is still developing its position, and further discussions are due to take place on 12 December, some points have already emerged which may be of interest to the Work and Pensions Select Committee. These points are set out in the Annex. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to reiterate that the LGA is still developing its position on the matter and it is hoped that we will be in a position to put forward our position in early 2014. In the meantime, I hope the information enclosed is of assistance to the Committeeâ€™s inquiry.
