It is the very \nfirst time it has ever happened, \nso I am feeling very smug\n. D\noubtless I am going to have a big fall in a minute. You were not here for the last session, I do not think. Were you here the whole time?\nDr Kyle: Not the whole time, no.\nThe Chairman: I just make the general housekeeping points. First of all, welcome to you and thank you for giving up the time to come before us and give us the benefit of your knowledge. The session will last approximately 50 to 60 minutes and I have to outline the following\n. m\nembers of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. \nThere are n\none. The session is on the record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible by the \np\narliamentary website. The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the \nparliamentary\n website. I have asked, for the record, if you could begin by stating\n,\n each one of you in turn\n,\n your names and official titles.\nDr Kyle: I am Peter Kyle. I am \nc\nhief \ne\nxecutive of WORKing for YOUth.\nAdam Swash: Adam Swash. I \nam head of strategy and research \nat Experian\n,\n but I founded and ran WORKing for YOUth, which is the reason I was called here.\nMike Thompson: Mike Thompson. I am head of \nearly careers \nfor Barclays.\nThe Chairman: Thank you very much for coming. I am sure it will be quite different evidence from the evidence we have just had from the previous witnesses. I would like to invite you to make an opening statement. Dr Kyle.\nDr Kyle: Thank you. I will say \ntalk \nabout the purpose of WORKing for YOUth. I have been \nchief executive \nof WORKing for YOUth for less than two months. I am new in post\n,\n but WORKing for YOUth was created two years ago, driven by Sir John Peace, who is \nc\nhairman of Standard Chartered\n,\n Experian, and the Burberry Group. It was created to be a force within the private sector to create opportunities for young people under the age of 24 who lacked qualifications. They want to create, and WORKing for YOUth seeks to create, a movement within the private sector that will create employment opportunities for young people with no qualifications. It has extremely ambitious targets creating 200,000 new posts within the private sector for young people and to create ultimately a fund of £100 million to try to tackle this issue.\n \nEven though the project, which is now a registered charity, has been running for almost two years, I have been brought on board to give focus to the work because we now have 56 corporate partners within the FTSE 100 and beyond, right down to the small and medium\n-sized\n enterprise market. Barclays is one of the key members of the programme as well. Now we are entering the stage where we are giving it real drive and focus, and we are going to seek to embed ourselves even further in the private sector and escalate the delivery function of what we are here to do. We are not here to duplicate the work that is being done out there by different delivery partners and different partners within the private sector and the voluntary sector and statutory sectors. What we see ourselves to do is to foster collaboration to harness and spread the best practice throughout the private sector, and make sure all of the partners and people in the private sector, who are tackling this issue, can create that to add up to more than the sum of its parts, so that we can show that there is a movement within the private sector, which is gaining traction and making a real impact here.\nAdam Swash: I think Peter has covered a lot of what I am here to do. I sit within Experian, which is one of Sir John’s organisations. I spend most of my life building strategies and policies for public sector and private sector organisations. I think Sir John was absolutely astounded when some of the figures around youth unemployment came in and wanted to know what business could do about it. \nM\ny team \nand I \nlooked into a lot of the issues and helped him build the germ of an idea, which turned into WORKing for YOUth. I have been responsible for building a lot of that and bringing the partnerships together now \nto \nhand over to Peter to run successfully. \nMike Thompson: Hopefully what I will bring to the session today is some practical experience of working with young people. I have been in my current role at Barclays for the last 18 months, and that has predominantly been working with recruiting and training young people who are not in education\n,\n training or employment. We have learnt a lot over the past 18 months about some of the issues young people face\n,\n and hopefully I can bring some insight to the Committee regarding some of the challenges \nthat \nwe have come across as an employer.\nQ99 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Thank you very much. I want to advise the witnesses that some questions will be more relevant than others. Each witness is not expected to provide an answer for every question, if you do not want to. That is not to try to keep the session short\n,\n but I do w\nant to keep it trundling along.\nCould you describe for us your involvement with young people as employees or trainees and how recruitment for this group has changed during the course of the economic downturn in about five years? Was WORKing for YOUth set up two years ago?\nAdam Swash: Two years ago.\nThe Chairman: This was on the back of Occupy, was it, or was it coincidental with Occupy?\nAdam Swash: It was coincidental with Occupy. I think it was after the disturbances we had seen the previous year.\nThe Chairman: Yes, Croydon and Tottenham.\nAdam Swash: Sir John is Lord Lieutenant in \nNottingham\n where there was particular trouble.\nThe Chairman: What is your involvement with young people as employees or trainees? Do you get involved with young people themselves\n,\n or do you sit there and say this is what should happen?\nDr Kyle: We do not spend that much time sitting\n,\n but my role is to co-ordinate, facilitate and spread best practice and try to inspire other employers to take the route that Barclays has, which is a phenomenal case study in this area. I should say that my role therefore is slightly a helicopter view of what is happening with youth unemployment. Previously my role here \nw\nas \ndeputy chief executive \nof ACEVO, the umbrella body for the voluntary sector, and in that time in 2011 we reported \nin \nthe Youth Unemployment Commission, which I helped establish\n and \nwhich David Miliband chaired\n. We \nran the \nc\nommission on youth unemployment for six to eight months, looking into the policy area\n,\n the policy underpinnings of the provider market and the social problems associated with youth unemployment, and that is what led me to here. My background is mostly in the policy areas and the policy implications and representing the providers. The voluntary sector is now obviously within the private sector\n, so I should hand over to Mike, \nwho can give you the front\n-\nline view on this.\nThe Chairman: I was going to ask him\n. A\n case study. What a build up.\nMike Thompson: You can look at it from two aspects. I think \nthat \npart of the question is \nabout \nwhat has happened in the labour market and what has been the trend over the last decade, probably not just the last five years, \nand it \nis this increasing focus on the graduate market as a source of talent for businesses as more and more young people are going down the graduate and higher education pathway. I think \nthat \nwe as a business, like many other businesses, have followed that trend\n,\n and increasingly we are starting to see even entry level jobs being filled by graduates who are in our contact centres and our branches,\n and\n our cashiering jobs are being filled by people with degrees. We took a step back about 18 months ago and looked at what implications that was having for our business. One was quite a high level of dissatisfaction among the young people because they were getting great qualifications and were filling roles that perhaps were not what they had aspired to and were not seeing the progression that they had hoped for. \nEqually for us we were seeing \na \nvery high turnover of young people because they were coming in, they were not progressing \nin \nthe way they had hoped to progress, and therefore they were leaving, and that was a revolving door for us and therefore quite a high cost to the business of training, which was leading to no progression or development.\n \nSo we took a step back and looked at the other implications of hiring purely from a graduate market, which was \nthat \nwe were not hiring anyone between the age of 16 or 18. In fact\n,\n we have very few people under the age of 21 in our workforce\n. A\n bank that wants to develop innovative digital products and find new ways of planking and providing services\n,\n both in the \nUK\n and globally\n,\n need\ns\n to have young \npeople of \ntalent coming into \ntheir \nbusiness who are digital natives\n \nfamiliar with digital technology.\n \nSo we took a step back and looked at our own policy—purely looking at the graduate market—and realised that was not taking us any further forward. \nAt the same time we were having conversations with WORKing for YOUth, and our \nchief executive was looking at some of youth employment \nissues, \nand a num\nber of factors came together\n. We said\n, \n“Look, one, we need to tackle an issue we have \nabout \nthe type of talent we are bringing into the business, but we \nalso \nneed to do something more substantial about youth unemployment”\n,\n and that is where my role came into existence, which is essentially when we set up our own apprenticeship programme targeting young people who had been out of employment for over six months or who have limited or no qualifications.\n \nWhat we saw was \nthat \nhistorically the success of banking has been built on people coming in at 16 and working their way up to the top.\nThe Chairman: \nTo 66\n.\nMike Thompson: Yes, and working their way through and having great careers\n. A\n lot of our senior leaders in our business now started that way. When we took a step back a couple of years ago we worked out that \nthat \npathway was not there any\n \nmore. You could not come in at 16 and work your way up. You had to have a degree\n,\n and therefore we were closing the door to a huge number of young people. So we took a very different standpoint and opened our doors through the apprenticeship model to young people who were struggling to get into employment with qualifications or who had very limited qualifications or no qualifications. \nT\nhe breadth of talent \nthat \nwe have now brought in versus perhaps quite a narrow segment of the youth market when we looked at just graduates\n has been a real revelation for our business\n.\n \nThe programme has been running for 18 months now and we are starting to see those young people already progressing very rapidly into more senior roles and bringing the ideas\n,\n enthusiasm and talent that perhaps we were not seeing previously.\nThe Chairman: How many apprentices do you take on each year?\nMike Thompson: Last year we took on 1,000 young people.\nQ100 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Does anybody have any idea of how many \napprentices are taken on by all \ncompanies in the \nUK\n every year, because I did not realise it was anything like as big as our last series of witnesses suggested? For example, McDonald\n’\ns takes on 1,000 a year. Does anybody know?\nMike Thompson: I think there are roughly 500,000 apprenticeships in the \nUK\n. Having said that, how many of those are new jobs and new employees\n? They are \nprobably\n a much smaller number, \nbecause a lot of those are existing staff who are moving upwards.\nThe Chairman: Would you say that we are beginning to go the German way and believe that apprenticeships \nare \none way?\nMike Thompson: Yes. Over the last two years we have seen a huge uplift among many employees for that vocational pathway versus the traditional higher education recruitment drive.\nThe Chairman: Apprenticeships used to be very popular 50 years ago and then something happened\n. W\nhat happened?\nMike Thompson: I would say that more recently higher education happened.\nThe Chairman: Going for the 50%?\nMike Thompson: If you look \nat \n15 years ago\n,\n 25% of young people went to higher education\n. I\nt is now 60%.\nThe Chairman: Now we are aiming for 50%.\nMike Thompson: I think it is already higher, so that means \nthat \nthe population that you are drawin\ng upon is typically a graduate.\nDr Kyle: It might be worth stress\ning\n that \nthe extraordinary thing about \nthe 1,000 apprentices you are taking on at Barclays is \nthat \na high degree of them have no qualifications at all.\nThe Chairman: It is the best thing.\nDr Kyle: Yes. So these are getting to young people who—\nThe Chairman: That is good.\nDr Kyle: Exactly.\nQ101 &#xa0; \n \nBaroness Valentine: You have probably partly answered this\n,\n but to what extent do you see \nthe \nproblems with young people finding and keeping jobs being to do with the lack of suitable opportunities for them in the labour market, and to what extent is this due to their own skills or employability?\nMike Thompson: I think it is probably both. If you look at the opportunities for young people to gain work experience\n,\n it is much harder than it was a decade ago. If you look at the research that is being done, 10 years ago over 50% of young people were doing some form of Saturday job or some sort of work experience. I think that is now about 25%\n,\n simply because a lot of employers are not offering those sorts of opportunities any longer, so for somebody building up their employability skills it is much harder these days to find ways of doing that. \nThere is a\nlso the shape of the labour market\n. \nI think the previous panel members touched upon \nthe fact that \nour economy is \ndriven \nmuch more by small business\n growth than it is by corporate, \nso the number of opportunities in corporate is probably shrinking as technology and other factors come into the labour market. We are seeing a rapid growth in the SME market. The SMEs market\n,\n I think\n,\n find\ns\n it very difficult to connect with this group of young people\n; t\nhe mechanisms simply are not there. So for us it is relatively easy as big organisations to go out\n, find, \nattract and train, because we have the resources to do that. For a small business it is very difficult to go and find the right young talent, so they do not tend to. They tend to go to people who already have experience or who are recommended by friends and family.\nI think \nthe problem \nis a little bit on both sides. The young people struggle to get employability skills because they cannot get work experience\n,\n and the smaller employers struggle to connect with the youth labour market.\nBaroness Valentine: If you are taking people in at 16 with no qualifications, there must be some sort of pre-employability training. \nMike Thompson: Yes.\nBaroness Valentine: Could you give one of the youngsters coming in typically a task to do, which you would be confident they would finish if you gave them an instruction?\nMike Thompson: Yes.\nBaroness Valentine: When they arrive?\nMike Thompson: I \nwill \ndescribe how the programme works. We effectively work with a partner organisation to identify the young people and then assess where their skills are\n. S\nome we found are already ready and do not need any pre-employment training\n,\n and they go straight for interview because our view is \nthat \nyou want to get somebody into work as quickly as possible. That is what the young person wants\n and \nwhat the employer wants\n,\n and you want somebody to come off whatever benefit system they might be on and into paid employment.\n \nFor those \nwho \nare not ready\n,\n we run a four-week employability programme\n that \ncovers basic skills around workplace presentation, communication, team working\n—\nall kind of basic ingredients for an employee to be able to make a transition into a workplace. Also, come January next year, we are adding a two-week work experience placement, which will give them some real live work experience before they then go for an interview with one of our managers.\nOur goal is to try to give them the best opportunity possible, recognising that coming out of the education system\n,\n or in our case coming out of that population of people who ar\ne not in employment, education or\n training, they are going to need some extra support to get them ready for that job interview. We try to set them up for success and generally that is the case.\nQ102 &#xa0; \n \nBaroness Hooper: It is often said that one of the problems is that young people are now coming on the job market unable to read and do simple arithmetic. Given that some young people do not have any qualifications\n,\n do you also find many examples of complete failure of the education system?\nThe Chairman: \nThe Division Bell is ringing, and \nI think, Lady Hooper, \nthat \nwe are going to have to stop here. We will be 10 minutes, maximum. I am sorry about this. I should have warned you\n,\n but I did not think we were going to have it.\n&#xa0;\nSitting suspended for a Division in the House\n&#xa0;\nThe Chairman: Are we quorate\n,\n because I am told there is going to be another Division in short order\n on \nthe next amendment, so we have to try to get through this now.\nBaroness Hooper: I had just asked my question about the reading and writing, the basic skills.\nThe Chairman: \nWe\n could not hear you up here because of the horrible bell.\nBaroness Hooper: I am very sorry you could not hear\n,\n but the gist of my question was simply whether in the absence of qualifications this also meant that many \nwere coming \nforward who did not have the basic reading, writing and arithmetic that we hear so much about. \nMike Thompson: I would say \nthat \nabout 50% of young people \nwho \nwe see do not have an English or Maths A to C qualification. That said, we take the view that part of the reason why we take funding through an apprenticeship model is to help support those young people \nto attain\n that education through a vocational pathway. So during the 12 months of our apprenticeship programme\n,\n \nwe work with the \npeople who do not have A to C in Maths and English to get them to where they need to be. \nI think it is fair to say \nthat \nin the early days of the programme we do have some young people who struggle with the numeracy required to work in a bank, but we believe that with the right education through the apprenticeship route we can get them to where they need to be. The vast majority end up with an equivalent Maths and English qualification by the end of the 12 months.\nThe Chairman: Dr Kyle, you wanted to add to that.\nDr Kyle: It is worth just saying \nfirst \nthat the Government have just released an updated apprenticeship policy document in which they say \nthat \nthey intend to require anyone graduating with an apprentice to qualify with Maths and English by the end of it, so if you do not have the qualifications at the beginning, when you finish an apprenticeship \nyou \nhave to have qualified with Maths and English. But it is worth saying that employers tell us in no uncertain terms that it is the soft skills\n—the communicative skills, the social skills—\nthat they find most lacking by the time people leave school and come to them. \nB\neing able to operate \non a social level within a work\nplace \nis one of \nthe skills that they feel people are not prepared for to a large degree.\n \nT\nhere is usually a basis \nof academic skills \nto work upon\n,\n and then it is fairly straightforward\n \nto do quite straightforward training\n,\n but the lack of social skills and soft skills \nthat should be learnt in \neducation is a real problem. Some people do not know how to answer the phone when they come into a work place\n. It \nis not just restricted to people from deprived backgrounds. That is remarkably common and is spoken about with great passion by employers.\nThe Chairman: The real problem is \nthat \nthey do not communicate any longer because they communicate only with a screen playing games and things like this. It is a shame \nthat \npeople do not have any social skills \nor \nsay, “Good morning”\n,\n or they do not look you in the eye because they are used to looking at screens.\nDr Kyle: There are different norms of communication within a workplace\n,\n and for any young person \nwho \nh\nas not had experience of a work\nplace it is normal to have a period of adjustment, but \nsome \nhave no grounding wh\nat\never\n,\n and the fact \nis that \nin different institutions and different places there are different social norms that you have to be familiar with. It is a difficult transition for young people to make\n,\n but there is very little preparation for it.\nMike Thompson: One of \nmy \nconcerns is \nthat \nthere is a very poor perception of young people and their skills at the moment\n. W\nhile I agree that there are issues regarding their readiness for work, our experience has been that it does not take an awful lot to get them ready. I think there is a big stigma hanging over young people at the moment regarding their readiness.\nThe Chairman: Mr Swash, you wanted to come in.\nAdam Swash: I was going to answer the question \nabout \nthe suitable opportunities\n. O\nne of the things here is that there are quite a number of opportunities that young people could go to and \nthat \nwould be suitable employment for them. One of the things that we are seeing with perhaps the change in the labour market towards smaller companies is that companies are less willing to take a risk\n,\n and if they have the choice of a young person with no experience versus someone who has one or two years’ experience they are automatically defaulting to the person with the experience. I think they have two main worries here. One is that they have been told by the media that all young people are terrible louts and will run their business into the ground. The other is that they just do not believe they have the time to make them work. I think it is less about money\n and \nmore about their feeling \nthat they need to give \nthose young people \ntime to get them \ninto work.\nDr Kyle: There are a multiplicity of reasons why. It would be great if we could narrow it down to one or two reasons\n,\n \nsuch as it being \neither a lack of opportunities o\nr a lack of skills. The \ntruth is \nthat \nit is right across the board. I think broadly, at its highest level, we as a society have a very clear vision for young people’s pathway that includes university education. We do not have a strong vision for young people who have alternative routes into successful and gainful employment and a career, and I think that is something we have to get right.\nThe Chairman: This came out of the last session of witnesses\n,\n too.\nQ103 &#xa0; \nBaroness Valentine: \nI want \nto come back on this\n,\n because I am always confused about inner \nLondon\n, which is one of the target areas\n and has \nover 25% in unemployed presumably, yet there are so many jobs in inner \nLondon\n. \nPrêt à Manger\n is the one we use\n,\n but next door to it\n, the Japanese restaurant has advertised for \na waitress and a waiter for \nthe last six months. What is all that about?\nDr Kyle: Again, the evidence is that there \nare\n a lot of barriers that are not being tackled. \nA\n straightforward \nexample\n is transport\n, and j\nust travelling quite a small distance for interviews, for example. When I \nwas involved in \nthe Commission \non\n Youth Unemployment, we interviewed a great number of young people directly\n,\n and some of these were applying for more than a dozen jobs a week\n and \ngetting called for several interviews. The sheer expense of travelling for the interviews\n and \nto get the work was prohibitive.\nBaroness Valentine: Does that mean if you live in \nSomers\n \nTown\n out the back of Kings Cross, \nby which \nI mean presumably walking distance\n,\n there wi\nll be quite a lot of jobs there?\n Do those \ntwo things not connect up? W\nhat is going on?\nDr Kyle: As I say, there are a lot of barriers\n. We found that \ntransport was one of them, particularly for rural areas. It was a huge barrier for people living in small to medium-size\nd\n communities \nwho\n would have to travel.\n \nFor other young people, it is purely about having an established pathway into work\n,\n having entry level work explained and \nit \nbeing an understood pathway to a career. Many young people do not understand the pathway \nthat \nyou have to take, whether it is an apprenticeship, taking a job in \nPrêt\n or one of the other entry level\n,\n more retail\n,\n jobs and seeing them into a pathway to a better job. Careers pathways are simply not understood by young people in the way they would have been in the past for very understandable reasons, because we live in a much more complex landscape.\nBaroness Valentine: One follow-\nup \nquestion \nfrom that\n. \nBarclays, I know you are in \nCanary\n \nWharf\n, but obviously you have literally on your doorstep lots of unemployed people. Has some inroad been made to those pathways?\nMike Thompson: In our own programme we have targeted those areas\n,\n and I think one of the challenges is salary and pay. If you look at the apprenticeship minimum wage in \nLondon\n it is very difficult to live, to feed yourself and become economically independent\n on it\n.\nBaroness Valentine: Versus benefits?\nMike Thompson: Versus benefits, yes. When you look at some of the jobs that you refer to\n, the question is whether they are \na viable step to independence\n. That is v\nery unlikely. I think \nthat \none of the issues is \nthe \ngrey economy\n, very low-\npaid, transient jobs for young people\n that \nare not offering the career pathways. \nIn o\nur own programme we pay the living wage in \nLondon\n, but I would imagine \nthat \nwe are one of the few organisations that probably does\n,\n because we have the resources to be able to do that. That is a challenge in \nLondon\n in particular, and \nin \ninner cities, where the cost of living, \nthe \ncost of accommodation—\nThe Chairman: Of course you cannot say \nthat \nin 10 years’ time you can be manager of this, that and the other\n,\n because they do not believe it. They do not think they are capable because they do not have a lot of confidence. It is very difficult.\nMike Thompson: It is challenging\n, a\nlthough I would say \nthat \nMcDonald\n’\ns \nhas \ndone a very good job. \nIt has \nshown \nthat \nyou can do it\n: that y\nou can move into interim jobs and progress.\nQ104 &#xa0; \n \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: If we may return to Europe, \nI am \nlooking across at both companies \nthat \nhave experience\n that is not just in the \nUK\n, \nso maybe you can help us with \nthis question\n. What do you believe should be the main ways in which employers across \nEurope\n should be responding to the youth employment difficulties?\nMike Thompson: \nT\nhe theme for me is collaboration. I think \nthat \ncompanies need to recognise that they can do more than just their own programmes and their own employment. For instance, Barclays obviously \nhas \na very large supply chain and a very large customer base, so we have been looking and working very closely with those organisations to help \nthem to \nunderstand how they can benefit from the programmes that are available to them. For instance, if you look at small businesses, there is a very low level of understanding of what an apprenticeship is\n and \nwhat support is out there. They do not have the time to go and research it\n. C\nollaboration and working together, either at the corporate supply chain \nor with \ncustomers, is something the bigger corporates can do and is exemplified by the work that Adam and Peter have done, where they have brought together organisations to do that. \nAdam Swash: WORKing for YOUth has been focused \nprimarily \non the \nUK\n to start with. We have ambitions to go wider than that\n,\n but at the moment we are concentrating on the \nUK\n. \nO\nne of the things that strikes us is that each country has different sets of issues. Whereas in the \nUK\n we have seen \nthat \na reasonable number of jobs \nare \nbeing created and \nthat \nit is a case of working out how to join \nup \nthe jobs and the young people, there are certainly countries within \nEurope\n \nthat \ndo not even have the luxury of those jobs in the first place\n. With \na lot of these issues\n,\n national and international schemes can be put together\n,\n but a lot of the time you almost have to trickle them down and boil them down to local issues. But there will be things like companies’ engagement with education\n and \nthe public sector and joining \nup \nthose loops that will be practical and reasonable for all areas and countries to look at.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: Do you think employers should be doing more? I hear you talking \nparticularly \nabout the changed relationship now that we have fewer big companies in the way we had 30 or 40 years ago, and we have more asset means and there is a difficulty there, which perhaps no one has an easy answer to. Do you think you can assist there and \nthat \nmore assistance \nshould be \ngiven\n,\n and can \nG\novernment do anything more? Is it left to employers rather than \nG\novernment?\nMike Thompson: I think it is a collaboration between public and private sector, to be honest. Government has a lot of financial resources \navailable to it, \nand obviously the education system. I do think \nthat \nemployers need to find a way of rebuilding \nthe \nvery strong \nbridge that used to exist, which is much more fragile for a young person \nwho \nis not going into higher education. I think this is about where employers can work with the education system directly. In our case, just to \ngive \nyou an example, we finished a programme earlier this year called Barclays Life Skills\n,\n \nthrough which \nwe have made an offer to every school in the \nUK\n that we will help \nto \ndevelop the employability skills of their pupils from the age of 14 to 17 and provide them with work experience.\nThe Chairman: Did I hear correctly: every school in the \nUK\n?\nMike Thompson: Yes. It is a very huge ambition that we have taken on\n.\nThe Chairman: Indeed.\nMike Thompson: We have so far signed up 3,000 schools to the programme, which shows the demand that is coming from the education sector to plug a gap in the pupils’ skills that they do not believe they can plug. I think that is an example of where we are working with schools to help the young person over that bridge\n: g\nive them the skills they need so \nthat \nwhen they leave the education system they are not going to fall into that neat trap.\nDr Kyle: I spent most of my career in the voluntary sector campaigning for different areas of change and sometimes bashing the private sector for not living up to its responsibilities, but since doing this job and speaking to many different very large organisations and small ones, I have been absolutely struck by the scale of ambition within the private sector to tackle this\n,\n and the sincerity with which people such as Mike in Barclays and beyond are tackling this. \nThere is also, I think it is fair to say, some real surprise that \nG\novernment \nhas \nnot been more accepting of the scale of ambition within the private sector\n. C\nertainly there is some surprise that the Government \nhave \nnot challenged the private sector more on some of these issues, and they feel that there has been very little engagement in the past with the private sector to a large degree about tackling about this issue.\nGovernment has a role to facilitate and \nto \ndeliver training and some of the supply side challenges to youth unemployment\n,\n but you cannot create jobs sustainably into the long term without the private sector. I do see a scale of ambition\n, which we have just heard and \nwhich is quite remarkable in the private sector. Sometimes I wonder whether \nG\novernment realises the scale of ambition and \nthat \nsome of these organisations are just getting on with it at the moment.\nThe Chairman: \nThey d\no not want to be bothered with the red tape and all the other bureaucracy. Lord Liverpool, I was told you were looking for another question.\nEarl of Liverpool: That was the previous question.\nQ105 &#xa0; \n \nLord Clinton-Davis: The European Union has provided a programme called \nthe y\nouth \ng\nuarantee. The idea of that, as I understand it, is that young people who are devoid of work\n,\n training or studying can occupy a position within four months to enable them to enter the world of work. Do you think from the point of view of business \nthat \nthis is a good or bad idea?\nMike Thompson: Personally, I think it is a very good idea. We would love to see somebody guarantee a place or an opportunity from day one of leaving education\n,\n but clearly that is not practical. I think \nthat \nhelping somebody\n \nas soon as possible\n into a meaningful pathway to work, whether that be a training course that will ready them for work\n,\n an apprenticeship or a job, has to be the ambition for young people. We cannot have people \nsitting there and \nlet all the talent go to waste. I think there are some barriers and challenges to achieving that. Certainly in the \nUK\n,\n if you do not have Maths and English qualifications\n,\n \naccess to vocational training\n is a significant issue. I think \nthat \n40% of young people do not attain A to C Maths and English.\n T\nhe majority of intermediate or entry level apprenticeship that are advertised on a national apprenticeship website require Maths and English, so there is a huge group of young people \nto \nwhom one whole pathway of education is not available. To deliver on that promise, I think we need to address some of those underlying structural issues in the labour market, but as a principle, yes, \nI am \nvery supportive.\nAdam Swash: I think it is a good idea from a business perspective\n. T\nhey would love to see more young people with more experience. It is a way of making sure \nthat \nthey are ready for work and getting them into work. One of my cautions would be that imposing mandatory things for small businesses to take on young people would be an issue.\nThe Chairman: Too much cost.\nAdam Swash: I think we have to make it almost socially unacceptable for them not to and make them want to do it rather than imposing things on small and medium businesses.\nThe Chairman: Of course you do know that \nit has been\n said that if every SME in the 28 \nM\nember \nS\ntates employed one more person there would be no unemployment throughout the Union.\nAdam Swash: Can I just come back on that one? It is something that I hear quite often. At Experian we hold a lot of data on businesses and the size of businesses and how business grow and change. \nO\nver 50% of small businesses have no desire to grow. They employ one or two people. They are lifestyle businesses. \nOnly s\nomewhere between 5% and 10% of small businesses grow anything like rapidly, \nso \ntrying to say that all small businesses should take one new person is not going to happen\n,\n and I do not think it is helpful to the debate.\nThe Chairman: I am always bandying that one around because I have heard it from the Commissioner for Employment and so many times too in \nBrussels\n. If you have a definitive few paragraphs on that\n,\n could you send them to me?\nAdam Swash: Of course.\nThe Chairman: I think we have to be myth busting as well as making statements, and that one is definitely gaining legs.\nLord Clinton-Davis: What do you think is happening \non \nthis issue \nin \nthe UK Government and others?\nDr Kyle: To come back to your original point about whether a mandatory job guarantee is good\n, \nI would concur with the other two witnesses here \nthat it \nis a very good idea. What needs debating is whether it is four months, six months, a year. \nW\nhether or not it is a good idea is moot because there is evidence that the scarring impact that \na period of being unemployed\n has on a young person, particularly a young person under 24, is acute. A young person who is out of work and on benefits for more than a year will earn £2,000 or £3,000 less for the rest of their career than somebody who is of a similar socioeconomic background. They will have, by all likelihood, mental health challenges later on to a greater extent than their peers. They will experience relationship breakdowns to an extent that others do not. The question of whether there is a book end to which no young person should go beyond is unequivocal\n i\nn my mind\n. There \nneeds to be a cut-off point that triggers some intervention, and whatever the cost of that intervention it is value for money from an economic perspective but also from a social perspective.\nQ106 &#xa0; \n \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Lord Clinton-Davis was asking about the EU \ny\nouth \ng\nuarantee. What is your reaction to the \nUK\n programme that you contract? In addition to things you all mentioned already, \ndo \nyou think there are new things that should be done, different things that should be done, and \ndo \nyou have anything more to say about the idea of apprenticeships or work experience?\nMike Thompson: I am not sufficiently well\n \nversed on the youth contract. What I would say from a business perspective is \nthat\n the landscape is quite confusing in terms of the number of schemes\n and \ninitiatives, \nwhich are \nall very well\n meaning and \nall with the same intentions. \nI\nn reality\n,\n whether you are a large business or a small business\n,\n the world is a confusing place if you are trying to help a young person. \nOne of the things \nthat \nshould be done differently is to radically simplify the offering, both to the young person and to the business. I think the current \nA\ndministration \nare \ndoing a very good job with the recent introduction of traineeships, pre-employment training programmes and apprenticeships, and starting to build out some very simple, solid pathways. I would clear the decks of the different schemes and focus the effort on something that is very marketable to businesses and to young people\n,\n and more importantly to their parents\n,\n because a lot of advice for young people is given to parents. If parents do not understand the different schemes that are out there, and the benefits of them, they are not going to encourage their young people to go through them.\nIf I could just touch on something else \nthat \nI would love to see, \nit \nis \nthat \nwe should be bringing \nback some sort of mandatory \nwork experience to the school curriculum. \nT\nhe\n bridge that used to exist locally where\nby\n young people would get work experience and then build those connections, which would then allow them to get employment two or three years later, \nis \nvery broken at the moment. \nI\nf you were to reintroduce some sort of mandatory work experience at the age of 15\n or 16, \nyou \nwould begin to rebuild some of th\ne connections that have been lost.\nDr Kyle: Just briefly, I believe \nthat \nthe youth contract has under\nperformed. C\nertainly in the privat\ne sector they know it has under\nperformed. It was not a scheme that they felt would make a significant impact at the outset\n,\n and this was articulated back in the very beginning of the scheme in 2011\n. The \nlatest evaluations \nare\n \nthat \nonly 27% of young people \nwho \ngo through it\n go\n to full-time work afterwards.\n It is a scheme that has under\nperformed\n,\n and I believe \nthat \nthe problem was that it was underinvested in at the beginning. It only aimed to get 50,000 young people into work after its first year\n,\n when 250,000 young people were out of work at the time. \nR\necommendations \nwere \nfirmly put to \nG\novernment that \nit \nfrontload the scheme and find the money to upscale and make a big impact at the beginning. That would have got employers excited. It would have created a momentum that could have been carried forward into the proceeding years.\n \nIt is a scheme that has not captured \nthe \nimagination. It certainly has not delivered\n,\n and when you are communicating with the private sector, lack of delivery is something \nthat it is \nacutely aware of in \nits \nday\n \nto\n \nday world\n. It \ncertainly do\nes\n not tend to gravitate towards schemes that underdeliver from the outset.\nThe Chairman: What would you do with it? Would you just grab it and start something afresh?\nDr Kyle: Personally, I would use the money for a job guarantee. But the scheme is coming to an end now. \nI do not think that t\nhe youth contract will last into the long term. A job guarantee is what is needed at the moment\n, to\n my mind.\nQ107 &#xa0; \n \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: May I ask a terribly \nsimple\n question\n?\n Mike Thompson\n,\n when you say \n“a \nmultiplicity of schemes\n”\n, w\nhat would your advice \nbe \nto a young person just leaving school or to a young person’s parents \non \nwhere to look for what sort of schemes there might be?\nMike Thompson: There is a multiplicity of schemes. There is also \na \nmultiplicity of sources of advice. In fact there \nare\n probably even more sources of advice, which is terribly confusing for parents and terribly confusing for young people. Personally I would love to see some sort of UCAS clearing system, which works exceptionally well for higher education\n,\n for apprenticeships and traineeships. That would be my ideal if I had a magic wand and I could make a difference tomorrow\n: o\nne place where you could get good quality advice\n,\n where businesses or young people could go and could connect easily. At the minute that is not there. There is the National Career\ns\n Service, which is relatively young\n and \nwhich could morph and develop into that type of service, but I am not sure the \nG\novernment resources are there to fund that. I am with Peter in that I would probably redirect some of the resources that have been spent on \nthe \nyouth contract into giving a good solid advice service for young people and small businesses.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: But \nin \nsome of the successful countries in \nEurope\n one finds that the employers put more cash into it and it is not simply left to the public.\nThe Chairman: That was a question \nthat \nwe were going to ask\n: \ndo you think \nthat \nemployers in the \nUK\n can learn from the models in other countries? I am very conscious of the fact that we are going to have \na \njangling bell in our ears very shortly, so I was just wondering if you had ideas on the answer to that question\n. C\nould you give some thought to it and write to us?\nMike Thompson: Yes, of course.\nThe Chairman: That would be very u\nseful. I am sorry but \nwe are up against\n,\n and you have been very unfortunate because we have not \nbeen disturbed by the Division B\nell for several months now. Your UCAS idea\n: \ndoes such a thing exist in other countries?\nDr Kyle: Not that I know of.\nMike Thompson: I think \nthat \nthe system starts a lot earlier in connecting the young person/employer in \nSwitzerland\n and \nGermany\n from the age of 14. The UCAS system is probably a bit redundant\n, because locally, \nregionally and nationally there is much more integration of education and employment, and the vocational path is much stronger. I think we a\nre starting to see it in the \nUK\n, \nbut I do not think \nan \nequivalent exists that I am aware of.\nQ108 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Also, \nas \nan observation, we have not discussed this as a Committee before, but I was just talking\n \nto \nmy\n friends about issues \nsuch as \nthis and unemployment\n, as one does, \nand particularly about mess-ups and IT projects and \nwhether \nanybody \nis \ncomputer literate. We all know how to switch them on, we know how to do Microsoft Word, we know a few more things, but somebody\n who employs\n \na group of about 50\n very high-\nlevel people in the City \nand who \nhas done the appraisal system\n, asked\n them\n, “\nHave you any idea of where you would like your competencies enhanced? In other words, is there any\n course or whatever that\n you would like us to send you\n on\n?”\n.\n Of the 50 people, 45 of them suggested an increase in the knowledge of IT skills. These are people who are so IT aware\n,\n one would have thought, but the problem is \nthat \ntechnology is going ahead of everybody. \nMy question comes\n back to this\n. These young people \nare so computer literate and can program everything for you, \nso \nwhy is somebody somewhere—nobody ever brings this up\n—not \ncoming up with a fantastic idea to get some of these people\n,\n who know all about playing games and things, on courses\n?\n W\nould it not be some great philanthropy for these large organisations to say, “We will produce IT experts or teachers or make courses in a local area for IT”\n?\n Any ideas?\nMike Thompson: I would suggest it is not philanthropy\n; i\nt is a business necessity.\nThe Chairman: It is.\nMike Thompson: If you want to compete in the modern global economy you have people in your business who can work with digital technologies. I think \nthat \nmore and more\n of our apprenticeships\n—100 of our 1,000\n—\nare \nin \nIT. \nThe Chairman: What are your views?\nDr Kyle: I think I would alter some of the characterisation of the problem. It is very difficult to find young people who sit around playing computer games as opposed to quite actively trying to find work. We spend a lot of time trying to understand this view of youth unemployment. We ran focus groups and consultations \nin the past \nand \nfound \nenormous\n amounts \nof very idealistic, energetic and frustrated energy among young people with lots of talent that they feel is being ignored and underused, which causes frustration.\nOn \nthe IT side of things\n,\n obviously young people have inherited skills that previous generations would not have but they are not being harnessed in the right way and focused, which \ngoes \nto my final point about this pathway. We are not intervening early enough. We are not joining up the different agencies\n enough\n. One of the key problems with youth unemployment is that it is not the domain of one departmental o\nversight; it is E\nducation, it is DWP, it is \nH\nealth.\nThe Chairman: Yes, we heard that before.\nDr Kyle: It crosses\n departments\n, and there is a lot of local government, so you will find some areas of the country that have 15, 18\n separate agencies\n—we found one that had 24 separate agencies in one geographical area\n—\nall of whom receiving some degree of statutory funding to tackle different aspects of youth unemployment. If I had my way I would pool the budget of youth unemployment and force every agency to come together and work together to tackle the problem. They would identify individual young people who are unemployed\n,\n and then different agencies would have to come together \nto \nco-ordinate the response and have ownership of those individuals. We have a very disjointed response because it ha\ns just crept across departments\n. If youth unemployment was a different issue—we have 1 million young people who are unemployed\n—and \nthe young \nunemployed\n \nwere visible\n,\n I think there would be a very co-ordinated, very public response to the problem. Youth unemployment is hidden because it is buried deep within neighbourhoods\n,\n families and homes. I think that makes it quite difficult for people to imagine the solutions for it.\nThe Chairman: We have had that comment before too, which is very scary because you do not know where to find them. Thank you very much. You \nhad \none minute to go. Are there big gaps in the questions that we asked you that you wish that we had asked you, and if so could you write to us about them and tell us? I will not say \nthat we are \noperating in the dark, not at all\n, but \nit has been a very steep learning curve\n,\n \nand \nwe want to make this a good report, and we want to make a difference \nto \nyouth unemployment. So \nwe would be delighted to have further evidence from you on \nanything that you can think \nof\n. \nI\nn the meantime, thank you very much indeed.\nDr Kyle: Thank you.\n&#xa0;\n"
