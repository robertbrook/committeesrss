[[[ (WSC0102)]]]&#xa0;Additional information about the Open University&#xa0;Although scientific research in academia can require long hours, there are opportunities to introduce the&#xa0;flexibility&#xa0;to do the work at different times and from different locations. It is important to let go of assumptions about where work gets done and how it is done.&#xa0;The OU has a strong track record in flexible working and remote working using technologies because of our distributed structure. Academic staff based in our 13 regional and national centres can regularly join meetings and collaborate on both teaching and research via our internal video and audio conferencing systems. All meetings at our Milton Keynes campus are held within core hours to allow for travel which has the additional benefit for those who need flexibility for caring commitments. Our&#xa0;Open Science Laboratory&#xa0;is at the forefront of developing new research methods and pedagogies for conducting experiments at a distance.&#xa0;Between 2005 and 2011 the Open University ran a programme for women returning to STEM careers after a career break, in which over 1000 women STEM graduates participated. As well as 100 hours of online learning, the women, who had previously worked in a range of STEM professions both in academia and industry, were able to interact in online forums, and meet each other at local networking events.Â  A recent evaluation showed over 70% of women had returned to employment in STEM five years after taking part in the programme. This was an externally funded project and we would recommend further funding to support such initiatives in future.&#xa0;The Open University hosts, edits and publishes the International Journal of Gender Science and Technology. This was originally set up in 2009 and funded via the UK Resource Centre for Women in SET and since the funding ended in 2011 has continued to be supported by The Open University in recognition of the important role this journal plays in bridging the boundaries between policy, practice and research. As an open access free online journal we are able to disseminate robust peer reviewed international research to a wide community of stakeholders to help inform developments in this area.&#xa0;Recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
