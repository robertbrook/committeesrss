[[[About UNISON]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UNISON is the UK’s largest public services union representing over 1.1 million workers in local government, health, education, police and justice and the voluntary and community sector delivering public services. UNISON members work directly for contracting public authorities and for private, community and voluntary sector service providers. &#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have extensive experience of dealing with commissioning and procurement policy and practices in sub central government public services and a good grasp of the current impacts and direction of travel of the governments public service reform programme. This is based on our UK regional and local branches dealing with the contracting out of public services to external providers and including more recently spin offs into social enterprises and mutual’s and co-operatives. &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have a long track record of championing high quality, accountable public services for local citizens. We therefore welcome the opportunity to respond to this inquiry.&#xa0;

[[[Focus ]]]

[[[of UNISON]]]

[[[ Response]]]&#xa0;UNISON believes that more regulation in procurement and strengthening accountability is paramount before the government opens public services further. We have set out our reasons and evidence and recommendations in Appendix 1.

[[[Procurement ]]]

[[[issues]]]

[[[ in local government]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UNISON has submitted to Communities and Local Government Select Committee Inquiry: local government procurement (September 2013) a set of examples demonstrating and evidencing its concerns about councils failing to comply and/or circumventing procurement regulations. (See Appendix 1). &#xa0;

[[[Transparency]]]

[[[, ]]]

[[[Council governance, scrutiny and democratic accountability]]]&#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The introduction of Elected Mayors, Cabinet and Leader models and the delegation of decision making now also mean that these decisions are often made by a single councillor or a small handful of councillors and cabinets.&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Often, the scrutiny function is either too weak, too under resourced, undermined by cabinet pressure or provided with insufficient information to adequately ensure that these major procurement decisions are properly examined. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Weakness of external audit]]]&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UNISON is concerned that external audit of council procurement decisions and expenditure is weak and that there is an absence of effective mechanisms to review external audit inadequacies. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Audit Commission is being disbanded and external audit for councils in England now rests in the hands of ‘self-regulating’ accountancy firms – many of the same firms which have been criticised by the Public Accounts Committee for their activities in helping corporate clients dodge taxes.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Value for money - Major contract failure and procurement models that create additional risk]]]&#xa0;9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recent trends in public sector procurement place reliance on bidders to work out the detail of service design and delivery and calculate the costs – variously referred to as ‘outcomes-based commissioning’, ‘enabling’, ‘thin client’, ‘intelligent client’ and ‘light client’.  Andy Mudd from the Association of Public Service Excellence (APSE) has highlighted how the risks and complexity of working out the necessary ‘inputs’ are increasingly being left to the bidders.  &#xa0;10. Recent examples West Coast Main Line (Department for Transport), G4S (LOCOG) and allegations of fraud by the Ministry of Justice against SERCO and G4S cast serious doubt on the likelihood that this form of commissioning can deliver best value or transfer risk. &#xa0;

[[[Power imbalance]]]&#xa0;11.  UNISON is concerned about the number of instances where the balance of power within complex arrangements is inappropriately weighted towards the private sector and against the public interest. This is largely due to the loss of in-house capacity, the development of ‘company towns’ (where the local economy becomes excessively reliant on the contractor’s presence), and the threat of legal action by contractors. See example of Liverpool and Southwest One examples in Appendix 1. 

[[[Value for money through in]]]

[[[ – ]]]

[[[sourcing]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]12. The increases in contract failings have led a growing number of local authorities to take the decision to bring privatised services back in-house.&#xa0;13. A study for UNISON carried out by APSE found that out of 140 survey respondents, 57% had either brought a service back in-house, were in the process of insourcing or were considering doing so. A need to improve efficiency and reduce service costs was the most frequent key reason for insourcing with almost 60% of respondents citing it. After cost, 44% of respondents said a need to improve service quality was critical to the decision to insource. The research found that councils of all sizes, locations and political complexions were represented among those deciding to insource. Insourcing was regarded as a means of delivering efficiency savings in the face of mounting budgetary pressure. 

[[[Cut-price procurement and the effect on quality: the damage in social care ]]]&#xa0;14. It is clear that in some areas of local authority expenditure the twin pressures of rising demand for services and funding cuts have created a drive by councils to secure cost-cutting at the expense of service quality. Nowhere is this more prominent than in social care. UNISON has been at the forefront of campaigning to highlight the alarming decline in the quality of care that users receive.&#xa0;15. UNISON research based on FoI data from councils in England, Wales and Scotland found that 81% of councils commission from homecare providers where they do not guarantee providers specific hours from one week to the next. This enables councils to drive down the costs they incur as a result of fluctuations in care need. But it fuels the use of zero hours contracts for homecare workers. As the Minister for Care Norman Lamb has stated: “The idea of a zero hours contract is in most circumstances completely incompatible with a model of high quality care in which the individual really gets to know their care worker.”&#xa0;16. The consequences of this cut-price approach by councils in the homecare sector were encapsulated in the recent Government-commissioned Cavendish Review which stated that:&#xa0;“It will not be possible to build a sustainable, caring, integrated health and social care system on the backs of domiciliary care workers who have to travel long distances on zero hours contracts, to reach people who have to see multiple different faces each week... The advent of zero hours contracts, fee cuts and no payment for travel time is making it financially prohibitive for some domiciliary care workers to struggle on. Attrition rates are already dangerously high: and they will only increase when carers feel that they can no longer even give good care.”&#xa0;17. A growing number of councils are recognising that the quality and reliability of privatised homecare has become unacceptable. These developments in homecare have led UNISON to establish our Time to Care campaign which asks councils to sign up to an ‘ethical care charter’ to commission homecare in line with a core set of baseline standards including non-use of 15-minute visits, ensuring payment of travel time, non-use of zero hours contracts and proper training and support for staff to raise concerns about care standards. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Procurement from the community and voluntary sector]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]18. UNISON represents more than 60,000 members working in the community and voluntary sector – a large proportion of whom work in services commissioned by local government.&#xa0;19. UNISON is seeing a rise in consortia bidding for contracts instead of just individual charities. However, these are large and expensive exercises to engage in, and often a large private contractor will be the principle bidder while work flowing to the charities will be sub-contracted.&#xa0; This has led to the phenomenon of the profitable work being creamed off by the contractor and charities left to deliver  services at bargain basement prices, which are sometimes loss making.&#xa0; It also means charities having to squeeze down even further on the pay and terms and conditions of staff, and increasingly using zero-hour contracts.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[UNISON recommendations on ]]]

[[[local government ]]]

[[[procurement]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]20. To address the current concerns around procurement practices UNISON has submitted a set of recommendations to the CLG select committee which we would also like the PASC to consider as part of this inquiry in to the governments public service reform programme. See section 2 in Appendix &#xa0;

[[[UK transposition of the ]]]

[[[EU Procurement D]]]

[[[irective and reserved contracts for ]]]

[[[mutuals]]]21. UNISON has concerns over some provisions in the forthcoming EU procurement directive which we would like the committee to consider as part of the ongoing inquiry into open public services. These are set out in section 3 Appendix 1 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q2: Does opening up the public services to alternative providers improve customer choice, ]]]

[[[diversity in local ]]]

[[[services and accountability?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[NHS]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]22. UNISON remains concerned that the choice agenda has been too narrowly focused and too easily equates patients with consumers.&#xa0;23. There is a distinction to be made between real choice and the artificial creation of markets in the health service. When it comes to areas such as maternity or end of life, there is a real choice between different clinical or lifestyle approaches. In other areas, the move to an Any Qualified Provider system of service provision is more about creating a market with opportunities for new entrants from outside the NHS, with no evidence that this form of provider plurality increases the quality of care or patient experience, or that patients want it. &#xa0;24. David Boyle’s “Barriers to Choice Review” produced for the government is very instructive in this regards. He found that public support for choice of hospitals is ambiguous and that proximity to home remains the most important factor for patients when choosing which hospital to have their treatment in. Boyle has rightly noted that choice has been too closely tied with competition and the concept of “contestability”, which has led to the debate over choice being dominated by ideology rather than what is actually best for patients, parents or service users. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Decentralisation]]]

[[[ and diversity]]]&#xa0;25. Whilst the restructuring of the NHS appears to be based on decentralisation with commissioning with clinical commissioning groups now taking the lead, NHS England (the new commissioning board) still wields the most power, both over the CCGs and more generally within the NHS. Thus power in Whitehall, in actual fact remains based on a centralised top-down approach and forcing CCGs to put a number of their services out to Any Qualified Provider, when we know that most CCGs would much rather avoid this route. &#xa0;26. UNISON has already demonstrated in numerous submissions with the Health and Social Care Act (2012) that opening up public services does not necessarily improve the options for service users. For example, the development of private sector monopolies (or oligopolies) where services have been and are being privatised is likely to encourage players within the market to merge, leaving a few big non-public sector providers where previously there were a few big public sector providers. The NHS the Competition Commission recently chastised the private hospitals sector on similar grounds&#xa0;&#xa0;27. UNISON is concerned that the recent reforms to marketise the NHS and the failure to fund the service adequately has led to the rationing of services becoming increasingly prevalent. This has meant that many patients are now faced with the option of paying to go private or having their care limited / compromised. Evidence of this is referenced at the footnote &#xa0;28. UNISON believes that the accountability in health services with the new structures in commissioning has effectively removed the ultimate responsibility for the NHS from the (democratically elected) Secretary of State and handed it to the NHS commissioning board, an unelected super-quango. The attempt to remedy the lack of local democracy in the NHS through Health and Wellbeing Boards, although a good idea is insufficiently strong to do this: HWBs lack the power to veto commissioning decisions, and they need have only one elected councillor among their number.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q3.]]]

[[[ How can risks be reduced in ]]]

[[[Open access to public services under alternative forms of ownership]]]

[[[?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]29. UNISON has concerns that currently in the drive to open up public services and ensure open access and minimise risks of alternative forms of ownership, provision and accountability, basic statutory duties are not being fulfilled therefore diminishing the empowerment of stakeholders and citizens and service users. We give the examples of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) and Ministry of Justice Probation Reforms

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Police and Crime Commissioners]]]

[[[ (PCCs)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]30.  PCCs  are under a new statutory obligation to publish a wide range of information to their electorates. The relevant statutory instrument is: The Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information) (Amendment Order) 2012 &#xa0;31. In relation to opening up privatised police services to scrutiny, the Order promised that PCCs would have to publish:&#xa0;32. The Order requires that all the above information to be published as soon as practicable after it becomes available to the PCC.PCCs were elected in November 2012 and 10 months later UNISON can find no evidence that any of the above information has been published by PCCs. &#xa0;33. G4S currently operates one of the biggest privatised police contracts in the UK for Lincolnshire Police. In April of 2013, the company and the Lincolnshire PCC published a glossy report which made a number of claims regarding the performance of the contract. Unfortunately, in the absence of the information required to be published under the above statutory order, neither Lincolnshire voters, nor other interested parties can scrutinise the company’s claims. &#xa0;34. UNISON asks what the Government is doing to make its requirement on PCCs to publish commercial contracts, work in practice as part of its public service reform programme empowering the citizen and service users?

[[[Ministry of Justice Probation Reforms]]]35. Under the Ministry of Justice ‘Transforming Rehabilitation’ proposals, local probation services will be removed in their entirety from any potential for open access or accountability. 20 years ago, Probation was run as a local service by committees of the upper tier local authority, with local councillors on their boards and 20% or so of funding coming directly from the local authority. Local magistrates also sat on the committee. &#xa0;36. Since that time, successive governments have stripped out this local representation and funding,  and when Probation Trusts were created in 2007 all vestiges of local authority representation were finally removed. &#xa0;37. In 2013, the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced radical reforms of the Probation Service to abolish the 35 local Probation Trusts, replacing them with 21 government companies, which are to be sold to the private sector in October 2014. Not only will the reduction in local entities from 35 to 21 destroy the co-terminosity of Probation areas with police force boundaries, but the handing of probation services to the private sector by the Secretary of State as the single commissioner and client removes at a stroke any pretence at localism or accountability for the Probation Service.&#xa0;38.  The creation of these new 21 private entities to run probation services undermines the public and citizens access to how their local police and justice services should be run. It undermines the ability of the elected Police and Crime Commissioners to be accountable in their public role to be able to influence locally the commissioning of police and local justice probation services.&#xa0;39.  Although UNISON notes that the Justice Secretary has agreed to create a board to allow PCCs to influence the commissioning process it is not clear how much commissioning decision making  power the board will have in the in the contract award of the 21 private companies.&#xa0;40. UNISON has no evidence that these new structures will re-introduce any localism, open access for grass roots communities to influence local probation services through their elected PCC or provide sound accountability into the process of how the 21 private companies will operate public probation services, particularly as the Secretary of State remains sole commissioner. 

[[[Q4]]]

[[[: How can public services through co-ordinated local provision provide better value for money and local accountability?                                                                                       ]]]

[[[Further ]]]

[[[Education services]]]

[[[ and academies]]]

[[[ ]]]41. UNISON fears that the academy programme is drawing schools nearer to the FE college model driven by financial imperatives and working in a service provision framework with lack of accountability or participation in a co-ordinated service to education and the community. An academy is contracted directly to government with little responsibility as a publicly-funded local educational establishment; a parent with complaints has little opportunity for redress. Without ties to the locally-elected authority, accountability is limited and citizen empowerment and democracy short-changed.&#xa0;42. UNISON has continued to express concern about the impact of multi-organisational provision and multi-level governance and the difficulty in maintaining coherent and cost-effective services that reflect the needs and desires of the community and offer high quality services. &#xa0;43. This is well demonstrated in Further education services, which have not to date been run for profit beyond the independent sector, but have been subjected to a stream of structural and institutional change since the late 1980s. &#xa0;44. UNISON believes that this constant change of structures and funding and governance mechanisms are costly in terms of redundancy payments and rebranding. Organisations become ineffective as they have little time to embed good practice and develop a sustainable professional ethos or body of knowledge and expertise that can provide assistance locally to empower local communities. &#xa0;45. Funding for 16-19 year olds should be transferred to local authorities and a local accountable education body should work to ensure that educational provision is coherently and strategically planned. In particular this is needed to work jointly with academies and free schools so that any widening of public educational provision and choices are accountable, efficient and accessible choices can be made by parents and young people.&#xa0;46. The Price Waterhouse Cooper Academies 5th Annual report (2012) concludes that “there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive judgement about the Academies as a model for school improvement”. &#xa0;47. UNISON would like to see the government address some of the recommendations set out in the report which would improve open access and accountability to parents and citizens in local communities about academy provision. In particular the report highlights:&#xa0;48. Academies have resulted in the diminution of the role of the Local Authority (LA) in relation to school accountability, challenge and support, since they are technically and legally outside their jurisdiction. UNISON would like to see the role of LAs re-instated so that school accountability of academies is accessible to the community and citizens;&#xa0;49. Continuing to involve and engage parents (in particular), the local community of schools      and the wider community in the life of the Academy continues to be a significantchallenge. UNISON would like to see as a step in the right direction improved        management transparency and engagement with unions and staff on good practice terms and conditions for all staff, local engagement with parents and the wider community and neighbouring schools to assist in removing the persistent disapproval of Academies as a provider of educational services.
