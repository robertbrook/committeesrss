&#xa0;&#xa0;Call for Evidence on EU action to tackle youth unemployment 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;1.1 Prospects is a leading education, employment and training services company, working nationally and internationally. We estimate we help more than one million people each year, through a range of high quality services.  We are one of the first and largest new public sector mutuals, with shares owned by managers and staff.&#xa0;1.2 Our services include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.3 We are recognised for our expertise in event management, recruitment, community regeneration and educational resources. Gabbitas, the independent education consultancy, is part of the Prospects Group.&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1 This paper from Prospects is in response to The Select Committee’s call for evidence on EU action to tackle youth unemployment.  We are pleased to contribute evidence to inform the Committee as it influences the development of policy in this critical area.  &#xa0;2.2 The problem of youth unemployment is complex. While there is a “conveyor belt” of established support for those heading towards university education, there is no similar mechanism for half of the population who can’t or don’t wish to progress to higher education.  It is also worth noting that the difficulties young people face in the labour market don’t disappear as soon as they start work.  Many young people find themselves locked into insecure or precarious employment, suffering low wages, zero hour contracts, and poor terms and conditions.  Many find themselves working without real opportunity to develop and progress in their careers.  &#xa0;2.3 Youth unemployment rates across Europe remain worryingly high and we believe that measures can and should be implemented to ensure more effective approaches are put in place to achieve faster reductions in youth unemployment levels.  We hope that this contribution is of value and would be happy to answer further questions or present in person to provide more detail on any aspect that is of particular interest to the Select Committee.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs? ]]]&#xa0;3.1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We agree that the EU should be funding Member States to tackle youth unemployment and providing leadership to members. We believe it does respect each Member State’s powers.&#xa0;3.1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; EU funding needs to be better targeted so it better meets the needs of regions and individual Local authority areas. Ironically in some parts of London, there are too many different funding streams. These essentially target the same groups with similar initiatives, approaches and support mechanisms.  For example Youth Contract, Education Funding Agency, local authority targeted support contracts, Greater London Authority programmes for young offenders and those with learning difficulties and disabilities as well as Fast Forward ESF.  Meanwhile, NEET who have qualifications are rarely supported through any of these funding streams. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]]&#xa0; 

[[[How do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment? ]]]&#xa0;3.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Added value arises where it is permitted that EU resources can be spent flexibly to compliment rather than duplicate a Member State’s spending in this area. The EU can provide leadership, and facilitate the sharing of good practice.&#xa0;3.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; EU funding should focus on high impact, innovative programmes. In our experience initiatives can connect and strengthen local partnerships to create cohesive programmes. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3.3]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Is there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as being not in education, employment or training (‘NEETs’), support for newly qualified graduates looking for work, and general career guidance? ]]]&#xa0;3.3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It does seem that disaggregation falls to Member States rather than the EU.  Government agencies such as the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) are making decisions on the target groups and format of projects tendered. We trust such decisions are being based upon objective evidence. Whilst the NEET group is well recognised and defined the graduate group is less visible within EU measures and has not been targeted to the same extent by EU initiatives.&#xa0;3.3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would like to see funding targeted at:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Are the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not? Are there ways in which they could be improved?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is quite right and proper that projects delivered using European public funds should be fully and properly monitored and evaluated. We would argue that existing procedures are stringent and sufficient. &#xa0;3.4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; EU monitoring, evaluation procedures and funding tend to focus on eligibility and the minutiae; the paper evidence can on times stifle innovation and taking risks, with people focusing funding on young people who are eligible but often easier to help and for whom there will be a full suite of EU paperwork. This skews the evaluation of the effectiveness of the funding. &#xa0;&#xa0;3.4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Undoubtedly some projects are more successful than others and it is important that learning which results from evaluation should be widely shared among those delivering similar work in the EU. We would point out though that the procurement practices of some government agencies can inadvertently jeopardise the success of projects.  For example SFA ESF NEET projects should have started delivery on 3rd September this year but have effectively lost at least two months delivery time because the proposed preliminary meeting in London could not be held until 11th November.  We would welcome greater efficiency in EU procurement processes.&#xa0;

[[[How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the European Social Fund (ESF) could best be spent? ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]There are many challenges for those delivering projects funded by European initiatives. It is critical that there is sufficient flexibility in how EU funding can be spent particularly the YEI and ESF.  As the Select Committee identifies there are widely varying rates of youth unemployment, social and economic conditions across Member States. It must be Member State governments and their agencies which ultimately determine the priorities in their own countries to maximise employability and progression &#xa0;3.5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In principle we support the EU recommendation that each Member State launch a “Youth Guarantee”.  There is however great complexity around how such a guarantee might be funded, with different rules and eligibilities applying to different age groups.  For example younger apprentices find their training funded in full, while those over 18 only attract 50% funding.  Those claiming Job Seekers Allowance who are 18 and NEET can get access to the support of the Work Programme within 3 months, while most others aged 18-24 wait 9 months for access.&#xa0;3.5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  While employers have an important part to play in providing access to employment and training opportunities, moves to shift the cost of apprenticeship provision from government to business may have a detrimental effect on the quantity and availability of opportunities, and on the outcomes for apprentices.&#xa0;3.5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the least sensible aspects of funding initiatives is that when projects are completed there is no flexibility to apply for further funding to continue with new beneficiaries, even if the obligatory monitoring and evaluation has clearly provided strong evidence that initiatives are working.  A further lengthy and bureaucratic procurement process starts all over again. We are aware of examples outside our organisation where this has led to strong successful projects being terminated. If the EU genuinely wants to increase the pace with which youth employment is stimulated, then this is one immediate aspect which could be improved to increase the impact of projects.&#xa0;3.5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We can provide numerous examples of targeted projects which demonstrate how European funding can be effectively applied to effect positive change by tackling local priorities.  In London our Go4It project targets two groups of young people particularly vulnerable to becoming NEET – care leavers and young parents.  Our Square Mile Jobs initiative works with people in the fringe boroughs bordering the City of London, helping them access the seemingly hard to access job market within the square mile.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Do you feel that young people (aged 15-24), youth groups and their representatives are involved and consulted to a satisfactory degree in the decisions being made around EU funding for youth unemployment projects, and how they are administered?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe there is room for greater and more effective consultation.  There is always the danger that consulting young people becomes somewhat tokenistic.  There needs to be a clear demonstration that initiatives, strategies and priorities take into account the views and suggestions of the young people they aim to support.&#xa0;3.6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In our own projects with those aged 15-24 we ensure regular and active participation by young beneficiaries in evaluation, taking into account suggestions made to improve our practice and develop services to be more responsive and more effective. &#xa0;

[[[3.7]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Should the EU and Member States take into account the positive and negative socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment? How might any negative consequences be mitigated? ]]]&#xa0;3.7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We agree that there can be both positive and negative consequences to unemployment related youth migration within the EU.  There is potentially the danger of a talent drain from those countries unable to sustain adequate levels of youth employment. States attracting greater migration may also experience increased competition for jobs between migrants and nationals.  In determining how funds are disaggregated Member States should target initiatives which can help to stabilise employment in shortage sectors and increase opportunities for within the country to reduce the level of economic migration. &#xa0;3.7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; More importantly however it needs to be recognised that young people are more disadvantaged in the labour market because they are in competition for the same jobs with older workers with experience. This is why opportunities to gain experience in the workplace are so important. &#xa0;3.7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; London receives a disproportionately high number of migrant workers and this should be reflected in the targeting of initiatives and allocation of funds. &#xa0;

[[[How can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to combat youth unemployment? ]]]&#xa0;3.8.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The EU and Member States should encourage and foster innovation, whether that is technology based or not.  It is up to those suppliers competing for funding to determine methods appropriate to the needs and focus of any project.  While innovation is important it is also the case that much good and effective practice does already exist and can be continued or replicated, with appropriate support disseminating the results of evaluation and increasing the flexibility to extend funding for projects which are proven to work. &#xa0;3.8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We do believe technology has a place in projects to the 15-24 year old age group.  We have developed a mobile phone app called “Ask Ella” to support NEET young people in East London secure college and apprenticeship opportunities.  We also use social media to reach out and provide services to harder to reach young people, who might not otherwise be able to access our physical facilities.  &#xa0;3.8.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Digital literacy rates in the UK show that one in five people lack the skills they need to access the job market electronically. There is also a core of young people who cannot afford access to smartphone technology and don’t have easy access to the internet.  At a time when more and more opportunities are being promoted using technology, this creates a significant disadvantage to some groups.  There is room for EU and Member State initiatives which tackle digital literacy head on to improve access to education, employment and training opportunities.&#xa0;3.8.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The EU needs to embed the use of technology in its contract management. Evidence requirements are burdensome and costly for providers; audits are onerous and whilst recognising the need to protect the public purse, there should and can be efficiencies.&#xa0;&#xa0;21 October 2013&#xa0;
