[[[About the Society for General ]]]

[[[Microbiology]]]The Society for General Microbiology (SGM) is a membership organisation for scientists who work in all areas of microbiology. It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe with a worldwide membership based in universities, industry, hospitals, research institutes and schools. The SGM publishes key academic journals in microbiology and virology, organises international scientific conferences and provides an international forum for communication among microbiologists and supports their professional development. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, through a comprehensive framework of communication activities and resources. Further information about SGM is provided in Appendix 1.&#xa0;

The Google Map on the left gives a snapshot of where microbiology research occurs (red is for universities, green for public sector research establishments, and blue for companies). The map is best viewed online.&#xa0;Universities strong in microbiology are distributed throughout the country (see section 4.2). Looking at the private sector, firms conducting microbiology R&amp;D are also found throughout the UK: some are associated with former ICI or Big Pharma sites, such as Billingham in County Durham or Alderley Edge in Cheshire; others co-locate with universities; others still locate in science parks, or strike out on their own.&#xa0;In July, the Sheffield-based vaccine discovery start-up Absynth received £850k funding from Fusion IP, The North West Fund (European Union-backed), and the Technology Strategy Board. In the chemicals and fuels sector, large enterprises with microbiology activities are based in Teesside; and microbiology-based small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Oxford, Guildford, Hertfordshire, Edinburgh, inter alia.  Increasingly, traditional chemical companies (e.g., INEOS at Grangemouth) are becoming interested in the applications of Synthetic Biology to create “microbiological factories” (see section 4.4).&#xa0;There is a real possibility of growing significant research, development, and production processes across the country, with clear translation of benefits to the economy, environment, and public health.&#xa0;

Genomics, the metagenome, the microbiome, microbial ecology, synthetic biology, industrial biocatalysis, fermentation technology, biochemical engineering and new developments in bioinformatics, all imply a range of opportunities that have emerged from microbiological research in universities, or are having significant impacts upon the productivity and inventiveness of university research. These present opportunities to tackle wider problems such as climate change, biofuels and chemicals, food and water security, infectious disease, and antibiotic resistance.&#xa0;The universities have particular strengths for effective R&amp;D, notably:&#xa0;

[[[4.3.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Emerging opportunities to fight infectious diseaseMicrobiology research concerned with ‘anti-infectives’ technology (to detect, prevent, and treat infectious disease) is an emerging source of private sector innovation. There are critical developments across three areas, namely (1) antimicrobial drugs aimed at bacterial and fungal infections (particularly vital due to the rise of antibiotic resistance in bacteria); (2) diagnostic devices; and (3) vaccines. Collectively, these measures have the potential to solve infectious diseases, such as those in the globally-important aged care sector (e.g., hospital-acquired infections), and also represent significant opportunities in the global healthcare market.&#xa0;The Chief Medical Officer has drawn attention to the problem of antibiotic resistance. We welcome wider government moves on this topic, such as recent investments made by the Technology Strategy Board (via the Biomedical Catalyst), and the Ministry of Defence. There is significant potential in an emerging commercial sector: our own survey indicates that there are now at least 20 small firms across the UK actively involved in research on antimicrobial resistance (see the Microbiology Research Map, online). These firms deploy a range of different approaches, from investigation of natural products, to development of vaccines, and other methods. Diverse approaches represent a richness of endeavour.&#xa0;But further commitment is critical if we want take-off for a wider range of measures including antimicrobial therapies, diagnostic devices, and vaccines (as is support for skilled, motivated, imaginative and well-trained scientists in this field). Different, but complementary, approaches could usefully be driven forward by a new Catalyst Fund focused on Anti-infectives Technology.&#xa0;

[[[4.4.]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Biotechnology in the green economy – opportunities, and challengesIt is estimated that over 30,000 different chemicals are now in commercial use. Unstable oil prices – and emerging green technologies – are prompting a transition from oil-based chemistry towards alternative, renewable starting materials. Firms involved range from the very large, to SMEs. Microbiological research plays a pivotal role, as the yet-to-be-developed production processes depend on bacteria and fungi to convert sugars into useful chemicals.&#xa0;There are two interrelated aspects to government support for science in this area. The first concerns research and development to establish viable production processes using pre-existing knowledge (knowledge translation); good progress is being made here. The second concerns basic research on the microbial physiology needed to operate these processes on an industrial scale; in this area there is significant weakness.&#xa0;Government support for knowledge translation has helped the UK into the top five of EU countries for commercialisation of research in this field. Government recently expanded its backing for applied research through the Biological Sciences and Biotechnology Research Council (BBSRC)/Technology Strategy Board (TSB)-funded Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst. This scheme, which launches in 2014, should be encouraged. &#xa0;On the second aspect, however, there appears to be less progress. One significant scientific issue for R&amp;D expenditure is scaling-up production. When moved to large scale – as is needed for industry – useful end products kill the micro-organisms producing them. Yields are therefore too low. We are yet to develop an ‘off-the shelf’ industrial biotechnology.&#xa0;As noted in a policy research paper from NESTA – and widely acknowledged elsewhere – creative solutions will emerge from greater collaboration between chemical engineering and microbiology. &#xa0;The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) supports relevant research but the funding is targeted at the engineering side. The BBSRC is the major Research Council of relevance to the microbiological side; BBSRC funding for ‘industrial biotechnology and bioenergy’ amounts to £26.2m in 2012/13, but this is split between 18 often eclectic areas ranging from tissue engineering to biomass crops. The focus is therefore diffuse, with relatively little opportunity for the scientific committees that allocate research funds to make major investment in one area.&#xa0;There is, as a consequence, a huge funding gap for applied microbiological research in technology readiness levels 1-4 (discovery, research, and proof of concept) for key areas of basic science underlying industrial biotechnology.  The BBSRC Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBB) will usefully link together interested researchers for the purpose of knowledge exchange, but they are not a research funding mechanism. It would therefore be worth examining the value of a ring-fenced funding pathway for synthetic biology, targeted at microbial physiology for industrial application. This could go some way to supply the research needed in terms of scaling-up production processes.&#xa0;

The CSO does not make the conventional distinction between ‘PSREs’ (taken to mean institutions directly under a ministerial department), and ‘research institutes’ (government-funded, but held at arm’s length through the Research Councils). &#xa0;In our analysis, there are a total of about 30 research establishments and research institutes with significant microbiological interests (see map; detailed list available on request from the Society for General Microbiology). The majority are located in England; one is in Northern Ireland (not included on the CSO’s list); and two in Scotland.&#xa0;These institutions cover the gamut of microbiological research, from the most applied, to the bluest skies; but sharing a clear focus on (i) infectious disease; and (ii) agriculture. With their specialist infrastructures, they support significant research strengths in UK microbiology, covering vital topics for future public health, food production, and the agricultural economy. They provide essential frontline services, such as predicting and controlling disease outbreaks. They have potentially enormous value in linking basic, strategic and applied research, with a longer time-horizon than the shorter-term grants offered to universities, and acting as nuclei for innovation. Developing more effective synergistic relationships between researchers in universities and public sector research establishments should be a future goal.&#xa0;
