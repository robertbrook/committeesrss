[normal]differences in children’s academic achievement and underachievement. Differences between children are often assumed to be entirely caused by variation in family, school, teacher and peer environments – but research by me, and many others in several countri
[normal]es, shows that genetic (DNA) differences between children account for more than half of the differences between children in their educational achievement. By contrast, only about a fifth of the differences between children in educational achievement is acc
[normal]ounted for by schools. No specific policy implications follow directly from recognising genetic differences between children in how easily -- they learn even basic literacy and numeracy skills. Nonetheless, it cannot be right to ignore genetics in discussi
[normal]ons about why children differ in their educational achievement.
