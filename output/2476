defaultIncome streams have been affected as arrears have increased and less rent has been collected. Some members have been affected worse than others, but all report increases in arrears. Combined with additional 
defaultcosts revenue is being impacted by at least £100,
default000 per association reducing what can be leveraged for further development. Housing associations have to accept that, for the first time, tenants have not got and will not have enough money to pay their rent.

defaultMany are worried for those households who were
default already in arrears before the changes came in who are finding it harder to keep to suspended possession agreements now that they must pay the agreed rent plus some.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStaffing costs have increased significantly as a result of the need to provide greater s
defaultupport to tenants as well as to ensure staff have a thorough understanding of the changes. Higher levels of contact and support are required both as preventative measures and to help residents through increasing levels of crises.

defaultSome properties have been freed up and there is an increase in the number of mutual ex
defaultchanges as people who want to downsize have matched with people who want bigger properties. In the last five months alone 
defaultHightown Praetorian &amp; Churches Housing Association default(Hightown) has reported 26% more exchanges than it did in the entirety of last year
default, an experience that has been replicated across the county. 
defaultCircle Housing Groupdefault provides House Exchange, the country’s largest not-for-profit web-based mutual exchange service. House Exchange allows for home swaps between 
defaultany council and housing associati
defaulton tenant with the right to mutually exchange by
default automatically matching house-seekers with a home that meet their needs. Since the Under-Occupation Penalty – or the so called ‘bedroom tax’ – was introduced in April 2013, the number of registrations to Hous
defaulte Exchange website, 
defaultwww.houseexchange.org.uk
default, have increased by 26%. The majority of those registering on the site, around 26%, are looking to move to a larger property 
defaultbut the number looking to down-size has increased as a proportion of registrations to around 10%. 
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough mutual exchange is an important tool in addressing welfare reform, it still remains the case that there are not enough one bedroom properties for te
defaultnants to down-size into. Indeed some research undertaken by the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Housing and Planning Research on behalf of East 7 showed that, even 
defaultIf all appropriate re-lets were reserved to allow under occupying tenants to move to sm
defaultaller homes, it would still take nearly eight years to re-house all current tenants who 
defaultrequire a downsize to 1 bedroom accommodation.

defaultSome housing associations have seen an increase in voids, with particular difficulties in letting family homes e.g. 3 bed flats and houses in rural locations. One member, 
defaultEstuarydefault points to a 38% increase in 
defaultvoids in the first four months of 2013/14 compared to the same period the previous year, stimulated by transfers responding in part to welfare reform. 
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe trends already outlined are likely to continue, with increased costs and bad debts, and reduced income. There will continue to be uncertainty over how tenants will respond both in the short and longer term. 
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHousing associations are likely to have to
default increase the number of evictions for non-payment of rent as well as dealing with the consequences of uncertainty around direct payments. 
default3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe biggest impact has been the increased risk of family financial hardship with greater pressure on household budgets. The emotional impact and increased stress, particularly for vulnerable groups is not
default to be underestimated, as the following case studies show.
default3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn particular, customers with disabilities have needed additional support in requesting DHP from their local authority or reviewing their options where they live in adapted housing. Those with fami
defaultlies who have been allocated a particular size of house by the local authority but now face the ‘bedroom tax’ reduction in their housing benefit have struggled to understand and cope with this.
default default3.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNorth Herfordshire Homesdefault reports that 676 of their 8,000 gene
defaultral needs tenants are affected by the ‘bedroom tax’, with 119 deemed to be under-occupying by two rooms or more. Arrears have increased for 409 (62%) of those affected, averaging £10.80. 14 possession orders have been obtained and two eviction warrants sou
defaultght for these cases. 150 of 
defaultNorth Herfordshire Homes’default tenants are waiting to downsize, but only 38 have been able to. 161 households are unable to move due to rent arrears or a possession order being in place. 
default3.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor those in the examples, the likely outcomes are that the costs to the tax payer will far outweigh the relative saving through imposing the ‘bedroom tax’, and do not 
defaultnecessarily make better use of our stock. Affected tenants have to make choices about ho
defaultw money is spent where previously those choices were made for them. These decisions become more acute when there simply is not enough money to cover some very basic outgoings. This will become more acute when direct payment is implemented.   
default&#xa0;defaultCase studiesdefault&#xa0;defaultA lives in a 3B and is deemed to be under occupying by 2 bedrooms with a 25% deduction in HB. He suffers from multiple sclerosis and in the absence of any family support receives 24 hour care from a professional carer. His carer only receives 5 hours pai
defaultd care a week as she lives in the property and so does not contribute to the rent. A is not able to move unless we fully facilitate the move and the Local Authority (or Estuary) invests appropriately to replace his hoist and hospital bed and moves the equi
defaultpment needed for his daily needs.  We have applied for DHP for A and at least expect his deduction to be reduced to 14%.  
defaultCouple 
defaultB
default have a number of health issues and between them receive low level DLA, some Employment and Support Allowance and Carer’s All
defaultowance for a daughter with Cystic Fibrosis. The property has minor adaptations and equipment for their daughter. The equipment is kept in the 3rd bedroom which is considered a ‘box-room’. The daughter’s income support payments have been taken into consider
defaultation in the council tax support which has resulted in benefit being cut from 100% to only a few pounds. DHP has been awarded for 3 months. The couple need a very large 2 bed or face placing their daughter in a care home to widen their options to a one-bed
defaultroom. The likelihood of securing alternative accommodation in 3 months is very low.
defaultC has learning difficulties. Her 11, 13 &amp; 14 year old children are in care but as she is in regular contact, there was a hope that at least one will be able to live with he
defaultr in her 2-bedroom property. Downsizing removes the hope of this. It has been some time since she has worked and although she has been invited to the job club, it is not clear whether the job club’s generic approach will be of assistance.
defaultD occupies a 3B o
defaultn her own as her lodger recently moved out. D has poor health but was turned down for
default Employment Support Allowance. 
defaultWe have no one bedroom properties in her area and so we have been unable to offer any likelihood of a transfer. D does not have access to th
defaulte internet to make a claim, and at our visit had no credit on her phone or bus fare to contact/visit and make an application for JSA. D’s JSA will provide £71 per week income however outgoings equate to over £100 including £26.41 for the shortfall, £2.50 c
defaultouncil tax, £40 gas and electricity, £30 food and toiletries and £5 for her phone. An application for DHP has now been made for D whilst we assess what assistance we can give her

defaultE
default cannot afford to wait. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn efforts to stretch budgets tenants are being proactive but choices can have a negative impact. The use of food banks and simply not being able to afford to buy food is seen much more regularly amongst our tenants. In addition the use of non-traditional 
defaultloan sources has continued. Some tenants have found lodgers and some have found work as a way out of the situation. 
default3.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the new system tenants have less choice. They are limited by what size properties housing benefit will fund, irrespective of what the
defaulty may need. This in turn has led to a more stressful experience. 
default3.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCommunity and family stability will also be impacted. More are moving as people take a two bedroom house now whilst they have young children, but they will need to get a bigger home when they are older. 
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe trends outlined in answer to Q3 will continue. In addition, with the roll-out of Universal Credit, many tenants who have never managed their own housing costs will need support in dealing with the amount a
defaultnd frequency of Universal Credit payments. They will need to learn to budget monthly rather than weekly or fortnightly and will have more payments to make.
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the new system it is important that members can spot problems before they escalate, helping tenants to manage any problems, and providing much greater support. To achieve this all members have had to look at their services
default, staffing, funding support, and procedures, to ensure a holistic response. We provide further detail on how they are innovating below. 
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers are working with tenants to help them to move. Initiatives range from pro-actively identifying those tenants un
defaultder-occupying and who would benefit from a move, to mutual exchange events (speed dating for transfer applicants), and home visits to households to advise customers on the options available to them in reaction to the introduction of the ‘bedroom tax’. 
defaultHighdefaulttowndefault has even given its Housing Director discretion to approve transfers if households are in rent arrears due to the Government’s welfare reforms. 
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers are investing in the training and up skilling of staff so that they can provide more support in-per
defaultson to tenants. This includes the creation of new roles, such as 
defaultbphadefault’s Pre-tenancy Officers to carry out income and expenditure assessments to discuss the true affordability of taking on a new home with prospective tenants, and 
defaultProject Neighbourhood Offic
defaulters to carry out additional work looking into the impact of changes within a neighbourhood, and 
defaultNorth Hertfordshire Homesdefault’ specialist advice posts for under-occupation and mutual exchange, and welfare benefits advice. Housing management staff’s roles have 
defaultchanged to provide early and more effective intervention on rent arrears.
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEmployment support and money advice services are in particular demand: 
defaultbphadefault is experiencing greater number of referrals to its employment support and money advice services, as tenant
defaults focus on getting into work and dealing with debt;
default Estuary defaulthas increased the number of employment workshops, support with completing DHP applications. In addition, more general budgeting assistance is also being provided. , 
defaultCircle Housing Group defaultis investi
defaultng £1 million each year in financial inclusion services
default defaultand 
defaultNorth Hertfordshire Homes defaulthas introduced budgeting assistance into its support work, providing advice on cooking, food shopping on a budget and information on food banks. 
defaultIndeed, concerns regardin
defaultg the provision of food have become so acute that some of our members have started to contribute 
defaultdirectly 
defaultto foodbanks. South Northants Homes, a subsidiary of 
defaultGrand Union Housing Groupdefault, 
defaultbecame 
defaultinvolved in the establishment of a foodbank in Towcester when t
defaulthey 
defaultdiscovered referrals of their tenants to foodbanks had doubled
default.  
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers are helping tenants to navigate the new welfare system and to receive the right benefits. Initiatives include simple tools such as the provision of a benefits calculator on the 
defaultEdefaultstuary defaultwebsite to fuller support such as 
defaultNorth Hertfordshire Homes defaultestablishing close working links with housing benefits teams to facilitate applications for discretionary payments and assist tenants with their applications. 
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne worrying aspect of the re
defaultforms is the digital exclusion caused by moving many aspects of the benefit system online. When 
defaultCircle Housing Group defaultconducted a survey in anticipation of the welfare reforms, they discovered 45% of their tenants did not have access to internet at home. In
default response to the problems raised by the Government’s ‘digital-by-default’ approach, 
defaultNorth Hertfordshire Homesdefault are recruiting ‘digital champions’ to assist claimants without access to personal computers or unfamiliar with how to use online forms and recycli
defaultng PCs and laptops to equip households for digital benefits claims. Public use points for PCs are also being established in neighbourhood and communal facilitates, supported by volunteers or staff. 
default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are also perverse consequences within the system. D
defaultue to necessity, one association is exploring with housing benefit teams how to maximise the number of new supported housing tenants that can receive housing benefit payment under the vulnerability criteria and exploring fully the application of ‘exempt ac
defaultcommodation’. 
default5.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers are also investing their surpluses in removing blockages within the system. For example, a tenant may wish to downsize to avoid a reduction in benefit, but under normal circumstances this would not be permitted if they were in arrear
defaults. Members are adopting a more flexible response as well as providing financial incentives. For example, 
defaultbphadefault has a “room to move” policy, creating the financial room to move by 
defaulthelping tenants with moving costs and also allowing tenants who have rent arre
defaultars to move home with a package of help and conditions. 
default5.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers are partnering with other organisations to secure financial services which can support their tenants. As part of this work they are also increasing financial inclusion training so that staff 
defaultare better able to advise. A number of our members, including 
defaultFlagshipdefault, 
defaultEstuary defaultand 
defaultNorth Hertfordshire Homesdefault, are partnering with Credit Unions to provide managed accounts for those without bank accounts, and helping to promote these so that there is an e
defaultasy route for people to access them. In addition, 
defaultNorth Hertfordshire Homes defaultis providing increased funding to the Black Squirrel Credit Union so that loans to tenants are underwritten on more favourable terms
default6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMembers’ preference is for the housing element to be clearly defined and not lumped in with a single payment. Reasons range from the efficient functioning of the system, to the
default needs of the tenant. 
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is recognition that the logic that underpins Universal Credit and the basic principles of empowering people, replicating the way wages work and giving people responsibility are sound. We can understand the reasoning behind hous
defaulting costs being included, but not the insistence on it being on a compulsory basis. For those people who wish to have their housing costs deducted at source they should be able to do so. There are parallels for those with a mortgage, where the building soc
defaultiety or bank requires a direct debit to be in place for automatic payment. 
default6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important to balance the policy objective of fostering good financial behaviour with the importance of a secure home. Ensuring that rent is paid not only provides stability but reduce the costs to the tax payer of homelessness, children’s care servic
defaultes, schemes to address rough sleeping and cost to the NHS. Given that there is clear potential for tenants to use tax payer funded benefit on costs other than rent, for those wishing to avoid that risk there should remain an option for rent to be paid dire
defaultctly to a social landlord.    
default6.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are also some unanswered questions around how the housing cost element will work in practice. 
defaultParticularly around defaulting payments to landlords where arrears accrue, the process for payments reverting to customers, f
defaultrequency of allowing the default, etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is particularly hard for any tenant to recover from accruing two months of rent arrears and it can have a very long term impact on their life if this is allowed to happen – a safety mechanism needs to exist and be 
defaultproperly thought through.  
default6.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor the housing associations, with careful management the impact of the inevitable passage back and forward from payment to tenants to payment to landlords as people fall into arrears and then recover can be managed but clarity 
defaultis needed. 
default6.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, policy makers need to be aware that the increased administrative burden combined with the general increase in financial pressures, will inevitably lead to higher 
defaultrent arrears which will restrict housing association’s ability to bor
defaultrow from banks etc.  The reduction in surpluses caused by reduced income will compound this and as a result we will be able to do less, build less homes and provide less good services.
