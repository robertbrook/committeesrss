&#xa0;
[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]East 7 [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Income streams have been affected as arrears have increased and less rent has been collected. Some members have been affected worse than others, but all report increases in arrears. Combined with additional 
[normal]costs revenue is being impacted by at least £100,
[normal]000 per association reducing what can be leveraged for further development. Housing associations have to accept that, for the first time, tenants have not got and will not have enough money to pay their rent. 
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many are worried for those households who were
[normal] already in arrears before the changes came in who are finding it harder to keep to suspended possession agreements now that they must pay the agreed rent plus some.  
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Staffing costs have increased significantly as a result of the need to provide greater s
[normal]upport to tenants as well as to ensure staff have a thorough understanding of the changes. Higher levels of contact and support are required both as preventative measures and to help residents through increasing levels of crises. 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes’[bold] [bold]housing management 
[normal]yearly 
[normal]staffing costs have increased by
[normal] £134,000 (1.6%
[normal])
[normal] annually due to the need to recruit specialist posts and increase staffing levels generally. 
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some properties have been freed up and there is an increase in the number of mutual ex
[normal]changes as people who want to downsize have matched with people who want bigger properties. In the last five months alone 
[normal]Hightown Praetorian &amp; Churches Housing Association [bold](Hightown) has reported 26% more exchanges than it did in the entirety of last year
[normal], an experience that has been replicated across the county. 
[normal]Circle Housing Group[bold] provides House Exchange, the country’s largest not-for-profit web-based mutual exchange service. House Exchange allows for home swaps between 
[normal]any council and housing associati
[normal]on tenant with the right to mutually exchange by
[normal] automatically matching house-seekers with a home that meet their needs. Since the Under-Occupation Penalty – or the so called ‘bedroom tax’ – was introduced in April 2013, the number of registrations to Hous
[normal]e Exchange website, 
[normal]www.houseexchange.org.uk
[normal], have increased by 26%. The majority of those registering on the site, around 26%, are looking to move to a larger property 
[normal]but the number looking to down-size has increased as a proportion of registrations to around 10%. 
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Although mutual exchange is an important tool in addressing welfare reform, it still remains the case that there are not enough one bedroom properties for te
[normal]nants to down-size into. Indeed some research undertaken by the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Housing and Planning Research on behalf of East 7 showed that, even 
[normal]If all appropriate re-lets were reserved to allow under occupying tenants to move to sm
[normal]aller homes, it would still take nearly eight years to re-house all current tenants who 
[normal]require a downsize to 1 bedroom accommodation.
[normal] 
[normal]What is more, mutual exchange
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] expensive 
[normal]for housing associations:
[normal] 
[normal]Grand Union Housing Group [bold]calculates 
[normal]that 
[normal]for each 
[normal]transaction, they incur an average cost
[normal] 
[normal]of £550.
[normal]1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some housing associations have seen an increase in voids, with particular difficulties in letting family homes e.g. 3 bed flats and houses in rural locations. One member, 
[normal]Estuary[bold] points to a 38% increase in 
[normal]voids in the first four months of 2013/14 compared to the same period the previous year, stimulated by transfers responding in part to welfare reform. 
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The trends already outlined are likely to continue, with increased costs and bad debts, and reduced income. There will continue to be uncertainty over how tenants will respond both in the short and longer term. 
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Housing associations are likely to have to
[normal] increase the number of evictions for non-payment of rent as well as dealing with the consequences of uncertainty around direct payments. 
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The biggest impact has been the increased risk of family financial hardship with greater pressure on household budgets. The emotional impact and increased stress, particularly for vulnerable groups is not
[normal] to be underestimated, as the following case studies show.
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In particular, customers with disabilities have needed additional support in requesting DHP from their local authority or reviewing their options where they live in adapted housing. Those with fami
[normal]lies who have been allocated a particular size of house by the local authority but now face the ‘bedroom tax’ reduction in their housing benefit have struggled to understand and cope with this.
[normal] [bold]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]North Herfordshire Homes[bold] reports that 676 of their 8,000 gene
[normal]ral needs tenants are affected by the ‘bedroom tax’, with 119 deemed to be under-occupying by two rooms or more. Arrears have increased for 409 (62%) of those affected, averaging £10.80. 14 possession orders have been obtained and two eviction warrants sou
[normal]ght for these cases. 150 of 
[normal]North Herfordshire Homes’[bold] tenants are waiting to downsize, but only 38 have been able to. 161 households are unable to move due to rent arrears or a possession order being in place. 
[normal]3.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For those in the examples, the likely outcomes are that the costs to the tax payer will far outweigh the relative saving through imposing the ‘bedroom tax’, and do not 
[normal]necessarily make better use of our stock. Affected tenants have to make choices about ho
[normal]w money is spent where previously those choices were made for them. These decisions become more acute when there simply is not enough money to cover some very basic outgoings. This will become more acute when direct payment is implemented.   
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Case studies[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A lives in a 3B and is deemed to be under occupying by 2 bedrooms with a 25% deduction in HB. He suffers from multiple sclerosis and in the absence of any family support receives 24 hour care from a professional carer. His carer only receives 5 hours pai
[normal]d care a week as she lives in the property and so does not contribute to the rent. A is not able to move unless we fully facilitate the move and the Local Authority (or Estuary) invests appropriately to replace his hoist and hospital bed and moves the equi
[normal]pment needed for his daily needs.  We have applied for DHP for A and at least expect his deduction to be reduced to 14%.  
[normal]Couple 
[normal]B
[normal] have a number of health issues and between them receive low level DLA, some Employment and Support Allowance and Carer’s All
[normal]owance for a daughter with Cystic Fibrosis. The property has minor adaptations and equipment for their daughter. The equipment is kept in the 3rd bedroom which is considered a ‘box-room’. The daughter’s income support payments have been taken into consider
[normal]ation in the council tax support which has resulted in benefit being cut from 100% to only a few pounds. DHP has been awarded for 3 months. The couple need a very large 2 bed or face placing their daughter in a care home to widen their options to a one-bed
[normal]room. The likelihood of securing alternative accommodation in 3 months is very low.
[normal]C has learning difficulties. Her 11, 13 &amp; 14 year old children are in care but as she is in regular contact, there was a hope that at least one will be able to live with he
[normal]r in her 2-bedroom property. Downsizing removes the hope of this. It has been some time since she has worked and although she has been invited to the job club, it is not clear whether the job club’s generic approach will be of assistance.
[normal]D occupies a 3B o
[normal]n her own as her lodger recently moved out. D has poor health but was turned down for
[normal] Employment Support Allowance. 
[normal]We have no one bedroom properties in her area and so we have been unable to offer any likelihood of a transfer. D does not have access to th
[normal]e internet to make a claim, and at our visit had no credit on her phone or bus fare to contact/visit and make an application for JSA. D’s JSA will provide £71 per week income however outgoings equate to over £100 including £26.41 for the shortfall, £2.50 c
[normal]ouncil tax, £40 gas and electricity, £30 food and toiletries and £5 for her phone. An application for DHP has now been made for D whilst we assess what assistance we can give her
[normal].
[normal]E is a victim of extreme domestic violence
[normal] and 
[normal]has two girls aged
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]14. 
[normal]After 
[normal]E 
[normal]suffered 20 years of physical abuse the police finally removed her husband from the property last year. The abuse had a lasting effect on her eldest daughter, X, who is diagnosed with autism and has a DLA award for this. X is self-harming on a dail
[normal]y basis by cutting her arms and legs. 
[normal]E
[normal] 
[normal]wants 
[normal]to downsize as she simply ca
[normal]nnot afford the £13.55 per week—s
[normal]he is trying to find a property with a dining room or a big enough room to split into two. She cannot put the girls together as the eldest one needs 
[normal]her own space and she doesn’t want the youngest copying her self-destructive behaviour. In a year and a half when the eldest 
[normal]turns 16 they will no longer be affected by the under-occupancy charge, but 
[normal]E
[normal] cannot afford to wait. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In efforts to stretch budgets tenants are being proactive but choices can have a negative impact. The use of food banks and simply not being able to afford to buy food is seen much more regularly amongst our tenants. In addition the use of non-traditional 
[normal]loan sources has continued. Some tenants have found lodgers and some have found work as a way out of the situation. 
[normal]3.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the new system tenants have less choice. They are limited by what size properties housing benefit will fund, irrespective of what the
[normal]y may need. This in turn has led to a more stressful experience. 
[normal]3.7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Community and family stability will also be impacted. More are moving as people take a two bedroom house now whilst they have young children, but they will need to get a bigger home when they are older. 
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The trends outlined in answer to Q3 will continue. In addition, with the roll-out of Universal Credit, many tenants who have never managed their own housing costs will need support in dealing with the amount a
[normal]nd frequency of Universal Credit payments. They will need to learn to budget monthly rather than weekly or fortnightly and will have more payments to make.
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the new system it is important that members can spot problems before they escalate, helping tenants to manage any problems, and providing much greater support. To achieve this all members have had to look at their services
[normal], staffing, funding support, and procedures, to ensure a holistic response. We provide further detail on how they are innovating below. 
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Members are working with tenants to help them to move. Initiatives range from pro-actively identifying those tenants un
[normal]der-occupying and who would benefit from a move, to mutual exchange events (speed dating for transfer applicants), and home visits to households to advise customers on the options available to them in reaction to the introduction of the ‘bedroom tax’. 
[normal]High[bold]town[bold] has even given its Housing Director discretion to approve transfers if households are in rent arrears due to the Government’s welfare reforms. 
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Members are investing in the training and up skilling of staff so that they can provide more support in-per
[normal]son to tenants. This includes the creation of new roles, such as 
[normal]bpha[bold]’s Pre-tenancy Officers to carry out income and expenditure assessments to discuss the true affordability of taking on a new home with prospective tenants, and 
[normal]Project Neighbourhood Offic
[normal]ers to carry out additional work looking into the impact of changes within a neighbourhood, and 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes[bold]’ specialist advice posts for under-occupation and mutual exchange, and welfare benefits advice. Housing management staff’s roles have 
[normal]changed to provide early and more effective intervention on rent arrears.
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Employment support and money advice services are in particular demand: 
[normal]bpha[bold] is experiencing greater number of referrals to its employment support and money advice services, as tenant
[normal]s focus on getting into work and dealing with debt;
[normal] Estuary [bold]has increased the number of employment workshops, support with completing DHP applications. In addition, more general budgeting assistance is also being provided. , 
[normal]Circle Housing Group [bold]is investi
[normal]ng £1 million each year in financial inclusion services
[normal] [bold]and 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes [bold]has introduced budgeting assistance into its support work, providing advice on cooking, food shopping on a budget and information on food banks. 
[normal]Indeed, concerns regardin
[normal]g the provision of food have become so acute that some of our members have started to contribute 
[normal]directly 
[normal]to foodbanks. South Northants Homes, a subsidiary of 
[normal]Grand Union Housing Group[bold], 
[normal]became 
[normal]involved in the establishment of a foodbank in Towcester when t
[normal]hey 
[normal]discovered referrals of their tenants to foodbanks had doubled
[normal].  
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Members are helping tenants to navigate the new welfare system and to receive the right benefits. Initiatives include simple tools such as the provision of a benefits calculator on the 
[normal]E[bold]stuary [bold]website to fuller support such as 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes [bold]establishing close working links with housing benefits teams to facilitate applications for discretionary payments and assist tenants with their applications. 
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One worrying aspect of the re
[normal]forms is the digital exclusion caused by moving many aspects of the benefit system online. When 
[normal]Circle Housing Group [bold]conducted a survey in anticipation of the welfare reforms, they discovered 45% of their tenants did not have access to internet at home. In
[normal] response to the problems raised by the Government’s ‘digital-by-default’ approach, 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes[bold] are recruiting ‘digital champions’ to assist claimants without access to personal computers or unfamiliar with how to use online forms and recycli
[normal]ng PCs and laptops to equip households for digital benefits claims. Public use points for PCs are also being established in neighbourhood and communal facilitates, supported by volunteers or staff. 
[normal]5.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are also perverse consequences within the system. D
[normal]ue to necessity, one association is exploring with housing benefit teams how to maximise the number of new supported housing tenants that can receive housing benefit payment under the vulnerability criteria and exploring fully the application of ‘exempt ac
[normal]commodation’. 
[normal]5.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Members are also investing their surpluses in removing blockages within the system. For example, a tenant may wish to downsize to avoid a reduction in benefit, but under normal circumstances this would not be permitted if they were in arrear
[normal]s. Members are adopting a more flexible response as well as providing financial incentives. For example, 
[normal]bpha[bold] has a “room to move” policy, creating the financial room to move by 
[normal]helping tenants with moving costs and also allowing tenants who have rent arre
[normal]ars to move home with a package of help and conditions. 
[normal]5.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Members are partnering with other organisations to secure financial services which can support their tenants. As part of this work they are also increasing financial inclusion training so that staff 
[normal]are better able to advise. A number of our members, including 
[normal]Flagship[bold], 
[normal]Estuary [bold]and 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes[bold], are partnering with Credit Unions to provide managed accounts for those without bank accounts, and helping to promote these so that there is an e
[normal]asy route for people to access them. In addition, 
[normal]North Hertfordshire Homes [bold]is providing increased funding to the Black Squirrel Credit Union so that loans to tenants are underwritten on more favourable terms
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Members’ preference is for the housing element to be clearly defined and not lumped in with a single payment. Reasons range from the efficient functioning of the system, to the
[normal] needs of the tenant. 
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is recognition that the logic that underpins Universal Credit and the basic principles of empowering people, replicating the way wages work and giving people responsibility are sound. We can understand the reasoning behind hous
[normal]ing costs being included, but not the insistence on it being on a compulsory basis. For those people who wish to have their housing costs deducted at source they should be able to do so. There are parallels for those with a mortgage, where the building soc
[normal]iety or bank requires a direct debit to be in place for automatic payment. 
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important to balance the policy objective of fostering good financial behaviour with the importance of a secure home. Ensuring that rent is paid not only provides stability but reduce the costs to the tax payer of homelessness, children’s care servic
[normal]es, schemes to address rough sleeping and cost to the NHS. Given that there is clear potential for tenants to use tax payer funded benefit on costs other than rent, for those wishing to avoid that risk there should remain an option for rent to be paid dire
[normal]ctly to a social landlord.    
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are also some unanswered questions around how the housing cost element will work in practice. 
[normal]Particularly around defaulting payments to landlords where arrears accrue, the process for payments reverting to customers, f
[normal]requency of allowing the default, etc.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is particularly hard for any tenant to recover from accruing two months of rent arrears and it can have a very long term impact on their life if this is allowed to happen – a safety mechanism needs to exist and be 
[normal]properly thought through.  
[normal]6.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For the housing associations, with careful management the impact of the inevitable passage back and forward from payment to tenants to payment to landlords as people fall into arrears and then recover can be managed but clarity 
[normal]is needed. 
[normal]6.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, policy makers need to be aware that the increased administrative burden combined with the general increase in financial pressures, will inevitably lead to higher 
[normal]rent arrears which will restrict housing association’s ability to bor
[normal]row from banks etc.  The reduction in surpluses caused by reduced income will compound this and as a result we will be able to do less, build less homes and provide less good services.
