[normal]I am architect with over 30 year 
[normal]of architectural experience, 
[normal]during which I gained
[normal] a Master of Science in Sustainable Development and Climate Change, with Distinction, 
[normal]at De Montfort University. Since 2000 I 
[normal]led the development of sustainable design practices within 
[normal]a large commercial architectural practice, 
[normal]3DReid
[normal] which was previously REID architecture
[normal]. 
[normal]I am also a
[normal] 
[normal]trained CIBSE Low Carbon Consultant (Design),
[normal] Code for Sustainable Homes Assessor, a
[normal] BREEAM Accredited Professional &amp; BREEAM Assessor for offices, retail &amp; 
[normal]industrial schemes.
[normal] 
[normal]I was 
[normal]commission by RIBA Publishing to write a Guide to BREEAM, due for publication 
[normal]at the end of 2011. I currently sit
[normal] on two British Standards Institute’s committees, one dealing with Sustainability in Construction Works an
[normal]d the Design Advisory Committee and I am a member of the RIBA Regulations &amp; Standards Group. This submission is, however, being submitted in a personal capacity and not on behalf of any organisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to express my concern about the government’s unilateral decision to wind down the role of the Code for Sustainable Homes, as currently proposed within the Housing Standards Review consultation. My concern covers a number of areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1: The first area of concern relates to the fact while that the Housing Standards Review consultation contains the statement from the government that it proposes to wind down the role of the Code for Sustainable Homes it does ask any questions within this consultation to gain views on whether respondents feel this is appropriate. The Code for Sustainable Homes has played a central role in the raising of standards &amp; the development of more sustainable housing over the last few years and the proposal to wind its role down within any form of consultation appears to be very arbitrary. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2: The Nation Planning Policy Framework, launched by the current 
[normal]government 
[normal]supports
[normal], the “
[normal]presumption in favour of sustainable development
[normal]”.
[normal] The problem with the National Planning Policy Framework is that it provides no guidance as to what is a 
[normal]sustainable development
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In terms of housing development the use of the Code for Sustainable Homes provides a independent, third party assessment of a developments sustainable credentials. It is important to realise that the Code for Sustainable Homes covers more than just carbon reduction. It covers none categories covering environmental &amp; social aspects of sustainability. Within the currently Housing Standards Review there is no real proposal as to how a housing development’s sustainability should be assessed &amp; does not provide any benchmarks on measuring sustainability.    
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3: The Housing Standards being proposed by the government deal with only 3 areas that are covered by the Code for Sustainable Homes. These are Accessibility, Water Efficiency &amp; Energy. It is proposed that certain areas such as Health &amp; Well Being, Waste &amp; Pollution issued should be covered by the planning process, but no standards or benchmarks are being proposed. In fact within the three areas being covered by the proposed Housing Standards, the extent of benchmarking is not as extensive or as high a quality as that currently contained within the Code for Sustainable Homes. The government appears to be proposing no standards or benchmarks for some very important areas of sustainability which are currently covered by the Code for Sustainable Homes – Materials, Management (of the construction process), Ecology. The current Housing Standards Review consultation is very deficient in allowing a proper discussion &amp; consultation on the marinating a serious &amp; rigorous benchmarking process for measuring future development’s sustainability as required under the National Planning Policy Framework.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4: The government accepts within the Housing Standards Review that other voluntary standards have a role to play within the house building industry, while seeming determined to remove the Code for Sustainable Homes which could be a valuable voluntary standard that could be used by local planning authorities to set know required standards for future developments within their area. Already a large number of planning authorities use the Code for Sustainable Hones for this purpose. Surely this is the essence of localism, allowing local planning authorities to set standard that is deemed appropriate for their communities after going through the due process of public consultation.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5: The government feels that incorporating certain minimum energy, water efficiency &amp; accessibility standards within the proposed Housing Standards, and eventually into the Building Regulations, covers’ their sustainability objectives. If this is the case then this should form part of a consultation 
[normal]process as it is clearly a significant change of approach towards what sustainability is. This consultation would have to incorporate an understanding of the impact of the government’s definition of zero carbon homes, what is being proposed for Allowable Solutions so that a full understanding of what is being proposed is understood. At the moment it is fragmented and not joined up. For instance the government as stated that their zero carbon homes standard is a 100% reduction in the regulated energy levels achieved under the 2006 Building Regulation standards of which a significant proportion can be offset by the proposed Allowable Solutions. While this sets a minimum standard many within the industry feel this is insufficient to help the country to meet the commitments of the Climate Change Act &amp; the stated intension of reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emission by 80% by 2050. This is in the context that buildings are responsible for around 44% of the UK’s emissions &amp; housing alone is responsible for around 25%. This is does not form part of the current consultation
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6: Another issue that does not form part of the current consultation is the fact that the Code for Sustainable Homes is able of providing more than a minimum standard currently being proposed by the Housing Standards. The Code currently provide &amp; could provide in the future a pathway for increasing levels of sustainability above the minimum standards that would be covered by Building Regulations and a process for measuring this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7: Another issue that is not addressed within the current consultation on the Housing Standards is the existence of trained specialist profession that is able to provide independent expertise and assessment of housing schemes when their sustainability credential are measured. The potential cost of losing this expertise has not been addressed or how independent measurement of a housing developments sustainability credentials will be measured in the future. The government appears to have decided to remove one process (the Code for Sustainable Homes) without consulting on how this should be replaced.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion I feel that the government’s decision to wind down the role of the Code for Sustainable Homes without proper consultation is seriously flawed which seriously comprises the acceptability of the proposed Housing Standards currently out for consultation.
