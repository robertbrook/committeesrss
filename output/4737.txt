[[[Why this recession has hit young people hard]]]&#xa0;This recession has seen a reduction in hiring, rather than an increase in people losing their jobs. Job creation happens when a workplace is newly established or expands; job destruction when one contracts or closes. Using firm level data, Bob Butcher at NIESR found:&#xa0;&#xa0;This hits young people especially, because older workers can get by staying in jobs.&#xa0;Last year, the TUC worked with the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development on a project on Tackling youth unemployment: lessons from Europe. We noted that our youth unemployment rate has consistently been about the EU average, both before and after the recession – but this figures hides as much as it reveals. &#xa0;Firstly, we have a significantly above average proportion NEET – 18.4%, compared with 16.4%. &#xa0;Secondly, the position of young people relative to older adults is much worse – in the UK a young person is 3.5 times as likely to be unemployed as an over-25, compared to 2.5 times in the PIGS and 1.5 times in Germany. &#xa0;

[[[To what extent is the difficulty young people face a supply side matter?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Overall, unemployment is a demand side issue: the key statistic is the ratio of unemployed people to job vacancies. This has now started to fall, but is still nearly twice the 2.5 : 1 that was the norm before the recession.&#xa0;Some of the factors frequently referred to as possible causes of youth unemployment do not stack up:&#xa0;&#xa0;Factors that may have played a part&#xa0;Generation Lost suggests one issue may be Jobcentre Plus’s 2001 decision to pay less attention to youth unemployment. &#xa0;In the project we engaged in with IPPR and CIPD, we were struck by the fact that the difference between youth and older adult unemployment was much less noticeable in countries with strong vocational education and training systems. &#xa0;The low rates of youth unemployment in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands highlight the importance of how the education system interacts with the world of work, and the institutional support that young people receive to make the transition between the two. As a result, policymakers across Europe increasingly stress the importance of high quality vocational education that provides structured pathways into work. One Commission official told us that &#xa0;“it’s not an intellectual insight that when we have well-established, structured and functioning transition pathways youth unemployment is low. So the issue is not identifying the right policies, but delivering on those priorities.”&#xa0;In addition, the TUC is very worried about the situation with regard to careers guidance. According to the OFSTED Report Going in the Right Direction - careers guidance in schools is not adequate: “the new statutory duty for schools to provide careers guidance is not working well enough”. There have been massive cuts in connexions services and the National Careers Service does not offer face to face careers guidance for young people – you have to be aged 19 or over – even though research has shown that young people prefer face to face guidance.&#xa0;On 22 November, we held a TUC Apprenticeships Focus Group attended by 50 apprentices. Careers guidance received was practically non-existent or was limited to “go to university”. &#xa0;

[[[How unions ]]]

[[[should respond]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We would emphasise the importance of making sure bargaining supports skills and training. Unions are encouraging employers to recruit young people, pushing to recruit young people themselves.&#xa0;In UK, we have emphasised learning as the field where unions can make a difference. The TUC’s learning arm, unionlearn, has trained 30,000 Union Learning Representatives (ULRs). &#xa0;ULRs – and increasingly other union rep.s as learning becomes more mainstream (TUC education for rep.s now includes a major learning element) – have negotiated Learning Agreements: 209 since April 2012. These cover such issues as equality &amp; diversity statements, time off for ULRs, setting up workplace learning committees and learning centres, special provision in English and maths, helping people move on to higher level qualifications, the investment employers will make. &#xa0;With the last government, we worked on the New Deal and the Future Jobs Fund to help minimise objections from existing workers and reduce displacement and substitution. We had an Agreement with the Employment Service covering the New Deal, took part in the panels awarding Future Jobs Fund contracts and we established a network of union officials dealing with the FJF to troubleshoot any problems with abuse of the programme (though this turned out to be rare). &#xa0;At European level, the employers’ organisations and the ETUC have a plan for social dialogue negotiations. We regard youth unemployment as a priority and made a “Framework of actions on youth employment” our first priority for the 2012-14 round. There are dozens of agreed actions relating to learning, transitions, employment and entrepreneurship. &#xa0;

[[[Active labour market programmes ]]]&#xa0;Although the publicity for the YC has emphasised the employer subsidy, the bulk is made up of work experience placements: there have been 136,000 work experience placements through the Youth Contract. Next most important have been the sector-based academies, with 49 per cent of the 61,000 people starting these courses being aged 18 – 24. &#xa0;By May 2013 (one third of the way through the programme), there had been 21,460 starts on jobs supported by the wage incentive. Interim and final payments had been made in respect of 4,690 people, including 2,070 payments for completing the full 26 weeks.&#xa0;Between May 2011 and Feb 2013, 146,810 people were referred to Mandatory Work Activity, 43 per cent of whom were 18 – 24 year olds. The DWP’s 2012 research into the Early Impacts of Mandatory Work Activity found that “MWA had a small and transitory impact on benefit receipt, and no impact on employment”&#xa0;The TUC strongly supports a job guarantee, like the Future Jobs Fund. It is important to remember that the Future Jobs Fund was set up at an extremely unpropitious time – no-one was creating jobs at this point and there were major job losses being announced every day. The 2011 evaluation by Fishwick et al found that this one scheme accounted for over a fifth of the exits from JSA among long-term unemployed young people, over two fifths at its busiest time and 60 per cent in the most disadvantaged parts of the country.  &#xa0;“Of the 105,220 participants who started FJF jobs between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 15 per cent of them left their job before six months – more often than not to move immediately into another job. Overall, an estimated 43 per cent of participants obtained a job outcome after FJF – in the majority of cases with the same employer as their FJF job.”&#xa0;The evaluation for the DWP carried out by NIESR in 2012 found that, two years after participating, people were 7% less likely to be on benefit – and as this reduction was stable it was likely to be sustained – a problem for active labour market policies. It increased the likelihood of being in unsubsidised employment 2 years after participation by 10 points, again, this seemed likely to be sustained. &#xa0;The programme benefited participants by £1,600 net per head, their employers by £6,850 per participant. It cost the Exchequer £3,100 per participant net, but produced a net benefit to society of £7,750 per participant – mostly due to their economic output while in FJF employment plus their subsequent extra unsubsidised employment.&#xa0;If the employment effect of the programme persists beyond the two years after participation covered by the study, the benefit to society could be as high as £15,000. Even on the most conservative assumptions, the net befit to participants was £1,600, to employers was £3,750 and to society was £1,100, whilst the net Exchequer cost was £4,300.&#xa0;These assumptions included that the output produced by FJF workers had no value and that the employment effects of the programme ceased immediately after the study stopped tracking participants. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is very sad that the UK is the only EU member state that has said it will not implement the Youth Guarantee. Unlike most of the richer MSs, we are not adding national funding to the European Youth Initiative either.
