[normal]David Bancroft – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a member of 2 rambling clubs and walk every Sunday in any one of 5 national parks accessible from Manchester on day trips.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When I encounter much mud and water in deep ruts and tranches created by motorbikes and 4x4 vehicles I think something must be done to stop irreparable damage.  Surely National Parks are not intended to accommodate convoys of 4x4s and motorbikes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My purpose in writing this letter is to support formal submissions made by:-
[normal]1. YDGLA (Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance)
[normal]2. PDGLA (Peak District Green Lanes Alliance)
[normal]3. GLEAM (Green Lanes Environmental Action Group)
[normal]4. GLPG (Green Lanes Protection Group)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please give their submissions your favourable consideration.
