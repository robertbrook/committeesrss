[[[The Committee is particularly interested in hearing views on:]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; New and innovate responses to changes to housing support already taking place-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Implications of changes for:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Treatment of housing costs within Universal Credit&#xa0;Key points from Temporary Accommodation perspective

[[[Direct payments]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; TA staff currently provide extensive support for customers in claiming housing costs via Housing Benefit to ensure income is secured, which includes maintaining a good working relationship with the council’s Revenues and Benefits department. This relationship is not likely to be possible as support for housing costs move under the DWP, especially where the customer is hard to engage and has not given consent to discuss their application. This may lead to delays in rental costs being paid-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As customers will be expected to take control of their own household finances under Universal Credit, there is a risk that they may not also take responsibility for notifying the DWP of their change in circumstances when they move into TA – unless consent is given to TA staff. This could lead to delays in payment adjustments to include updated housing costs-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Monthly payments to customers could pose several issues for TA, including:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It has been outlined that deductions, including sanctions and income above the benefit cap or from earnings of those in low-paid employment, will be taken from the support for housing costs element of Universal Credit. There have already been difficulties in securing service charge payments from customers in TA who have had existing benefits sanctioned; this is likely to be exacerbated as more substantial deductions come into place-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Although exemptions to direct payment have been outlined, these need to be clarified. The qualifying period of 8 weeks non-payment before direct payments can be requested also poses a particular issue for TA due to the transient nature of its customers. TA could not keep a household beyond one month’s missed payment due to the levels of arrears built up – the service could not afford to run like this. After one missed payment, people would be evicted. &#xa0;

[[[Other issues: ]]]

[[[Claimant Commitment]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This could pose particular issues for homeless people. Current information from Universal Credit pilot areas suggests that the commitment will involve customers devoting 30+ hours per week to job searches, or risk sanctions. This time commitment could be problematic for a population already having to deal with associated issues around their homelessness, without a settled base. Not meeting the commitment and resultant sanctions could have serious implications for rental income at TA. As above, if sanctioned UC meant no housing costs are paid to cover rent, this would result in eviction. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; “Digital by default” also presents an issue for those in TA, due to limited access to ICT facilities. Whilst some provision is available within the schemes and local area, resources are limited especially when competing with others in a similar situation. In addition, it cannot be stressed enough the high level needs and vulnerability that comes with this client group – often a lack of any formal education; learning difficulties; mental and physical health issues; drug and alcohol dependency issues etc. will prevent this client group from being able to engage with any digital inclusion initiatives, and as such will present major problems in terms of them being able to use ICT facilities or engage with support staff attempting to support them in doing so. &#xa0;

[[[, social sector size criteria]]]

[[[ and TA]]]-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The definition of ‘exempt supported accommodation’ is too narrow to reflect the actual circumstances of many homeless customers, as is the DWP statement that the majority of households in TA are in accommodation procured from the private sector. Under homelessness legislation, local authorities can use several types of accommodation which is not limited to those falling within the definition of exempt. In Stockport almost all homeless customers are placed into accommodation managed by the ALMO on behalf of the Metropolitan Borough Council; therefore these customers, over 300 households (families and single occupants) per year, face being adversely affected by reforms despite this accommodation providing the same service to vulnerable customers as defined exempt supported accommodation schemes. Temporary Accommodation in Stockport provides high level intensive support, as defined in SEA criteria.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence from the Universal Credit Pathfinders has also caused further concern with regards to ‘exempt supported accommodation’. One Pathfinder has reported that there is some confusion with regards to how the exemption is applied, as a DWP representative issued advice stating that for existing Universal Credit claimants, moving in to TA / exempt supported accommodation would be classed as a “change of circumstances” and the exemption for supported housing costs would not apply as it would with current legacy benefits. A significant proportion of TA resident intakes will require a “change of circumstances”; therefore this presents a real risk to rental income as well as posing a confusing scenario to vulnerable homeless clients. Therefore there needs to be clarification and a uniform definition of what is classed as exempt, and how this comes to be applied from the DWP.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The basis of entitlement to temporary accommodation costs in Universal Credit on household size rather than accommodation type does not take into account the demand, throughput and pressure on TA. This is also exacerbated by the benefit cap already in place. Customers are placed into TA overwhelmingly on an emergency basis, and into whichever flat/room vacancy is available. Due to TA schemes often being at capacity and the broad range of households within them, there is not always scope to move customers into more suitably sized accommodation. Even where a move is possible there is a risk that some flats, e.g. larger units carrying higher rent, will be under-occupied due to the on-going need to provide some form of accommodation to homeless households, and further reduce rental income. The inflexibility posed by these size criteria therefore has serious consequences for both rental income at TA, and financial pressure on customers who may need to meet shortfalls in rent.&#xa0;1 October 2013&#xa0;
