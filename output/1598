default&#xa0;
default1default              defaultHow do Government and local authorities identifdefaulty demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultSomerset County Council
default 
default(
defaultSCC
default)
default is the Transport Authority for the South Somerset area
default. However
default 
defaultSouth Somerset Together (SST), the 
defaultstrategic partnership for South Somerset
default, which includes both SCC and 
defaultSouth Somerset District Council (
defaultSSDC
default)
default along with other key stakeholders, 
defaulthas identified the declining access to services in rural areas as a real barrier for a large variety of resident
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe SST organised w
defaultorkshops in February and April this year
default, 
defaultwhich involved local user groups including Parish C
defaultouncils, service providers (including Citizens Advice, health, housing, education &amp; training and Sport &amp; Leisure), community and public 
defaulttransport providers. 
defaultThese workshops 
defaultestablished a 
defaultneed (and an ability to provide) for some services to be offered in a more central hub
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultAdditionally 
defaultthe South
default Somerset Citizens Advice Bureau undertook a survey in January
default 2013, which indicated that 
default1 in 3 respondents felt that access to employment and healthcare was poor or very poor.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultD
defaultetermining actual demand
default is difficult given the wide
default 
defaultdispersal
default 
defaultof 
defaultrural settlements and the varied reasons for travel. What we do know though is that i
defaultn contrast
default to the overall
default national trend, passenger journeys by bus in Somerset have decreased in the past two years. The county has one of the lowest number of bus trips per population in England.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultThe Department for Transport Publ
defaultic Service Vehicle (PSV) Surv
defaultey 
defaultestimates that in 2011-12, there were 8.6
default million bus passenger journeys 
defaultin Somerset.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis 
defaultrepresents a 12% fall
default from the
default 
default2009-10
default figure of 9.8 million.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultT
defaulthe number of bus journeys per head of population 
defaulti
defaultn 
defaultSomerset has
default decreased from 18.7 
defaultbus 
defaultjourneys
default per 
defaulthead 
defaultof population in
default 2009/10 
defaultto 17.9
default in 2010/11
default and 16.2 in 2011/12
default. 
defaultThis contrast
defaults with
default the upward trend in numbers experienced in most local authorities across the South West and in England as a whole.
default 
defaultSomerset has the 
defaultlowest figure in the 
defaultSouth West and 
defaultone of the
default lowest 
defaultin England.
default However the 
defaultneighbouring
default authorities of Devon and Dorset have 
defaultalso 
defaultshown a slight downturn since 2010/11. 
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultWhilst it is difficult to ascertain an exact correlation it is likely that this decrease in patron
defaultage has arisen due to the reductions in local bus subsidy during the same time frame. Additionally the drop in
default the
default 
defaultreimburs
defaultement rate to the operators for 
defaultconcessionary fares from 70% to 55% is likely to have had a greater impact on rural bus routes where,
default unlike urban areas, there is considerably  less opportunity to generate any additional patronage through the free-fare scheme. It is also likely that the Government’s 20% reduction in Bus Service Operator’s grant may well have had a more adverse 
defaultimpact 
defaulton
default rural routes
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default              
defaultThe net result is that many marginal rural routes have either been withdrawn or curtailed. Across the
default whole
default District there are now no evening bus routes
default after around 6/7pm, 
defaultand only two infrequent routes remain in operation on a Sunday.
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default              
defaultThe
default Focus
default Group
default recognises 
defaultthat it is n
defaulto longer
default possible to continue to subsidise
default bus
default routes where there is little potential of 
defaultachieving a
default realistic degree of viability and 
defaulthence the need for a different approach.
default&#xa0;
default2default              defaultTo what extent are the needs of defaultdifferent groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public tradefaultnsport to isolated communities?default&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultLack of access to transport is a huge issue for many people living 
defaultin rural areas. For those families where there is only one
default, or no
default, vehicle
default and/or limited public transport, it can restrict access to key services such as healthcare
default, education, social activities,
default etc. 
defaultThis particularly impacts on women especially with you
defaultng children.  
default2.2
default              
defaultAccess to support groups for those facing discrimination or other challenges is much more difficult as the groups tend to operate within the larger towns. This particularly impacts on the LGBT community and those with disabilities includ
defaulting people with mental health challenges and those experiencing domestic violence or other forms of harassment.
default2.3
default              
defaultLiving in rural areas poses particular challenges for people with disabilities in accessing education, training, and employment opportunitie
defaults and playing an active role in their communities. Access to transport is crucial and voluntary sector provision or adapted taxis are often very expensive.
default2.4
default              
defaultEvidence shows considerable variability in the provision and availability of services between di
defaultfferent rural 
defaultareas but
default overall, the picture is of under-provision and they are less likely to receive services comparable with their urban counterparts.
default For example, older people in rural areas are likely to receive lower levels of supportive services su
defaultch as domiciliary care and meals on wheels than those living in urban areas, and the general take-up rates for welfare benefits seem lower.
default2.5
default              
defaultYoung people are also significantly 
defaultdisadvantaged
default: whilst they are taken into account where there is a statutory
default requirement e
default.
defaultg
default.
default getting people to school, there is no provision to allow young people to take part in 
defaultextracurricular
default activities and other social networking as they can’t get home afterwards or 
defaulttravel at weekends.  This also impacts on their ability to take part in further training and job search and limits employment opportunities to those accessible by public transport which significantly reduces their opportunities. 
default&#xa0;
default3default              defaultWhat are the main challdefaultenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcomedefault?
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultT
defaulthe cost of 
defaultrail 
defaultinfrastructure
default means t
defaulthat it is not
default cost effective 
defaultwhere 
defaultthe settlements are 
defaultnot 
defaultwithin th
defaulte catchment area for existing routes. In South Somerset there is some potential on the Bristol – Weymouth line if appropriate arrival and departure times were provided at 
defaultstations in the district and a business case establishing the viability of improved t
defaultimetabling has been undertaken on behalf of the Community Rail Partnership.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe b
defaultus 
defaultoffers
default more flexible
default options
default,
default but with major reductions in recent years to the subsidised bus network and the unlikelihood that commercial services will be viable to take their place, the overall bus network of routes has significantly reduced especially in rural areas.
default 
defaultH
defaultistorically t
defaulthe temptation when passenger numbers have dwindled has often been to merge 
defaultroutes
default, however long end to end journey times are often a significant deterrent to travel except for those that have no other alternative
default. Whilst this may achieve a short term savin
defaultg in subsidy costs the net result is often a long and circuitous route and consequently further dwindling numbers.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultA more proactive approach would be 
defaultto develop more community based transport groups such as small parish car schemes or DRT type servi
defaultces that feed into the main arterial commercial bus routes
default. Lincolnshire CC has adopted this type of approach
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultSee also, our answer to the following question.
default&#xa0;
default4default              defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in defaultisolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultCommunity Transport 
defaultcan be very effective
default in delivering transport to isolated communities.
default 
defaultThey
default have local knowledge,
default both of the area and their
default customer
defaults. They can offer a bespoke servi
defaultce often door-to-door for those in most need.
default 
defaultH
defaultowever costs 
defaultto
default the passenger
default,
default funding and resource availability for the operator can be major issues. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultFurther issues arise with the lack of communication and coordination between all transport groups with operators working in isolation of each 
defaultother. At
default best this can result in unintentional duplication and at worse a complete failure for 
defaultsomeone to make a 
defaultjourney
default at their convenience, and thus
default 
defaultthere is potential to improve service delivery through closer partnership working 
defaultbetween
default the transport operators
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultA lack of good transport information can also be a problem for local residents, who often don’t k
defaultnow what services are available to them even where they exist.  Therefore a comprehensive access point where accurate information can be sourced would improve access to community transport.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultThe SST workshops held earlier this year established that
default 
defaultt
defaultransport in itself 
defaultmay 
defaultnot
default be
default the whole solution 
defaultand that 
defaulta mixture of 
defaultstrategies to include providing
default services
default more locally needed to be considered.
default The partnership proposes to set up a pilot to deliver the solutions
default as set out
default below:-
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultThe ma
defaultin purpose is to trial an innovative project to mitigate rural isolation and improve access to essential services through the creation of a community hub. 
defaultThis hub is likely to be the accepted market town for the area with a number of locations within it p
defaultroviding a set of accessible services. These may or may not be co-located depending on natural affinities
default.
default 
defaultSST has identified a number of services that could be delivered more locally, such as Health Clinics, Further Education and Training, Citizens Advice Bureau and Community/Social Housing services.  
default4.6
default              
defaultThe SST will work with the District and County Council
defaults, health and education partners, community facilitators and housing associations to develop a local community package of services that could be provided through this community hub.  
default4.7
default              
defaultA Community Transport scheme
default will act as the catalyst providing affo
defaultrdable transport links to the hub.  Alongside this partners will work with bus operators and community transport groups (including potential community car schemes) to develop an integrated transport infrastructure and a transport hub. Besides increasing ac
defaultcessibility it also offers an opportunity to gain additional patronage on the
default existing
default core 
defaultbus
default and coach
default services serving 
defaultthe hub
default.
default4.8
default              
defaultThe hub will become a one-stop shop for transport solutions
default in that area
default, providing information, booking services and de
defaultlivery through public bus, car schemes, car sharing and community transport.
default Beneficiaries from such a scheme:

default&#xa0;
default5default              defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other defaultdemand-responsive transport services?default&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultThere is, at least initially, a resistance to advance booking the service for any demand responsive or taxi-bus type service, although this can generally be overcome by better education and raising awareness
default.
default 
defaultCost of travel for the passenger can be a major issue, especially for those on low incomes and fixed pensions. Very often (as has been highlighted in the
default 2012
default OFT 
defaultconsultation)
default those in rural communities pay a higher proportion of their income on transpor
defaultt. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultThere
default is 
defaultalso 
defaultthe disparity that often arises 
defaultin respect of
default the ability to 
defaultuse a bus pass. Whilst
default the County Councils have discretionary powers to extend the bus pass scheme to include CT schemes, often budgetary constraints means that this doesn’
defaultt happen or as in Somerset it is offered at reduced rate (50%) with a cap fares for longer journeys (currently £10 in Somerset).  I
defaultn theory it is possible for taxi operators to register a ‘ta
defaultxi bus service’ under the 1985 T
defaultransport
default Act
default and similarly the l
defaultarger Community Transport operators can register a local bus route either under
default section 22
default or a Public Service Vehicle Operator’s licence
default. I
defaultn more remote areas the small community transport 
defaultand
default small taxi operators have been very reluctant to do this. Oft
defaulten they do not have the resources, skills or funds to undertake what they see as a very bureaucratic process
default. 
defaultSimilarly many
default remote
default areas are served by community car schemes, which
default rely on direct payment to the driver to cover costs (usually 45ppm recognised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs). 
defaultThe net result, where such small 
defaultschemes do evolve
default,
default is passengers have to pay often quite high fares where their urban counterparts can travel for free
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6default              defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?default&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultThe main challenge is to overcome the “we’ve always done it this way approach”
default to the provision of
default rural transport. 
defaultWhilst the economic downturn has resulted in a relatively rapid withdrawal of financial support for bus services that had previously seen escalating costs, with little potential for passenger growth; little has been done
default to date
default either in
default South Somerset or nationally to look at options that can mitigate the impact
default of local bus service provision
default often for those groups with the most need. 
default The concept that we have outlined above 
defaultoffers a potential solution to this issue. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultThe low 
defaultpopulation density in most of these areas means
default that the cost per passenger is likely to be high when compared with 
defaultmost
default urban routes. As 
defaultindicated
default above 
defaulttypically all types of Community Transport schemes have evolved on an ad hoc basis to meet 
defaultthe needs o
defaultf their community,
default often in response to the decline or withdrawal of local bus services. Laudable as this is their very nature means they often operate in isolation from each other and 
defaultpublic transport operators. Closer liaison
default means that savings could
default oft
defaulten
default be
default made by the
default CT
default operators and
default with the added potential of increasing patronage on core routes.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultThere is a need to address the disparity between urban and rural areas in respect of the bus pass
default. One option (that’s currently not permitted under th
defaulte 
defaultConcessionary Fare Scheme)
default that we often encounter in feedback from the community is that 
defaulta small flat fare could be levied for bus pass use. The monies raised 
defaultcould then be used to extend the scheme.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultAdditionally the government has made specific pu
defaultblic transport funding available through grant schemes. These
default have
default primarily
default 
defaultbeen 
defaulttargeted at
default 
defaulturban
default areas (
defaulte.g.
default Better Bus 
defaultArea
default &amp; 
defaultthe Green Bus Fund
default)
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultThere is also a 
defaultneed to
default develop services that people will use – ie they go where they need to go when people want them to.
default&#xa0;
default We need to get more flexibility from agencies and services that people go 
defaultto make
default it easier.
default&#xa0;
default For example, more ability to pick appointments in hospitals; 
defaultgrouping services so that in one trip to town, someone can achieve lots of tasks.
default&#xa0;
default We also need agencies like DWP to be more flexible and innovative – for example, using on line tools to verify claimants’ work search; using housing providers or district co
defaultuncil offices to hold Job Centre services rather than expecting those on benefit to travel to the larger towns.
