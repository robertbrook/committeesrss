[normal]Summary of main [bold]points[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]              [bold]How do Government and local authorities identif[bold]y demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Somerset County Council
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]SCC
[normal])
[normal] is the Transport Authority for the South Somerset area
[normal]. However
[normal] 
[normal]South Somerset Together (SST), the 
[normal]strategic partnership for South Somerset
[normal], which includes both SCC and 
[normal]South Somerset District Council (
[normal]SSDC
[normal])
[normal] along with other key stakeholders, 
[normal]has identified the declining access to services in rural areas as a real barrier for a large variety of resident
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]The SST organised w
[normal]orkshops in February and April this year
[normal], 
[normal]which involved local user groups including Parish C
[normal]ouncils, service providers (including Citizens Advice, health, housing, education &amp; training and Sport &amp; Leisure), community and public 
[normal]transport providers. 
[normal]These workshops 
[normal]established a 
[normal]need (and an ability to provide) for some services to be offered in a more central hub
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally 
[normal]the South
[normal] Somerset Citizens Advice Bureau undertook a survey in January
[normal] 2013, which indicated that 
[normal]1 in 3 respondents felt that access to employment and healthcare was poor or very poor.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]D
[normal]etermining actual demand
[normal] is difficult given the wide
[normal] 
[normal]dispersal
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]rural settlements and the varied reasons for travel. What we do know though is that i
[normal]n contrast
[normal] to the overall
[normal] national trend, passenger journeys by bus in Somerset have decreased in the past two years. The county has one of the lowest number of bus trips per population in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]The Department for Transport Publ
[normal]ic Service Vehicle (PSV) Surv
[normal]ey 
[normal]estimates that in 2011-12, there were 8.6
[normal] million bus passenger journeys 
[normal]in Somerset.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his 
[normal]represents a 12% fall
[normal] from the
[normal] 
[normal]2009-10
[normal] figure of 9.8 million.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he number of bus journeys per head of population 
[normal]i
[normal]n 
[normal]Somerset has
[normal] decreased from 18.7 
[normal]bus 
[normal]journeys
[normal] per 
[normal]head 
[normal]of population in
[normal] 2009/10 
[normal]to 17.9
[normal] in 2010/11
[normal] and 16.2 in 2011/12
[normal]. 
[normal]This contrast
[normal]s with
[normal] the upward trend in numbers experienced in most local authorities across the South West and in England as a whole.
[normal] 
[normal]Somerset has the 
[normal]lowest figure in the 
[normal]South West and 
[normal]one of the
[normal] lowest 
[normal]in England.
[normal] However the 
[normal]neighbouring
[normal] authorities of Devon and Dorset have 
[normal]also 
[normal]shown a slight downturn since 2010/11. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst it is difficult to ascertain an exact correlation it is likely that this decrease in patron
[normal]age has arisen due to the reductions in local bus subsidy during the same time frame. Additionally the drop in
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]reimburs
[normal]ement rate to the operators for 
[normal]concessionary fares from 70% to 55% is likely to have had a greater impact on rural bus routes where,
[normal] unlike urban areas, there is considerably  less opportunity to generate any additional patronage through the free-fare scheme. It is also likely that the Government’s 20% reduction in Bus Service Operator’s grant may well have had a more adverse 
[normal]impact 
[normal]on
[normal] rural routes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8
[normal]              
[normal]The net result is that many marginal rural routes have either been withdrawn or curtailed. Across the
[normal] whole
[normal] District there are now no evening bus routes
[normal] after around 6/7pm, 
[normal]and only two infrequent routes remain in operation on a Sunday.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] Focus
[normal] Group
[normal] recognises 
[normal]that it is n
[normal]o longer
[normal] possible to continue to subsidise
[normal] bus
[normal] routes where there is little potential of 
[normal]achieving a
[normal] realistic degree of viability and 
[normal]hence the need for a different approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]              [bold]To what extent are the needs of [bold]different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public tra[bold]nsport to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Lack of access to transport is a huge issue for many people living 
[normal]in rural areas. For those families where there is only one
[normal], or no
[normal], vehicle
[normal] and/or limited public transport, it can restrict access to key services such as healthcare
[normal], education, social activities,
[normal] etc. 
[normal]This particularly impacts on women especially with you
[normal]ng children.  
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Access to support groups for those facing discrimination or other challenges is much more difficult as the groups tend to operate within the larger towns. This particularly impacts on the LGBT community and those with disabilities includ
[normal]ing people with mental health challenges and those experiencing domestic violence or other forms of harassment.
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Living in rural areas poses particular challenges for people with disabilities in accessing education, training, and employment opportunitie
[normal]s and playing an active role in their communities. Access to transport is crucial and voluntary sector provision or adapted taxis are often very expensive.
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Evidence shows considerable variability in the provision and availability of services between di
[normal]fferent rural 
[normal]areas but
[normal] overall, the picture is of under-provision and they are less likely to receive services comparable with their urban counterparts.
[normal] For example, older people in rural areas are likely to receive lower levels of supportive services su
[normal]ch as domiciliary care and meals on wheels than those living in urban areas, and the general take-up rates for welfare benefits seem lower.
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Young people are also significantly 
[normal]disadvantaged
[normal]: whilst they are taken into account where there is a statutory
[normal] requirement e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal].
[normal] getting people to school, there is no provision to allow young people to take part in 
[normal]extracurricular
[normal] activities and other social networking as they can’t get home afterwards or 
[normal]travel at weekends.  This also impacts on their ability to take part in further training and job search and limits employment opportunities to those accessible by public transport which significantly reduces their opportunities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]              [bold]What are the main chall[bold]enges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome[bold]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he cost of 
[normal]rail 
[normal]infrastructure
[normal] means t
[normal]hat it is not
[normal] cost effective 
[normal]where 
[normal]the settlements are 
[normal]not 
[normal]within th
[normal]e catchment area for existing routes. In South Somerset there is some potential on the Bristol – Weymouth line if appropriate arrival and departure times were provided at 
[normal]stations in the district and a business case establishing the viability of improved t
[normal]imetabling has been undertaken on behalf of the Community Rail Partnership.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]The b
[normal]us 
[normal]offers
[normal] more flexible
[normal] options
[normal],
[normal] but with major reductions in recent years to the subsidised bus network and the unlikelihood that commercial services will be viable to take their place, the overall bus network of routes has significantly reduced especially in rural areas.
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]istorically t
[normal]he temptation when passenger numbers have dwindled has often been to merge 
[normal]routes
[normal], however long end to end journey times are often a significant deterrent to travel except for those that have no other alternative
[normal]. Whilst this may achieve a short term savin
[normal]g in subsidy costs the net result is often a long and circuitous route and consequently further dwindling numbers.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]A more proactive approach would be 
[normal]to develop more community based transport groups such as small parish car schemes or DRT type servi
[normal]ces that feed into the main arterial commercial bus routes
[normal]. Lincolnshire CC has adopted this type of approach
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]See also, our answer to the following question.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]              [bold]How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in [bold]isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Community Transport 
[normal]can be very effective
[normal] in delivering transport to isolated communities.
[normal] 
[normal]They
[normal] have local knowledge,
[normal] both of the area and their
[normal] customer
[normal]s. They can offer a bespoke servi
[normal]ce often door-to-door for those in most need.
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]owever costs 
[normal]to
[normal] the passenger
[normal],
[normal] funding and resource availability for the operator can be major issues. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Further issues arise with the lack of communication and coordination between all transport groups with operators working in isolation of each 
[normal]other. At
[normal] best this can result in unintentional duplication and at worse a complete failure for 
[normal]someone to make a 
[normal]journey
[normal] at their convenience, and thus
[normal] 
[normal]there is potential to improve service delivery through closer partnership working 
[normal]between
[normal] the transport operators
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]A lack of good transport information can also be a problem for local residents, who often don’t k
[normal]now what services are available to them even where they exist.  Therefore a comprehensive access point where accurate information can be sourced would improve access to community transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]The SST workshops held earlier this year established that
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]ransport in itself 
[normal]may 
[normal]not
[normal] be
[normal] the whole solution 
[normal]and that 
[normal]a mixture of 
[normal]strategies to include providing
[normal] services
[normal] more locally needed to be considered.
[normal] The partnership proposes to set up a pilot to deliver the solutions
[normal] as set out
[normal] below:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]The ma
[normal]in purpose is to trial an innovative project to mitigate rural isolation and improve access to essential services through the creation of a community hub. 
[normal]This hub is likely to be the accepted market town for the area with a number of locations within it p
[normal]roviding a set of accessible services. These may or may not be co-located depending on natural affinities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]SST has identified a number of services that could be delivered more locally, such as Health Clinics, Further Education and Training, Citizens Advice Bureau and Community/Social Housing services.  
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]The SST will work with the District and County Council
[normal]s, health and education partners, community facilitators and housing associations to develop a local community package of services that could be provided through this community hub.  
[normal]4.7
[normal]              
[normal]A Community Transport scheme
[normal] will act as the catalyst providing affo
[normal]rdable transport links to the hub.  Alongside this partners will work with bus operators and community transport groups (including potential community car schemes) to develop an integrated transport infrastructure and a transport hub. Besides increasing ac
[normal]cessibility it also offers an opportunity to gain additional patronage on the
[normal] existing
[normal] core 
[normal]bus
[normal] and coach
[normal] services serving 
[normal]the hub
[normal].
[normal]4.8
[normal]              
[normal]The hub will become a one-stop shop for transport solutions
[normal] in that area
[normal], providing information, booking services and de
[normal]livery through public bus, car schemes, car sharing and community transport.
[normal] Beneficiaries from such a scheme:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.8.1[bold]              [bold]Residents would benefit from: [bold]4.8.2[bold]              [bold]Transport operators would[bold] benefit from:[bold]4.8.3[bold]              [bold]Community Service[bold] Providers would[bold] benefit from:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]              [bold]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other [bold]demand-responsive transport services?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]There is, at least initially, a resistance to advance booking the service for any demand responsive or taxi-bus type service, although this can generally be overcome by better education and raising awareness
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Cost of travel for the passenger can be a major issue, especially for those on low incomes and fixed pensions. Very often (as has been highlighted in the
[normal] 2012
[normal] OFT 
[normal]consultation)
[normal] those in rural communities pay a higher proportion of their income on transpor
[normal]t. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]There
[normal] is 
[normal]also 
[normal]the disparity that often arises 
[normal]in respect of
[normal] the ability to 
[normal]use a bus pass. Whilst
[normal] the County Councils have discretionary powers to extend the bus pass scheme to include CT schemes, often budgetary constraints means that this doesn’
[normal]t happen or as in Somerset it is offered at reduced rate (50%) with a cap fares for longer journeys (currently £10 in Somerset).  I
[normal]n theory it is possible for taxi operators to register a ‘ta
[normal]xi bus service’ under the 1985 T
[normal]ransport
[normal] Act
[normal] and similarly the l
[normal]arger Community Transport operators can register a local bus route either under
[normal] section 22
[normal] or a Public Service Vehicle Operator’s licence
[normal]. I
[normal]n more remote areas the small community transport 
[normal]and
[normal] small taxi operators have been very reluctant to do this. Oft
[normal]en they do not have the resources, skills or funds to undertake what they see as a very bureaucratic process
[normal]. 
[normal]Similarly many
[normal] remote
[normal] areas are served by community car schemes, which
[normal] rely on direct payment to the driver to cover costs (usually 45ppm recognised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs). 
[normal]The net result, where such small 
[normal]schemes do evolve
[normal],
[normal] is passengers have to pay often quite high fares where their urban counterparts can travel for free
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]              [bold]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The main challenge is to overcome the “we’ve always done it this way approach”
[normal] to the provision of
[normal] rural transport. 
[normal]Whilst the economic downturn has resulted in a relatively rapid withdrawal of financial support for bus services that had previously seen escalating costs, with little potential for passenger growth; little has been done
[normal] to date
[normal] either in
[normal] South Somerset or nationally to look at options that can mitigate the impact
[normal] of local bus service provision
[normal] often for those groups with the most need. 
[normal] The concept that we have outlined above 
[normal]offers a potential solution to this issue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]The low 
[normal]population density in most of these areas means
[normal] that the cost per passenger is likely to be high when compared with 
[normal]most
[normal] urban routes. As 
[normal]indicated
[normal] above 
[normal]typically all types of Community Transport schemes have evolved on an ad hoc basis to meet 
[normal]the needs o
[normal]f their community,
[normal] often in response to the decline or withdrawal of local bus services. Laudable as this is their very nature means they often operate in isolation from each other and 
[normal]public transport operators. Closer liaison
[normal] means that savings could
[normal] oft
[normal]en
[normal] be
[normal] made by the
[normal] CT
[normal] operators and
[normal] with the added potential of increasing patronage on core routes.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]There is a need to address the disparity between urban and rural areas in respect of the bus pass
[normal]. One option (that’s currently not permitted under th
[normal]e 
[normal]Concessionary Fare Scheme)
[normal] that we often encounter in feedback from the community is that 
[normal]a small flat fare could be levied for bus pass use. The monies raised 
[normal]could then be used to extend the scheme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally the government has made specific pu
[normal]blic transport funding available through grant schemes. These
[normal] have
[normal] primarily
[normal] 
[normal]been 
[normal]targeted at
[normal] 
[normal]urban
[normal] areas (
[normal]e.g.
[normal] Better Bus 
[normal]Area
[normal] &amp; 
[normal]the Green Bus Fund
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]There is also a 
[normal]need to
[normal] develop services that people will use – ie they go where they need to go when people want them to.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We need to get more flexibility from agencies and services that people go 
[normal]to make
[normal] it easier.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For example, more ability to pick appointments in hospitals; 
[normal]grouping services so that in one trip to town, someone can achieve lots of tasks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We also need agencies like DWP to be more flexible and innovative – for example, using on line tools to verify claimants’ work search; using housing providers or district co
[normal]uncil offices to hold Job Centre services rather than expecting those on benefit to travel to the larger towns.
