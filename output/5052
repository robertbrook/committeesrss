[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Tony Lloyd
[normal], 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner for 
[normal]Greater Manchester
[normal] [PCC Progress 42]
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.0.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As Police and Crime Commissioner for Greater Manchester, I welcome the Home Affairs Committee’s 
[normal]investigation into
[normal] the work and effectiveness of Commissioners – and the opportunity to make this written submission to the 
[normal]C
[normal]ommittee. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In responding, I have taken each of the key areas identified in your invitation for submissions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effectiveness of C[bold]ommissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Police and Crime P
[normal]lan I 
[normal]have 
[normal]developed aims to empower police and other agencies to work together to build safer communities in Greater Manchester. In an era of austerity, with 
[normal]significant
[normal] cuts to the police service and other bodies, working in partnership
[normal] with other agencies
[normal] is key to delivering effective policing
[normal] and safer communities
[normal]. I have been able to bring partnership agencies toge
[normal]ther in a way that simply did not
[normal] happen before I was elected. Complex issues such as child sexual exploitation or domestic violence are challenges the police 
[normal]cannot
[normal] deal with on their own. And this is where Commissioners can be pivotal. Having one local, democratically-accountable figure who takes a strategic view across both the criminal justice system and the community safety agenda, who brings different agencies together around the table to find better ways of working, is central
[normal] to improving confidence in police and other agencies, and making our communities safer
[normal]. And here in Greater Manchester, this 
[normal]is not just a talking shop – we are
[normal] delivering real change for the people I represent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The neighbourhood policing model also sits at the heart of delivering effective policing, and this is something that the Chief Constable and I are determined to ensure remains embedded into the culture and practice of GMP. I used
[normal] a
[normal] modest increase in the police precept (10p per week for the average bill) to support the frontline. The £3.3m generated from the precept increase has been used to bolster neighbourhood policing, creating new neighbourhood police 
[normal]officers and support staff.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have
[normal] also introduced new ways of holding the police to account. For a long time the target culture 
[normal]was the main way in which police performance could be measured. I believe this is a flawed model, and have
[normal] done away with 
[normal]targets
[normal], preferring instead new, meatier performance reports taking a more rounded view. We examine 
[normal]what crimes are going up, what is
[normal] going down and what the trends are. This helps identify areas where more work is needed and is much more effective than a targets regime. It’s intelligent monitoring of intelligent policing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Alongside this new way to monitor performance, I have introduced parliamentary-style forums which take a detailed look at issues of significant public interest
[normal] (see below)
[normal]. I hav
[normal]e also ensured that the public gets regular opportunities to question directly the Chief Constable and me, for example at public meetings, which I have held throughout Greater Manchester since being elected.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of C[bold]ommissioners in holding their [bold]Chief C[bold]onstables to account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As outlined above, the new style of forum allows the Chief Constable and relevant 
[normal]senior 
[normal]officers and staff to be questioned in detail on issues of significant public interest. Topics we have looked at so far include fraud, police standards and domestic violence and those giving evidence have been questioned not just by me and my deputy, but a by a range of pane
[normal]l
[normal]lists from different walks of life and political persuasions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As another
[normal] example, I recently extended the Chief Constable’s contract for three years and at one of these public forums 
[normal]I asked him to outline
[normal] his vision for GMP in the coming years. He was then questioned by a panel that included journalists, community representatives 
[normal]and the leader of Rochdale Council, who also chairs the Police and Crime Steering Group (see below)
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For performance measurement, in addition to the new-style performance reports which look at GMP as a whole, I recently published similar reports for each of the districts of Greater Manchester. 
[normal]This gives residents the chance to see how police are performing in their own district, in addition to at a Greater Manchester level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of P[bold]olice and[bold] [bold]Crime P[bold]anels in holding their C[bold]ommissioners to account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In Greater Manchester the Police and Crime Panel comprises the nine local authority leaders, Salford City Mayor and two independent members. The seniority of the membership demonstrates how Greater Manchester local authorities value the Commissioner’s role, and demonstrates their commitment to the community safety agenda.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Underpinning the P
[normal]anel is a separate 
[normal]Steering G
[normal]roup which works with my office, po
[normal]lice and partner agencies. The Steering G
[normal]roup conducts specific pieces of joint work
[normal] with police, my office and other agencies. F
[normal]or example
[normal], the G
[normal]roup has secured agreement between police and the 10 local authorities on charging for events on the highway. Shortly it will be working on a shared approach to dealing with domestic violence
[normal]. This allows the P
[normal]anel to concentrate on setting a strategic
[normal] direction for local authority Crime and Disorder P
[normal]artnerships, and focus on scrutinising my work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I believe the model adopted here in Greater Manchester is the right one. The seni
[normal]ority of the membership of the P
[normal]anel allows it to be a truly strategic group, which can also 
[normal]scrutinise
[normal] my work with authority. Having a d
[normal]elivery group underpinning the P
[normal]anel’s strategic overview creates opportunities for further joint working, and – as has been seen here in Greater Manchester – allows for a consensus to be built on issues where agreement has
[normal] previously
[normal] been challenging. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I believe the role of Police and Crime Panels should be reviewed and enhanced. The ultimate sanction against any Commissioner is, of course, the ballot box and it is entirely appropriate that the final say should be the public’s. But there should be further checks and 
[normal]balances in the system to hold C
[normal]ommissioners to account who are not performing or who have strayed vastly from their manifesto. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This 
[normal]cannot
[normal] be used as a way of settling political grudges or playing party politics. A sensible option would be to have a recall function. But this would need to be underpinned by a 
[normal]real, and not synthetic, 
[normal]public appetite, perhaps being activated by public petition
[normal] with a clear minimum threshold
[normal], and must not undermine the democr
[normal]atic legitimacy of the elected C
[normal]ommissioner.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The division [bold]of functions and staff between Commissioners and C[bold]hief [bold]C[bold]onstables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and[bold] Social Responsibility Act 2011[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I have worked closely with GMP to ensure a smooth transfer of staff. 
[normal]I 
[normal]have agreed with GMP that all staff will transfer to 
[normal]the Chief Constable from April.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of C[bold]ommissioner[bold]s in budget and precept setting[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As outlined above, 
[normal]there are significant pressures on police budgets. Greater Manchester Police has
[normal] lost more than 1,000 officers . By 2016 that will have risen to nearly 2,000. By 2017, more than £137m will have been cut from GMP’s budget. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In this challenging climate we have to prioritise and that is why I have focused this year’s precept increase on bolstering neighbourhood policing. This model of policing is a real success story, and both the Chief Constable and I are determined to do all we can to ensure it continues. We cannot return to an era of blue light police response. Neighbourhood policing teams are part of the fabric of communities across Greater Manchester, driving up confidence and helping to keep crime down. By asking for a small additional contribution from the public, we have been able to help secure the neighbourhood policing model.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Within the budget I have also sought where possible to encourage partnership working and funding innovative schemes to reduce demand on police and improve services to victims. So GMP and the NHS are currently running a pilot scheme where there will be immediate and better sharing of information and expertise when police are called to an incident involving an individual with mental health problems. This has been funded from money I have set aside to target mental health and the drain it puts on police resources. As this kind of scheme b
[normal]ears fruit, I am
[normal] confident we can pool more resources with other agencies to try and improve services in a context of shrinking resources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly, I have worked with Victim Support and the NHS to develop a groundbreaking initiative to help get targeted support to victims of domestic violence quickly and at a much earlier point. Domestic abuse specialists will be based in Accident and Emergency units to help NHS staff identify victims domestic violence when they present at hospital and get those victims quickly and appropriately referred to support services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effectiveness of C[bold]ommissioners in promoting local policing priorities[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]My role 
[normal]cannot
[normal] be one where I sit in an of
[normal]fice all day long. I have
[normal] been elected by the people of Greater Manchester and it is really important that I 
[normal]regularly 
[normal]meet as many members of the public 
[normal]as possible.
[normal] So I ensure that 
[normal]I regularly visit 
[normal]HomeWatch
[normal] groups, victims’ groups, major events, formal public meetings, community projects and other events that allow me to meet the public, listen to their concerns and ideas and respond to them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, I have a strong presence on social and new media platforms, regularly participating in 
[normal]webchats
[normal] and responding to questions that have been raised online.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I also generate s
[normal]ignificant media coverage and engagement with local media
[normal] with regular columns in the main papers, and appearances on media outlets. We have also worked in partnerships with the media to get messages out on major issues. For example, in November I ran an awareness month for domestic abuse to get the message out to the public that help is out there for victims and their families.
[normal] This was aimed at combating low levels of reporting domestic violence, demonstrating clearly that police and other agencies will take domestic violence seriously, thereby building confidence for those experiencing it, and demonstrating that we all have a part to play in changing the climate of acceptance that still exists within society generally.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.0.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Progress on establishing colla[bold]boration agreements with other C[bold]ommissioners, policing organisations and partners[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I work closely, and have a good
[normal] relationship, with all of the C
[normal]ommissioners in the North West, meeting regularly and looking for opportunities to work together. For larger forces, collaboration benefits can be more effectively leveraged by 
[normal]working with other agencies within 
[normal]our area, rather than formal agreements with other forces. So, for example, we are developing collaboration agreements on things like design and print services and fleet management with Manchester City Council. There are significant opportunities available to work more closely with local authorities on a range of issues from human resources to finance which I am seeking to develop in the coming year. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However
[normal], effective collaboration does not
[normal] necessitate formal agreements. Informal arrangements can be just as powerful. For example, we have seen the benefits of co-locating council, police and other services in the same building, creating a new way of working that not only drives modest financial savings, but actually helps in the delivery of a better service. I am also developing a local victims’ charter with the rest of the criminal justice system partner agencies in Greater Manchester which will sit alongside the national code, but will be more user-friendly and accessible.

[normal]It should go without saying that any elected representative should be committed to transparency – I am here to represent the people of Greater Manchester and they must be able to see that I am representing them well. All of the information that I am required to publish is on my website and is easily accessible through a simple search function.
