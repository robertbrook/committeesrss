"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Cardiff University with contributions from the Cardiff Women in Science Network (WSC019)1 Executive summary\n&#xa0;\n2 Ca\nrdiff University\nCardiff University is among the top tier of Britain’s research intensive universities and is a member of the Russell Group of Univers\nities. The University has 17 STEM Schools \n(including the School of Medicine) \nwithin two of its three Colleges\n: the College of \nBiomedical and Life Sciences and\n the College of \nPhysical Sciences\n and Engineering\n.\n Of its 27,744 students, 14,754 are in \nSTEM\n (58.3% female, 41.7%male).\n \nThe number of academic staff in STEMM schools are 2065 of which1230 Males (59.5%) and 835 females (40.5%)\nThe University is committed to addressing the historic under-representation of women across the sector at all levels of aca\ndemic employment, and believes that the best way of undertaking this is through embedding equality and diversity into the University culture.\n The university has a structure \nthat \naims to \ntackle stereotyping and gender bias and provide ways to embed equality\n into everyday activities.\n It starts with the Vice Chancellor and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor leading on equality and diversity and implementing a strategic equality plan which includes mandatory equality and diversity training.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3 Information and comments\n on relevant matters\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is often said that there is some kind of built-in bias against women in STEM subjects. Though Cardiff University is not aware of any conscious bias operating in the institution against women in job application and promotion processes, we cannot be certa\nin that no unconscious bias exists. This may be especially the case in that, with the best will in the world, the majority of those making the judgements are likely to be male.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe same may well be true when male academics are mentoring or otherwise suppor\nting more junior \nfemale \ncolleagues and, again in a more or less unconscious way, may identify with those who are male like them. Just as in society generally STEM work and the qualities needed for it are often perceived as a male domain, academics too ma\nn\ny\n, if again unconsciously, share such a perception. This may also apply to the idea that a woman can be a suitable head of department or authority figure.\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuch an idea may be reinforced in female STEM academics by not seeing many women in top academic/rese\na\nr\nch positions \na\nround them who they can aim to emulate. \n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome w\nomen academics\n may also\n effectively have ‘two jobs’, their professional role and \ntheir role in starting a family and looking after its\n members\n.\n This means that being present at work sometimes af\nter ‘normal’ working hours, as academics, including scientists, are often called upon to do, can place \ndisproportionate \nstrain on female scientists. This makes it more likely they will not keep up with male colleagues in producing research\n outputs\n, keeping\n up with their field and \nsubmitting \ngrant applications. So when new posts are advertised or \npromotion applications are made, they may present \nless \nstrong \napplicants \ntha\nn\n some of their male counterparts. \n \n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor reasons to do with \ncaring\n commitments, it is also often difficult for women STEM academics to transfer to new, and perhaps more career-enha\nn\ncing, posts in other places. The fact that \nexpiry of \nfixed-term contracts sometimes actually make\ns\n this \nnecessary\n is a further potential bar \nto career advancement for women. In other words, \nthey\n cannot just ‘up sticks’ at short notice. This is especially troublesome for women in the early part of their careers, when they are most likely to encounter these problems owing to the fixed-term nature\n of external funding and the difficulty of securing posts which give them ongoing contracts of employment.\n In addition, e\nvidence suggest\ns\n that this influences women before the time they actually have these commitments\n.\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of the consequence\ns\n of the above \nissues is that universities \ntend to \nhave on their staff a relatively small number of female professors\n to act as role models\n. This imbalance is unlikely to have a positive impact on \nthe confidence of \nfemale staff seeking to make their \nway in academia\n and\n \nm\nay have\n \na vicious circle effect \nin that\n if\n there are\n no \nfemale academics\n in a particular department, \nfemales\n may not \nchoose to \napply there but go somewhere where the culture already looks more balanced (within or outside academia).\n&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor women taking \nmaternity leave, there is sometimes great pressure to come back as early as possible. This was felt necessary in order for individuals to retain the same teaching duties and administrative responsibilities, and also keep up their publication output or “res\nearch productivity” in this highly competitive arena.\n              \nSome female academics on maternity leave feel pressured to maintain regular contact to continue to run projects, manage their manuscripts within the peer review system, \nand work\n with\n PhD students.\n \n    \n        \n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?\n&#xa0;\n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch tends to show that some women who leave academia \ndue to \nfamily commitments have periods at home before attempting to move into other careers. Both these and others who leave academia for other reasons may move into administrative roles within a higher education institution\n, into science teaching at secondary or\n further education level\n or into roles in business and commerce. In \nall\n cases they are likely to put their scientific training to positive effect by \nusing \ntheir \nscientific knowledge, \nand\n their \nability to view problems \nin general \nfrom an objective, ‘scienti\nfic’ point of view\n.\n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis means that scientifically trained women who leave academia are \nunlikely to be\n lost to\n productive employment and indeed are likely to make important contributions to the educational, social\n,\n business\n and economic\n good of the country\n. However, given the relatively \nlow\n number of women in academic science employment, it is the case that this \nunder-\nrepresentation is exacerbated by every woman who takes the decision to leave scientific academia.\n It also means that the unique contributions\n and perspectives these women could bring to academic science \nare\n lost\n, at the same time representing a missed opportunity to encourage and stimulate the\n scientific aspirations o\nf other\n young \nwomen.\n  \n   \n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat should universities and the higher \neducation sector do to retain woman graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?\n&#xa0;\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThroughout undergraduate \nstudy\n, steps should be taken by institutions and by individual \nuniversity \ndepartments and schools to make \nclear to female science students that their contribution is valued entirely on a par with that of their male counterparts. Any \nsuggestion of gende\nr \nbias in the culture should be addressed at this early stage by thoroughgoing equality and diversity training\n for all staff and by having a system that offer\ns\n support if ever such bias, or indeed discrimination of any kind, seems to manifest itself.\n A contribution towards this would be an ‘inclusive curriculum’ aiming\n \nto support academic schools in reviewing the \ninclusivity and accessibility of their practices in learning, teaching and assessment, and in implementing an action plan to promote equality.\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt goes without saying that this culture should continue at postgraduate level, since this is the point at which \nmany female students will decid\ne\n whether they wish to become paid researchers and make a career in academic science. Their experience at this \nstage\n will therefore be crucial.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOnce female postgraduates are taken into employment, either\n as\n postdoctoral \nresea\nrchers \nand/or as \nlecturers\n, the process whereby their value is clearly demonstrated to them by the institution should continue,  by effective mentoring by either female or male colleagues who are fully and consciously aware of the need \nto \nsupport them and foster their confidence in every area. Universities could also \nconsider the way fixed term appointments are managed and look at alternative options \nto extend them after expir\ny\n, if necessary by the use of bridging arrangements. \n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversitie\ns\n should promote the academic career\n and the many benefits associated with it, such as the flexible working arrangements / generous annual leave entitlement,\n at events to its own undergraduates and PhD students.  \n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversity appointment committees could lo\nok for a new way in measuring the output of an individual, such as normalising by the number of years working in the post, which takes into consideration part-time work and maternity leave. \n This is currently used in evaluating research output in the Rese\narch Excellence Framework (REF)\n.\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs mentioned earlier, women in academia can be \ndisproportionately\n penalised by ‘out-of hours’ working patterns, since they are more likely than men to have caring commitments.\n For this reason, it behoves institutions to take into account the need that women scientists may have to keep ‘regular’ hours and to accommodate work arrangements that allow this. Nor should such accommodation be seen as women receiving particular privile\nges but rather as a necessary quid pro quo for the diversity of talents\n,\n approaches \nand \ninnovation\n \nthat a diverse workforce necessarily brings to a discipline and \nto \nan institution. \n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUniversities should seek to give special prominence to women who have gai\nned positions of leadership and academic authority in the institution in order to provide role models for other aspiring female academics. \n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn a practical level, universities should make sure that events essential for normal participation in academic life \n(meetings, outside lectures, etc.) are held at times of day that are not likely to disadvantage female scientists with family commitments.  \n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExamples of good practice\n at Cardiff University\n:\n \n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the \nretention of women in academic STEM careers?\n&#xa0;\n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCan the government find a way of mitigating the precarious material situation that many postdoctoral and early career science researchers find themselves in? If a central fund were available to offer more secur\ne, or longer-term, employment to these staff it would benefit both men and women. But, crucially, it would almost certainly mean that proportionately a larger percentage of female than male staff would feel sufficiently comfortable not to contemplate the p\nossibility of leaving academic research. This would especially be the case for female staff with family commitments on whom pressure\ns\n can already be great without the added stress of not being sure if contract renewal is likely in the near future.\n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe gove\nrnment could also \nconsider \nset\nting\n up a body to investigate the issue of gender equality\n in the universities\n and the extent to which it is being \nimplemented and \nachieved. Such a body could \npraise, publicise and recompense good practice while sanctioning institutions where unsatisfactory approaches or lack of progress were \nfound\n. \n \n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe same body could also investigate how effectively dedicated schemes for women in science (e.g. Athena SWAN, P\nroject Juno) are being implemented and utilised to change the gender culture of universities and the historic under-representation of women in STEM disciplines.\n22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment could \ninvestigate the possibility of \nrequir\ning\n funding bodies to \nmake the achievemen\nt of a proven demonstrable level of equality and diversity necessary as a condition of full funding awards to those bodies.\n \n23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a positive action measure t\nhe government could help in dismantling the barriers that women face by giving the ‘same opportunity’\n to women as men in \nResearch Councils grant submissions.\n \nThis would mean in cases where grants are evaluated with the same academic score, priority is given to grant where applicants in STEM subjects are female or from a minority group. \n24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment could \ninvestigate the possibility of having\n some kind of adjustment for people who have taken periods of leave/career breaks to care for family members. This would apply equally to men and to women.\n25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment could investigate the possibility of funding mentori\nng and networking opportunities to set up these networks\n.\n&#xa0;\n4 Recommendations\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nSee Monash\n University system as outlined in paper ‘How many papers is a baby worth ?’.
