"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Reptile &amp; Exotic Pet Trade Association (REPTA)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPREAMBLE&#xa0;\nThe Reptile &amp; Exotic Pet Trade Association (REPTA) was formed in 2005 to represent the interests of the \nUK\n reptile &amp; exotic pet industry. Its primary objectives are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nREPTA predominately works with issues relating to the trade of reptiles and amphibians, but also promotes responsible keeping of so-called exotic pets, including primates and other taxa. The \nUK\n has a long tradition of keeping reptiles and amphibians in captivity and with trade, with records dating back to the 1600’s and today in the \nUK\n more than a million households keep in excess of eight million reptiles and amphibians. The reptile industry is valued at over two hundred and fifty million £ annually and significant numbers of other non-traditional, or exotic, species are also kept as companion animals.  \n&#xa0;\nThe trade in reptiles as pets is dominated by captive bred animals, with some 90% of the trade in 2013 comprising of such animals.  Species such as bearded dragons, leopard geckos, corn snakes and royal pythons are now regarded as domesticated species and form part of the mainstay of the general pet trade, no being longer regarded as specialist species. The reptile market is now dominated by relatively few commonly produced species but specialists have also kept over 3,600 species and subspecies, many of which have been bred in captivity, which have been legally traded in the passed ten years.  \n&#xa0;\nClearly the exotic pet trade could be a pathway for invasive species and as such it is a matter taken very seriously by the industry.  REPTA has participated in both EU and \nUK\n working groups concerning this draft legislation.  \n&#xa0;\nOVERVIEW OF INVASIVE SPECIES &#xa0;\n1)  The issue of invasive species is entirely of man’s making, be it by deliberate introduction of species for ornamental purposes, such as Japanese’s knotweed, or unintentional release e.g. as mitten crabs. Whatever the means of introduction, the irrefutable fact is non-native species may be introduced as a result of human activity. The problems could potentially escalate with increasing mobility of humans and exploitation of global resources.\n&#xa0;\n2)  In 1860 an organisation called ‘The Society for Acclimation of Animals, Birds, Fishes, Insects and Vegetables within the \nUnited Kingdom\n’ (The Acclimation Society) was formed.  Its objectives were to establish as many non-native (alien species) in the \nUK\n as possible, be it for practical reasons such as for food, or purely for ornamental purposes.   The society ran for many years and made numerous attempts to establish new species and was not alone in these endeavours, one of the principle objectives of the Zoological Society of London formed in 1826, being ‘to introduce new and useful animals to \nBritain\n. Almost all attempts to introduce non-natives were unsuccessful which clearly demonstrates that most species actually pose little or no threat. \n&#xa0;\n3)  Deliberate introduction is now no longer acceptable and the single biggest pathway for alien species to move globally is now, potentially, via importation of food.  The volumes of fresh produce (fruit &amp; vegetables) moved on a daily basis around the globe is considerable and with trade on such a large global scale comes a high risk of transporting unwanted passengers (flora and fauna) and pathogens. \n&#xa0;\n4)  Many thousands of species of flora and fauna are also moved around the globe for other purposes, of which the pet trade is just one factor. The value and international significance of the global trade in flora and fauna should not be underestimated when considering any impact assessment of restrictive lists. Most species have been traded for many years (or even centuries), and have posed absolutely no problem to native ecology and cannot be viewed as a significant risk. Calls for cessation of trade for the purposes of carrying out risk assessment would, therefore, in the vast majority of cases, be entirely disproportionate and unnecessary. Rather than consider blanket bans, it would be more appropriate to introduce an approved list to include species traded safely over the years. Inclusion of species should be based on sound practical knowledge and experience, with significant input from those involved with the global movement of species, including importers.  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;DEFINING INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES &#xa0;5)  \nOne of REPTA\n’s\n primary concern is defining \nthe difference between an ‘alien’ species and an ‘invasive alien’ species, a critical factor that is not sufficiently addressed in the draft regulations, which allows NGO’s to exploit the legislation for ulterior political objectives. The Commission does, however, acknowledge that or an estimated 12,000 non-native species within \nEurope\n, only 10-15% are considered invasive with the potential to cause harm.\n&#xa0;\n6)  \nMany species may survive in \nan\n environment\n to which they are not native\n but will not become invasive. \nI\nn the \nUnited Kingdom\n, for example,\n the red-eared terrapin \nTrachemys scripta elegans\n is\n,\n regrettably\n,\n a species \nestablished in the natural environment through deliberate release, but is unable to breed in our climate and cannot be considered invasive. In parts of southern Europe, for example \nSpain\n and \nItaly\n, the situation, however, the climate is very different and this species has clearly become invasive.  This situation \nclearly demonstrates the need for individual member states to adopt appropriate lists, rather than EU wide directives, in the respect of species of European concern. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;POSITIVE LISTS v NEGATIVE LISTS &#xa0;\n7)  A Positive List, or White List, is a list of species which are permitted and if a species is not listed it is excluded (prohibited) whilst a Negative List, or Black List, is a list of species specifically prohibited.    \n&#xa0;\n8)  In recent years there has been a significant push from the Animal Rights movement that a Positive List of species permitted to be kept by private keepers should be imposed.  Superficially the benefit of a Positive List may appear logical, but the reality is a stark contrast and such a list would be highly detrimental to the welfare of captive animals.  Positive Lists limit the number of species kept in captivity which does not equate to good welfare and driving a species into extinction that thrives in captivity is not a benefit to conservation.\n&#xa0;\n9)  The EU IAS Regs. originally proposed a Positive List approach but this was soon discarded in favour of a much more sensible, proportionate and pragmatic Negative List which  REPTA emphatically supports.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nINVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES OF UNION CONCERN&#xa0;\n11)  The concept of a list of species of union concern (a Negative List) is fully supported by REPTA, as is the capping of the number of plants or animals that may be listed.  The number of species (50) does, however, appear low in comparison to the number of known alien species (12,000).  \n&#xa0;\n12)  Ideally there should be no arbitrary number or a limit. Any limits should be defined by the criteria used, the need for proportionality and the requirement to ensure enforcement resources are used to best effect.  Unfortunately such an approach is likely to be exploited, making a cap on numbers necessary.  A compromise would be to raise the number to a cap of 100 species which would be in line with the DAISIE (\nDelivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe\n) overview of IAS in \nEurope\n.\n&#xa0;\nONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL &#xa0;\n13)  EU member states encompass a wide range of bio-graphical zones, with habitat types ranging from sub-Arctic to semi-tropical. The likelihood of species becoming invasive is entirely dependent on its suitability to its habitat and climate and an EU-wide approach would, therefore, be entirely inappropriate. Controls applied EU-wide, as with the suggested list of 50 species proposed, would not take into account differing conditions across the region and member-state specific controls, or zonal or regional, regulations would be a more workable and practical approach. \n&#xa0;\n14)  Most reptiles and amphibians in trade, for example, could not survive in the \nUK\n climate for extended periods and the vast majority could not breed and thus establish. The vast majority of species, therefore, pose no risk and should not be included on restrictive lists.\n&#xa0;\n15)  Even if species pose little or no risk, public awareness of the problems of alien invasive needs to be considered and the message that no flora or fauna should be released into the environment, deliberately or accidentally, should be reinforced strenuously. Education of the public in this respect is of paramount importance.     \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCONCERN FOR PROHIBITED SPECIES &#xa0;\n16)  It is absolutely inevitable that some species kept by private keepers will be banned (added to restrictive lists) and the manner in which this will be administered once the legislation is ratified is a major concern.  Provision is made in: \nArticle 26\n (\nTransitional provisions for non-commercial owners\n), although each \nMember\n \nState\n will be responcible for its administation.  \n&#xa0;\n17)  \nThe concern is not just restricted to the welfare of the animals subject to \nres\nt\nriction (\nban\n)\n, but also the potential ramifications \nof\n deliberate release\n following imposed controls\n.  \nT\nhe species \nwhich is possibly the cause \nof greatest concern is the racoon \nProcyon lotor\n, native of North America but now widespread in \nGermany\n and parts of \nFrance\n.  The establishment of racoons in \nEurope\n was not from escaped pets, rather deliberate release for hunting purposes and escapes from fur farms. The number of racoons kept as pets in the \nUK\n is unknown, but research by REPTA suggests there are many hundreds, if not several thousand animals. If racoons (or indeed any species kept as a pet) are the subject of prohibitions imposed by the EU, \nUK\n authorities must be prepared in advance and work with industry and keepers to make the transition as smooth as possible. Keepers, and indeed the British public, will not tolerate the mass slaughter of pets simply to comply with EU Regulations. \n&#xa0;\n18)  The greatest concern for REPTA is if (when) species kept as pets (companion animals) are banned if existing keepers cannot comply with new regulations, they may be pressured into releasing their animals, rather than risk having them destroyed.  There is anecdotal evidence this happened with the introduction of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act in 1976 as it has repeatedly been suggested that large cats now prowl the countryside as a result of animals released by owners that could not comply with the new legislation.\n&#xa0;\n19)  There is also an issue with animals held as “commercial stock”, which is addressed by Article 27 of the proposed deals. It has been proposed that traders holding animals considered “Invasive species of Union concern” would be granted two years in which to dispose of stock acquired before listing to zoos or conservation projects. This would, however, have a negative impact on their livelihood which be given due consideration.\n&#xa0;\nPATHWAYS&#xa0;20)  There are many means by which s\npecies are intr\noduced to alien environments, some intentional (deliberate release for food, hunting, ornamental purposes) and some not escapees, flora spreading from parks and gardens. The global trade in pets is a very obvious vector for the spread of non-native species, but actually forms a small part of international trade in wildlife. This trade is actually highly visible and subject to high levels of control, with imported specimens requiring to pass official scrutiny and inspection when entering the EU.\n&#xa0;\n21)  REPTA fully supports reasonable and proportionate controls on importation of flora and fauna but feels that current \nUK\n legislation is sufficient and there is no requirement for increased control\n. REPTA has, however, advocated that commercial importers of reptiles and amphibians should be licensed (regulated) which would be another means of controlling movement of potential I\nA\nS.  Anyone can currently import live reptiles and amphibians, although all such imports are strictly regulated in terms of standards of packing to ensure welfare needs are met and legality of species traded. A system by which commercial importers are licensed would be highly desirable, as it would ensure the importer has adequate and secure facilities from which no I\nA\nS could inadvertently be released into the environment.\n           \n  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;ENGAGING INDUSTRY&#xa0;22)  T\nhe \nWorld Trade Organisation (WTO)\n \nrecommends \nemphasis\ning\n the need to raise public awareness\n of issues connected with invasive species\n and engage with industry bodies\n in order to achieve this objective\n. \nREPTA would suggest that the pet industry have long been aware of the problems and have made significant advances in restricting trade in inappropriate species, such as red-eared terrapins. \n&#xa0;\n23)  Almost 50% of \nUK\n households own pets and the industry can, therefore, play a valuable role in educating the public as to the potential problems caused by invasive species. Most reptiles and amphibians kept as pets (companion animals) in the \nUK\n do not pose a problem if they are introduced, either intentionally or accidentally, into the environment. Owners should, however, be encouraged to adopt a responsible attitude and ensure all reasonable efforts are made to ensure pets are kept securely at all times. Restrictive lists, and subsequent deliberate release of animals by owners who do not wish their pets to be destroyed, is likely to be a major problem.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHISTORIC ISSUE &#xa0;\n25)  Historic issues have largely been behind introduction of alien species to the \nUK\n, an issue which has been largely ignored during the development of the EUI IAS Regulations. As stated earlier, in the mid nineteenth centaury The Acclimation Society endeavoured to establish many alien species without any apparent success and records \nfrom the 1950’s to the early 1970’s show that a number of private keepers routinely tried to establish many European species of reptiles and amphibians in the UK, again largely unsuccessfully.  \n&#xa0;\n26)  With the benefit of hindsight, such endeavours were unwise, although not unlawful at the time, and it is important that this is recognised.  It is also important to recognise that government itself \nwas implicit in the introduction of alien species.  \n&#xa0;\n27)  \nFor a protracted period there was a trade in garden centres for amphibians \nintended \nfor release into\n garden\n ponds, much as there is \nstill \na trade for fish \n(\nnative or exotic\n (e.g. \ngoldfish)\n)\n.  After the \ng\nreat crested newt \nTritu\nr\nus cristatus\n was \nafforded \nprotect\nion\n under the Wildlife and Countryside Act trade \nwas \nprohibited\n and\n the Italian Great crested newt \nTriturus carniflex\n \nwas offered for sale as an alternative.  For nearly a decade hundreds, if not thousands, of \nItalian \ng\nreat crested newt\ns were sold annually for release into garden ponds and could potentially have become established in the \nUK\n.  \n&#xa0;\n28)  \nSimilarly\n,\n for many years American bull frog \nLithobates (Rana) catesbeianus\n tadpoles were commonly available from garden centres for release \ninto ponds and tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of tadpoles were imported and sold legally.  These two species are widely reported as examples of why IAS legislation is necessary, although the latter has never become widely established in the \nUK\n (despite the vast numbers which were introduced). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCONCLUSIONS&#xa0;\n29)  REPTA favours the Commission’s approach of a list of harmful species to tackle, rather than a list of safe species which would not be restricted.\n&#xa0;\n30)  Trade in reptiles, amphibians and other exotic species for the pet trade is currently well regulated and subject to scrutiny. Further restrictions would, therefore, be deemed unnecessary. The licensing of animal importers would, however, ensure that import facilities were secure and fit for purpose, thus reducing risk of inadvertent introduction of alien species.\n&#xa0;\n31)  Greater public awareness of the problems caused by non-native species is required and the pet industry should endeavour to raise the profile of the issue.\n&#xa0;\n32)  Controls such as those in place in \nScotland\n, where it is an offence to release animals “outside their native range”, should be considered as a UK-wide initiative, although inadvertent release (escaping) of pet animals may be an issue. A point of particular contention would presumably be posed by domestic cats, millions of which are deliberately introduced into the environment as a matter of course.\n&#xa0;\n33)  Any list of restricted species should be based on sound reason and practical scientific evidence, and not speculative opinion. \n&#xa0;\n34)  Regional or zonal lists would be preferable to an EU-wide approach which would not take heed of bio-geographical diversity across member states. The \nUK\n should consider a adopting a single-state approach reflecting its relatively isolated situation and reduced risk of spread from neighbouring countries. \n&#xa0;\n35)  Placing restrictions on species widely kept as pets (e.g. raccoons) would almost certainly lead to widespread mass release, thus compounding the problem this initiative is designed to deal with.\n&#xa0;\n36)  Any additional legislation and/or trade restrictions should be proportionate and appropriate.\n&#xa0;\n13 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
