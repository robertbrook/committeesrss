[[[Written evidence submitted by the Society of Biology (WSC074)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Society of Biology is a single unified voice, representing a diverse membership of individuals, learned societies and other organisations. We are committed to ensuring that we provide Government and other policy makers - including funders of biological education and research – with a distinct point of access to authoritative, independent, and evidence-based opinion, representative of the widest range of bioscience disciplines.  &#xa0;The Society welcomes the interest of the Committee and is pleased to offer these comments structured around the four main questions set out by the inquiry and gathered in consultation with our members, member organisations and advisors.
