"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dr. Rebecca Dingo, Associate Professor at the University of Missouri, USA.Executive Summary:\nIntroduction:\n[1] \nI am an Associate Professor with tenure in Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of Missouri, USA. I write as a \nscholar/\nresearcher who \nhas spent the last 10 years examining global gender and disability policy arguments and development programmatic plans developed by international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank, national governments, and NGOs.  I am trained in \ngender\n and development, transnational and international feminisms, and rhetorical methods. \nI also have experience working in the newly \nestablished \ninternational\n \nscholarly field of disability s\ntudies.  \nThis training and my research has a\nfforded me an \nimportant\n birds-eye view of various development progr\nam outcomes across the world; I\n make recommendations based on looking at outcome trends across these programs. My scholarship has addressed the relationship between language used in development policy an\nd \nprograms and their material outcomes.  \n[2] \nM\ny response importantly takes seriously that the language we use to describe and promote development\n agendas,\n goals\n,\n and plans has a deep history and often conjures up specific ideological meanings beyond what \nan author\n/committee\n may (or may not) intend. \nFor example,\n notions of “normalcy” and “disability” are not formed by objective fact but through discourse—or any spoken or written language in use as a social practice. Discourses draw from ideologies that are \noften unquestioned and presumed to be naturalized and commonsense. \nThis means that when people use words such as \n“\nnormalcy\n,”\n \n“\ndisability\n, “mainstreaming,” and “inclusion”\n they draw upon\n \ncommonplace social ideas that are deeply tied to longstanding social b\neliefs. \nA\ns disability scholar, \nJong-Gu Kang \n(2009) \nexplains\n discourses of disability are power-laden con\nstructs that privilege the able-bodied/mind\n majority\n and their ways of being\n. \nIn short, disability is a social construct rather than a natural fact and steps need to be taken to analyze a communities’ normative interpretation of bodily difference \n(Foley, 2009) \nbecause disability is\n \n“\nimplicit in cultural representation, in language a\nnd in socialization\" (Shakespeare, 1994\n) and\n \n“\nour realities revolve around the culturally ascribed dominate meanings of differences and how they irrevocably impact lives\n”\n (Gallagher, 2001).\n[3] \nFor this reason\n, I also take seriously that notions of what is\n a disability and what is not \na disability \ntends to manifest\n in language as \ntaken-for-granted \nobjective fact\n. \nWidely held\n perceptions\n of disability have persisted (albeit such discourses subtly change throughout time) through social, political, cultural, a\nnd even economic and geopolitical interactions and arrangements. As a result, policies and programs may promote ways of thinking and ways of practicing that continue to misunderstand and misrepresent the needs of \npeople with disabilities (PWD)\n, stigmatize \nthem,\n and ultimately disempower them.\n \n[4] \nDisability Studies scholars tend shun the medical model of disability that \nspeaks of and treats\n disability as a pa\nthology to cure or overcome (\ne.g. Garland-Thompson\n, 2005\n)\n. T\nhis model tends to talk about individual “impairments,” “cures,” “deficiencies,” and “illness”, for example, over \nthe socio-culturally negative attitudes and stigmas and the political, and \nphysical \nsystemic barriers that are the main contributing factors i\nn disabling people\n. While mainstreaming and inclusion policies do not necessarily promote a medical model, they do emphasize that a PWD must fit into the mainstream instead of the mainstream changing to fit them. \nDisability studies also draws attention to \nthe fact that \nPWD\n \nenhance our communities not only through their participation\n in public life, \nbut also by demonstrating alternative means of\n being and doing\n that are often useful for the wider community (e.g. wheelchair ramps help people pushing children \nin strollers and people who have short-term leg or knee injuries and can prevent knee injuries; lights at corners that beep and have visual cues help all people cross the street more safely). \n&#xa0;\n[5] \nAs a result, disability studies scholars and activists ten\nd to embrace a social-cultural view of disability as just another part of the diversity of the human condition\n. They point out that \nmany of us who are\n currently\n able bodied, \nwill\n become disabled later\n as we age\n and then become dependent on our communities for care\n. \n \nT\nhey also promote that the notion of  “disability” is, of and in itself, a cultural construct or \ninterpretation that\n often varies across time, \nplace\n, and situation\n.  \nThis final point is crucial to my\n recommendations and comments on mainstreaming and inclusion programs because it draws attention to how current geopolitical arrangements \nimpact how we understand and create disability and development programs and why they are often unsustainable for the d\nevelopment organizations and \nPWD\n.  \n&#xa0;\nBackground\n &amp; Evidence\n:\n \n[6] \nM\nainstreaming and inclusion \nmay \nappear to be viable \ndevelopment \nstrategies\n \nfor alleviating poverty among \nPWD because \nthey attempt to put PWD on equal footing and with equal treatment with peo\nple with\nout disabilities.  Yet\n, \nresearch of\n several disab\nility and development \ninitiatives\n across t\nhe world suggest that programs\n promoting only mainstreaming and inclusion do not get at the heart of why \nPWD\n \ncontinue to \ncomprise 20% (U.N. 2006) of those in poverty across the world. \nThe background and evidence I offer does not come from on-the-ground calculated data as many policy briefs and analyses do. As my article, “Making the Unfit, Fit” makes clear, development pract\nitioners must be careful of the language they use so that they do not continue to forward the very conditions that constrain PWD ability to part\nicipate in their communities\n \nand\n they must be mindful of the geopolitical contexts that impact PWD’s local circu\nmstances\n.  \nFor this reasons, I wish to highlight three problems I have with some mainstreaming and inclusion models:\n[7] \nThese\n models\n can further \nproduce \nstigma against \nPWD\n since the onus to enter the mainstream in these programs is often constructed as a choice to be made by a PWD who may already have constrained choices due to the aforementioned pr\noblems\n.\n  Crucially\n, a\ns disability studies \nscholar Harlan Han \n(1997) \nmakes clear, “the unemployment rate of disabled adults may be traced to broad economic forces rather than\n individual impairments” (p. 17\n). \nHan’s\n findings \nhighlight the need to look beyond impairment and \ndemonstrates the importance for development programs to recognize and promote \nunderstanding disability through \nthe social model\n-- \nand even what I would\n describe as a contextual model--\n \nby identifying and cre\nating programs that confront \nsystematic barriers\n (physical, social, cultural, economic\n,\n and geopolitical),\n negative attitudes, and social exclusion (purposefully or inadvertently)\n to \npublic participation\n. \n[8] Moreover, the social model of disability sugge\nsts that attempts to fix or cure the disability without addressing how the wider community\n \ntreats \nPWD\n can lead to further stigma and even social exclusion \neven while attempting to be inclusive\n. When \nPWD\n are constantly being told their bodies/minds and ways\n of being need to change to be included into the mainstream this can cause low self-esteem\n on the part of the \nPWD\n and continued stigmatization\n by people without disabilities\n. \nSuch thinki\nng also crucially ignores\n the social, \ngeo\npolitical, and economic reaso\nns that \nPWD\n are unable to participate fully in the mainstream\n (Meekosha\n, 2011\n)\n.  \n[9] \nMainstreaming and inclusion policies tend to focus on \nthe individual with a disability being able be a part of a mainstream community\n instead of \naddressing \nthe way that social and economic factors and practices are what actually makes a person disabled.  \nThese social and economic factors vary across locale, region, and nation.  \nIn contrast, the social/contextual model of disability\n see\ns\n that people can become\n disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs.  These resources can be monetary but they can also include\n[10] \nIn Karr’s \n(2011) \ncomparative\n study of \nQOL\n \nindicators\n \nfor PWD \nin three different \ncountries with very different his\ntories and geopolitical relationships\n (the US, Nepal, and Zambia) she found that \ngenerally across\n \neach country \nPWD\n indicated that access \nto \ncommunities/structures \nthat allow \nPWD\n to practice self-determination and that value \nPWD\n ability to use their resources and knowledge capacity to pursue their interests\n ranked as the highest indicator\ns\n for \nQOL\n.  \n[11] \nYet, \nQOL\n can differ across culture\n and \nQOL\n can be affected by local \ncircumstances\n.  \nIn Western countries that value independen\nce, QOL may include living in their own homes, in \nregions that value collectivity, QOL may mean participating in community decision making.  \nFor this reason,\n I advocate for a slight revision of the social model of disability that I call the contextual mode\nl\n of disability\n.  \n[12] \nThis \ncontextual \nmodel follows \nboth feminist approaches to political economy and transnational practices (Dingo\n 2012\n) and \nMeek\nosha’s \n(2011) \nstudy of indigeneity, disability, and colonialism in Australia\n. It also\n \ntakes \nthe following \ninto account \n[13] \nDisability activist and scholar Helen\n \nMeekosha \n(2011) \nstates, “Disability is produced in the violence a\nnd war that is provoked by the North, either directly or indirectly, [and] in the struggle over the control of miner\nals, oil and economic resources\n”\n (668).\n \nFor example, i\nn regions of Central Africa where precious metals are mined, for example, people have \nlittle choice in work and that work is often dangerous, poorly paid, and produces disabilities \nthrough work conditions, poverty, \nand violence. \n \nIn other words,\n \ns\nimply speaking about mainstreaming and including \nPWD\n,\n does not get the wider contexts of poverty\n.  For \nthis reason, Meekosha\n (2011)\n suggests\n paying attention to “social suffering in order to understand “disabling and distressing events that have occurred on large and communal scale” \n(p. 670) \nin \npoor nations.\n She advocates the development of frameworks and measurements for \nunderstand\ning\n \nand addressing \nthe collective sufferings of the world’s \npoorest \ndisabled peoples\n.\n[14] \nL\nastly, in relationship to social and contextual models of disability,\n the practice and d\niscourse of mainstreaming and inclusion have both material and linguistic constrains that directly impact \nPWD\n and can lead to short-sighted development programs\n over long-term sustainable development\n.  \nPost the 2004 Disability and Development conference hosted by the World Bank, \ndisability activists began to have a formal presence on the World Bank’s Disability and Development website.  Since then there has been a notable recognition how stigma works on \nmany levels ranging from language practices and their work on the psyche to actual fu\nnding opportunities for PWD.  For example, as\n noted in an article by \nFlavia Nakabuye Bwire, George Mukasa, \nand \nRoy Mersland\n (2009), notions of mainstreaming and inclusion \ncannot work if there is not work on the social and cultural stigmas against PWD.  \nIn\n their study of a Ugandan microlending d\nevelopment initiative they show\n how despite the intentions of “mainstreaming” PWD into micro-lending programs, for example, prevaili\nng ideologies about PWD kept lenders from reaching out to this population.  Likewise, if they did, lenders tended to make special programs for PWD and in doing so privileged microlending plans that were unsustainable \nfor the person taking the loan \nonce the\n loan period ended. Notably, they found that many banks and \nlending \nNGOs chose not to lend to PWD because they believed the following: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n[15] \nAlong these same lines, because many microlending agencies rely upon solidarity groups or village banks, due to stigmatization, local community members also believed th\nese same stigmas and discouraged agencies from reaching out to PWD.  As Bwire et als\n (2009)\n, make clear in their findings, such stigmas not only limit important business opportunities for the wider community and the lending agency, they also “\nfail to pract\nice the double bottom line policy of reaching both financial and social objectives, which nearly all \nmicro-finance agencies\n claim\n”\n \nto be part of. \nA contextual model of \ndisability\n takes into account how mainstreaming and inclusion programs \nmust address wide\nr contexts, such as addressing how a community talks about and makes presumptions about PWD within local contexts. \nThe \nUganda project \nwas somewhat successful because\n the program \nrelied on community members (some with disabilities)\n to actually \ntrain lenders\n how \nto\n interact with \nPWD\n. This program was unique because it worked against common practices of mainstreaming and inclusion of PWD and instead focused on the changing the mainstream to be more inclusive. \nRecommendations:\n[16] \nSince the World Bank’s 2004 \nDisabil\nity and Development conference\n, long-term studies examining disability and development initiatives out of specific countries such as Bangladesh, India, Uganda, Serbia, the US, Nepal, Australia, Zambia, and Cuba (to name a few) \nindicate\n that programs\n that merely employ mainstreaming and inclusion efforts often re-marginalize \nPWD\n.  \nSuch\n programs promote \nmainstreaming \nwork and education related activities that target the people with the disability\n.\n \n Yet, these programs\n \ndo \nnot \naddress\n:\n[17] \nThese all impact\n the physical and mental environment of people with and without disabilities. Moreover, the sorts of \nmainstreaming and inclusion \nwork activities available to \npeople in poor nations can be dang\nerous and create more disabilities\n and/or are dangerous for \nPWD\n. \nBased on a birds-eye-view of disab\nility and development programs\n \nthis evidence submission\n has\n fo\ncused\n on shifting programs\n away from a sole focus on mainstre\naming, inclusion, and rehabilitation \nof \nPWD\n \nand instead to emphasize the following:\n \nDisability and development programs should\n[18] \nMainstreaming and inclusion initiatives tend to emphasize the need for people disabilities to change themselves so that they can participate equally with peopl\ne who do not have disabilities.\n Such priorities place the onus for \nPWD\n to develop skills and habits on par with their non-disabled community members.  And in most cases, due to physical or psychological barriers, people with disability are (like many who are marginalized) are unable to \nparticipate in the mainstream on equal footing without significant changes to the environment and to ideologies and expectations about “normal” ways of being verses “abnormal” ways of being.  In some cases, programs that have only emphasized work or educat\nion related activities and microloans aimed to teach \nPWD\n how to participate in the formal labor sector, have resulted in further stigmatization.  Such plans in and of themselves are not wholly problematic but they miss the fact that the people without disa\nbilities that people with whom \nPWD\n interact may hold deeply ingrained stigmas against those \nPWD\n. Simply providing formal work and educational opportunities to \nPWD\n makes it easy for NGOs, microlenders, and development practitioners to continue to marginaliz\ne (via their expectations\n and ignoring of contextual issues\n) \nPWD\n in these settings.  Likewise, stigma operates deep in the psyche and is often reinforced by language and ideology so that even development experts, NGO practitioners, and micolenders might pr\nesume that \nPWD\n have not cultivated important educational expertise, knowledge, abilities, or practices that might already make them employable, able to pay back loans, begin businesses, and participate in their communities.  \nCitations:\nBwire,\n F.N.\n Mukasa\n,\n G.\n, \nand \nMersland\n, R. \nAccess to Mainstream Microfinance Services \nfor Persons with Disabilities — Lessons Learned from Uganda. \nDisability Studies Quarterly, 29 \n(1). \nRetrieved from http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/168/168.\nDingo, R.
