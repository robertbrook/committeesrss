"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSam \nKuper\n (CYS0083)\n&#xa0;\nAs a citizen of the UK, who uses cycling as his primary form of transport, I am writing in a personal capacity. I wish to make two points:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPoint 1\n=======\n&#xa0;\nThe following document was commissioned by the Department for Transport:\n&#xa0;\nTitle:     \nDriversâ\n€™ perceptions of cyclists Authors:   L \nBasford\n; S Reid; T Lester; J Thomson; A \nTolmie\n Date:      01/01/2002 Reference: TRL549 ISBN:      1-84608-548-9 ISSN:      0968-4107\n&#xa0;\nIt addresses issues central to your committee's concerns. Your committee should not conclude until every member has read that document. It is only 38 pages long, so thi\ns should be quite manageable.\n&#xa0;\nFor convenience, I note that the document has been mirrored at: http://www.southamptontriclub.co.uk/storage/TRL549.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPoint 2\n=======\n&#xa0;\nIt is better for the committee to take a little longer, and to draw sound conclusions, \nthan for the committee to conclude sooner and draw invalid conclusions.\n&#xa0;\nAdditionally, it is dangerous to draw conclusions on a topic from a position of ignorance in relation to that topic.\n&#xa0;\nThere are many forms of ignorance. The Transport Select Committee\n on cycling safety, in taking (ostensibly) knowledge-based submissions from a range of stakeholders, is trying to reduce the ignorance of its members, to improve the quality of the eventual findings of the committee. That is laudable.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, as the foll\nowing two articles makes clear, several members of the Transport Select Committee on cycling safety lack - and apparently are likely to remain lacking - in not only knowledge but also in recent and extensive *experience* relating to cycling on the public h\nighway in the UK.\n&#xa0;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/dec/03/transport-committee-cycling http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2013/dec/05/cyclists-select-committee-london\n&#xa0;\nUnless that is remedied, the committee's conclusions \nwill be made from a position of significant ignorance, no matter how extensively the committee consults. Fortunately, this is easily and inexpensively remedied - assuming that the committee members are sincere in their desire to understand the dangers cycl\nists face.\n&#xa0;\nI therefore propose the committee adopts the following rule:\n&#xa0;\nBefore any contribution from a member of the Transport Select Committee on cycling safety can be included in the committee's written findings, that member must prove that he or she h\nas:\n&#xa0;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ntravelled, by pedal cycle, on each of at least 100 days of the preceding 365 days, a distance of at least one mile on the public highway in the UK; and\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ntravelled\n, by pedal cycle, at least 20 miles in total on A-roads within the preceding 365 days.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
