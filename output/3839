defaultth
default November 2013, 
defaultBASW was asked to make proposals concerning the qualifications and training of local authority staff engaged in 
defaultidentifying and 
defaultcommissioning a placement for children’s residential care.
defaultThe background t
defaulto this 
defaultrequest
default was that
default, in BASWs view, 
defaultas the private sector has become increasingly the majority provider of 
defaultChildren’s 
defaultResidential Care, it has become 
defaultincreasingly 
defaultimportant for local authorities to employ staff to identify and commission quality 
defaultprovision
default,
default and to maximise the information available to Social Workers about the experience and everyday culture about a variety of provision
default for looked after children. It is also becoming more important that Social Workers involved in placing children, an
defaultd supporting children in placement
default,
default have an understanding of commissioning processes
default. 
defaultBASW believes the qualification and experience of 
defaultstaff involved in 
defaultCommissioning and placement 
defaultidentification
default and providing background support to front-line Social Work
defaulters
default are crucial in getting the right placement at the right time for the right child. This is an area where a high level of skill is required.
default We advocate that such Teams should be led by a qualified Social Worker and staff with residential and fostering e
defaultxperience and skills should be key members of such teams
default, particularly in terms of setting out the key elements of a contracted placement and the contract monitoring of the placement
default.
defaultAs well as some commissioning staff having Social Work (SW) qualificatio
defaultns, this is also about front line staff having training and development and an understanding of the commissioning processes and what their part in it is. There may be a choice of services so they would really need to understand what would deliver the best 
defaultoutcomes for that child. Then when a service is selected they would need to understand how they would know whether the service was delivering improvement which would relate back to the individual assessment of need and changing needs over time. 
defaultSimilarly 
defaultthe provider would need to know what they are expected to deliver which will be quality assured by the operational Social Worker and Commissioning monitoring staff.  For services commissioned outside the Local Authority, the feedback from referring Social 
defaultWorkers needs
default to be fed into the formal contract meetings, this again requires time and trained and experienced Commissioning and contract staff.  A combination of SWs definition of outcomes and these being communicated to the provider and defined within a
defaultn agreement or contract should be the mechanism for ensuring quality and ultimately good outcomes for children and young people. 
defaultCurrently, the organisation of Commissioning and placements teams appear to 
defaultvary both
default in nature of membership 
defaultand in
default terms of staff qualification and training. 
defaultTeam membership
default varies and may include Social Workers, Contracting 
defaultstaff,
default staff with history of residential or foster 
defaultcare-
default or the placement finding activity in some authorities may be seen as more of an administ
defaultrative function. There appears to be little consistency between local authorities.
defaultIn 2009 Skills for Care and CWDC worked in all four UK countries to develop National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Commissioning, contracting and procurement of social ca
defaultre, and in 2013 this , we understand is being revised by Skills for Care. BASW has consistently supported the development of these NOS, but are very disappointed that we cannot find evidence of the NOS substantially being put into practice by local authori
defaultties or education institutions , at least as far as children’s services are concerned.
defaultBASW believes key elements 
defaultfor a training and qualification structure for Commissioning and Placement support are:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn understanding of 
defaultintegrated 
defaultcommissioning process
defaultes
default to support good outcomes and value for money within the context of services commissioned across LA and health
default

defaultExperience of commissioning and quality assuring individual and service requests for children
default

defaultcommissioning process

defaultAbility to apply commissioning principles to work with children and families
