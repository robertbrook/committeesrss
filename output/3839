[normal]th
[normal] November 2013, 
[normal]BASW was asked to make proposals concerning the qualifications and training of local authority staff engaged in 
[normal]identifying and 
[normal]commissioning a placement for children’s residential care.
[normal]The background t
[normal]o this 
[normal]request
[normal] was that
[normal], in BASWs view, 
[normal]as the private sector has become increasingly the majority provider of 
[normal]Children’s 
[normal]Residential Care, it has become 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]important for local authorities to employ staff to identify and commission quality 
[normal]provision
[normal],
[normal] and to maximise the information available to Social Workers about the experience and everyday culture about a variety of provision
[normal] for looked after children. It is also becoming more important that Social Workers involved in placing children, an
[normal]d supporting children in placement
[normal],
[normal] have an understanding of commissioning processes
[normal]. 
[normal]BASW believes the qualification and experience of 
[normal]staff involved in 
[normal]Commissioning and placement 
[normal]identification
[normal] and providing background support to front-line Social Work
[normal]ers
[normal] are crucial in getting the right placement at the right time for the right child. This is an area where a high level of skill is required.
[normal] We advocate that such Teams should be led by a qualified Social Worker and staff with residential and fostering e
[normal]xperience and skills should be key members of such teams
[normal], particularly in terms of setting out the key elements of a contracted placement and the contract monitoring of the placement
[normal].
[normal]As well as some commissioning staff having Social Work (SW) qualificatio
[normal]ns, this is also about front line staff having training and development and an understanding of the commissioning processes and what their part in it is. There may be a choice of services so they would really need to understand what would deliver the best 
[normal]outcomes for that child. Then when a service is selected they would need to understand how they would know whether the service was delivering improvement which would relate back to the individual assessment of need and changing needs over time. 
[normal]Similarly 
[normal]the provider would need to know what they are expected to deliver which will be quality assured by the operational Social Worker and Commissioning monitoring staff.  For services commissioned outside the Local Authority, the feedback from referring Social 
[normal]Workers needs
[normal] to be fed into the formal contract meetings, this again requires time and trained and experienced Commissioning and contract staff.  A combination of SWs definition of outcomes and these being communicated to the provider and defined within a
[normal]n agreement or contract should be the mechanism for ensuring quality and ultimately good outcomes for children and young people. 
[normal]Currently, the organisation of Commissioning and placements teams appear to 
[normal]vary both
[normal] in nature of membership 
[normal]and in
[normal] terms of staff qualification and training. 
[normal]Team membership
[normal] varies and may include Social Workers, Contracting 
[normal]staff,
[normal] staff with history of residential or foster 
[normal]care-
[normal] or the placement finding activity in some authorities may be seen as more of an administ
[normal]rative function. There appears to be little consistency between local authorities.
[normal]In 2009 Skills for Care and CWDC worked in all four UK countries to develop National Occupational Standards (NOS) for Commissioning, contracting and procurement of social ca
[normal]re, and in 2013 this , we understand is being revised by Skills for Care. BASW has consistently supported the development of these NOS, but are very disappointed that we cannot find evidence of the NOS substantially being put into practice by local authori
[normal]ties or education institutions , at least as far as children’s services are concerned.
[normal]BASW believes key elements 
[normal]for a training and qualification structure for Commissioning and Placement support are:
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An understanding of 
[normal]integrated 
[normal]commissioning process
[normal]es
[normal] to support good outcomes and value for money within the context of services commissioned across LA and health
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Experience of commissioning and quality assuring individual and service requests for children
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]An understanding of the S
[normal]ocial Work rol
[normal]e in the 
[normal]commissioning process
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ability to apply commissioning principles to work with children and families
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Commitment to focus on the ‘individual’ needs of the child in social work practice
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Understanding of evidence based programmes
