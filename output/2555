defaultocal Authority however did not offer any private accommodation and each time Amber called up she was told someone would call back but they never did. Amber’s mother passed away in November 2010 and has still not been provided with any accommodation. Amber’
defaults mother left her housing association to Amber’s older brother with whom Amber has always had a difficult relationship. Amber’s brother was 
defaultpressurising
default her to leave and additionally there was an insect infestation in the house that he was refusing to addr
defaultess. Amber’s doctor wrote a letter concerning Amber’s skin condition and the local authority had still not provided her with any accommodation. 
defaultStreetlegal
default wrote a letter to the local authority proposing to commence judicial review proceedings if they did 
defaultnot provide Amber with emergency temporary accommodation. Amber and her children were then provided with suitable accommodation. Amber was a particularly vulnerable young person who would have had little prospect of rectifying her situation without the ass

defaultMark was accommodated by the Local Authority under a Part VII homeless application under the Housing Act 1996 at 17 years old. When M turned 18 a Section 184 decision was made that he was not in priority need for accommodati

default. 
defaultStreetlegal
default obtained a psychiatric report confirming that he would be vulnerable if he were street homeless as a result of his mental health issues and relied o

defaultTom was in his late 30’s when he approached ILC in a highly distressed state. He explained he was homeless having fled his secure accommodation due to homophobic violence. Tom was a former care leaver and had been subjected to severe sexual and e
defaultmotional abuse during his time in care. Tom had been sectioned in the past and had a history of trying to take his own life. He applied to the local authority as a homeless person and was told verbally he was not vulnerable and temporary accommodation was 
defaultdenied. In desperation he tried to commit suicide and was 
defaulthospitalised
default. Upon his release from hospital Tom again approached the local authority homelessness department and 
defaulthe was told that he was 
defaultnot vulnerable and therefore not in priority need. By the ti
defaultme he reached ILC it was mid-afternoon and he was very distressed and informed us that he felt like killing himself. Urgent contact was made with the local authority and a request for urgent interim accommodation was made. Psychiatric evidence was provided
default to the authority together with a request for the authority to review its decision under section 202 of the Housing Act 1996 (Part VII). The authority declined to provide interim accommodation pending the outcome of the review request. ILC had no option bu
defaultt to issue judicial review proceedings and seek urgent injunctive relief. That evening the High Court ordered the authority to provide interim accommodation. Whilst proceedings were issued the matter did not go to permission or a full trial as the local au
defaultthority conceded their position, and Tom was spared the stress and trauma of lengthy litigation in the High Court. Tom was clearly very vulnerable and had the local authority fulfilled its statutory duty and made enquiries into his circumstances whilst pla
defaultcing him in temporary accommodation, a judicial review would have been avoided.

defaultShareen
default is a 19 year old victim of sexual violence and was trafficked into

defaultconfirming her highly distressed state and concerns over her fitness for interview. Written submissions are made to the Home Office to request that her 
defaultasylum 
defaultinterview be delayed pending the assessment of the psychiatrist. The Home Office refuse to postpo
defaultne the interview. Professionals are extremely concerned that compelling 
defaultShareen
default to attend an interview may damage her mental health and 
defaultthere is a risk that such an interview may 
defaultretrigger trauma. We write to the Home Office to advise that we will have no 
defaultchoice but to lodge a claim for judicial review if they fail to reschedule the interview. If 
defaultShareen
default does not attend her 
defaultinterview, 
defaultand the Home Office do not agree to rescheduling
default,

default 
defaultThe Home Of
defaultfice refuse to engage with numerous pre-action correspondence and we have no choice but to lodge a claim 
defaultincluding
default an urgent application for interim relief from the court. The judge considering the application orders that the interview be postponed pending

defaulttion correspondence had not reached a senior official in time. The case is conceded and there is no need for the case to go up to a judge to consider whether permission be granted.

default is a 17 year old 
defaultnational from Senegal
default with 
defaultsevere 
defaultmental health problems. He has indefinite 
defaultleave to remain in the UK and his family are British Citizens. He was charged and sentenced for offences relating to his gang affiliation in a local 
defaulthousing estate in North London.  
defaultUnfortunately, there has been a breakdown in the family relationship and t
defaulthe Home Office have decided to take deport action to remove him from the UK. 
defaultUpon release he was denied support from the Local Authority. He was later assessed as having significant cognitive impairments with an assessed mental capacity of a 5 year old. Sp
defaultecialist legal advice was needed to ensure that the Local Authority fulfilled their statutory duties to provide adequate accommodation, support services and protection from gang reprisals.  
default&#xa0;
defaultBelinda is 16 year old from the DRC. Her family were killed duri
defaultng the civil conflict whereby significant human rights abuses were committed against women and children. Belinda is orphaned at the age of 12 and has been raped on numerous occasions. She is later trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation through 
defaultseveral African countries. 
defaultDuring this time she falls pregnant and is subjected to a forced abortion. 
defaultHer traffickers 
defaultlater 
defaultfacilitate her entry to the UK through a false visa placing her age beyond her actual minority. She is internally trafficked through
default England and is imprisoned in a brothel for several years. Belinda was finally able to escape her trafficking situation and was street homeless in a major UK city before she was helped by a female stranger. When she arrived at the police station she was pl
defaultaced into the care of the Local Authority and housed in a foster placement because of her vulnerabilities. 
defaultShe is taken to the Home Office by her social worker. At no stage have the police or the Local Authority disputed Belinda’s minority, she was 16 at t
defaulthe time. Having arrived at the Home Office the immigration official note that she is trafficked victim having listened to Belinda’s account and that of her social worker. Whilst at the Home Office Belinda is abandoned by her social worker. She has no idea 
defaultwhere she has gone and is forced to wait at the Home Office alone before she is told to travel with a man and boy in a car. Belinda does not know where she is being taken and is extremely scared. Upon leaving the car she is met by a housing officer who inf
defaultorms her that she will be staying at the accommodation before she is taken back to the Home Office. A week later Belinda is taken to the Home Office and told that her age is being disputed. The Home Office rely on the visa application that was used to faci
defaultlitate her entry to the UK. She is taken to adult accommodation for asylum seekers. She is alone and isolated for several weeks before the accommodation she lives in is raided by immigration officers. She is arrested and taken to HMP Holloway having been c
defaultharged with immigration offences for making a false claim for asylum and entering the UK unlawfully. Whilst in prison concerns about her mental health and minority are raised by prison staff and immigration officers but no steps are taken to assess her nee
defaultds and provide her with appropriate support. Once the case was referred to use we secured he release from prison, she was age assessed by a Local Authority who later found her to be a child and she was placed in a foster placement once again.
