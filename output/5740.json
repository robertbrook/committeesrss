"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from \nKaty Bourne\n, \nPolice and Crime Commissioner for \nSussex\n [PCC Progress \n51\n]\n&#xa0;\nThank you for your letter of 17 January 2014 requesting further information to the oral\n \nevidence I gave to the Home Affairs Select Committee on 7 January.\n&#xa0;\nI am pleased to provide you with the following additional information:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe viewing figures have gradually increased and we regularly achieve over 500 viewers, either watching live or subsequently once the webcast is permanently uploaded. On one occasion the viewing figures went to over 1450. This was a result of a specific single issue that had attracted considerable media attention.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPlease find attached a briefing note for your information which I think provides a\n \nuseful summary.\n&#xa0;\nKaty Bourne\nSussex Police and Crime Commissioner\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Briefing Note: Surrey Sussex Collaboration - What we have achieved&#xa0;\nOverview\n&#xa0;\nSurrey and Sussex Police forces have been working together bi-laterally to collaborate in a number of\n \noperational and support services since 2010.\n&#xa0;\nTo date, a number of Joint Services have gone live \nincluding the Major Crime Team, \nTactical Firearms Unit\n \nand Forensic Investigations (which were initially established under a ‘Joint Command’ Model) and Joint\n \nProcurement Service, Joint Insurance Service and Joint Transport Service under a ‘Lead Force’ Model.\n&#xa0;\nThe ambition of collaborating in these areas was to deliver better pol\nicing services to \nthe public through\n \nincreasing resilience and inter-operability, improving performance, as well as delivering financial savings.\n&#xa0;\nThe following sections include further details of\n what we did and an overview of \nsome of the benefits\n \nrealised.\n&#xa0;\nJoint Command\n&#xa0;\nIn June 2011 the Joint Command was established.\n&#xa0;\nThe original business case for the collaboration of Major Crime, Firearms and Scientific Support (now\n \nForensic Investigations) under a Joint Command model, identified savings of £3.46m over 4 years and\n \nacross both forces in the agreed ratio of 55:45 (Sussex\n \n:\n \nSurrey).\nThese savings were not only achieved earlier than originally anticipated but also exceeded the target\n \namount.\n&#xa0;\nOther benefits identified in the business case focused around improved performance, interoperability and\n \nresilience.\n&#xa0;\nInteroperability from an ICT perspective has been a\nchieved with the implementation \nof the ‘Citrix Access\n \nGateway’, allowing both Forces to log onto their respective networks along with a number of joint systems\n \nincluding SOCRATES - a Forensic database, Chronicle for recording Firearms Operations and HOLMES for\n \nrecording of major crimes.\n&#xa0;\nFurther benefits are cited in the business areas below:\n&#xa0;\nTactical Firearms Unit\n&#xa0;\nThe Tactical Firearms Unit (TFU) provides a 24/7 armed response capability across Sussex and Surrey. In\n \naddition to the Armed Response Vehicles for attending spontaneous incidents, the unit is integrated with the\n \nFirearms Training and Protection Unit to ensure that between them there is also capability for pre planned\noperations such as protection for royalty and VIPs.\n&#xa0;\nSince collaborating, a large amount of work has been completed in order for TFU to achieve a Joint Training\n \nLicence from the College of Policing including standardisation of equipment, aligned processes and a Joint\n \nIT system to record all operations. As a result, at the start of the financial year 2013/2014, TFU was awarded\n \nan interim Licence following Inspection. Verbal feedback was positive around standards of written\n \nsubmission and training. Furthermore, the College of Policing was so impressed with the high standard of\n \ndesign and management of the training that the Surrey-Sussex model is to be used as the national\n \nbenchmark for the safe and effective delivery of firearms training. Work remains ongoing to meet the\n \nrequirements to secure a full licence.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the benefits realised by collaboration on tactical firearms include:\n&#xa0;\n- \nPrior to collaboration it was not possible to have a Sussex and Surrey ARV working together and be\n \nconfident that they would carry out a tactic in the same way. This led to significant risk if they were drawn\n \ntogether for a spontaneous incident. As they now train together it is possible to utilise the two nearest\n \nvehicles for an intervention irrespective of which force they originate from.\n&#xa0;\n- \nThe blending of the two forces’ tactics has resulted in the TFU having the most effective and appropriate\n \ntactics ever used. Vehicle stops are now, in the opinion of officers involved in this arena for up to 15\n \nyears, more ‘fit for purpose’ than at any time previously in either force.\n&#xa0;\n- \nJoint training has been very successful for the sharing of ideas and building relationships outside of a\n \nsingle force. Officers from different forces now regularly train together.\n&#xa0;\n- \nThere has been a reduction in the overall number of people that need specialist skills therefore reducing\n \noverall training requirements lowering training cost and reducing abstractions.\n&#xa0;\nMajor Crime Team\n&#xa0;\nThe collaboration of the Major Crime Teams in Surrey and Sussex saw amongst others changes, the move\n \nto a single shift pattern and a single version of HOLMES system with joint access for the recording of major\n \ncrimes, the alignment of processes and the ability to flex resources across both force areas.\n&#xa0;\nAs a result, the Major Crime Team (MCT) now operates as one across two Major Incident Rooms (MIRs)\n \nlocated in Woking and Brighton. Both teams work together in a borderless manner, leading and supporting\n \ninvestigations across both Force areas.\n&#xa0;\nThe MCT is primarily responsible for investigating homicide within Surrey and Sussex. However, the remit of\n \nthe team extends to cover other incidents as detailed below:\n&#xa0;\n- \nAll Homicides\n- \nStranger Rapes and Rape series\n- \nDeath following Police contact (in support of the IPCC/Force Professional Standards Departments)\n- \nCorporate Manslaughter\n- \nKidnap and crimes in action\n- \nAny other incident agreed by Chief Officers (e.g. high-profile, politically sensitive etc)\n- \nChild Death incidents\n&#xa0;\nThe resilience of the team was tested throughout 2012-2013 with periods of outstanding demand. This is\n \nwhere collaboration and the ability to utilise resources across both forces has proved invaluable. It is\n \ntestament that a review of the collaborative arrangements in December 2012 found implementation to have\n \nbeen successful with high service and confidence levels. As a result, MCT was signed off as a completed\n \ncollaboration project in early 2013 and is now considered business as usual.\n \n&#xa0;\nBenefits:\n&#xa0;\n- \nIt is established practice to deploy officers and staff at all levels from one area to the other in times of\n \nhigh demand. There are numerous examples of Operations in which the South Team assisted the\n \nNorth or vice versa. As mentioned above, there was a period of outstanding demand during a long\n \nrunning operation requiring significant resources. The ability to flex resources meant that MCT could\n \ncontinue to offer a professional and sustained service during this period and maintain the \ncapacity to\n \ndeal with day to day demand which would not have been possible prior to collaboration.\n- \nThe increase in resilience means divisional detectives are now rarely required to bolster MCT\n \nallowing them to focus on divisional priorities.\n- \nThe ability to provide support to a Basic Command Unit (division) when previously it would have to\n \nhave been declined. For example Surrey based MCT staff have assisted West Sussex on an\n \nattempted murder case when Sussex MCT staff were fully committed and vice versa Sussex MCT\n \nstaff have assisted Surrey Investigation strand on a rape investigation when Surrey MCT were fully\n \ncommitted.\n&#xa0;\nForensic Investigations\n&#xa0;\nForensic Investigation services across Surrey and Sussex underwent a complete restructure both in regards\n \nto staffing structures and how the service is provided.\n&#xa0;\nAs part of the restructuring a number of new combined units were created including:\n&#xa0;\n- \nThe Forensic Identification Services Unit (FISU) which went live in November 2012 based in Sussex.\n \nThe unit has been at the forefront of developing cutting edge technology to digitally transmit\n \nfingerprint marks from SOCO bases and the Forensic Recovery Unit in real time, enabling\n \nidentifications to be regularly achieved within hours. These 'faster' forensic results help support\n \ninvestigators in detecting crimes in a timelier manner, enabling them to arrest offenders before they\n \ncan reoffend.\n&#xa0;\n- \nThe Forensic Recovery Unit which went live in April 2013 following significant re-development of the\n \nexisting laboratories based at Surrey Headquarters. It is here where staff carry out the scientific\n \nexamination and screening of exhibits recovered from crime scenes; utilising chemical treatments,\n \npowders, DNA screening techniques, light sources and imaging to develop, enhance and capture\n \nfingerprints and other forensic trace evidence. The unit also attends crime scenes upon request to\n \nprovide specialist advice and guidance to officers to assist the investigation in the use of\n \nforensic/chemical treatments to develop and enhance forensic evidence at the scene.\n&#xa0;\n- \nThe Forensic Hub which went live in June 2013 also based at Surrey Headquarters. The Forensic\n \nHub deals with all forensic submission advice, administration and reporting of results across Surrey\n \nand Sussex and sees a more efficient triage approach to requests for Forensic Investigation\n \nservices.\n&#xa0;\n- \nForensic Imaging Unit which went live as a colla\nborated unit in September 2013. \nThe service which\n \nis delivered from Surrey Headquarters is responsible for handling photographic matters including but\n \nnot limited to the production of photographic exhibits, print service, image enhancing, photo\n \nprocessing and uploading and downloading of images.\n&#xa0;\nBenefits\n&#xa0;\n- \nISO 17025 Accreditation achieved - All police forces are required under an EU mandate to be\n \naccredited in forensic DNA screening and forensic enhancement processes and accommodation by\n \nNovember 2013 and April 2015 respectively. \nFailure to comply would have meant that no in-house\n \nactivities could have be carried out resulting in increased and additional spend to external service\n \nsuppliers. In support of the hard work and dedication shown by staff throughout the collaboration and\n \nchange process, in July 2013 the team had a successful assessment by UKAS leading to\n \naccreditation being awarded in October 2013.\n&#xa0;\n- \nThe service offered is now fit for purpose, meeting the ever changing needs of the two forces. An\n \nexample of success can be seen in the following quote taken from an email which was received in\n \nrelation to an armed robbery in Surrey in 2012, which was linked to a number of other offences and\n \nfor which a usable mark was found on a demand note:\n&#xa0;\n‘Until we had the fingerprint \nident\n this was going nowhere. The images had been circulated all over\n \nthe place, locally, nationally you name it. We were going to get the CCTV shown on \nCrimewatch\n as a\n \nlast resort but thanks to the fingerprint hit we didn’t need to do that. It was thanks to your good work\n \nand those of the investigating team that this man got a lengthy prison sentence (8.5 years) and 7\n \nbank robberies have been cleared up’\n.\n&#xa0;\nLead Force - Support Services\n&#xa0;\nIn line with the implementation of business areas under a Joint Command, Surrey and Sussex also agreed\n \nsome additional collaboration opportunities in Support Services as per below:\n&#xa0;\nJoint Insurance and Risk\n&#xa0;\nThe Joint Insurance Service was the first collaboration between Surrey and Sussex that used a ‘Lead Force’\n \nmodel. This service went live on 1st June 2012.\n&#xa0;\nLed by Sussex Police, the joint service has the responsibility for the insurance programmes of Surrey and\n \nSussex and provides advice and guidance on all insurance-related matters.\n&#xa0;\nJoint Procurement Service\n&#xa0;\nThe Joint Procurement Service, led by Surrey Police, went live on 1st September 2012 operating from a\n \nmain site based in Guildford, with a satellite office based in Lewes, East Sussex.\n&#xa0;\nThe service consists of two streams - future sour\ncing and tendering and contract \nmanagement. Future\n \nsourcing concentrates on tendering high value, high risk contracts, ensuring that the best commercial and\n \ncontractual terms are attained. Tendering and contract focuses on contract management, proactively\n \ndelivering value throughout the term of all contracts held by the two forces. These contracts will include\n \nthose established on a national, regional or force-specific basis.\n&#xa0;\nThe main financial benefits of the project are not the savings associated with the re-organisation of the\n \nprocurement function - they are the savings that will be realised from the proactive management of the\n \nforces´ contracts. The two forces annually \nspend around £100m on goods, works and services, and there is\n \nconsiderable potential for savings to be made from this expenditure through combining the requirements of\n \nboth forces to benefit from economies of scale and also consolidating the number of suppliers used.\n&#xa0;\nA Joint Procurement Service also changed the way that procurement is undertaken across the forces. As a\n \nresult they now use a consultative model, delivering a professional advisory service to the forces offering a\n \nnumber of benefits including earlier interaction and provision of commercial support and market knowledge\n \nrather than just a technical processing function that manages the paperwork.\n&#xa0;\nJoint Transport Service\n&#xa0;\nThe Joint Transport service went live on 1st October 2013 led by Sussex Police and deals with the provision\n \nand support of Surrey and Sussex fleet. This includes all matters concerned with:\n&#xa0;\n- \nfleet costs\n- \nthe evaluation, acquisition and disposal of vehicles\n- \nmaintenance and repair\n- \nlicensing and insurance\n- \nhire contracts\n- \nfuel management including bunkers and pumps\n- \nfleet statistics\n&#xa0;\nThe benefits realised by collaborating in these areas are focused a\nround improved \nefficiencies, effectiveness\n \nand delivery along with a reduction in pay and costs as a result of streamlining the services. Each unit offers\n \na professional and consistent service which utilises best practice with expertise shared across the forces\n \noffering greater resilience and interoperability.\n&#xa0;\nSurrey and Sussex are currently building upon these \nexisting collaborations as part \nof a vision to create a\n \n‘unified organisation’. Whilst as indicated above a number of benefits have been realised, important lessons\n \nhave also been learnt along the way which will help to shape and develop the future services.\n&#xa0;\nSurrey &amp; Sussex Police\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
