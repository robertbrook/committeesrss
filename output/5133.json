"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written Evidence submitted by UK Blood Services Prion Working Group (BTO0014)&#xa0;Background Information\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Questions.&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;24. It is difficult to answer this question with certainty because of the \npotentially \nvery long duration of sub-clinical infection in individuals affected with prion diseases.  On the positive side it can be noted that there has been no evidence of transmission of vCJD by blood trans\nfusion\n since the introduction of universal leucodepletion in 1999.  On the other hand the prevalence of sub-clinical infection is estimated to be 1 in 2000 in the general population, the level of infectivity in the peripheral blood is unknown and the level of susceptibility of infected individuals to develop clinical disease in the longer term is unclear.  Therefore it would be premature to consider that there is no threat of ongoing transmission through blood components, tissues, cells and organs.  Plasma for manufacture of pharmaceutical agents is sourced outwith the \nUnited Kingdom\n and therefore poses minimal risk.  UK Blood Services and SaBTO continue to review proposed new vCJD risk mitigation measures.  There are none of clear superior utility available at present.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDeclaration of Interests.\nThis report was pr\nepared\n by Marc Turner, Chair of UK Blood Services Prion Working Group, Professor of Cellular Therapy at the \nUniversity\n of \nEdinburgh\n and Medical Director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.
