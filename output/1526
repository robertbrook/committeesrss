default&#xa0;
default2.2. 
defaultIn Devon 27% of passenger journeys on supported bus s
defaultervices are to/ from work (Passenger Focus survey 2013). While 
defaultit is difficult to provide
default empirical evidence, it would appear safe to assume that there is low time-elasticity for people travelling to work (little ability to continue in work if times change
default significantly)
default. This compares to
default essential access to other services 
default-

default 
defaultenabling these needs to be
default broadly met 
defaultwithin
default wider service
default time bands
default.   
default&#xa0;
default2.3. 
defaultIt is often stated that the travel needs of young people are not well served by pre-booked 
defaultDemand Responsive Transport (
defaultDRT
default)
default services – and are therefore better served by regular timetabled services as there is a high degree of “turn-up-and-go” in their travel patterns.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services defaultto isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?default&#xa0;
default3.1. 
defaultIn rel

defaulttion to m

defaulto
default 
defaultperhaps 
defaultstate the obvious, cost-efficient public transport requires significant passenger flows to provide the fares income to offset costs. Rural areas ha
defaultve flows which are diverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.
default&#xa0;
default3.2. 
defaultTransport in rural areas is often characterised by d
defaultiverse
default 
defaultdemands
default to 
defaultmany 
defaultdifferent
default 
defaultlocations
default. 
defaultThe
default rural economy is 
defaultoften
default 
defaultmade
default up of 
defaultmany
default different
default employers (SMEs) in different 
defaultlocations
default. 
defaultSignificant and established flows are therefore often difficult to find.
default&#xa0;
default3.3. 
defaultIt is difficult to provide for all the interchange needs of people living along a route, as many interchange opportunities can conflict
default. And different interchange needs at e.g. a station from bus to train or vice versa, or in different direction
defaults
default, may not be compatible
default – unless the vehicle waits at the station thereby increasing journey time 
default(
defaultand inconvenience for other passengers
default)
default and op
defaulterating costs through less efficient vehicle utilisation
default. As with many decisions on shaping the public transport network, the decision tends to favour “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” – which will mean that 
defaultnot all
default needs 
defaultcan
default be 
defaultmet.
default&#xa0;
default3.4. 
defaultIn 
defaultmeeting demands, m
defaultuch depends on 
defaultlocal
default 
defaultgeography
default. 
defaultTherefore different service types and models fit different areas best, and a single service model is unlikely to meet all rural needs. 
defaultDepending
default on 
defaultpopulation
default, w
defaulthere there are few
defaulter roads
default there may tend to 
defaultbe a 
defaultgreater
default 
defaultconcentration
default of travel demand on a corridor, and a greater 
defaultnumber
default of people 
defaulttravelling
default on a 
defaultpublic
default 
defaulttransport
default route. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5. 
defaultDevon County Council (DCC) has operated 12 Fare car schemes – a taxi-bus DRT service -  across the county with very dif
defaultferent costs/ passenger resulting. 
defaultDRT often has higher costs per 
defaultpassenger
default than conventional bus 
defaultservices
default, and a
defaultgain 
defaultgeography
default 
defaultis a key influence 
defaulton 
defaultwhether
default this is the case. 
defaultThere is not a continuum of reducing service levels and reducing costs from high
default frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs may therefore rise
default. Where DRT schemes have been introduced with reduced overall costs this tends to be as a result of losing significant passenger numbers on 
defaultthe change from timetabled to pre-booked services.
default&#xa0;
default3.6. 
defaultThe council also believes that key success factors are for Local Transport Authorities to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?default&#xa0;
default4.1. 
defaultCommunity Transport
default (CT)
default may be well placed to cater for the needs of isolated communities on grounds of cost and responsiveness to small scale local needs. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2. 
defaultThe 
defaultcapacity
default to expand community 
defaulttransport
default 
defaultservices
default 
defaultdepends
default 
defaultsubstantially 
defaulton the volunteer base. Much has been said 
defaultabout reduc

defaultin recent

defaultwhich

default needs of more people. 
defaultThe driving licence restrictions introduced in 1997 rega
defaultrding category D1 also provide an increasing constraint to sourcing drivers for minibuses as time goes by. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3. 
defaultDCC has supported the Community Transport sector for more than 25 years, and sees its 
defaultown 
defaultrole as 
defaultsupporting and 
defaultworking with the sector to ca
defaultpacity-build the sector
default. 
defaultMaintaining 
defaultgrant support to our CT can also help 
defaultgroups 
defaultlever in matched funding from other sources, helping the con
defaults
defaultta
defaultn
defaultt challenge for the s
defaulte
defaultcto
defaultr
default of fundraising.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.4. 
defaultThis role has evolved as groups grow in professionalism and 
defaultbecome more self-reliant, and with reduced council budgets seeking a more focussed approach to outcomes sought from funding. 
defaultThis has 
defaultalso 
defaultincluded encouraging CT groups to operate local bus services under Section 22 provisions, which has happened only to 
defaulta limited extent. 
defaultCT tenders are often no more competitive than those of 
defaultcommercial
default 
defaultoperators
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5. 
defaultCommunity transport tends to focus 
defaultwell on certain 
defaultneeds
default in their communities, in particular the needs of
default the frail elderly and disabled
default – 
defaultwhich
default has been a key aim of groups generally
default. This chimed well with the provisions of the 1985 Transport Act which allowed local authorities to make provision for th
defaultis sector
default. 
defaultCommunity Transport 
defaultdoes no
defaultt
default tend
default to cater so well for people in their communities wh
defaulto need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people and the opportunities that this travel can bring them.

defaultScope for CT to address needs 
defaultcurrently

defaultauthority
default 
defaultfunded
default 
defaultbus
default

default is limited, due to:
default&#xa0;
default(i) rural needs a
defaultre spread thinly; rural poverty and deprivation, and any lack of rural opportunities, even though this may be significant across a rural 
defaultarea
default, are often therefore invisible
default;

default&#xa0;
default(vi) The cost of running 
defaultlarge
default buses is
default 
defaultas
default great for the CT sector as it is for 
defaultcommercial
default 
defaultoperators
default. 
defaultDevon’s supported services tend to be operated by smaller bus operators at keen prices – but these costs are unlikely to be further reduced by CT operation – evidenced in DCC tender results
default;
default&#xa0;
default(vii) CT groups are often fundraising at full stretch; they are likely to find fundraising for multiple large bus operation unsustainable
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.7. 
defaultThe need for support for rural services needs to be seen as a given; there are clearly exceptions that geograph
defaulty etc. may help, but on the whole there is little scope for making rural services sustainable. 
defaultKick-starting CT schemes with short-term funding is unlikely to make new services financially sustainable long
default-
defaultterm 
defaultas the 
defaultshortfall between cost and revenue wil
defaultl continue. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?default&#xa0;
default5.1. 
defaultThe passenger’s need and 
defaultpriority
default is 
defaultan
default 
defaultavailable
default, reliable, 
defaultaffordable
default 
defaultservice
default, irrespective of how this is 
defaultprovided
default. There is no reason to assume this 
defaultshould
default be by 
defaulta
defaultny 
defaultparticular
default mode. 
defaultFrom the viewpoint of the funding local authority, provided the appropriate service standards are met, the aim is to achieve best value. The mode wi
defaultll therefore be determined by circumstances, not from any inherent bias towards any one particularly mode.
default&#xa0;
default5.2. 
defaultIn rural areas t
defaultaxis 
defaultcannot be regarded as 
defaultmore or less universally available
default; in some market towns, let alone villages, there are still no acc
defaultessible taxis available at all for those that need their more specialist support; where they are available 
defaultthe cost is 
defaultclearly
default 
defaultprohibitive
default for 
defaultregular
default use for many people. 
defaultJoseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport 
defaultP
defaultoverty is a greater fac
defaulttor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty
default: nationally 
defaultwe hear much about
default the latter whilst
default,

defaultFor understandable reasons including juggling balance the need to meet diverse demands,

defaultOff

default, on the margin,
default by buses that are fully used in the peak for c

default&#xa0;
default6. defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these sdefaultervices be made more affordable?default&#xa0;
default6.

defaultThe 
defaultoverriding 
defaultchallenge
default 
defaultis
default the 
defaultunchangeable
default 
defaultdefining
default feature of 
defaultisolated
default 
defaultrural 
defaultcommunities
default: low 
defaultpopulation
default and long 
defaultdistances
default from centres that provide essential services and employment. 
defaultTransport will therefore 
defaultalways be expensive to provide in terms of cost per passenger; this is inescapable, and the main challenge 
defaultwill the
defaultre
defaultfore
default always be funding, and what is deemed worth funding. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRural high cost/ passenger services will always compet
defaulte unfavourably for shrinking council funding with lower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services. Cost/ passenger is a prime assessment tool, as applying it to decisions on service cuts provides the means of minimising the number of people affected b
defaulty service reductions. 
default&#xa0;
default6.
default2. 
defaultNetwork
default 
defaultEfficiency
defaultDevon County Council has reduced the amount needed to support the local bus network through growing supported bus services to commercial operation and through working with operators of failing commercial serv
defaultices to make them fully commercial and financially sustainable in the long term. This reduction in funding that would otherwise be needed to continue to support the current network amounts to £2m annually, or 40% of the current bus support budget.
default I.e. wit
defaulthout growing these services the cost to the public purse of the current bus network would be 40% higher.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut 
defaultin spite of Devon’s success in 
defaultgrowing network efficiency and effective management of the network in this way, and 
defaultin achieving 
defaultpassenger growth i
defaultn the last decade in contrast to
default 
defaultthe national trend outside London, it has become clear that bus services which require a significant amount of funding support 
defaulttend to be 
defaultboth 
defaultdifficult
default to grow
default and 
defaultunlikely to ever become financially viable if funding supp
defaultort ended. 
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default. 
defaultThe “
defaultm
defaultyth of the empty bus”. 
defaultIn Devon all supported bus services use buses that are fully used in the peak hours. Using these buses in the off-peak will at times mean they are perhaps largely empty, but it is still more cost-effective to
default provide rural services using these vehicles on the margin than to use other (additional) vehicles for lower demand off-peak travel, with the added costs that would bring. Many commercially viable bus services are also empty at times – to see a bus empty a
defaultt times does not mean that resource is being wastefully used. Nevertheless this misperception may be in danger of distorting how society generally may value rural bus services as funding shortfalls result in increasing competition for dwindling funding res
defaultources across councils.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultNon-
defaultStatutory
default 
defaultNature
default of 
defaultPublic
default Transport 
defaultFunding
defaultThe non-statutory nature of council bus service support relative to e.g. social care, school transport, and the need to maintain roads, means that no matter how sympathetic 
defaulta council may be towards maintaining bus support, the size of the Spending Review funding cuts will inevitably mean that there will be little funding left for non-statutory services.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default5. 
defaultENCTS Scheme Costs
defaultIn Devon the cost of the statutory English Natio
defaultnal Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) is double that of the cost of supporting rural bus services. Whilst Devon sees the benefits of the scheme to eligible passholders, given the acute pressure on revenue budgets from the Spending Review, it has to be qu
defaultestioned nationally whether it is sensible to continue to fund statutory free travel when this is at the expense of a reduced ability to travel through cuts to council funded routes.  
default&#xa0;

default. Cross-Sector Benefits 
defaultA 
defaultsignificant
default 
defaultelement
default of the 
defaultvalue of bu
defaults 
defaultservices lies in other 
defaultorganisations
default or in wider 
defaultpolicy
default aims
default, e.g.
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is difficult to 
defaultfully 
defaultengage with local public sector departments on this while government is not joined-up and does not provide joined
default-up targets and messages on this to the local agencies. Agencies are not keen to work with the council to part-fund transport, even where this may reduce their overall net costs,  as their aims handed down from central government do not encourage this. 
defaultAs 
defaulta result it is difficult for 
defaultlocal government
default to
default successfully engage in joined-up service and budgetary planning with other public sector agencies when central government departments are not working together sufficiently on these issues
default.
default 
default&#xa0;

default7
default. Long Term 
defaultBenefits vs. Short Term Funding Needs
defaultA significant element of the 
defaultknown significant 
defaultbenefits 
defaultof public transport 
defaultwould also only be realised in the long term. 
defaultT
defaulthe contribution of council public transport funding towards the 
defaulteconomy, employment, youth oppo
defaultrtunities is critical. Transport is a key component of action required to succeed on 
defaultthe Prevention Agenda 
default– reducing de
defaultpendence 
defaulto
defaultn

defaultit
defaults
default through enabling employm
defaulte
defaultnt
default;
default reducing dependence on 
defaultbespoke care services through increased independen
defaultce in life
default at
default all ages; reducing ill-health through improving healthy lifestyles. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe payback is long term, and budget cut targets need to be met this year or next. So no matter how much it would be sensible to continue to provide funding for public transport, as th
defaulte payback is (a) often not within the council, and (b) not short-term or immediate, the
defaults
defaulte 
defaultimmediate 
defaultpressures are 
defaultunderstandably 
defaultgreater than the long
default-
defaultterm need to continue public transport funding.

default&#xa0;
default6.8. Summary
defaultTo summarise, the 
defaultsignificant 
defaultcross-sect
defaultor benefits that bus services provide
default,
default across society and 
defaultpolicy aims
default,
default need to be reflected in national policies to enable these linkages to be made locally - by recognising the need to treat 
defaulttransport funding 
defaultas wider than a purely 
defaulttransport budget
default issue.
default Only through such a new approach will 
defaultthe public sector achieve the benefits that will accrue and grow from continued public transport funding
default and will it avoid increas
