[normal]ach of the issues identified by
[normal] 
[normal]th
[normal]e
[normal] Committee 
[normal]are answered in turn belo
[normal]w.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. [bold]How do Government and local [bold]authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1. 
[normal]Peopl
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]often 
[normal]make decision
[normal]s
[normal] on
[normal] 
[normal]where they live and 
[normal]where
[normal] they work based on current provision, so there is a need to
[normal] 
[normal]produce
[normal] a degree of stability in the 
[normal]provision
[normal] of the 
[normal]public
[normal] 
[normal]transport
[normal] 
[normal]network
[normal]. It is more 
[normal]difficult
[normal] to identify unmet 
[normal]demand
[normal], and this 
[normal]will
[normal] often 
[normal]take
[normal] a long 
[normal]period
[normal] of 
[normal]time to
[normal] 
[normal]translate
[normal] into 
[normal]significant
[normal] 
[normal]passenger
[normal] flows. Most focus on 
[normal]potential
[normal] new 
[normal]services
[normal] relates to new 
[normal]housing
[normal] and 
[normal]business
[normal] 
[normal]developments
[normal]. 
[normal]In Devon the 
[normal]means
[normal] of identify
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]demand
[normal] 
[normal]includes
[normal] 
[normal]through
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. [bold]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport[bold] to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1. 
[normal]In Devon m
[normal]ost
[normal] bus 
[normal]services
[normal] are now low floor/ accessible.
[normal] C
[normal]onventional
[normal] bus 
[normal]services
[normal] are augmented by:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2. 
[normal]In Devon 27% of passenger journeys on supported bus s
[normal]ervices are to/ from work (Passenger Focus survey 2013). While 
[normal]it is difficult to provide
[normal] empirical evidence, it would appear safe to assume that there is low time-elasticity for people travelling to work (little ability to continue in work if times change
[normal] significantly)
[normal]. This compares to
[normal] essential access to other services 
[normal]- 
[normal]e.g.  
[normal]t
[normal]own centr
[normal]e
[normal] services, shopping, chemists, and other services people need to use
[normal] - which
[normal] can 
[normal]often 
[normal]be expected to be 
[normal]more 
[normal]flexible (high time-elasticity)
[normal] 
[normal]enabling these needs to be
[normal] broadly met 
[normal]within
[normal] wider service
[normal] time bands
[normal].   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3. 
[normal]It is often stated that the travel needs of young people are not well served by pre-booked 
[normal]Demand Responsive Transport (
[normal]DRT
[normal])
[normal] services – and are therefore better served by regular timetabled services as there is a high degree of “turn-up-and-go” in their travel patterns.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services [bold]to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1. 
[normal]In rel
[normal]a
[normal]tion to m
[normal]eeting 
[normal]n
[normal]eed
[normal], t
[normal]o
[normal] 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]state the obvious, cost-efficient public transport requires significant passenger flows to provide the fares income to offset costs. Rural areas ha
[normal]ve flows which are diverse and often cannot easily be aggregated together into cost-efficient routes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2. 
[normal]Transport in rural areas is often characterised by d
[normal]iverse
[normal] 
[normal]demands
[normal] to 
[normal]many 
[normal]different
[normal] 
[normal]locations
[normal]. 
[normal]The
[normal] rural economy is 
[normal]often
[normal] 
[normal]made
[normal] up of 
[normal]many
[normal] different
[normal] employers (SMEs) in different 
[normal]locations
[normal]. 
[normal]Significant and established flows are therefore often difficult to find.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3. 
[normal]It is difficult to provide for all the interchange needs of people living along a route, as many interchange opportunities can conflict
[normal]. And different interchange needs at e.g. a station from bus to train or vice versa, or in different direction
[normal]s
[normal], may not be compatible
[normal] – unless the vehicle waits at the station thereby increasing journey time 
[normal](
[normal]and inconvenience for other passengers
[normal])
[normal] and op
[normal]erating costs through less efficient vehicle utilisation
[normal]. As with many decisions on shaping the public transport network, the decision tends to favour “the greatest benefit for the greatest number” – which will mean that 
[normal]not all
[normal] needs 
[normal]can
[normal] be 
[normal]met.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4. 
[normal]In 
[normal]meeting demands, m
[normal]uch depends on 
[normal]local
[normal] 
[normal]geography
[normal]. 
[normal]Therefore different service types and models fit different areas best, and a single service model is unlikely to meet all rural needs. 
[normal]Depending
[normal] on 
[normal]population
[normal], w
[normal]here there are few
[normal]er roads
[normal] there may tend to 
[normal]be a 
[normal]greater
[normal] 
[normal]concentration
[normal] of travel demand on a corridor, and a greater 
[normal]number
[normal] of people 
[normal]travelling
[normal] on a 
[normal]public
[normal] 
[normal]transport
[normal] route. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5. 
[normal]Devon County Council (DCC) has operated 12 Fare car schemes – a taxi-bus DRT service -  across the county with very dif
[normal]ferent costs/ passenger resulting. 
[normal]DRT often has higher costs per 
[normal]passenger
[normal] than conventional bus 
[normal]services
[normal], and a
[normal]gain 
[normal]geography
[normal] 
[normal]is a key influence 
[normal]on 
[normal]whether
[normal] this is the case. 
[normal]There is not a continuum of reducing service levels and reducing costs from high
[normal] frequency buses to low frequency buses to DRT: when replacing low frequency buses with DRT costs may therefore rise
[normal]. Where DRT schemes have been introduced with reduced overall costs this tends to be as a result of losing significant passenger numbers on 
[normal]the change from timetabled to pre-booked services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6. 
[normal]The council also believes that key success factors are for Local Transport Authorities to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. [bold]How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1. 
[normal]Community Transport
[normal] (CT)
[normal] may be well placed to cater for the needs of isolated communities on grounds of cost and responsiveness to small scale local needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2. 
[normal]The 
[normal]capacity
[normal] to expand community 
[normal]transport
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] 
[normal]depends
[normal] 
[normal]substantially 
[normal]on the volunteer base. Much has been said 
[normal]about reduc
[normal]ing
[normal] levels of volunteering 
[normal]in recent
[normal] 
[normal]decades
[normal], 
[normal]which
[normal] is seen to be a constraint on 
[normal]the 
[normal]ability of 
[normal]sector 
[normal]to 
[normal]operat
[normal]e
[normal] a 
[normal]greater
[normal] 
[normal]range
[normal] of 
[normal]services
[normal] or cater for the 
[normal]travel
[normal] needs of more people. 
[normal]The driving licence restrictions introduced in 1997 rega
[normal]rding category D1 also provide an increasing constraint to sourcing drivers for minibuses as time goes by. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3. 
[normal]DCC has supported the Community Transport sector for more than 25 years, and sees its 
[normal]own 
[normal]role as 
[normal]supporting and 
[normal]working with the sector to ca
[normal]pacity-build the sector
[normal]. 
[normal]Maintaining 
[normal]grant support to our CT can also help 
[normal]groups 
[normal]lever in matched funding from other sources, helping the con
[normal]s
[normal]ta
[normal]n
[normal]t challenge for the s
[normal]e
[normal]cto
[normal]r
[normal] of fundraising.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4. 
[normal]This role has evolved as groups grow in professionalism and 
[normal]become more self-reliant, and with reduced council budgets seeking a more focussed approach to outcomes sought from funding. 
[normal]This has 
[normal]also 
[normal]included encouraging CT groups to operate local bus services under Section 22 provisions, which has happened only to 
[normal]a limited extent. 
[normal]CT tenders are often no more competitive than those of 
[normal]commercial
[normal] 
[normal]operators
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5. 
[normal]Community transport tends to focus 
[normal]well on certain 
[normal]needs
[normal] in their communities, in particular the needs of
[normal] the frail elderly and disabled
[normal] – 
[normal]which
[normal] has been a key aim of groups generally
[normal]. This chimed well with the provisions of the 1985 Transport Act which allowed local authorities to make provision for th
[normal]is sector
[normal]. 
[normal]Community Transport 
[normal]does no
[normal]t
[normal] tend
[normal] to cater so well for people in their communities wh
[normal]o need transport to get to work, or the travel needs of young people and the opportunities that this travel can bring them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6. 
[normal]Scope for CT to address needs 
[normal]currently
[normal] provided by 
[normal]local
[normal] 
[normal]authority
[normal] 
[normal]funded
[normal] 
[normal]bus
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] is limited, due to:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](i) rural needs a
[normal]re spread thinly; rural poverty and deprivation, and any lack of rural opportunities, even though this may be significant across a rural 
[normal]area
[normal], are often therefore invisible
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii) 
[normal]m
[normal]ost local 
[normal]bus
[normal] 
[normal]services
[normal] 
[normal]funded
[normal] by DCC are 
[normal]routes
[normal] that serve 
[normal]many
[normal] 
[normal]communities
[normal], often 
[normal]relatively
[normal] strategic 
[normal]rather than local 
[normal]in nature
[normal], and operated with large buses
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](ii
[normal]i
[normal]) Devon’s CT 
[normal]sector
[normal] is strong and 
[normal]widespread
[normal], but 
[normal]generally comprises many
[normal] small groups 
[normal]serving
[normal] their own 
[normal]locality
[normal] – e.g. the 16 Ring &amp; Ride schemes 
[normal]operated
[normal] by 
[normal]different
[normal] groups;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](iv) 
[normal]t
[normal]he change from local minibus operation to large scale sub-regional large bus operation is a 
[normal]large 
[normal]step to take for most groups
[normal]; 
[normal]premises and operating centres will be required which are not required for minibus operation;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](v) 
[normal]t
[normal]he 
[normal]willingness
[normal] 
[normal]of
[normal] volunteer 
[normal]organisations
[normal] to 
[normal]operate
[normal], 
[normal]often
[normal] with unpaid 
[normal]drivers
[normal], to take 
[normal]people
[normal] to work, is 
[normal]seen to be limited as it is 
[normal]very 
[normal]different
[normal] from 
[normal]operating
[normal] to meet the needs of the frail 
[normal]elderly
[normal] and disabled;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](vi) The cost of running 
[normal]large
[normal] buses is
[normal] 
[normal]as
[normal] great for the CT sector as it is for 
[normal]commercial
[normal] 
[normal]operators
[normal]. 
[normal]Devon’s supported services tend to be operated by smaller bus operators at keen prices – but these costs are unlikely to be further reduced by CT operation – evidenced in DCC tender results
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal](vii) CT groups are often fundraising at full stretch; they are likely to find fundraising for multiple large bus operation unsustainable
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7. 
[normal]The need for support for rural services needs to be seen as a given; there are clearly exceptions that geograph
[normal]y etc. may help, but on the whole there is little scope for making rural services sustainable. 
[normal]Kick-starting CT schemes with short-term funding is unlikely to make new services financially sustainable long
[normal]-
[normal]term 
[normal]as the 
[normal]shortfall between cost and revenue wil
[normal]l continue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. [bold]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1. 
[normal]The passenger’s need and 
[normal]priority
[normal] is 
[normal]an
[normal] 
[normal]available
[normal], reliable, 
[normal]affordable
[normal] 
[normal]service
[normal], irrespective of how this is 
[normal]provided
[normal]. There is no reason to assume this 
[normal]should
[normal] be by 
[normal]a
[normal]ny 
[normal]particular
[normal] mode. 
[normal]From the viewpoint of the funding local authority, provided the appropriate service standards are met, the aim is to achieve best value. The mode wi
[normal]ll therefore be determined by circumstances, not from any inherent bias towards any one particularly mode.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2. 
[normal]In rural areas t
[normal]axis 
[normal]cannot be regarded as 
[normal]more or less universally available
[normal]; in some market towns, let alone villages, there are still no acc
[normal]essible taxis available at all for those that need their more specialist support; where they are available 
[normal]the cost is 
[normal]clearly
[normal] 
[normal]prohibitive
[normal] for 
[normal]regular
[normal] use for many people. 
[normal]Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2010) identified that Transport 
[normal]P
[normal]overty is a greater fac
[normal]tor in rural areas than Fuel Poverty
[normal]: nationally 
[normal]we hear much about
[normal] the latter whilst
[normal],
[normal] e
[normal]ven now
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the importance of Transport Poverty 
[normal]is not 
[normal]widely
[normal] 
[normal]recognised
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3. 
[normal]D
[normal]RT s
[normal]ervices
[normal] are 
[normal]often
[normal] 
[normal]unsuitable
[normal] for 
[normal]regular
[normal] 
[normal]commuting
[normal] to work. 
[normal]For understandable reasons including juggling balance the need to meet diverse demands, 
[normal]schemes 
[normal]often 
[normal]only allow for booking up to a week/ fortnight ahead, which in itself is a barrier to meeting workers’ travel needs.
[normal] 
[normal]Therefore 
[normal]DRT
[normal], when it is cost-effect
[normal]ive, 
[normal]is 
[normal]likely
[normal] to 
[normal]work
[normal] better
[normal] for off-peak 
[normal]accessibility
[normal] needs to 
[normal]shopping
[normal]/ 
[normal]town
[normal] 
[normal]centre
[normal] 
[normal]facilities
[normal] and 
[normal]services
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4. 
[normal]Off
[normal]-
[normal]peak rural services in Devon tend to be more cost
[normal]-
[normal]effectively operated
[normal], on the margin,
[normal] by buses that are fully used in the peak for c
[normal]ommuting etc., rather than those buses being parked in the off-peak and using 
[normal]additional 
[normal]other smaller vehicles for off-peak DRT services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. [bold]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these s[bold]ervices be made more affordable?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]1. Relative Cost
[normal]The 
[normal]overriding 
[normal]challenge
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] the 
[normal]unchangeable
[normal] 
[normal]defining
[normal] feature of 
[normal]isolated
[normal] 
[normal]rural 
[normal]communities
[normal]: low 
[normal]population
[normal] and long 
[normal]distances
[normal] from centres that provide essential services and employment. 
[normal]Transport will therefore 
[normal]always be expensive to provide in terms of cost per passenger; this is inescapable, and the main challenge 
[normal]will the
[normal]re
[normal]fore
[normal] always be funding, and what is deemed worth funding. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rural high cost/ passenger services will always compet
[normal]e unfavourably for shrinking council funding with lower cost/ passenger urban and inter-urban services. Cost/ passenger is a prime assessment tool, as applying it to decisions on service cuts provides the means of minimising the number of people affected b
[normal]y service reductions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]2. 
[normal]Network
[normal] 
[normal]Efficiency
[normal]Devon County Council has reduced the amount needed to support the local bus network through growing supported bus services to commercial operation and through working with operators of failing commercial serv
[normal]ices to make them fully commercial and financially sustainable in the long term. This reduction in funding that would otherwise be needed to continue to support the current network amounts to £2m annually, or 40% of the current bus support budget.
[normal] I.e. wit
[normal]hout growing these services the cost to the public purse of the current bus network would be 40% higher.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But 
[normal]in spite of Devon’s success in 
[normal]growing network efficiency and effective management of the network in this way, and 
[normal]in achieving 
[normal]passenger growth i
[normal]n the last decade in contrast to
[normal] 
[normal]the national trend outside London, it has become clear that bus services which require a significant amount of funding support 
[normal]tend to be 
[normal]both 
[normal]difficult
[normal] to grow
[normal] and 
[normal]unlikely to ever become financially viable if funding supp
[normal]ort ended. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]. 
[normal]The “
[normal]m
[normal]yth of the empty bus”. 
[normal]In Devon all supported bus services use buses that are fully used in the peak hours. Using these buses in the off-peak will at times mean they are perhaps largely empty, but it is still more cost-effective to
[normal] provide rural services using these vehicles on the margin than to use other (additional) vehicles for lower demand off-peak travel, with the added costs that would bring. Many commercially viable bus services are also empty at times – to see a bus empty a
[normal]t times does not mean that resource is being wastefully used. Nevertheless this misperception may be in danger of distorting how society generally may value rural bus services as funding shortfalls result in increasing competition for dwindling funding res
[normal]ources across councils.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Non-
[normal]Statutory
[normal] 
[normal]Nature
[normal] of 
[normal]Public
[normal] Transport 
[normal]Funding
[normal]The non-statutory nature of council bus service support relative to e.g. social care, school transport, and the need to maintain roads, means that no matter how sympathetic 
[normal]a council may be towards maintaining bus support, the size of the Spending Review funding cuts will inevitably mean that there will be little funding left for non-statutory services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]5. 
[normal]ENCTS Scheme Costs
[normal]In Devon the cost of the statutory English Natio
[normal]nal Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) is double that of the cost of supporting rural bus services. Whilst Devon sees the benefits of the scheme to eligible passholders, given the acute pressure on revenue budgets from the Spending Review, it has to be qu
[normal]estioned nationally whether it is sensible to continue to fund statutory free travel when this is at the expense of a reduced ability to travel through cuts to council funded routes.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]6
[normal]. Cross-Sector Benefits 
[normal]A 
[normal]significant
[normal] 
[normal]element
[normal] of the 
[normal]value of bu
[normal]s 
[normal]services lies in other 
[normal]organisations
[normal] or in wider 
[normal]policy
[normal] aims
[normal], e.g.
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is difficult to 
[normal]fully 
[normal]engage with local public sector departments on this while government is not joined-up and does not provide joined
[normal]-up targets and messages on this to the local agencies. Agencies are not keen to work with the council to part-fund transport, even where this may reduce their overall net costs,  as their aims handed down from central government do not encourage this. 
[normal]As 
[normal]a result it is difficult for 
[normal]local government
[normal] to
[normal] successfully engage in joined-up service and budgetary planning with other public sector agencies when central government departments are not working together sufficiently on these issues
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]7
[normal]. Long Term 
[normal]Benefits vs. Short Term Funding Needs
[normal]A significant element of the 
[normal]known significant 
[normal]benefits 
[normal]of public transport 
[normal]would also only be realised in the long term. 
[normal]T
[normal]he contribution of council public transport funding towards the 
[normal]economy, employment, youth oppo
[normal]rtunities is critical. Transport is a key component of action required to succeed on 
[normal]the Prevention Agenda 
[normal]– reducing de
[normal]pendence 
[normal]o
[normal]n
[normal] bene
[normal]f
[normal]it
[normal]s
[normal] through enabling employm
[normal]e
[normal]nt
[normal];
[normal] reducing dependence on 
[normal]bespoke care services through increased independen
[normal]ce in life
[normal] at
[normal] all ages; reducing ill-health through improving healthy lifestyles. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The payback is long term, and budget cut targets need to be met this year or next. So no matter how much it would be sensible to continue to provide funding for public transport, as th
[normal]e payback is (a) often not within the council, and (b) not short-term or immediate, the
[normal]s
[normal]e 
[normal]immediate 
[normal]pressures are 
[normal]understandably 
[normal]greater than the long
[normal]-
[normal]term need to continue public transport funding.
[normal]   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.8. Summary
[normal]To summarise, the 
[normal]significant 
[normal]cross-sect
[normal]or benefits that bus services provide
[normal],
[normal] across society and 
[normal]policy aims
[normal],
[normal] need to be reflected in national policies to enable these linkages to be made locally - by recognising the need to treat 
[normal]transport funding 
[normal]as wider than a purely 
[normal]transport budget
[normal] issue.
[normal] Only through such a new approach will 
[normal]the public sector achieve the benefits that will accrue and grow from continued public transport funding
[normal] and will it avoid increas
[normal]ing
[normal] future costs and problems that would result 
[normal]if this is not addressed urgently.
