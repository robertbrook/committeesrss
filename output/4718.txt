[[[Supplementary written evidence submitted by the Rt Hon Gregory Barker MP, DECC (HOT0062)]]]&#xa0;I would like to thank you for inviting me to speak to the Energy &amp; Climate Change Committee on Tuesday. I hope you found the information that my officials and I provided helpful. I recognise that on a number of occasions, we could not give you answers in full and undertook to write to you. Having gone through the official record, I hope that the following further information fulfils that commitment. Please do let us know if there is any further information you require. 

[[[Regulations on Heating Controls]]]The Standard Assessment Procedure for demonstrating compliance with Building Regulations currently do effectively penalise the construction of a new home without appropriate heating controls – one part of the model adjusts the internal temperature and/or   assumed efficiency of the heating system in line with the effectiveness of the control system. Similarly on the installation of a full new heating system in an existing dwelling there is a requirement under Part L of the Building Regulations that reasonable provision is made for the installation of effective controls including timer, room thermostat and TRVs.In our Energy Efficiency Strategy we announced a programme to assess the potential of smarter heating controls to reduce domestic energy demand. The evidence base is currently mixed on the issue of the extent to which smarter heating controls reduce energy consumption. It suggests further development is needed to meet user requirements of different groups. DECC have recently published new research to test the usability of five currently available Smarter Heating Controls. The findings, published in full on the gov.uk website, highlight the need for further innovation in heating control design and usability.The next stage of the Smarter Heating Controls research programme will be to work closely with industry leads on how new products can be improved and to develop further evidence on whether they reduce energy consumption.

[[[Green Deal Application in Devolved Areas]]]The Green Deal offer is the same across the constituent nations of the UK. However, there were some differences in delivery in Scotland:We collect statistics around the UK for Green Deal and ECO uptake, as set out below:&#xa0;

[[[Regulatory Approaches around UK]]]The different regulatory regimes for buildings across the UK are set out in the following legislation: &#xa0;

[[[SAP Treatment of Thermal Mass]]]Thermal mass is incorporated into SAP via a ‘thermal mass parameter’, which is the summation of the heat capacity of the surfaces in contact with the internal air divided by the total floor area.It influences the result in two ways:First, greater mass leads to better utilisation of solar gains, particularly when received outside heating periods, since the walls and other surfaces can store heat.Secondly, it also means that the internal temperature drops less rapidly when the heating is off. These effects act in opposite directions.  The first leads to a reduction in the energy demand to be supplied by the heating system as thermal mass increased, while the second leads to an increase because of higher internal temperature averaged over 24 hours and thus the potential for greater heat loss depending on the insulation levels. For dwellings with poor or moderate insulation levels, the latter has the greater effect, so that higher mass tends to give a higher space heating energy requirement. For high insulation levels, particularly if coupled with passive solar design, the former can have the greater effect, with higher mass giving a lower energy requirement.

[[[Work of the Heat Network Delivery Unit]]]During the first round of bids for the Heat Networks Delivery Unit’s grant support programmes, a total of 131 requests for application forms were received from 84 Local Authorities. This led to 31 Local Authorities submitting completing applications relating to 53 separate projects. These projects have been assessed by the department against value for money and other published criteria and the Secretary of State is expected to make a formal announcement regarding payment of the grants in January 2014.The second round of the grant support programme was opened on 27th November, with a deadline for applications of  31st January. We are happy to keep the Committee updated as to the progress being made.

[[[Ventilation]]] The Green Deal incorporates robust procedures to ensure that work is done by competent installers and in accordance with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations including Part F Means of ventilation and Part J Combustion appliances.For existing properties, the Green Deal Code of Practice states that where a package of improvements is proposed to be installed under a Green Deal Plan, it is the responsibility of the Green Deal Provider to ensure that the products installed are properly integrated with each other and with any previously installed energy efficiency measures in order to minimise the risk of damage to the building fabric as a consequence of inadequate ventilation or inadequate air tightness, particularly where the installed measures include internal or external solid wall insulation systems, cavity wall insulation or replacement or secondary glazing.  For new build, Part F of Building Regulations requires an appropriate ventilation strategy, taking into account the requirements for conservation of fuel and energy (and thus the need for air tightness) set out in Part L of Building Regulations. Part L of Building Regulations in turn also takes account of the energy impact of any mechanical or natural ventilation system required under Part F.&#xa0;

[[[Heat Pump Bill Savings]]]Through their heat pump field trial, EST has provided the main source of evidence on in-situ performance of heat pumps in the UK.&#xa0; Phase 1 of the field trial measured 83 systems mainly installed in 2008.&#xa0; DECC analysed these results in detail and published a report, which is available on our website:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/analysis-from-the-first-phase-of-the-energy-saving-trust-s-heat-pump-field-trialThese results were disappointing but they have been used constructively by DECC and industry to develop improved heat pump installation standards, which have been in place since April 2012.EST’s field trial continued for a second phase with a reduced sample size after interventions had taken place.&#xa0; DECC’s detailed analysis of these results are available on the same webpage.&#xa0; They generally show significant improvements where interventions have been made.More recently, DECC have been running a new metering programme in the Renewable Heat Premium Payment.&#xa0; The sample size of this field trial is significantly larger than EST’s (approximately 700 systems) but the data collection exercise will not conclude until October 2014.It is not straightforward to match up metered sites with their previous heating fuel, make assumptions about the metered person’s previous system’s efficiency, heating energy consumption and fuel prices and produce an estimate of bill savings.&#xa0; However, by making reasonable assumptions, we should be able to present our new data in a way that estimates the proportion of installations that reduced the occupants’ heating bills.We intend to publish a short report in January showing examples of the data we are collecting in the RHPP metering programme.&#xa0; In that report we can also include an assessment of the Seasonal Performance Factors required to generate fuel bill savings in different scenarios under particular assumptions.

[[[Gas Network Strategy Group]]]The Department continues to engage with stakeholders. At the moment we are unsure what value a formal Gas Network Strategy Group would add to the conversations and engagement already taking place. However we will continue to consider the option and have no objection to a group being formed if it would add significant value to the process.

[[[overnment]]]  DECC’s Whole Energy System work is an overarching programme that integrates two projects considering electricity system topics and multi-vector challenges (e.g. future of the gas grid, role of hydrogen).&#xa0; The work is focused on delivering answers to key policy questions from a position that takes in the entire energy system under a number of scenarios out to 2050. The team is working with key external centres of energy system expertise, including UCL’s Energy Institute, the Energy Technology Institute and National Grid in order to understand what system thinking and modelling is already being undertaken. &#xa0;Each workstream takes a structured approach to scope potential issues and current practice before defining what capabilities will be required to shape the future decarbonised energy system.&#xa0; By verifying and building on existing system modelling capabilities, it will help DECC deliver a fit for purpose energy system at the lowest cost to tax payers.The programme will work with a Whole Systems Modelling Expert Panel containing advisers from a range of other Government departments as well as industry and academia. In this way, we plan to capture insights from all perspectives on the energy system.I hope that fulfils our commitment to follow up on those questions in writing. In addition, I would also like to draw your attention to two minor factual inaccuracies in our responses to your questions:&#xa0;In addition, we have published new data on off-gas-grid households since the hearing, which you may find useful. You can find it at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/266468/off_gas_grid.pdf.I hope you found these responses helpful. I look forward to the publication of your report..Decemeber 2013&#xa0;
