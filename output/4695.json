T\nhrough \nthe publication of robus\nt aviation management guidelines, \ninformation dissemination, \nworkshops and seminars, developing and delivering industry-w\nide initiatives and programmes \nand engaging with governments and other external organisations, the UKCS\n is \nwidely regarded as \na global \nexemplar of good \naviation \nsafety practice.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReference \nto Section 4 in the \nO\nil &amp; \nG\nas \nUK\n Health &amp; Safety Report 2013 will provide details \nabout\n the UKCS \nOffshore Helicopter Transport Safety Record\n up to the end of 2012\n.\n The report can be accessed at:\nhttp://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/Health_Safety_Report_2013.cfm\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition\n,\n under Supporting Documents\n,\n \nthis web page includes\n Appendix 2\n which \nprovides a complete listing of the 72 reportable accidents involving helicopters serving the UK offshore oil and gas sector from 1976 to 2012.\n&#xa0;3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1976, commercial air transport helicopter flight sta\ntistics and reportable accident \ndata\n for UKCS offshore operations ha\nve\n been collected by the industry along with relevant reports obtained from the \nCivil Aviation Authority (\nCAA\n)\n Mandatory Occurrence Repo\nrting (MOR) scheme. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDuring this \n37-year period up to year-end 2012, more than 6\n3\n million passengers ha\nve been transported to and from \noffshore installations on the UKCS, with over 7.5 million flights made (secto\nrs flown), consuming \nover\n 3.5 \nmillion flying hours. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegrettably, during this period, 12 fatal accidents have cl\naimed the li\nves of 115 offshore \nworkers and flight crew. There have been 60 non-fatal accidents.\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Health &amp; Safety Report 2013 provides a report that is representative of today’s offshore flight ope\nrations using a fleet of modern \nhelicopters. Data from 1992 to 2012\n have been used for comparative purposes\n. A\ns a \nmeasure of current UKCS\n activity, in 2012, just over 1\n1\n4\n,000 sectors were\n flown, consuming 86,000 flight \nhours and transporting \njust short of\n a million passengers offshore. \n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 1992, six f\natal accidents ha\nve claimed the \nlives of 47 offshore workers and flight crew and there have been 18 non-fatal accidents.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nU\nse of this statistical\nly\n \nsmall \ndata \nset \ndoes not determine “how safe are offshore helicopter flights”. To reach a sensible conclusion this requires a much deeper understanding of all facets of offshore helicopter \nflight \noperations\n and \nrotor\ncraft engineering\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMost important when assessing aircra\nft technical failures is to recognise that for helicopter types used globally in the same role, a major component failure resulting in a crash or ditching (as identified by the AAIB in their reports into the Eurocopter AS332L2 [G-REDL] fatal accident in 20\n09 and two Eurocopter EC225 accidents [G-REDW and G-CHCN] in 2012), could have occurred anywhere in the world; regardless of where the helicopter was being flown, over land or sea.\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndeed, when offshore helicopter accident rates on the UKCS are compared w\nith the International Oil &amp; Gas Producers Association (OGP) Aviation Safety Committee’s (ASC) worldwide fatal and non-fatal reportable accident rates for the period 1995 to 2010 the data indicates that, averaged over this time, offshore helicopter operatio\nns on the UKCS carry significantly less risk than operations elsewhere in the world.\n&#xa0;\nRegionFatal Accident Rates(per 100,000 flying hours)Non-Fatal Accident Rates(per 100,000 flying hours)Worldwide (OGP figure)\n0.57\n1.48\nUKCS (OGUK figure)\n0.26\n0.91\nComparison of Fatal and Non-Fatal Reportable Accident Rates, 1995 to 2010&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \nimportant \nobservation \nin the context of the UKCS helicopter safety record \nis independently supported by reference to \nTable 7.2 \n- Overview over helicopter accidents in the North Sea (and Canada) in the period 1999-2009 on page 88 \nin the Norwegian SINTEF Helicopter Safety Study 3\n,\n dated 22 March 2010\n;\n which explains why or why not \nthe \nlisted accidents could have occurred in the Norw\negian sector at the same time.\n \nhttp://www.norskoljeoggass.no/en/Activities/HSE-and-operation/Helicopter-safety-/\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nParagraph \n7.3.6\n in the SINTEF Report compa\nres the Norwegian and UK sectors\n and says, “\nIt is striking that the UK sector had ten accidents while Norway only had one accident in the\n \nperiod 1999-2009, with comparable amounts of person flight hours. All fatalities in the North\n \nSea during the period \nhave also occurred in the UK sector. The statistics show a significantly\n \ndifferent development between the UK and Norwegian sectors from the previous period. The\n \nanalysis has shown, however, that all accidents, in principal also could have occurred in\n \nNorw\nay. This indicates that our low accident rate in the period could be a random result; this is\n \nalso supported by sensitivity analyses\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEqually, when assessing outcomes from these accidents\n,\n it is very important to remember that the 100% survival rate for \nthe two (2) \nhelicopters that ditched\n in 2012 (33 people involved) was attributable to the \noutstanding \nskills of the \ntwo \nflight crews\n,\n \nrelatively \ncalm\n weather conditions, \nthe quality and effectiveness of passengers’ survival training and \nthe \naircraft and pe\nrsonal safety equipment provided.\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe AS332L2 non-fatal ditching accident whilst on the approach to BP ETAP \nin \nFebruary \n2009 [G-REDU]\n was attributed\n by AAIB\n largely\n \nto \nflight crew perceptual and procedural issues in the final approach\n. There was no loss \nof life and the 18 people involved were all rescued.\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the absence of completed investigations and a report by AAIB, it \nis \ninappropriate for O\nil &amp; \nG\nas \nUK to comment \nin detail \nor speculate \nabout outcomes from the AS332L2 [G-\nWN\nSB\n]\n fatal accident off Sumburgh o\nn \n23 August \n2013.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, \nAAIB published a\n Special Bulletin\n (S\n7\n-\n2013\n) \non 18 October 2013 \nwhich\n state\ns\n that \n“\nno evidence of a technical fault \nwith G-WNSB \nhas been found that could have been causal to the accident\n”\n. This \nfind\ning \nresulted in the AS332L2 being \nallowed to return\n to \noffshore \nservice\n;\n \nfollowing\n the \nprompt and\n \ncollective oil and gas industry \ndecision \n(including Trade\ns Union representatives\n) \non 24 August \nto \ntemporarily \nwithdraw the \nSuper Puma \nhelicopter type \n(all variants) \nfrom service\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n \nkey reason for\n \nthe UK having a better safety record in relation to helicopter operations relative to other countries \nis\n that many parts of the world lack the regulatory, management and equipment sophistica\ntion when compared with the UK.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlso,\n \non the UKCS, helicopter operations are \nconducted in a hostile marine environment \nexclusively \nwith \nt\nwo-engine, two-pilot operations.\n W\nhereas, for example,\n \nin the US Gulf Coast region there are a large number of small, single-engine helicopter and\n \nsingle-pilot operations\n conducted in relatively benign marine \nenvironments and a variety of onshore \nenvironments\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen attempting to make \nUK\nC\nS\n \naviation safety \ncomparisons with other North Sea states it should be noted that the UK has the largest helicopter fleet size and significantly higher rates of utilisation and passengers carried\n (e.g. twice the flight hours flown in Norway)\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurther\n, th\ne\n \nother North Sea \nhelicopter \noperations are principally conducted by \nsubsidiaries of \nthe same \nhelicopter \ncompanies that provide the \nbulk of helicopter services on the UKCS; \ngenerally \nworking to the same aviation rules\n (\ne.g. \nJAR-Ops 3)\n,\n \noperating\n, \nmaintenance\n and \nflight \nsafety \nrequirements / \nguidelines\n,\n pilot and engineer training regimes\n, etc\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUltimately, comparisons between the safety performances of countries \nshould\n be \nconsidered in relation to \nthe\n measure \nof\n \nsuccess in striving to meet \nthe prim\nary\n \nobjective of ensuring that everything that can \nreasonably \nbe done \nto minimise the risks \nis being done. As outlined elsewhere in this submission, we believe that the UK has been and remains a global leader in helicopter safety.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is not unreasonable to say that having invested very heavily in replacing an ageing fleet of helicopters on the UKCS with the very latest technology rotorcraft available in the global marketplace, UK helicopter operators and the oil and gas companies al\nike are shocked \nand \ndismayed \nby the severity and outcomes of the accidents, in the past \nfour \nyears.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAppendix 3 of \nthe Oil &amp; Gas UK Health &amp; Safety Report 2013\n \nreferred\n to in \nparagraph 3.1 \nprovides a full and detailed list of industry-led safety \ninitiatives and CAA research projects\n.\n \nThe Appendix can be accessed at:\nhttp://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/Health_Safety_Report_2013.cfm\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nil &amp; \nG\nas \nUK A\nviation \nS\nafety \nT\nechnical \nG\nroup (AS\nTG)\n and \nits \npredecessor\n,\n UKOOA Aircraft Committee\n,\n \nhave\n a long history of \ntaking the init\ni\native \nand aggressively driving forward projects \nto improve\n offshore helicopter safety.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving identified\n routine and \nsometimes \nunusual operational and technical issues and \ndiscovered \nproblems that require\n resolution\n,\n along with learning from the hard lessons arising from fatal and non-fatal accidents and incidents\n, \nmany safety initiatives have been \nfunded and \nimplemented \nby the \noi\nl and gas \nindustry over the past 35 years. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis includes a long list of research projects which are often jointly funded \nby oil and gas companies \nwith the regulators (CAA and \nHealth &amp; Safety Executive\n), helicopter operators and other involved organisations (e.g. \nNational Air Traffic Service (\nNATS\n)\n, \naircraft and equipment manufacturers).\n&#xa0;\n5.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKOOA Aircraft Committee was initially formed by a group comprised of aviation specialists from oil and gas \ncompanies and in the mid-1990s this group was opened up to include senior representatives from the regulators\n, agencies\n and helicopter operators. \n&#xa0;\n5.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis composition \nremains\n today in the O\nil &amp; \nG\nas \nUK ASTG.\n Hard won experience of working \ntogether \nto \njointly \nsolve problems and implement new ways of doing business \nin a challenging and hostile \nmarine \nenvironment \ncontinues today and is the foundation for continuous improvement.\n&#xa0;\n5.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nH\nelicopter \nT\nask \nG\nroup\n \n(HTG) \nand H\nelicopter \nS\nafety \nS\nteering \nG\nroup\n \n(HSSG) \nare \nthe other \noil and gas industry\n groups \ndealing with helicopter operations but they serve\n different purposes. \n&#xa0;\n5.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHTG was initially formed \nas the body tasked to focus on \noil and gas \nindustry responses\n to the 2009 fatal \nhelicopter \naccident. \nHTG was formed as a \nmulti-agency working group comprising \nexecutive and senior \nrepresentatives\n from O\nil &amp; \nG\nas \nUK, oil and gas companies, the offshore contractors, the helicopter operators, CAA, HSE, Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency, \nGrampian Police, \nTrades Unions (\nRMT, \nUnite\n and BALPA) and the offshore workforce.\n&#xa0;\n5.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHTG had full executive authority to maintain collective overview by all the stakeholders of the accident investigation outcomes and respond promptly to Air Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) findings and recommenda\ntions; along with reviewing all the activities to do with providing accident victims family support, management of the emergency response, robustness of aviation management guidelines and workforce communications, etc.\n&#xa0;\n5.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo work \nquickly and \neffectively when\n problems \nhad been \nidentified and solutions \nwere \nbeing sought, HTG had full authority to initiate research and other studies to improve \noffshore \nhelicopter safety. It did this in several areas such as pressing the aircraft manufacture\nr\ns to develop \n(from a \nresearch project) \nand implement Advanced Anomaly Detection\n (as production AAD systems)\n to enhance \nthe performance of Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) for improved fault detection in the major dynamic components (e.g. main rotor gearboxes\n and tran\nsmission\n).\n \nFurthermore, s\nince 2012, all workers flying offshore have been provided with personal locator beacons, \ntested to a CAA standard.\n&#xa0;\n5.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubsequently,\n after the \nHTG’s\n role \nof oversight of the 2009 accident came to a logical end it was decided to \ncontin\nue \nthe valuable work that had been done to improve\n workforce communication and engagement on helicopter \npassenger \nsafety under a new group, the HSSG\n, within the industry \nlead \nsafety body, Step Change in Safety\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nF\nollowing the 2012 / 13 accidents \nHSSG \nimmediately \nundertook a similar role to \nHTG to provide \ncollective \nindustry responses\n and provide the conduit for workforce communications and engagement\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, HSSG\n membership\n has become unwieldy in recent times so, HTG has been re-established as a sm\nall \nexecutive management oversight group and \nHSSG\n \nha\ns\n reverted to its previous role.\n&#xa0;\n5.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nASTG continues to focus on resolving \na wide range of \ntechnical \nand operational \nissues\n, \nprogressing solutions and further developing and refining Aviation Management Guidelines in conjunction with all the stakeholders. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is already an abundance of legisla\ntion and regulations relating to\n offshore helicopter operations.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the early days in the North Sea there has been \nalmost \nconstant regulatory evolution.
