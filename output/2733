[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Big Lottery Fund (the Fund) is the largest Lottery distributor, responsible for distributing 40% of funds raised for ‘good causes’ from The National Lottery. Since June 2004, we have awarded over £6bn to projects supporting health, education, environme
[normal]nt and charitable purposes. In 2012/2013 
[normal]92% of our funding went directly to the 
[normal]voluntary,
[normal] community sector 
[normal]and
[normal] social enterprise

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Big Lottery Fund has 
[normal]supported 
[normal]a wealth of projects 
[normal]and organisations that 
[normal]seek to combat youth 
[normal]unemployment
[normal] across the UK
[normal]. 
[normal]We have made awards worth around £300
[normal] 
[normal]million 
[normal]to projects supporting young people, 
[normal]ranging from small community based grants to large investments in national VCSE organisations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Many of our initiatives are targeted at young 
[normal]people who are not in education, employment or training or those moving from education to full-time work.
[normal] 
[normal]In supporting young peopl
[normal]e the Fund
[normal] has also found that there is a particular need to support young people experiencing challenging life transitions, 
[normal]such as leaving care or young offenders. All our investments focus on hard to reach young people and some focus on specific groups that require dedicated support, including young carers, young people leaving care and young people leaving youth offending in
[normal]stitutions.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In June 2012 the Fund launched 
[normal]Talent Match (England)[bold],
[normal] a major new £100 million investment that seeks to support young people aged 18 - 24 in England who are 
[normal]furthest from the labour market (
[normal]e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal]. those 
[normal]who have been out of work, education or training for over 12 months
[normal], or those who are completely disengaged from benefits and other systems
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]Big Lottery funding will be used to
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]create pathways for young people
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]employers 
[normal]and other organisations 
[normal]to come together and help young people find work or set up their own enterprises. 
[normal]Talent Match goes beyond simply improving the employability of young people, intending to address barriers to work and achieve sustainable, 
[normal]meaningful employment for a significant number of those engaged.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of relevance to Question 6[bold]: 
[normal]T
[normal]he Fund 
[normal]co-designed this investment with  a team of
[normal] young people aged 16-25
[normal] and worked with
[normal] a 
[normal]range
[normal] of experts 
[normal]to determine
[normal] how Lottery funding might best make a positive contribution. 
[normal] Young p
[normal]eople also acted as full Committee members alongside the Fund’s Committee making decisions on Talent Match applications.  
[normal]A
[normal] video and a podcast illustrate why the young people got involved in our investment and why it is so important to involve young people in decisions of this kind. These can be viewed at the Fund’s website at 
[normal]http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/programmes/england/talent-match
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We have used evidence 
[normal]on areas such as unemployment levels and employment opportunities 
[normal]to target 21
[normal] areas across England wher
[normal]e we will seek to 
[normal]achieve a significant and lasting impact. 
[normal]We ha
[normal]ve taken a range of considerations and the advice of stakeholders and young people into account when deciding where to target, and chosen the geographic areas covered by Local Enterprise Part
[normal]nerships (LEP) as our start point
[normal], these areas reflecting economic rather than traditional boundaries
[normal]. In each of these areas partnerships have been formed to bring about locally owned solutions to local youth unemployment issues and to 
[normal]use their local int
[normal]elligence and experience to 
[normal]further refine our chosen areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Each 
[normal]of the 21 target areas 
[normal]will receive 
[normal]a 
[normal]grant
[normal] of
[normal] between £1 million and £10 million for a portfolio of activities lasting up to five years. All partnerships are led by a VCSE organisation wit
[normal]h experience of working with young people who are not in work, education or training and include representatives from local businesses, employers, education and training providers and local authorities. For details of the 21 target areas and contact inform
[normal]ation for each partnership lead, see 
[normal]http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/programmes/england/talent-match
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Big Lottery Fund is offering LEPs the 
[normal]opportunity to ’opt-in’
[normal] with us for
[normal] a single delivery and match-funding service 
[normal]through
[normal] the
[normal]ir
[normal] 2014-2020 European Structural and Investment Fund
[normal] strategies. Our offer aligns to the social inclusion and poverty objective. Over the coming months, we will be w
[normal]orking closely with those LEPs that decide to op-in to understand their local needs and refine the delivery arrangements. From conversations already in train, we expect that out learning, expertise and networks from Talent Match will be of considerable int
[normal]erest to LEPs, and a strong element of many of their strategies. We will work to 
[normal]share
[normal] learning across our work involving European funding in England. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Talent Match will involve a significant economic evaluation, which will seek to inform commissioners of
[normal] future services aimed at supporting young people into employment, and will share learning and facilitate networking from projects as they begin to roll out. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Over £200m was awarded through the 
[normal]Young People’s Fund[bold] [bold](YPF)[bold] supporting projects across the UK t
[normal]hat provide activities for disadvantaged or vulnerable young people, including young people who are losing touch with the education system. Arrangements and approaches for the programmes varied, but all highlighted the importance of actively involving youn
[normal]g people in planning and running projects that set out to – among other aims – improve young people’s confidence, well-being and engagement in the economy and wider society. Across the UK, about 700,000 young people took part in YPF projects.
[normal] 
[normal]Young people 
[normal]served on awa
[normal]rd-making panels for grants to national organisations,
[normal] local organisations
[normal] and
[normal] individuals. 
[normal]([bold]Question 6[bold])[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Projects have also helped to develop young people’s employability skills, including presentation and communication skills, leadership, and assertiveness. For instance 3,356 young people aged 11 to 25 received awards of £250 to £5,000 to run their own proje
[normal]ct as part of Big Boost. Many of them benefited from training and developed skills for their future careers including team working, communication and decision making. In Scotland YPF consistently helped between 6% and 16% of young people to access employme
[normal]nt, go to college, access an apprenticeship or training or to go to university. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A range of YPF programme evaluation reports have captured learning and informed our current and future investments in this area. As well as considering the overall success of
[normal] projects and programmes in achieving what they set out to, the evaluation had a strong focus on considering approaches to effective involvement by young people – so the publications available here include good practice guides on that and related subjects
[normal]

[normal]2.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Getting Ahead (Wales)[bold] programme is a £3.4 million investment
[normal], which
[normal] 
[normal]seeks to engage, prepare and motivate young people aged 16–18 years into undertaking a six month paid supported work placement in order to enhance their chances of progress
[normal]ing into sustainable employment or further learning or training by increasing their employability skills. It will target young people aged 16-18 who have offended and young people who are leaving care. The programme is 
[normal]funded by money from dormant bank accounts. 
[normal]How to spend this money 
[normal]was
[normal] been decided by the Welsh Government and the Fund has worked closely with the Welsh Government to develop this programme.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Life Skills[bold] 
[normal](Wales) [bold]programme is jointly funded with the Welsh European Funding Office, and matches Lottery funding with European Structural Funds. The p
[normal]rogramme enables care leavers, carers and former carers
[normal] and
[normal] eco
[normal]nomically inactive families 
[normal]to develop their life skills, increase their confidence, and reengage and continue to access education, learning, volunteering or employment. Four contracts worth £2
[normal].4 million were awarded in 2011/12 following a competitive procurement process.

[normal]The £2
[normal]8
[normal] million 
[normal]Reaching[bold] Out: Empowering Young People[bold] 
[normal]([bold]ROEYP, [bold]Northern Ireland)[bold] programme seeks to make a difference to young people in Northern Ireland. Young people who are disengaged from education or at risk of getting involved in crime are a key group that this funding will support to make positive changes in their lives. A numb
[normal]er of the projects supported through this fund provide courses to help young people build the skills to find employment. Further information on the projects supported through this investment can be found here

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of relevance to Question 6[bold]: 
[normal]young people were i
[normal]nvolved at all
[normal] stages of the ROEYP programme, including 
[normal]project design and decision making.
[normal] A total of 400 y
[normal]oung people attended
[normal] consultation activities across a four month period. This involved half-day or shorter events. Four ‘at risk’ young people serve
[normal]d on the award-making committee. An intermediary organisation undertook facilitation of the beneficiary group. 
[normal]A case study exploring the involvement of young people in ROEYP was produced by IVAR for an 
[normal]independent report into how beneficiary involvement i
[normal]n decisions 
[normal]about what is most important to them

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Young Start (Scotland) programme[bold] will deliver funding to people and communities most in need in Scotland. £8.9 million of funding from dormant bank accounts will help children and young people in Scotland become more confident, healthy, connected and e
[normal]nterprising. One element of this fund is supporting young people to be better prepared for employment or to establish their own enterprise. This includes supporting work experience placements with local employers and volunteering placements with social ent
[normal]erprises. For more information see 
[normal]http://www.bigfund.org.uk/global-content/programmes/scotland/young-start
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Of relevance to Question 5: [bold]As already mentioned, Talent Match brings together a wide cross-sector partnership in each target area, including partners who had not worked together before.  We facilitated this in Talent Match through the use 
[normal]of Big Lottery Fund Advisers in each area, who acted as a dedicated point of contact and ‘critical friend’ to
[normal] 
[normal]each partnership to aid its development.
[normal] 
[normal]The Fund has 
[normal]also 
[normal]funded an innovative and effective cross sector partnership of employers 
[normal]in the public,
[normal] private and third sectors offering vocational training for young people.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Community Fixers[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Fund
[normal] has awarded £1,710,161 to the Federation of London Youth Clubs (FLYC) to deliver a programme of shared learning of practical skills through the refurbishment of empty council owned social housing in a state of disrepair. The Community Fixers scheme brings
[normal] together young people, adult volunteers and older retired or semi-retired trade people to offer practical learning through the repair and renovation of 40 empty houses across the London Borough of Lambeth, fitting with the council's Empty Property Strateg
[normal]y.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The award followed a successful 
[normal]community regeneration pilot project in Brixton, 
[normal]Lambeth
[normal] to develop vocational skills for young people, delivered by a cross sector partnership including Voluntary sector, Local Authority and local business. The pilot fo
[normal]cused on enabling inter-generational skills sharing through the repair and return to use of empty homes. For more information see
[normal] 
[normal]http://volunteerityourse
[normal]l
[normal]f.com/
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Community Fixers will allow 1,500 young 
[normal]volunteers aged 14-24 (mainly NEET) the opportunity to learn in a non-classroom environment with the aim of achieving a National Open College Network qualification by learning and applying new skills to enhance progress into further training, work placemen
[normal]ts or employment. Skills will include carpentry, plumbing, electrical skills, decorating and glazing. The scheme also offers volunteering opportunities for 800 adults and 400 retired or semi-retired, but still active trades-people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The project will also a
[normal]ddress the wasted resource of empty properties which attract social problems such as crime and drug use whilst encouraging shared inter-
[normal]generational learning, with older people passing on their skills and knowledge. Graduates of the first year of the proje
[normal]ct will be encouraged to return as mentors in the second year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As well as a partnership with Lambeth Council, further support will be offered by project partners such as London Youth and The Co-Sponsorship Agency. FLYC will use its links with youth clubs 
[normal]to engage with young people who are turned off by formal education. The Beth Johnson Foundation will monitor and evaluate the intergenerational aspect to identify and disseminate best practice. Trade volunteers will be recruited from groups such as Men 
[normal]In
[normal] 
[normal]Sheds and Retired Trades Association, while local building companies and traders will help supply tools and materials, with an agreement with Wicks already established.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4[bold]. [bold]              [bold]LEARNING [bold]AND GOOD PRACTICE [bold]ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4
[normal].1 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Fund has a lot of learning based on programme evaluations, as well as a number of reports for people developing and running programmes or projects for young people. Evaluations from the range of our investments highlight the following learning points:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].2
[normal]              
[normal]Holistic approaches that take account of young people’s wider concerns and experiences are far likely to be effective. Partnerships between statutory and voluntary providers can be an 
[normal]effective way of achieving this, as highlighted above
[normal]– statutory servic
[normal]es have comparatively universal reach, while voluntary services can offer more flexibility and personalised support. The latter can also help to overcome mistrust of statutory services.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].3 
[normal]              
[normal]Summer holidays at the end of compulsory education had earlier 
[normal]been recognised as a risk for allowing young people to fall out of touch with education, guidance and employment services. But the roots of disengagement may go back a lot further. Successful interventions are likely to take explicit account of these facto
[normal]rs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].4
[normal]              
[normal]Initiatives need to be very clear about what they intend to achieve and to elaborate detailed and shared understandings of how to get there. Many initiatives fail to meet stakeholder expectations because of unstated assumptions that can easily lea
[normal]d to confusion when 
[normal]operationalised
[normal]: focusing on developing self-esteem, for instance, is unlikely to lead directly to higher participation in education.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].5 
[normal]              
[normal]Involving young people directly in planning and running interventions can be a powerful motivato
[normal]r, not only by promoting more relevant and “owned” services, but by helping young people to develop experience, confidence and skills that are readily transferable to the world of work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].6 
[normal]              
[normal]Employers are not only interested in qualifications: they increa
[normal]singly value softer personal skills, many of which can be nurtured if necessary outside of formal educational provision. Opening young people up to new experiences and to meeting others from different backgrounds can be particularly effective in supporting
[normal] this approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].7 
[normal]              
[normal]Many of the projects 
[normal]the Fund
[normal] supports gather their own learning, are models of good practice and support new and innovative approaches to tackling an issue. Case studies and details of projects we have funded are available from our w
[normal]ebsite
