defaultWe have used evidence

default areas across England wher

defaultachieve a significant and lasting impact. 
defaultWe ha
defaultve taken a range of considerations and the advice of stakeholders and young people into account when deciding where to target, and chosen the geographic areas covered by Local Enterprise Part
defaultnerships (LEP) as our start point
default, these areas reflecting economic rather than traditional boundaries
default. In each of these areas partnerships have been formed to bring about locally owned solutions to local youth unemployment issues and to 
defaultuse their local int
defaultelligence and experience to 
defaultfurther refine our chosen areas.

default strategies. Our offer aligns to the social inclusion and poverty objective. Over the coming months, we will be w
defaultorking closely with those LEPs that decide to op-in to understand their local needs and refine the delivery arrangements. From conversations already in train, we expect that out learning, expertise and networks from Talent Match will be of considerable int

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProjects have also helped to develop young people’s employability skills, including presentation and communication skills, leadership, and assertiveness. For instance 3,356 young people aged 11 to 25 received awards of £250 to £5,000 to run their own proje
defaultct as part of Big Boost. Many of them benefited from training and developed skills for their future careers including team working, communication and decision making. In Scotland YPF consistently helped between 6% and 16% of young people to access employme
defaultnt, go to college, access an apprenticeship or training or to go to university.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA range of YPF programme evaluation reports have captured learning and informed our current and future investments in this area. As well as considering the overall success of
default projects and programmes in achieving what they set out to, the evaluation had a strong focus on considering approaches to effective involvement by young people – so the publications available here include good practice guides on that and related subjects

default  
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity Fixersdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Fund
default has awarded £1,710,161 to the Federation of London Youth Clubs (FLYC) to deliver a programme of shared learning of practical skills through the refurbishment of empty council owned social housing in a state of disrepair. The Community Fixers scheme brings
default together young people, adult volunteers and older retired or semi-retired trade people to offer practical learning through the repair and renovation of 40 empty houses across the London Borough of Lambeth, fitting with the council's Empty Property Strateg
defaulty.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe award followed a successful 
defaultcommunity regeneration pilot project in Brixton, 
defaultLambeth
default to develop vocational skills for young people, delivered by a cross sector partnership including Voluntary sector, Local Authority and local business. The pilot fo
defaultcused on enabling inter-generational skills sharing through the repair and return to use of empty homes. For more information see

default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunity Fixers will allow 1,500 young 
defaultvolunteers aged 14-24 (mainly NEET) the opportunity to learn in a non-classroom environment with the aim of achieving a National Open College Network qualification by learning and applying new skills to enhance progress into further training, work placemen
defaultts or employment. Skills will include carpentry, plumbing, electrical skills, decorating and glazing. The scheme also offers volunteering opportunities for 800 adults and 400 retired or semi-retired, but still active trades-people.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe project will also a
defaultddress the wasted resource of empty properties which attract social problems such as crime and drug use whilst encouraging shared inter-
defaultgenerational learning, with older people passing on their skills and knowledge. Graduates of the first year of the proje
defaultct will be encouraged to return as mentors in the second year.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs well as a partnership with Lambeth Council, further support will be offered by project partners such as London Youth and The Co-Sponsorship Agency. FLYC will use its links with youth clubs 
defaultto engage with young people who are turned off by formal education. The Beth Johnson Foundation will monitor and evaluate the intergenerational aspect to identify and disseminate best practice. Trade volunteers will be recruited from groups such as Men 
defaultIn
default 
defaultSheds and Retired Trades Association, while local building companies and traders will help supply tools and materials, with an agreement with Wicks already established.

default.1 
default              
default              
defaultThe 
defaultFund has a lot of learning based on programme evaluations, as well as a number of reports for people developing and running programmes or projects for young people. Evaluations from the range of our investments highlight the following learning points:
default&#xa0;
default4
default.2
default              
defaultHolistic approaches that take account of young people’s wider concerns and experiences are far likely to be effective. Partnerships between statutory and voluntary providers can be an 
defaulteffective way of achieving this, as highlighted above
default– statutory servic
defaultes have comparatively universal reach, while voluntary services can offer more flexibility and personalised support. The latter can also help to overcome mistrust of statutory services.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4
default.3 
default              
defaultSummer holidays at the end of compulsory education had earlier 
defaultbeen recognised as a risk for allowing young people to fall out of touch with education, guidance and employment services. But the roots of disengagement may go back a lot further. Successful interventions are likely to take explicit account of these facto
defaultrs.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.4
default              
defaultInitiatives need to be very clear about what they intend to achieve and to elaborate detailed and shared understandings of how to get there. Many initiatives fail to meet stakeholder expectations because of unstated assumptions that can easily lea
defaultd to confusion when 
defaultoperationalised
default: focusing on developing self-esteem, for instance, is unlikely to lead directly to higher participation in education.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.5 
default              
defaultInvolving young people directly in planning and running interventions can be a powerful motivato
defaultr, not only by promoting more relevant and “owned” services, but by helping young people to develop experience, confidence and skills that are readily transferable to the world of work.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.6 
default              
defaultEmployers are not only interested in qualifications: they increa
defaultsingly value softer personal skills, many of which can be nurtured if necessary outside of formal educational provision. Opening young people up to new experiences and to meeting others from different backgrounds can be particularly effective in supporting
default this approach.
default&#xa0;
default4
default.7 
default              
defaultMany of the projects 
defaultthe Fund
default supports gather their own learning, are models of good practice and support new and innovative approaches to tackling an issue. Case studies and details of projects we have funded are available from our w
