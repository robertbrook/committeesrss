[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; Para 5, Strategic Case for HS2 HM Treasury &amp; Infrastructure UK, October 2010, updated December 2012. https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/infrastructure-uk/series/national-infrastructure-plan  Vehicle technology is advancing quickly, and systems that interact with their surroundings and with other vehicles are becoming increasingly common. These technologies create the opportunity for vehicles that can autonomously manage actions that are currently reserved for the driver and could, in the future, be able to carry out all of the driver tasks. The UK has a fantastic opportunity to be at the forefront of these developments” – Para 3.39, Action for Roads, Command Paper Cm 8679, DfT July 2013 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212590/action-for-roads.pdf  “The Committee repeats its call for the Department to publish a national transport strategy to explain what the Government aims to achieve by spending money on transport and how its policies support these aims. It is now a full year since we first made this recommendation in our report on Transport and Economy so we look forward to hearing more from Ministers on this crucial matter when that report is debated on the floor of the House on 28 February" – Louise Ellman MP, 23rd February 2012 http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/transport-committee/news/scrutiny-of-dft-pn-report-/ “We recommend that a White Paper be published, clarifying the Government’s objectives for all transport spending and the criteria it will use for deciding between different claims on the available resources” – Recommendation 5, Transport and the Economy, Third Report of Session 2010-12, House of Commons Transport Committee http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmtran/473/473.pdf  “In our report on Transport and the economy we called for the DfT to publish a strategy to explain what the Government aims to achieve by spending money on transport and how its policies support these aims. The department dismissed our recommendation, pointing us to the lists of actions in the business plan. The business plan is a useful and informative document but it does little more than list transport policies and target dates for implementation. It sits in a strategic vacuum and can easily be overtaken by events” - “Counting the cost: financial scrutiny of the Department for Transport 2011–12, Fifteenth Report of Session 2010-12, House of Commons Transport Committee http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/1560/1560.pdf  “The absence of a transport strategy makes it hard to assess how HS2 relates to other major transport infrastructure schemes, regional planning and wider objectives, such as bridging the north-south divide. The biggest single transport investment proposed in this Parliament should be grounded in a well thought- through strategic framework and we are disappointed that the Government has not developed a strategy for transport, particularly after it rejected our earlier recommendation to publish a White Paper on transport and the economy” – Recommendation 1, High Speed Rail, Tenth Report of Session 2010-12 http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmtran/1185/1185.pdf  “Appraisal of alternative options lies outside your brief but is important in the context of allocating the limited funds available for investment in the national transport network” - HS2 Ltd Analytical Challenge Panel 17th Dec 2010 “The National Policy Statement on national networks … will set the context in which HS2 will be considered” – para. 1.2.10, High Speed Rail, London to the West Midlands and Beyond, A Report to Government by High Speed Two Ltd. December 2009 http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/legislation-and-advice/national-policy-statements/  “A Conservative Government will support proposals along the lines of the plan put forward by engineering firm, Arup, for a new Heathrow rail hub. This would link Heathrow terminals directly into the main rail network and the lines to Reading, Oxford, Bristol, Plymouth, Cardiff, Swansea, Cheltenham and Southampton, greatly improving public transport links to the airport. The plan would also include construction of a new high speed link connecting Heathrow airport to the Channel Tunnel Rail link and the new route north, providing a viable alternative to thousands of short haul flights now clogging up the airport” - Conservative Rail Review, February 2009 http://www.conservatives.com/%7E/media/Files/Downloadable%20Files/Railreview.ashx?dl=true  “I think that [the Hub] is an attractive idea. It’s vital that we have an integrated approach to planning new rail capacity and any new airport capacity that’s also required” – Lord Adonis, Secretary of State for Transport, Sunday Times 4th January 2009, http://cma.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Test/politics/article141091.ece  Column 356, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090115/debtext/90115-0006.htm “Early tests suggested that reducing journey times by one minute would provide benefits of around £300-600m on a fully utilised high speed line” – p.17, HS2 Demand Model Analysis, HS2 Ltd.

Speeds are to be cut back from upwards of 350 kph to 200 kph-250 kph with a maximum of 300 kph” - http://chinabystander.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/slow-train-coming/ “Other than some detailed design issues, HS1 has fitted into the surrounding countryside well, with few complaints” – Getting Back on Track, Campaign to Protect Rural England 2011 www.cpre.co.uk/resources/transport/item/download/379  “Damage to landscape, heritage and tranquillity must be minimal, for example by running new lines along existing road and rail lines wherever possible, as well as extensive tunnelling, landscaping and noise barriers”  - CPRE http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/transport/rail/highspeedrail  http://rightlines.org.uk/  “On environmental grounds, the new line (between Cologne and the Rhine/Main conurbation) was generally constructed in parallel with an existing motorway, as close to it as possible. For this reason, the maximum gradient was set at 40%, minimum track radius at 3350m and maximum cant at 170mm, which allows a design speed of 300 km/hr around curves.”  - Dr.Ing. Eberhard Jaensch, Network Strategy Unit, DB Netz AG, Railway Technical Review 2/05 “The route exploits the natural lie of the land and runs alongside the motorway to minimise environmental impact … within a corridor with an already dense infrastructure” – The New High Speed Turin - Milan Line, RFI 2005 http://www.rfi.it/cms-file/allegati/rfi/The%20new%20high%20speed%20TURIN%20-%20MILAN%20line.pdf “The preferred route of HS2 crosses the Chilterns AONB at its widest point, in contradiction to the policy followed by HS1. In Kent, the route of HS1 was amended to avoid the AONB … and run beside the existing M20, a major strategic transport corridor which reduced incremental noise pollution and landscape damage. By contrast, HS2 appears to have been deliberately routed through the least spoilt, widest part of the Chilterns” – Steve Baker MP, Westminster Hall debate 23rd November 2010 http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101123/halltext/101123h0001.htm#10112319000001 “The Chilterns Conservation Board is very concerned that the construction and presence of such a major piece of transport infrastructure would permanently blight the Chilterns.

[146109]Mr Simon Burns: As part of the Government's comprehensive spending review in 2010, £773 million was allocated to the development of the High Speed 2 Project. This has increased to around £900 million, primarily due to an increase in the capital budget relating to property compensation.
