&#xa0;Written evidence from  Fellowtravellers Ltd (TIC 020)&#xa0;Fellowtravellers is a prototype brokerage system aimed at delivering an alternative model of demand responsive passenger transport.   The aim is to deliver comprehensive taxi-bus services by utilising a variety of approaches.1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Approach 1:  Provide a dedicated forum where prospective travellers can ask for taxi-bus routes they require in the long term (for work commute, school run or similar regular journey).  Such route requests should be clustered together and be subject to precise query by potential providers (i.e.  show all route requests between point A &amp; point B within the time window of ???)&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Approach 2: Provide a database where taxi operators can list taxi-bus routes they are considering trialling, as a means of gathering expressions of interest from potential travellers.&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Approach 3: Provide a database where taxi  operators can list taxi-bus routes they are actively operating, and provide a means to log seat availability and to organise bookings.&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Approach 4: Offer guaranteed taxi-bus services to fixed settings with high demand within variable radius &amp; sub-contract transport to suitable taxi-operators.Approaches 1-3 are available on the prototype system:  www.fellowtravellers.co.ukApproach 4 has been successfully trialled in rural North Yorkshire over a three week period in 2010; offering guaranteed taxi-bus services to and from a theatre production at Ripley Castle within a radius of 25 miles for .30p per person per mile.   The trial provided door-to-door transport for 80 people over the three week period, with some travelling just a couple of miles, and others travelling from as far as York.  It was delivered at break-even cost.  It is anticipated that this model could be extended to offer similar guarantees to transport to towns at commuter times. &#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
