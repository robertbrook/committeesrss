[normal]Dr D C Turner &amp; Dr Beryl Turner – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We write in support of the proposals made by the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance, in particular that “All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be reclassified as Restricted Byways”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have experience in two public enquiries on the status of green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales National Park: Arncliffe Cote to Street Gate in1999-2000 and the Gorbeck road between Malham Moor and Langcliffe in 2005-2006. Both were lengthy and costly exercises in which extensive research on historic use was presented. Both inspectors eventually concluded that motor vehicles had rights to use these roads, although in the Arncliffe Cote to Street Gate enquiry only after reversing an earlier determination as a bridleway. Subsequently Traffic Restriction Orders have been imposed upon both routes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have witnessed the serious damage caused by recreational motor vehicles on these and other local green lanes. For example, the unsurfaced road from New Bridge, Litton to Blishmire House on the Halton Gill to Langcliffe road became badly damaged a few years ago especially between grid references SD897742 and SD886741 and consequently the North Yorkshire Council had to undertake extensive repairs to it. This is still open to use by off-road motor vehicles. Similarly, the track from Halton Gill in Littondale to Raisgill in Langstrothdale via Horse Head Pass became badly damaged by off-road vehicles; it is now protected by a TRO although the surface remains so badly broken and eroded that walking on it is difficult.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Green lanes need protection because of their historic importance and because they provide routes for walkers, cyclists and horse-riders into remote and peaceful countryside away from motor traffic. Much administrative time and effort have been spent in the past on disputes over their status. If they were all reclassified as UCRs, the lanes would be protected and administration costs greatly reduced.
