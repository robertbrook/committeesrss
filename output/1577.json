"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by UKlpg (HOT16)&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLP Gas has the potential to make a major contribution to the UK’s demanding carbon reduction \ntargets in the heat sector, with minimal need for infrastructure changes and investment. Making economic and environmental sense for politicians, rural businesses and householders when planning how to meet future energy needs\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKLPG commissioned \nindependent energy consultants Delta-ee to demonstrate and provide evidence of how LP Gas could contribute to reducing carbon in the off grid heat sector. In its modelling it concluded that:\n“A mix of low carbon LP Gas technologies could deliver significant carbon savings by 2030.”&#xa0;1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExcluding m\nixed solutions is unrealistic: n\new renewable technologies, especially those that are weather dependent need to be backed by constant fuel sources.  Consumers need reliable heat power and the reality is that fossil fue\nls will be a part of this mix.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncourage consumers towards prag\nmatic but efficient solutions: as a clean burning,\n lower carbon, gaseous fuel, LPG has a role to play to drive down emissions and can easily work in combination with other fuels and technologi\nes as consumers move to improve their homes’ efficiency.  Government should be helping consumers to take up the cleanest and most efficient options which allow them the reliability that they need.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNow and in the future: LP\n \nG\nas\n has a greater role to play t\no drive down emissions and can easily work in combination with other fuels and technologies as consumers move to improve their homes’ efficiency.\n&#xa0;\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen off grid reliability is key, options where there is integration with the building’s existing heating \nsystem ensures continuous energy for heat.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKLPG is the one voice of the LP Gas industry in the UK, representing an industry worth over £750 million to the economy and employing over 10,000 people.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKLPG represents all the major LPG distribution companies, retailers and equipment suppliers in the UK and a number of producers. Member companies cover over 95% of the total LPG sales in the UK.  \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLP Gas is sold into bulk tanks at customers’ locations in\n off grid areas, or in cylinders for portable use throughout the UK. LP\n \nG\nas\n is used in rural areas of the UK as a source of domestic and commercial heating and cooking, as well as agricultural grain drying and poultry rearing, and finally as a transport fu\nel.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPropane and Butane gases, collectively known as LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) are sourced either from separating the products from natural gas streams, or from oil refinery processes. LP\n \nG\nas \nis a relatively small part of the barrel, some 2-3% of the o\nutput of refined products, but is used extensively for off grid domestic and commercial heating - as is portable bottled gas - in industrial processes and in the petro-chemical industry. \n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA total of 3.5 million tonnes of LP Gas is used in the UK, of which\n two thirds is used in the petro-chemical industry and the remaining third sold into the inland heating and industrial market. Two thirds of LP Gas produced in the UK comes from refinery production versus one third from gas separation.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLP\n \nG\nas\n is cost effe\nctive due to its efficiency.  In its liquid form it is also so compact that one unit of gas holds the fuel of 270 units of gas.  LPG can be up to five times more efficient than traditional fuels.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsumption of energy for heat in the home is\n on a downward trend with promising new technologies offering further efficiency gains.\n The priority has to be to maintain this trend and the good news is that gas\n - including liquefied petroleum gas -\n technology still has an enormous amount to offer. For \nexample, two thirds of properties still have older non-condensing boilers and therefore still have significant savings available at relatively low cost.\n There\n is also a raft of exciting new technologies coming on to the market which will further accelerate\n the decline in energy consumption and carbon emissions and can be used in off gas grid areas as well. \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSeveral LP Gas technology options will be available in the next few years that can deliver carbon savings in rural buildings out to 2030. Today boiler \nplus options\n \nare already available at relatively low cost for domestic properties with hybrid technologies recently available, and commercial gas \nabsorption\n \nheat pumps \n(GAHPs) \nall being sold with LP Gas options.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA study into the role of LP Gas to heat rural homes and businesses was carried out by Delta Energy Environment. The resulting report, entitled \nOpportunity for Low Carbon LP Gas in Rural Heating to 2030\n reviewed existing and new heating technologies such as hybrid air source heat pumps, 18 kw LP Gas \nGAHPs\n, fuel cell micro combined heat and power, engine micro combined heat and power, boiler plus solar thermal, boiler plus flue gas heat recovery, and boil\ner plus controls. \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDelta-ee found that in addition to the 42% energy savings from low-carbon LP Gas technologies, that in old detached properties, LP Gas \nGAHPs\n deliver savings of 3.5 tonnes of CO2 per year. Rural hotels show a savings of 10 tonnes per yea\nr.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to Delta-ee \nmodelling for a detached pre-1900 property there are cost saving, as well as carbon saving benefits when using LP Gas. \nRunning cost savings are a high priority for customer decision making LP Gas heat pumps offer a very attractive\n reduction in annual running costs (~£1,200 per year). Hybrid ASHPs &amp; boiler plus controls are quite attractive delivering savings of ~£350 / yr. For other technologies, savings are more modest at &lt;£300 per year.\n&#xa0;\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGas Absorption Heat Pumps – a renewable ga\ns technology which can be retrofitted on to a home’s existing central heating system\n has already been recognised \nas a key low carbon technology \nin the latest DECC paper \nThe Future of Heating- Meeting the Challenge\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSignificant improvements in energy effic\niency in the housing stock can be achieved through replacement of inefficient appliances by technologies such as the condensing boiler, which utilises the latent heat of water produced from the burning of fuel, in addition to the standard sensible heat, to\n increase its efficiency. Condensing technology, an established and cost-effective solution has a demonstrated potential to increase boilers efficiency by 15-20 percent as compared to their conventional equivalents. \n&#xa0;\n3.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLPG and solar or wind energy are a natural partnership: Solar and wind are great examples of how LPG can offer reliability and security to renewables. LPG can be used as a primary or complementary source of energy, helping to overcome the intermittent natu\nre of these energy sources.\n These modern systems —often referred to as hybrids — combine the reliability of a conventional fuel with the numerous benefits of renewable energy to provide warm water for millions of consumers across Europe. Hybrid solutions c\nan also be desig\nned to meet space-heating needs.\n&#xa0;\n3.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are potential \nrisks\n associated with the promotion of fuels like biomass as these may reduce carbon dioxide emissions while contributing to the problem of climate change through their high black carbon\n emissions.  The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) noted the risk of biomass resulting in an increase in black carbon emissions in a 2010 report [AEGPL].\n&#xa0;\n3.10.\n \nLP\n \nG\nas\n produces low levels of particle and NOx emissions, meaning that it does no\nt pollute the air as much as many other energy sources.  For three priority pollutants; hydrocarbons,  nitrous oxides  and particle matter, as well as on carbon monoxide, toxics and heavy metals, gaseous fuels’ air pollution footprints are lower than those\n of liquid fuels (heating oil and residual oil) and dramatically lower than those of solid fuels (coal and wood). [LPG and Air Quality: A Scientific Review, Atlantic consulting].\n&#xa0;\n3.11.\n \nBiomass is proving to be\n risky\n: a\n switch to biomass fuelled heating – as some policies seem to be encouraging - could increase black carbon and particulate emissions and perversely lead\n to increased air pollution\n, an issue which government health figures already\n \nattribute to the cause of \nup to\n 80,000\n deaths\n per year\n \n.  \n&#xa0;\n3.12.\n \nElectricity should not be considered a green alternative until cleaner methods of generation are developed. Currently the facts suggest that electricity will remain reliant on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. The r\nole of coal in electricity production in the EU-27, is projected to decline only modestly, from 26% in 2010 to 22% in 2030. [AEGPL]\n&#xa0;\n3.13.\n \nWhen off grid reliability is \nimportant;\n options where there is integration with the building’s existing heating system ensu\nres continuous energy for heat.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment needs to r\necognise the role of a “balanced approach”, and to gain consumer momentum \nfor\n all low carbon alternatives should be included in the UK Policy framework. Government should take positive action to include LP Gas low carbon alternatives in the heat sector to help drive down carbon emissions while supporting the infrastructure transiti\non while electricity is decarbonised out to 2030. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThrough policies such as the Renewable Heat Incentive and the Green Deal encourage consumers towards pragmatic but efficient solutions. LP Gas is a natural partner to some renewable technologies, and can \nhelp overcome some of the short term barriers for consumer transition. It has an existing supply chain in place as well as an industry which has significant expertise in the unique hard to treat properties found off grid.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Delta-EE ReportA copy of the \nexecutive summary of this report is available in PDF format via our website at \nhttp://www.uklpg.org/exceptional-energy/lp-gas-providing-low-carbon-heat/\n \n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
