"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Housing Ombudsman [PHS0034]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI \nam grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to your committee's \ninquiries into complaints handling.\nBefore addressing the specific questions posed in your letter, I think it would be \nhelpful to the work of your committee if I sketched ou\nt some background information \non the Housing Ombudsman.\nBackground to the Housing Ombudsman Service Jurisdiction:The statutory Housing Ombudsman was created by the Housing Act 1996 and \ncommenced operating as such on 1 April 1997. The relevant provisions of the1996 Act were amended in the Housing and Regeneration Act of 2008 and, more \nsignificantly, in the Localism Act of 2011. The Housing Ombudsman is a corporation \nsole and operates unde\nr a Scheme approved by the Secretary of State (of the \nDCLG).\nI am the second statutory Housing Ombudsman and was appointed in 2001. Until 1 \nApril 2013 my jurisdiction covered private not-for-profit (or 'not-for-dividend') \nlandlords who are required by the \n1996 Act to be members of my Scheme \"for all his \nhousing activities\" and private for-profit landlords and managing agents who may \nchose to be members. Since 1 April 2013 all the retained stock owned or managed \nby Local Housing Authorities (LHAs) or by Arms\n Length Management Organisations \n(ALMOs) on their behalf has come within my jurisdiction. Leaseholders of all \nmember landlords are protected by my Scheme; there are, for example, about \n300,000 leaseholders of LHAs and they, like leaseholders in the 'housin\ng \nassociation' sector, do not fall into the definition of 'social housing' in the 2008 Act.\nSince 1 April 2013, therefore, it would be possible to categorise the Housing \nOmbudsman Service as a 'hybrid', having jurisdiction in both the private and public\n \nsectors. This is captured in our mission statement which is \"impartial dispute \nresolution in rented housing\".\nThere are now 5.1 million units and about 12.5 million people in my jurisdiction. My Service is funded by the private, for-profit and not-for-profit, landlords who pay £1.47 \nper unit per annum and grant-in-aid from government of £847,000 for the LHA \ndimens\nion of my jurisdiction.\nLocalism act 2011:The Secretary of State chose my Service to be the single housing ombudsman in the \nLocalism Act so that there would be a \"common route of redress for housing tenants\" and \"consistency in the treatment of complaints\n\".\nIn 2011, the impact assessment which preceded the Bill stated that government policy was to:\n\"...provide a common route of redress for all complaints about the performance of social housing landlords by designating a single, specialist \nombudsman for soc\nial housing. In April 2010 a new cross-domain regulatory system was brought into effect, ensuring that tenants of local authorities and \nhousing associations can expect a broadly similar level of service from their \nlandlord. Given the move \nto consistent standards across social housing, we \nnow wish to put complaint handling on a more consistent footing \nby\ndesignating\n a single ombudsman for all complaints about social housing \nlandlords. At the same time, we want to ensure that there continues \nto be \na\nhigh\n quality ombudsman service for all social housing tenants and their \nrepresentatives\"\nDesignating my Service as the single housing ombudsman was the preferred option because of our \"existing single focus on housing\". The option of giving the ext\nended \njurisdiction to the Local Government Ombudsmen was rejected as that would not \nhave resulted in there being a single ombudsman \"specialising\" in complaints about \nlandlords as their remit covers all Local Government services. This was consistent \nwith g\novernment's intention to have a single ombudsman in the context of a single, \ncross-domain regulator where there were \"common standards set by a single regulator\" and where it would make little sense for complaints about landlord performance (including agai\nnst the standards) to be considered by two different ombudsmen.\nThese changes in the Localism Act stemmed from the government's recent review of social housing regulation which concluded, among other things, that the system for \nmanaging social housing comp\nlaints should be changed in order to strengthen the \nrole of locally elected representatives and tenant groups, and address a perceived democratic deficit in understanding of housing issues at the local level. The review \nrecommended that a 'democratic filter' should be introduced so that in future tenants \nwho had exhausted their landlord's complaints procedure would have to go through their local tenant panel, MP, or councillor, who, in turn, would seek to resolve the \ncomp\nlaint before, if needed, referring the issue to the Ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\nIf there had not been changes to the Bill as it passed through the House of Lords \ncomplaints would only have reached me if one of these 'designated persons' had referred it on to me. If they had not, the grievance would have died where it stood \nand complainants would have been barred from bringing the issue to me. Their only, and remote\n, opportunity for redress would have been through the ballot box.\nChanges in the Lords resulted in residents being given a much wider range of \nchoices in terms of seeking resolution of their grievances if not satisfied at the \nconclusion of their landlords'\n internal complaints procedures (ICPs).\nDirect access to the Housing Ombudsman:In spite of clear provision to the contrary in the Localism Act, a myth has grown up \nthat disputes cannot come to me until eight weeks have passed after completion of \nproviders\n' internal complaints procedures (ICPs). This is a misunderstanding of the \nAct and of my Scheme approved by the Secretary of State.\nIt is true that one choice would be to wait eight weeks and come straight to me but \nresidents \nmight decide instead to go to \na designated person (any MP, a local \ncouncillor, or a designated tenant panel) and ask them to resolve the dispute. What is less commonly understood is that they may go to a designated person and ask \nthem to refer their dispute to me immediately. The desig\nnated person may agree to \nor reject the request but, provided that agreement or rejection is in writing or \nconfirmed in writing, the matter could be with me the same day.\nThis means that all tenants of councils and of private, not-for-profit landlords may \nuse the designated persons to achieve not only the 'dual track' access to me that was recommended by the Law Commission but also resolution of disputes by designated persons themselves. The choice lies with tenants depending on their \nneeds and the outcomes\n they are seeking. Their landlords are best placed to help them make the right choice.\nTenants of those for-profit landlords who have chosen to join my Scheme can still \nbring their disputes to me without having to decide whether or not to engage with \ndesig\nnated persons.\nThe crucial upshot of these provisions is, of course, that all residents and tenants in \nmy jurisdiction may have immediate and direct access to my Service if they so wish.\nLocal dispute resolution:We have made changes to ensure that more resources are devoted to early, local resolution where that is appropriate and proportionate. One example of this is that I \nnow have the power, at any time, to promote local resolution of a dispute between \nany landl\nord and any tenant in my jurisdiction by either referring the complaint back to the complainant and provider (and/or a designated person) or by providing them \nwith assistance to resolve the dispute. Also, I may decide to suspend or not to \nprogress an inves\ntigation if I think there is opportunity to resolve the dispute locally. \nSo, for instance, if a complainant refers a matter to me before completing an ICP, my\n \nnew power enables me to offer a solution to the parties there and then. Equa\nlly, I \nmay propose a form of local resolution in any of the circumstances described above.\nStrategy reviews:In 2006 we carried out a fundamental review of our core process and people development practices. In consequence, performance against targets for the \norganisation improved yearly. The work that was then required to prepare for my \nextended jurisdiction amou\nnted to the most far-reaching review of the Service since \nit came into being on 1 April 1997.\nIn order to support Parliament's intention that, where possible, complaints should be \ndealt with simply and quickly at local level and that an effective service i\ns provided to \nthose cases which are escalated to me we executed an ambitious change \nprogramme which linked into our strategic imperatives. We carried out a fundamental \nreview of all aspects of the organisation with one of our most important priorities \nbein\ng to re-align resources to focus on front-end delivery.\nOur strategic aims for 2012-13 were delivered by means of a Transition Plan that \nidentified and mapped specific, timed objectives and work-streams that:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClarified and defined the precise nature and \nextent of my new role;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloped new policy regarding management processes and learning and \nknowledge-management in the context of my new jurisdiction;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReviewed governance to ensure appropriateness for a statutory ombudsman \nand his extended role and \njurisdiction;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReviewed and amended the approved Scheme;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRe-engineered the core dispute resolution process;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDesigned dispute resolution principles to be supported by learning delivery \nmedia.\nIn order to ensure that the internal structure of the organisation\n would be fit for \npurpose we:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeployed the right people in the right roles;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReduced the size and cost of the leadership team so that more resources \nwere applied to front-end service delivery;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRe-configured our office space to ensure that it was suitable for the necessary \nexpansion of the team;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloped internal systems to run the Designated Tenant Panels Register (in \naccordance with a specific provision in the Localism Act);\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloped a new we\nbsite to meet the needs of all of our key stakeholders;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApplied our stakeholder management and communication strategy and plan \nas critical factors in the delivery of the overall strategy and the mitigation of \nrisks.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHousing Ombudsman's new role:My new, two-pronged, role is now stated succinctly in the introduction to my new \nScheme that was approved by the Secretary of State in February 2013; it is to \nresolve disputes involving members of the Scheme, including making awards of \ncompensat\nion or other remedies when appropriate, as well as to support effective \nlandlord-tenant dispute resolution by others. This new, composite role is now \nreflected in the changes to our strategic outcomes, revisions to the Scheme which \nregulates the Service, t\nhe re-engineered core process, new Dispute Resolution \nPrinciples, new learning media, and a re-focussed stakeholder management \nstrategy.\nThe first 'prong' of my role is clearly reflected in our mission statement (above). We \naim to provide an escalated comp\nlaint-handling and dispute-resolution service which \nis trusted, valued, and respected because it is fair, independent, impartial (free of \nbias and prejudice), effective, efficient, transparent, appropriate, proportionate, and \nrelevant. Equally, we aim to p\nrovide or assist dispute resolution, especially locally, \nwherever possible and this theme is picked up in our vision which is to \"work with \nothers to increase trust in dispute resolution and to improve landlord and tenant \nrelations\".\nThe primary outcomes o\nf our vision and mission are that, in 2016:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTenants and landlords have increased trust in dispute resolution;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTenant and landlord relations are improved;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLandlords have a positive view of complaints;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDesignated persons are playing their part in resolving \ndisputes fairly.\nPhilosophy:The changes to my jurisdiction and role as from April 2013 required a consequential \nrevision to our philosophy which is now as follows:\n\"In essence, we provide a high quality, impartial service to people who live in, \nsupply, or manage housing. We offer our experience, skills, expertise, and guidance to help tenants, landlords, MPs, councillors, and tenant panels. We\nare not regulators. We are conciliators and problem-solvers. We provide objective solutions at the earli\nest appropriate point. We make a positive \ncontribution to the quality of housing and dispute resolution within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction by:\na) enabling and encouraging landlords to improve their standards of housing\nmanagement through our independent, \nimpartial, and objective role by:\n- explaining the advantages of complying with our determinations, and \n- encouraging a positive attitude to the value of the outcomes of complaints and similar feedback\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nhelping to improve tenants' individual and shared amenity, environment, \nand quality of life\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsharing our expertise, principles, and lessons learnt by highlighting \ninstances of good practice revealed by our process, and\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsupporting good landlord and tenant re\nlations.\"\nOverall strategic intent:By achieving our mission, vision, their primary outcomes, and our philosophy we \nshall realise our overall strategic intent which is to be relevant, make an impact, \nmake a difference, and add value by:\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeing a catalyst for change in the rented-housing sector having fundamentally \nre-engineered, once again, our dispute resolution process with particular \nemphasis on the customer's perspective;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBeing the champion of good practice and the source of excellence\n in \ncomplaint handling and dispute resolution in rented housing through \nappropriate and proportionate methods of dissemination;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDemonstrating that we are making an impact by collecting more data that \nprovide evidence of the success of the measures we shall\n set for \norganisational performance, service delivery, and monitoring improvement in \ndispute resolution practice in the sector;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApplying our resources proportionately to the ombudsman functions of \ninvestigation, systemic failures, and knowledge disseminati\non.\nDeveloping, improving, and enhancing the following nine characteristics of the value \nadded by our service delivery will make a significant contribution to the success of \nour strategy:\ni)\n              \nWe help improve customer service and positive relationships:\nThe outputs of our investigations where service failure or maladministration is found \nare in the form of recommendations or orders, or both.

They recognise, as the Law \nCommission put it (in their Consultation Paper 196 ) the \"political or moral pressure\" \non them to put things right following a decision of the Ombudsman. They are also confident that\n the Ombudsman is independent and operates an impartial, quality-\nmanaged process that draws conclusions only from careful analysis of available evidence.\niii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe provide advice, assistance, and signposting:\nEven before 1 April 2013 and the re-configuration of our core process to concentrate \nresources on early dispute resolution, about 90% of cases were already being closed \nwithout investigation.\nYear\nTotal complaints closed\nTotal investigations\nTotal closed \nwithout\ninvestigation\n2008-09\n7047\n715\n6332\n2009-10\n8280\n716\n7564\n2010-11\n9792\n864\n8928\n2011-12\n9951\n750\n9201\n&#xa0;\nOn many occasions people contacting us had not completed their landlord's internal \ncomplaints procedure (ICP). In most cases we used to advise completion of the ICP \nbecause the. former Scheme provided that, usually, the Ombudsman would not \nconsider complaints which in his opinion could still be pursued through providers' procedures.\nUnde\nr the new Scheme the value that we can add in these circumstances is even \ngreater because I now have the power, at any time, to promote local resolution of a \ndispute by either referring the complaint back to the complainant and provider and/or a designated\n person; or providing assistance to the complainant and provider and /or \na designated person to resolve the dispute.\nMany other cases are outside jurisdiction (OSJ) \n(e.g. \nthe provider may not be a \nmember of the Scheme, or the issue may not relate to a land\nlord and tenant \nrelationship \netc) \nand we may not be able to assist further. Nevertheless, whenever \nwe can, we give information or advice on process and, where possible, signpost people to other agencies that may be able to help them. The table below \ndemons\ntrates this activity up to the commencement of my new jurisdiction and our \nnew processes and procedures.\nGateway Outcomes\n2008-09\n2009-10\n2010-11\n2011-12\nAssist ICP\n63%\n64%\n62%\n51%\nInfo given\n14%\n16%\n24%\n36%\nOSJ\n21%\n18%\n12%\n12%\nOther\n2%\n2%\n2%\n2%\n&#xa0;\niv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe give an external perspective:\nOften, we 'shine a light' into areas that are obscured from the view of providers. \nUsually, they accept our findings, acknowledge their failings, and put them right. Even when they may be displeased by the discovery that their systems or \nmanagement procedures are not as good as they thought they were providers still \ntend to accept our de\ncisions recognising that they are fair and un-biased and that the \nOmbudsman has a unique perspective on the way their organisations operate in \npractice.\nv)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe make \n'gratis' \nrecommendations:\nEven where we do not make a finding of service failure or maladminist\nration we \nsometimes make suggestions to providers for them to consider as part of their customer care and service provision. How they deal with those suggestions is a \nmatter for them but we consider this to be another contribution to the value that we \ncan \nadd to providers and their residents to enrich service provision and customer \ncare.\nvi)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe identify service failure:\nFrom April 2013 and the operation of the new Scheme, I have been able to make \nfindings not only of maladministration but also service failure. A finding of \nmaladministration or, indeed, severe maladministration will still be available to and \nwill be made in appropriate circumstances but extending the spectrum of \nmaladministration wi\nll \nenable findings that would not have merited the strength of \ncriticism evoked by the concept of 'maladministration'. Feedback we have received \nfrom providers and other \nstakeholders indicates that providers are more likely to \nreact with good grace to, and\n residents will, accordingly, benefit from, such findings \nwhich can be expressed in more conciliatory and positive terms.\nvii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe encourage local solutions:\nI now have the power to authorise the drafting of many more orders and \nrecommendations in terms that wil\nl set out the presenting issues and then require \nproviders to design appropriate remedial actions. Again, feedback from providers \nand other stakeholders during the consultation process that preceded formal \napproval of my new Scheme, indicated that provider\ns would more likely to be \nencouraged to take responsibility for resolving disputes and be more likely to \nproduce an outcome that suits local conditions and meets the particular needs of residents especially if providers work with tenant scrutiny panels. We\n are gathering \ndata against which we shall test these assumptions.\nviii)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder the terms of my Scheme, providers are expected to comply with my \ndeterminations. If they do not, I have the power to:\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRequire them to report to me on compliance with a determination in such a \nway and at such a time as I may specify;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReport them to any appropriate regulatory agency and/or, in accordance with \nthe policy o\nf localism and co-regulation as expressed in the Localism Act, the \nboards, committees, or tenant scrutiny panels of providers;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOrder them to publish that they have failed to comply, in such a way as I see fit;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublish the facts and circumstances of non-compliance naming the providers \nin my annual report or elsewhere.\nix)\n              \nWe share our learning:\nAn important objective of my Service has always been to share lessons learnt not \nonly with landlords but also with other\ns with an interest in the outcomes of our core \nprocess. Traditionally, we have done this by publishing reports, speaking at \nconferences and seminars, and providing training for Board members, front-line staff, and tenants. Landlords, in particular, have fe\nd back to us that these initiatives have \nhelped them to change and to design policies and practices in respect of complaint-\nhandling in particular and wider customer service in general. Our historical shared-\nlearning \ninter-actions with providers and residents were so well-valued and \nrespected that we were frequently approached by landlords and landlord and tenant \nbodies to deliver it for them by special request.\nTo deliver our current vision and mission we intend to wo\nrk with landlords and \ntenants to resolve disputes that come to us impartially using processes that are fair, \nevidence-based, and free of bias and prejudice. These principles of dispute \nresolution will be,the basis of \nour work with landlords, tenants, MPs, \ncouncillors, and \ntenant panels. We are developing an extended set of dispute resolution principles \nwhich will be augmented by complementary learning media. Working with all \ninterested parties, we aim to achieve accessible dispute resolution that will be of\n \nbenefit to both landlords and tenants and encourage landlords to use these \noutcomes to improve the services they provide.\nGovernance:The Housing Act 1996 (Sch. 2., para.10) provides for the Ombudsman's Scheme to \nbe administered by a body corporate or by \na corporation sole. Until 1 April 2013 \nthere was a body corporate, IHO Limited, a company limited by guarantee and not \ntrading for profit which, in 2006, was designated as an eNDPB. The Board \ncomprised equal numbers of tenants, landlords, and independents \n(the 'constituency \nmodel'). The Secretary of State made an order establishing The Housing \nOmbudsman as a corporation sole. As Ombudsman, Chief Executive, and\n \nAccounting Officer, I am supported\n by an Audit and Risk Committee. In accordance \nwith an express provision in the Scheme I may set up a Panel of Advisors but such a \ngroup is not part of the governance of the corporation sole and advises me \npersonally.\nThe principal reasons for changes in g\novernance were:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo support my independence as Ombudsman in the discharge of my \nstatutory function;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo remove 'double governance';\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo reduce the costs (direct and indirect) of servicing two full governance \nstructures;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo remove the potential for conflict \narising from my three roles;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extension of jurisdiction under the Localism Act 2011;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo reflect my future status as an office holder not an employee.\nI turn now to the specific points raised in your letter. \nHarmonisation of Ombudsman Schemes Ease of access:Two of the primary outcomes of our mission and vision are that tenants and \nlandlords have increased trust in dispute resolution and designated persons are \nplaying their part in resolving disputes fairly. It is important to understand that, for \nus, th\ne 'increased trust' refers broadly to dispute resolution in rented housing that \nmay be taking place locally between landlords and tenants or by designated persons as well as when it is escalated to me.\nAchievem\nent of our strategic intent will deliver better access to dispute resolution for \nresidents.\nMany providers, especially since the coming into force of the Localism Act, have \nreduced \ntheir ICPs to two stages and many do not explicitly refer to 'stages' in an\n attempt to resolve complaints and disputes without raising an expectation that all \n`stages' must be completed before resolution may be had. Such providers share with \nus the importance of early, local, appropriate, and proportionate dispute resolution.\nConfusion:My recent experience is that confusion about the ways in which people in my \njurisdiction can complain has been caused by two principal factors. The first is the \nclumsy, complex, and clunky drafting of section 180 of the Localism Act. When I \nasked a\n leading Housing Law QC for advice on certain aspects of this section one of \nhis observations was that \"it is clear that it is unclear\". If this is the opinion of a QC \nlandlords and tenants can be forgiven if they too are confused and probably explains why\n myths such as that of the \"8-week rule\" occur.\nLinked to this is the complete lack of communication by government of the \nconsequences of legislation such as section 180 to people who will be affected by it.\n&#xa0;\nWe are all committed to achieving cost effectiveness and good value for money in \nthese times of economic challenge and austerity but there is a strong case for \ncertain, especially low-cost, exceptions. My Service does not have the resources to \nmount far-reaching communication exercises. Even if we did, we must seek an \nexemption from DCLG to spend money from our budget on, for instance, leaflets for \ntenants. Recently, for example, I put up a business case to spend £6,000 on such \nleaflets but, in \nline with Francis Maude's decrees concerning spending on marketing, \npromotion, and communication, was eventually granted an exemption to spend £4,000.\nGiven these systemic limitations on our ability to inform, our strategic approach is to \nwork with others \n(e.g. \nlandlords, trade bodies, and others) to use their networks and \nresources to reach our customers.\nFitting alongside others:In terms of consultation and collaborative working the Localism Act adds the Housing \nOmbudsman to the list of bodies with whom \nthe Local Government Ombudsmen (LGO) may consult during the course of their investigations. It also provides that if, \nat any stage in the course of conducting an investigation, I form the opinion that the \ncomplaint relates partly to a matter which could be\n the subject of an investigation by \nthe LGO, I must consult with the appropriate 'Commissioner' about the complaint \nand, if I consider it necessary, inform the complainant of the steps necessary to \ninitiate a complaint with the LGO.\nProvision is also made \nto enable me and the LGO to carry out joint investigations. In \nparticular, if at any stage in the course of conducting an investigation I form the \nopinion that the complaint relates partly to a matter within the jurisdiction of the LGO, \nI may conduct an investigation jointly with the LGO provided I have first obtained the \nconsent of the complainant or the complainant's representative. Moreover, if I form the opinion that a complaint which is being investigated by the LGO relates partly to \na\n matter within my jurisdiction, I may conduct an investigation jointly with the LGO \nand we may make joint reports so long as we distinguish my determinations from \nother findings or \nrecommendations.\nI am currently talking to the LGO about a memorandum of un\nderstanding (MOU) that \nwill help us provide a seamless, high quality service to our respective customers for \nthose occasions, should they ever occur, when we might conduct joint investigations. \nThere have not been any since 1 April 2013.\nWe do not have an \nMOU with the PHSO. To my knowledge we have not had a \nsingle case in which our jurisdictions have ever overlapped although sometimes \npeople have contacted the PHSO about a matter within my jurisdiction and have \nbeen referred by them to me.\nSharing good practice with other Ombudsmen:My colleagues and I attend conferences and special interest groups arranged and \nsupported by the Ombudsman Association. Although my predecessor decided to \nstop attending meetings of the Public Sector Ombudsmen Group because he, l\nike\n \nme, considered the Housing Ombudsman to be, predominantly, a private sector ombudsman, I decided to accept Sir Tony Redmond's invitation to attend meetings of the group because I took the view that any opportunity to mix with other \nombudsmen to share good \npractice, challenges, mutual concerns and interests, new \ndevelopments, and emerging trends was of benefit to my Service.\nMy colleagues and I also meet other ombudsman and their colleagues at different \nlevels for different purposes. In recent months, for ex\nample, I have had meetings with The Property Ombudsman, the Ombudsman (Property), the Pensions Ombudsman and the CEO of The Dispute Service. Colleagues have visited, for \nexample, the Legal Ombudsman to share concerns and ambitions concerning data \ncollectio\nn and processing for accountability, improved organisational performance, \nand better customer service.\nSingle access point:I am instinctively but cautiously drawn to this concept by the obvious benefits \nespecially to customers if it could be organised eff\nectively and efficiently. During the course of my nearly 13 years as an ombudsman I have been to many meetings in \ndifferent \nfora \nto discuss the implementation of a 'single portal'. It remains, however, \nsomething of the 'holy grail' of ombudsmanry.\nMy conce\nrns are:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWill it deliver my strategic aims and their primary outcomes?\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow is it going to be paid for?\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWill that be more expensive than my present arrangements that have been \nput in place following the fundamental review of our core process and role?\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat \ncontrol will \nI have over the quality of service provision?\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat would be my rights to withdraw from such a service if it wasn't working \nto my satisfaction and to deliver my strategic aims?\nSingle PSOE:A single PSOE appears, superficially, to be a good thing but, from my point of view, it \nis another myth that has emerged from the mists of prejudice and assumption. To my knowledge it has never be subjected to what the judges call \"nice chemical \nanalysis\".\nBefore I could support this idea I should need to be convinced by:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClearly set out aims, objectives, and outcomes;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA clearly set out, argued rationale as to why it would be an improvement on \nwhere we are now;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA cost-benefit analysis;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn options appraisal;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn audit of necessary changes to primary legislation;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn informed and authoritative assessment of the likelihood of legislative \nchanges and a clear indication of timescales;\n• A comprehensive risk assessment.\nI have had brief conversations with Julie Mellor and Jane Martin about this issue. I have made it clear to both that compelling evidence from the combination of the \nabove list would be a \nsine qua non \nof my decision to support or not support the idea \nof a P\nSOE. At my last meeting with Julie I made it clear that in the absence of such \nevidence I would not be able to form a considered view of the concept.\nEuropean Directive in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)What consideration have you given to the introduction of the Directive and are you taking any action in response?\"Appropriate/alternative\"Although I get the point that the proposal applies to ADR that seeks to resolve \ndisputes between consumers and trade\nrs \"out-of-court\" it is a pity that the Directive \ndefines ADR as \nAlternative \nDispute Resolution rather than \nAppropriate \nbecause \ncourts are sometimes the only 'appropriate' forum for the resolution of a dispute \n(e.g. \nnovel points of law, interpretation of t\nhe law, where remedies such as damages, \ninjunction and specific performance are sought).\nCommon principlesThe Directive states that effective ADR procedures should be guided by a number of \ncommon principles, such as impartiality, transparency, effectivene\nss, and fairness. \nNo ombudsman in the UK or Ireland will disagree with this statement except to say \nthat the criteria set out by the Ombudsman Association (OA) for membership in the \n`ombudsman' category might go further than these criteria. The Cabinet off\nice and the Ministry of Justice have formally accepted and endorsed OA's extended criteria \nwhich are included in their joint guidance to government departments which are \nthinking of reviewing or setting up ombudsman schemes.\nCross-border complaintsThe int\nention of the Commission is to propose measures on ADR that ensure that all \nconsumer complaints can be submitted to an ADR entity and that disputes arising from cross-border transactions and the digital environment may be more easily \nresolved. On the basis\n of past experience, I do not expect my Service to be involved \nin any cross-border transaction in the terms of the proposal.\nDigital environmentThe digital environment is of relevance to my Service and we plan further to develop \nour website but also to cr\neate a digital media communication strategy that will help \nus raise awareness of our services and also to enable easier and wider access to them. We acknowledge government's aspiration to achieve 'digital by default' and \nare seeking to work with others to overcome significant challenges facing residents \nin my jurisdiction to achieve it. Many, for instance, cannot afford telephone land lines \nand therefore have no access to broadband and the internet. Many others are\n \ndenied digital facilities by reason of their advanced age, ill-health and other frailty, or \nspecial needs.\nThe Directive will require Member States to ensure that all disputes between a \nconsumer and a trader arising from the sale of \ngoods or the provision of services can \nbe submitted to an ADR entity, including through online means. Subject to the \nchallenges referred to above, our new website is designed to be inter-active and, I \nbelieve, would already meet the Commission's requiremen\nt.\nEnhanced redressThe second objective of the Directive to enhance redress for consumers is directly \nrelevant to one of the aspects of my role but I cannot presently see how the Directive \nwill actually enhance redress for residents, landlords, and managing agents in my \njurisdiction.\nLack of awareness and uneven qualityThe Directive recounts that analysis of the current situation identified certain main \nshortcomings which hinder the effectiveness of ADR such as the lack of consumer \nand business awareness, and the uneven quality of ADR procedures.\nWithin the limits placed on us by government in terms of communicating to our customers, we shall continue to \ndo all we can raise awareness of our Service. In \nparticular we shall use our new website and will continue to work with landlords and \ntheir professional and trade bodies and with tenant organisations to get across \nmessages about who we are, what we do, and\n how we add value.\nI am not in a position to comment on whether there is uneven quality of ADR \nprocedures in the context of rented housing. I can say, however, that the quality of \nmy Service has been consistently recognised and reflected in objective and \nu\nnsolicited evidence.\nResidual cross-sectoral entityApart from my comments about private-for-profit landlords and managing agents being required to join my Scheme, I presently have no views on a residual cross\n&#xad;\nsectoral \nentity.\nComplaints filed by traders against consumersThe Commission's proposal covers disputes between consumers and traders (the \nlatter being defined as \"any natural persons or any legal person, irrespective of \nwhether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person\n \nacting in his name or on his behalf, for purposes relating to his trade, business, craft \nor profession arising from the sale of goods or the provision of services\") and \nincludes complaints filed by consumers against traders as well as complaints filed by \ntraders against consumers. In the context of the Housing Ombudsman and assuming \nthat the definition of \"trader\" includes landlords, there would have to be a change in \nprimary legislation to allow landlords to trigger disputes coming to me.\n&#xa0;Accessible information about ADR providers The proposal states:\n\"When disputes arise, consumers must be able to quickly identify which ADR \nentities are competent to deal with their dispute. To this end, this proposal \nensures that consumers will be able to find information on the competent ADR entity in the main commercial documents provided by the trader and, where a \ntrader has a website, on that website. In addition, traders will have to inform \nconsumers on whether or\n not they commit to use ADR in relation to \ncomplaints lodged against them by a consumer. This obligation will act as an \nincentive for traders to use ADR more frequently.\"\nTo the \nextent that \"traders\" includes landlords in my jurisdiction, these criteria are met. Some landlords even make clear in their tenancy agreements residents' rights \nto escalate disputes. If for-profit private-sector landlords and managing agents were \nrequired\n to join my Scheme as a result of the Directive, I have the power in the \napproved Scheme to require the same criteria of them.\nCosts, length, and complexityI am confident that the fundamental changes we have made recently to our \nprocedures and practices i\nncluding, especially, our re-engineered core dispute \nresolution process and strategic re-alignment of resources linked to an activity-based \ncosting model will meet the following requirement of the Commission's proposal:\n`ADR procedures should be effective \nand address certain shortcomings \nassociated with court procedures, such as costs, length and complexity.\"\nResolution within 90 daysSince we have re-aligned our resources to deliver early local dispute resolution we \nare completing cases in minutes, days, o\nr weeks and would expect in the majority of \ncases to satisfy the Commission's requirement that:\n\" Based on the results of existing studies, the present proposal requires that \ndisputes should be resolved within 90 days.\"\nThe addition of the word \"generally\" later in the text satisfies me that 90 days is a \ndesirable rather than an absolute and permits flexibility and discretion to produce a \njust outcome in appropriate cases such as, for instance, novel or complex cases, \nins\ntances involving systemic issues, or matters containing important learning \noutcomes for the sector or in the public interest.\n&#xa0;Free of chargeThe proposal states that:\n\"In order to ensure that ADR procedures remain accessible to all \nconsumers,\nthe present proposal provides that they should be free of charge or of \nmoderate cost for consumers.\"\nThe services of my organisation are free to residents at the point of complaint. \nCompetent authoritiesIt is proposed that, in each Member State\n, a competent authority will be in charge of monitoring the functioning of ADR entities established on its territory. The competent authorities will, \ninter alia, \nassess, on the basis of information notified to them by ADR \nentities, whether a given ADR enti\nty respects the quality requirements laid down by the present proposal.\nIt is not clear to me how such an arrangement would align with my existing duty \nunder statute to report annually to the Secretary of State who lays the report before \nParliament. If it \nmeans double reporting there will be an unnecessarily bureaucratic \nprocess and a risk that resources that would be better directed to providing an improved service to consumers will be needlessly spent on duplication.\nIt seems to me that where reports are \nlaid before Parliament they are documents of \npublic record and this requirement should be enough to meet the requirements of the \nDirective. Equally, the public availability of such reports should be enough to enable:\n\" the competent authorities to publish regular reports on the development and \nfunctioning of ADR entities. Every three years, the Commission will report to \nthe European Parliament and the Council on the application of the Directive\".\nTo what extent do you believe the Directive will allow better and meaningful comparisons in performance and sharing of practice across providers or agencies?I do not believe that the Directive will allow better comparisons in performance. Ombudsmen in the UK, for instance, hav\ne tried in a variety of networking \nfora \nto \nmake \nsuch comparisons but their constitutional arrangements, core processes, and \nrelated performance measures, or KPIs, or targets are so disparate that comparison \ninevitably fails to get apples and pears to coinc\nide.\nSubject to my fears of duplication and unnecessary costs referred to above, I do \nbelieve, however, that \"competent authorities\" and the collation of reporting \nmechanisms by the Commission to the European Parliament will provide the \npotential for a fra\nmework to facilitate sharing of good practice.\n&#xa0;To what extent do you think the Directive presents an opportunity to remodel the existing system of ADR to resolve possible existing overlaps, shortfalls, and conflicts?The Directive states that another of the main shortcomings which hinders the \neffectiveness of ADR is \"gaps in the coverage\". The most obvious gap in terms of \nmy jurisdiction is the fact that the vast majority of consumers of services provided by \nprivate, f\nor-profit landlords and managing agents are excluded from access to my \nService, and, therefore, justice, in respect of unsatisfactory provision of those \nservices for which they pay market rents. These consumers have for too long been \nthe Cinderellas at the\n ADR ball. Government strongly supports the role of the private \nsector in the provision of rented housing. Giving tenants in this sector the right to \nescalate their disputes to the Housing Ombudsman would not only give them the \nrights of access to ADR requ\nired by the Directive and thereby access to out-of-court \njustice but would also test standards in that sector and drive up the quality of \ncustomer service by reference to an ever-increasing body of learning arising out of a \nrich bank of ombudsman decision-\noutcomes.\nHow can those involved in dispute resolution, but who aren't covered by the Directive, ensure that they are meeting the same expected standards of quality as those who are covered by it?As stated above, Ombudsman members of OA will not have diff\niculty meeting the \nstandards. Indeed, many of us, no doubt, will be able to argue that we exceed them.\nI suspect that the simple answer to this question is that those who are not covered \nby the Directive should ensure, by amendment and revision if necessar\ny, that their \nconstitutional arrangements meet the standards. This will be a matter, as may be \nappropriate, for their Boards, councils, regulators, departmental sponsors, industry \nstakeholders, and, ultimately, government.\nHow can the government ensure against the proliferation of excessive numbers of different dispute resolution bodies and mechanisms (and should it be doing so)?This is definitely something in respect of which the government should be taking a \nlead. The proliferation of different ombudsmen and other dispute resolution bodies \nin the same or similar industries, sectors, or businesses is very confusing to consumers and does not \nserve them well in terms of straightforward access to \njustice.\nGovernme\nnt should ensure that the OA guidance endorsed by the Cabinet Office \nand the Ministry of Justice is followed by its departments. One valuable contribution \nto this outcome would be that all legislation setting up or reviewing ombudsmen or \nother ADR schemes \nshould be subject to a pre-condition of approval by Cabinet \nOffice advised by Treasury Solicitors.\n&#xa0;Specific actionI have decided not to take any immediate action in response to the Directive \nprincipally because I cannot see any obvious impact on my Service particularly in the \ncontext of efforts to \"improve the functioning of the retail internal market\".\nFor the moment, I have decided to keep in close contact with fellow ombudsmen, especially t\nhose in the private sector, and monitor how the introduction of the \nDirective develops and take any action as may be necessary.\nGiven that my Service's mission is \"impartial dispute resolution for the whole rented sector\", I shall be alert to any opportuni\nty afforded by the Directive to argue that the \nwhole of the rented housing sector (including the private, for-profit sector) should be included in my jurisdiction.\nI hope that this contribution is helpful to you and your Committee. Please contact my office\n if you need any additional information. I should be very happy to meet you at \nthe House of Commons or at my office if you would like to discuss these matters \nfurther.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
