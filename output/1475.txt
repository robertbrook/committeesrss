[[[Submission by Quaker Crime Community and Justice Sub-Committee VEP 0041]]]&#xa0;Quakers in Britain support the right of prisoners to vote and have endorsed public statements by the Prison Reform Trust, the Howard League for Penal Reform and others, urging the UK Parliament to amend the law.&#xa0;People sent to prison remain members of society and should be encouraged to exercise their civic responsibilities despite the denial of their liberty. As part of their rehabilitation we should encourage responsibility as far as possible and exercising one’s right to vote is part of that responsibility.  &#xa0;We regard it as more appropriate to maintain enfranchisement as a right of citizenship and a symbol of the principle that while prisoners are being punished for relatively serious breaches of the law, they are not outcasts but citizens with whom society endeavours to remain in constructive engagement. &#xa0;To preserve the right to vote would form part of society’s effort to encourage responsible and empathetic behaviour on the part of offenders and to prepare those who are to be released for active citizenship.  It might also have the practical advantage of making Members of Parliament more responsive to the concerns of their constituents in prison.&#xa0;We believe that rather than seeing the issues as giving prisoners the right to vote, we should see it as not removing the franchise from them.   We are all unique, precious children of God, even those who have transgressed.&#xa0;Paula Harvey, Programme Manager on behalf ofCrime, Community and Justice Sub-CommitteeQuaker Peace &amp; Social Witness &#xa0;Quaker Peace &amp; Social Witness is part of the central organisation of Quakers in Britain, and its Crime, Community and Justice Sub-Committee supports and represents Quaker concerns in the area of criminal justice.&#xa0;August 2013
