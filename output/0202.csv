Written evidence submitted by  J W F Harriman (FSS011)IntroductionI have been an independent firearms forensic examiner since about 1985. I am a sole trader with my own practice. During an average year I will give expert advice in some 30 – 40 cases, mainly for the Defence.
Experience and qualificationsAnswers to the Committee’s questionsAs a firearms forensic examiner I have confined my answers to that particular specialist field.
1. Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?In my opinion, there is no integrated government strategy for forensic science in the UK. Certainly, there has been no government involvement of which I am aware in the field of firearms examination. Accordingly, there is no R&amp;D programme and no real support for the criminal justice system.
2. Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?I am unable to comment on this.
3. What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)In my experi
e
nce the closure of the FSS has caused a dramatic increase in the use of police support staff as expert witnesses
 in firearms cases
. The
y
 tend to be force armourers or firearms licensing enquiry officers. They are used because of the cost implications associated with instructing a commercial 
forensic 
provider
 coupled with lead times for submission of reports
.
Their training is minimal and most are required to prepare evidence-ready reports after attending a 2 day basic course from a commercial 
training 
provider. 
In my experi
e
nce their ability varies considerably from those who are not competent to undertake firearms 
examinations
 to those who can 
be relied upon to deal with basic classification issues.
 I am aware of several cases where police support personnel have been allowed to give evidence when they were clearly 
non 
peritus
. 
This is especially the case when the issue before the court is whether a firearm is an antique for the purposes of the exemption at Section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968.
The courts appear to be uncritical of 
non-
peritus
 police support staff who appear as experts. If any doubt as to any expert’s credibility exists, then the judge should direct that a 
voir
 dire
 hearing is held to test that expert’s credibility.
The use of police personnel invariably raises questions of their impartiality. In my 
experience
, most 
police employees feel that they need to sustain their employers’ objectives. Equally most are unlikely to be robust if subjected to 
pressure
 by senior officers. The virtue of the FSS was its separation from the police service.
As a general principle, I suggest that it is not in the interests of justice for the police service to have its own forensic arm. 
There should always be clear blue water between forensic scientists and law enforcement officers.
Since the closure of the Council for the 
Registration
 of Forensic 
Practitioners
 
(March 2009) 
there has been no accreditation for forensic firearms examiners. This is a disturbing 
situation as several offences within the Firearms Acts carry mandatory custodial sentences on conviction, unless the judge find
s
 there are exceptional circumstances. When a Defendant’s liberty is a stake 
and 
then 
subject to
 a mandatory 
gaol 
sentence, it follows that the Crown’s expert adviser must be a properly accredited person
