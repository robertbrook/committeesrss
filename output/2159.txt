[[[John E. Warren – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]First let me say I agree with a large amount of the proposed changes. I do however have concerns with some parts which I explain below&#xa0;Clause 27 (1) (F)&#xa0;Targets, reports ect. Are important for judging progress so I think reports should still be issued. Informal objectives are often not open to scrutiny by 3rd parties which is wrong in my view.&#xa0;Clause 29&#xa0;Each step in process to giving fine increases the cost of the process. I think issuing a warning is enough.&#xa0;Clause 47 (I)&#xa0;From personal experience I know councils need to required to use local people in decision making.&#xa0;I was a tenant representative for 5 ½ years and struggled to get copies of policies before they were implementation for review. My council was using me to rubber stamp decisions.&#xa0;I was also a trustee of a self advocacy group for people with learning difficulties. Trying to get easy to read version of proposed policies was difficult and at least 2 times we had to force an extension to consultation period as easy read not available&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
