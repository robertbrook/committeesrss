default&#xa0; 
defaultHealth and social care are interdependent and must be considered as a whole system. Local government is therefore concerned with any loss of resources to the whole health and social care system and supports the need to use precious resources to unlock efficiency and effectiveness as opposed to simply cutting services.  
default&#xa0;default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal government welcomes a more integrated approach to dealing with financial pressures with a strong focus upon investing in early intervention and preventative approaches to reduce more expensive intensive interventions, especially within the NHS acute sector. Bearing this in mind, local government supports the transfer of NHS Funding towards community based early intervention and prevention which is clearly signaled in the ITF and it is important that the NHS is politically supported to reconfigure Acute Services to unlock this investment.
default&#xa0;default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is noted that the Nicholson Challenge is treated differently to the budget reductions being applied to councils via a reduced Rate Support Grant. The Nicholson Challenge is geared around efficiencies being re-invested back into the NHS whereas adult social care efficiencies contribute to councils savings targets.

default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe alignment between NHS and local government funding is critical in achieving a whole system approach. Funding must be increasingly seen as a 
defaultjoint resource and as such the mechanism for allocating funding must equally be aligned to ensure consistency and transparency. 
default&#xa0;default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal government supports an allocation formula based upon a credible evaluation and analysis of population and levels of socio-economic deprivation. However,
default defaultthe current proposals to allocate NHS funding based upon population numbers only will significantly impact upon the joint approaches to respond to need across health and social care and will create inconsistencies in how localities are resourced to deal with the severity of health and wellbeing inequalities.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal government is seriously concerned with the poor financial position of a number of NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts as recently reported by Monitor. These challenges are further compounded with councils also reporting significant financial pressures and the prospect of public services facing financial meltdown is a very real risk. Whilst the push for integration will provide some financial rewards, the scale of financial pressures must be addressed centrally through a fully funded and sustainable health and social care system fit for the 21
defaultst
default century.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal government is seriously concerned with the level of financial pressures across the whole health and social care system. Further, the recent announcement of Winter Pressures Funding for 2013 and 2014 although welcomed, is considered inappropriately distributed to meet pressures across the whole system. It is only targeted at failing A&amp;E units, rather than within community settings (across all localities) which can mitigate against increase admissions and delayed transfers.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultAdditional funding for social care was allocated in the 2010 Spending Review but its impact would only be felt if we were in a settled state. Significant cuts to council funding has inevitably meant that adult social care has had to contribute to savings; particularly as the service represents more than one third of councils’ budgets, which is the biggest area of discretionary spend for councils. 
default&#xa0;default5.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultDespite having attempted to protect adult social care services as much as possible, councils have had to reduce their adult social care budgets by £2.68 billion, 20 per cent of the budget, over the last three years in response to reduction of overall council funding. Although there is no exact science to capturing what is genuine efficiency and what is not, evidence from the ADASS Budget Survey indicates that this figure is made up of efficiency (75 
defaultper cent); service reductions (18 per cent); and income and charges (7 per cent). 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultAt the same time of reducing council funding, 
defaultcouncils are facing a demographic pressure of three per cent of adult social care budgets. It costs over £400 million a year to continue to provide the same level of service, which excludes the impact of inflation. The greatest demographic pressure comes from adults with a learning disability (44 per cent of total demography pressure), followed by older people (40 per cent).
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultContinuing to make this level of saving annually is simply not sustainable.  The recent ADASS Budget Survey noted that, for 2013/14, adult services directors are looking at a number of medium to high priority areas for making savings, namely:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe increasingly limiting options for councils to manage funding reductions (as detailed above) expose a number of significant risks, namely: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s far-reaching welfare reforms are likely to increase demand for care and support services and impact further on the ability to raise income. Moreover, the care and support reforms, including the capped-cost model of funding reform and Care Bill, will entail substantial 
defaultadditional 
defaultcosts for the sector.  
default&#xa0;default5.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe additional costs for the funding reforms and Care Bill are yet to be fully understood and agreed. The Government has allocated £335 million for implementation costs in 2015/16 and must also meet any additional costs with new money. ADASS is currently modelling the running costs of the reformed system and the Department of Health is working closely with ADASS and LGA (through a Joint Programme Management Office) to understand and agree any additional burdens upon councils. This work is currently on-going.
default&#xa0;default5.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government must exercise caution when assessing the scope for further immediate efficiencies, particularly where this focus then jeopardises longer-term efficiency programmes. Any government assumptions of further efficiencies will therefore leave a bigger gap that will have to be fixed by cuts. Adult social care would not be immune to this, exacerbating the pressures being faced. Reducing spending on prevention and early intervention is one of the only places left to look for further savings; but doing so runs counter to the policy direction set out in the care and support White Paper.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe NHS Transfer announced in 2010 has made a difference to councils. Nevertheless, the amount transferred does not compensate for the overall reductions in council funding over the same term (and the extent of cuts to adult social care budgets over the last three years).  The ADASS Budget Survey noted that for 2012/13, 32 per cent of the NHS Transfer received was allocated to avoid  cuts to front line services, 14 per cent to cover demographic pressures, 18 per cent for investment into new services (that benefit both health 
defaultand social care) and 36 per cent is  yet be allocated.
default 
defaultOf particular note is the extent to which social care has tackled delayed transfers of care, with the proportion of delays solely attributable to social care being reduced from
default 
default33 per cent to 27 per cent over the last four years. 
default&#xa0;default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocal government (through the LGA and ADASS) has been central in the construct and development of the ITF from its very inception. We welcome the underlying principles and policy implications of the ITF in driving a more integrated approach that recognizes the value and contribution that adult social care makes towards the NHS.  Whilst welcoming the ITF, we are advocating that the approach needs to widen to consider whole resources within a locality and over a longer planning horizon.  The wider the ITF extends, the greater the potential to 
defaultrealise
default efficiency and whole system approaches to meeting individual improved outcomes
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is already significant momentum behind localities integrating health and social care and with the continuing pressures on budgets and demand, this momentum is likely to increase.  Whilst there is wide acceptance of the financial (and service delivery) benefits of integration, there is no one solution or one business case, but rather a rich myriad of differing approaches reflecting local relationships and conditions. The one consistently important element however is the growing significance of the local Health and Wellbeing Board to oversee and coordinate integrated local services.  
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important that local Health and Wellbeing Boards lead the work across the whole system locally to unlock resources.  This needs to happen across health and social care with a focus on greater investment into preventative and early intervention solutions, combined with an increasing emphasis upon an asset based approach and individual responsibility. The experience from the Community Budget pilots will provide a rich source of evidence to help shape this work.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe shift of resources from 
defaultacute hospital and institutional care into community based services requires change to NHS and council activity and expenditure, combined with changes over several years in hospital configuration, GP services, community health and social care. This long term planning is critical and local Health and Wellbeing Boards must not be distracted by short term gains.
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the biggest potential areas for savings is through more effective care for individuals with long term conditions, most of whom are older people with a variety of needs that require an integrated response. Getting this right will avoid inappropriate hospital admissions and improve hospital transfers. Improving standards of health care could have a positive impact on the need for social care, for instance in the treatment of people with strokes, continence problems or dementia. Intermediate care could also be used more effectively, 
defaultfor instance to treat continence problems in older people who leave hospital so that they do not need to go into residential care.
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst the integration approach mainly tackles the interface between NHS and social care in terms of older people, 
defaulta large increase in costs for local government is from younger adults, particularly those with learning disabilities. The increase in the proportion of adult social care spend on younger adults, in three years from 2007/2008 has risen from 23 to 30 per cent
default.
default&#xa0;
default7.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe evidence to-date – for example analysis of the Partnerships for Older People Projects (POPP) pilots – shows the vast majority of integration efficiencies goes to the NHS rather than social care. A strengthened whole system approach as characterised by the ITF will allow for a more transparent approach to recycling efficiencies across the whole system to then generate further efficiencies in reduced complex and expensive crisis interventions.
default&#xa0;
default7.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, we support the transfer of public health to local government as means to improve integration of health and social care. However, we suggest that the Government ends the Public Health ring-fence to extend flexibility for whole system approaches that respond to local conditions and needs and is inclusive of Publ
defaultic Health preventative influence and contribution.
