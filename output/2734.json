"&#xa0;&#xa0;House of LordsSub Committee B (Internal Market, Infrastructure and Employment)EU action to tackle youth unemployment&#xa0;&#xa0;1. Do you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States' power in the area of social and employment affairs?&#xa0;With high levels of youth unemployment across the EU and cuts to welfare in many countries, providing EU funding to help tackle youth unemployment\n is a\nn important part of the EU'\ns \"Youth unemployment package\". Funding\n of around \n€\n8bn\n for the \"Youth Employment Initiative\" is a key part of EU policy to tackle youth unemployment and making\n most of this\n money available in the first two years of the next multi\nannual financial framework, by frontloading the funds\n,\n is a welcome move by the European Council and European Parliament. \n&#xa0;\nWe can already see the positive impact that EU funding, specifically from the European So\ncial Fund, has had regarding support for \nyoung people\n in the current MFF. \nFor example, in \nWales\n, \n£\n62\n \nmillion (of which \n£\n33 million comes from the ESF) has helped \"Jobs Growth Wales\" to support young people aged 16-24 to secure a job\n. The ESF currently supports a number of \"youth\" projects, to hel\np get young people into work, education and training and the YEI will build on this. \n&#xa0;\nWhat is important to realise is that a total of \n€\n8bn will not be enough to combat youth unemployment alone, and that action and additional financing at\n \nMember\n \nState\n leve\nl is crucial in order to make a real impact on this growing problem.  Furthermore, it is not only EU funding that can help remedy these problems, but exchanges of best pr\nactice with other Member States.   \n&#xa0;\nMember States' policies in the area of social and\n employment affairs can be complemented by action at EU level. When we look at the Youth Guarantee Scheme, we see that the EU is setting out broad guidelines, as a result of political \ncommitment\n by EU leaders. These guidelines should be flexible, \nallow the\n possibility for gradual implementation and should be compatible with Member States' policies in this area.\n&#xa0;\n2. How do you think the funds allocated through the Youth Unemployment Initiative and the European Social fund could best be spent? &#xa0;Firstly, it's\n vital that the funds allocated to Youth Unemployment Initiative and the ESF complement one another and are used to their full potential. With reference specifically to the YEI, which will be used to support young people not in education, employment or tra\nining, there needs to be a certain degree \nof flexibility. \nAccording to the European Commission, t\nhe \npriority of the YEI is to support those regions with a youth unemployment rate\n above 25%. The European Parliament has been pushing to lower this threshold i\nn order to benefit more EU regions, particularly those who fall just short of the 25%, which appears to be the case for several \nUK\n regions. Having some kind of flexibility on this specific issue could potentially help a greater number of \nUK\n regions and cou\nld have a greater impact on reducing youth unemployment rates. \n&#xa0;\nFunds allocated through the YEI and ESF could be best spent by promoting apprenticeships and traineeships, increasing youth mobility and more generally, improving the transition between \neducation and work.\n Making sure ESF funds are \"match funded\"\n by Governments\n is also key to \nensuring the\n success of EU funding for youth\n employment.\n&#xa0;\nLooking at some of the projects currently being carried out in \nWales\n, we can see some clear examples of how\n best to spend ESF funds. ESF funds are being invested in apprenticeship schemes for 15-24 year olds; the Young\n Recruits Programme and \nthe Pathways to Apprenticeship\n Programme are two examples that show how ESF funding can have a positive impact on young p\neople\n'\ns future employment prospects. Programmes such as these not only have an impact on young people trying to improve their future employment chances, but they\n also\n help businesses\n to increase their productivity\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7 October 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"
