[[[Professor Robin Simmons]]], University of Huddersfield&#xa0;

[[[Q109 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Good afternoon, and thank you all for giving up this time. As you know, we have been doing this inquiry for some time and we hope to finish up in April with a report, which at the moment is looking very interesting because we have had some terrific witnesses and we are looking forward to what you have to say today. The session will last for approximately 50 to 60 minutes, and Members of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. Any interests? No.The session is on the record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible via the parliamentary website. Witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct, and this will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. Could you begin by stating, for the record, your names and official title? After that I will ask you to make an opening statement, if that is agreeable to you.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to be here. My name is Kari Hadjivassiliou and I am a Principal Research Fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies. I have been working on issues around European employment and education training policies for about 15 to 20 years, and youth unemployment for the last four to five years. My particular interest is school-to-work transitions and the effectiveness of the existing policies around Europe, in particular apprenticeships, traineeships, internships and the like.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you, we look forward to your evidence.

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: Good afternoon. My name is Massimiliano Mascherini. I am a Research Manager at Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. We are an independent European agency, established in 1975, and our mandate is to produce knowledge in the field of employment and social matters.

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Good afternoon. I am Robin Simmons and I am Professor of Education at the University of Huddersfield. For the last five years or so I have been involved in various research projects looking at the lives of young people who are classified as NEET or at risk of becoming NEET; the research is funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. Starting again, Ms Hadjivassiliou, would you like to make an opening statement before we question you or are you prepared to go straight in? 

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: No, I think I will go to the questions. The opening statement is that the levels of youth unemployment at the moment across Europe, in my opinion, are unacceptably high. I am encouraged to see that policymakers, at both EU and national level, have realised that they have to act as a matter of urgency. Personally, I am not sure that some of the measures proposed are sufficient to address the magnitude of the problem but at least a start has been made. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] An opening statement from you, Mr Mascherini?

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: No. I would like to thank the Committee for the invitation and I look forward to the questions.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you for coming. Professor Simmons? 

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Likewise, thank you for the invitation but I would like to proceed to the questions.

[[[Q110 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. I have to advise the witnesses that some questions will be more relevant to them than others. Each witness is not expected to provide an answer for every question. I think you will probably be relieved to hear that.A central element of the EU’s approach to tackling youth unemployment is the Youth Guarantee. Could you summarise for us your understanding of the extent to which this has been taken up across the EU and whether there are signs that it is achieving any results yet? If there are statistics available, perhaps you could identify the fact that they are and then it would be very useful if you could send them to us as a backup. Who wants to answer that question? 

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: I can start. The concept of the Youth Guarantee was born in Scandinavian countries in the 1980s and is based on the concept that young people are guaranteed an opportunity a certain amount of time after becoming unemployed or finishing their education. At the European level the discussion about the Youth Guarantee started in 2005 when the European Council encouraged member states to guarantee an opportunity for young people four months after becoming unemployed.The discussion has gone on for years and the European Parliament realised the need to guarantee an opportunity for young people. In December 2012 the European Commission made a proposal for a youth guarantee to the European Council. That has been endorsed and published by the European Council on 22 April. On the basis of the European Council recommendation, the guarantee is that every young person has to receive an opportunity four months after becoming unemployed or finishing education. That can be an educational position, a study place, an apprenticeship, an internship, training or an offer of a job within four months. This happened last April. Now member states are required to submit an implementation plan for the Youth Guarantee. The deadline is December 2013 for those member states that have an unemployment rate higher than 25%; otherwise it is spring 2014 for the other member states. The level of unemployment below or above 25% is the condition for accessing funding. In this regard, €6 billion has been made available for those regions whose unemployment rates are above 25%. This is linked to the submission of the implementation plan to the European Commission. This is the status, I would say. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you think that it is going to improve? Has it been instrumental in getting a move on in terms of the opportunities for these people who have been unemployed for four months? 

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: Yes. Data is available from the evaluation of the Finnish Youth Guarantee, which is the model that is taken as an example. From that we see that the first development plan was carried out for 93% of young people within two weeks of their registration with the Public Employment Services. After three months, 72% of young people who participated in this programme were no longer unemployed. Half of them were in the labour market, 20% were in education or training, but there is no data for the remaining 30% who have disappeared from the statistics. This is an official evaluation by the Finnish Government, and I would be happy to share the source of that with you.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That would be very kind and very helpful. You feel slightly optimistic but you are still worrying about those who do not have anything. Did you say 30% or 13%?

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: Slightly above 30% disappear. Further research on those for whom there is no information is crucial in order to fully understand the effectiveness of these guarantees, even though the numbers are positive in comparison to other programmes.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: Similarly to the Finnish results, an evaluation of the Youth Guarantee scheme in Sweden has shown that participants find a job faster than a control group which does not have the support of the Youth Guarantee. We have some data from Austria and, although there is a high dropout rate from their participants, of those who participated in the Youth Guarantee in 2010, about 58% found a job after three months and 63% found a job after 12 months.That said, my concern—and not only my concern, commentators have mentioned this—is the amount available, the €6 billion. It is welcome but, given the magnitude of the problem, it is considered in some quarters to be insufficient. For example, the ILO have estimated that for a proper implementation of the Youth Guarantee one would need €21 billion, so you can see the difference. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Goodness gracious, the difference between €6 billion and €21 billion. 

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: Yes, but that is an ILO estimate. I am just saying that those are the arguments that are out there at the moment.

[[[The Chairman:]]] There is just one point I want to clarify before I forget it. What is the dropout rate? You said the dropout rate. 

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: I do not have it here but I can send it to the Committee. That was for Austria.The other thing is that the Eurofound study on the Youth Guarantee shows that there are some critical factors for the success of the Youth Guarantee, one of which is capacity, Public Employment Services capacity, quality of advice and number of advisers. There is a big discrepancy in the capacity of Public Employment Services across the EU, as you can imagine. The Youth Employment Initiative is frontloaded for 2014 and 2015. I do not know whether there is enough space to develop the capacity in member states if it is not adequate.Also, in a number of member states the Youth Guarantee is delivered through the Public Employment Services. The coverage of young people who are supported by the Public Employment Services also varies across the EU. In Lithuania it is 25% of young people. What will happen to the other 75% of young people? There are these issues. I am sure they are going to be ironed out but those are the issues at the moment.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you have anything to add to that, Professor Simmons? 

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Yes. The ILO have done quite a good report on this, called Studies on Growth with Equity. They look at the Finnish and Swedish Youth Guarantee and provide some case studies of how that operates. I can forward that to you.The main thing it is useful to think through is what that guarantee consists of. Evidence shows that if the guarantee consists of labour market reintegration it is likely to be more successful than concentration on education and training. For example, the Swedish and Finnish model concentrates on reintegrating back into the workplace. Further afield there are similar schemes in Australia and New Zealand that concentrate mainly on reintegration into education, and success rates are significantly worse, below 50%.The other thing that is quite interesting is the delivery models. In Australia and New Zealand that is a highly marketised system, in many ways similar to many of the support services in England, with quite a lot of competition and duplication. That appears to be less successful than the Nordic model with the Public Employment Service.

[[[Q111 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] In Finland and Sweden how are the jobs created in order to give them to the people who are being looked after? I can see that in education government can do that and in public services government can do that to a certain extent, but how are the jobs created for people to occupy? 

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: In the Finnish Youth Guarantee the jobs basically are not created but employers are helped in hiring young people through incentives. Each young person who participates in the programme and is thought to be ready for the labour market is provided with a voucher. It is called a Sanssi card and it removes part of the salary from the employer for a certain amount of time. The part that is removed is different for an apprenticeship or a real job. There is data showing that after the voucher expires, most of those who have started a work relationship keep the work relationship alive, so they remain in the labour market after the conclusion of the voucher.

[[[Q112 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] After the change of Government in Australia, do you anticipate any changes so far as this policy is concerned? 

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: It is difficult to say. I do not think there will be radical changes because I think broadly the new Government has a quite similar outlook generally to the old one, so I would not see them shifting towards a more Finnish or Swedish model. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is an interesting point. Do you think that in even in countries where the Government and Opposition are quite opposed to one another in a fundamental way they come together with youth unemployment because it is a general worry to everybody? 

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: I suppose if you look at the Anglophone nations in particular, with varying degrees, largely policies within a neo-liberal framework—and there is the emphasis mainly on supply side rather than demand—the Nordic countries have mediated that to some degree and their policies have stimulated demand more than the Anglophone nations. 

[[[Q113 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] I want to come back to the Finnish example that you quoted and the 30% who did not continue in the scheme, who disappeared from the scheme. What is the difference between that and being a dropout?

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: There is one-third for which they have no data, so they do not know if they became self-employed or if they are at work but there is no record. This is the difference between the dropouts, because among them there can be a part that is a dropout and another part that maybe is at work but there is no record because data has been discontinued. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] The black economy, we call it here. 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Are there any other European countries offering subsidies, effectively? The vouchers are subsidies, are they not? 

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: I think there are other countries that offer incentives or subsidies. One is Sweden and then maybe you have other data. Another thing, for example, is negative incentives. This is a measure that I found in France where large companies need to have 4% of their labour force as apprentices. If they do not have this 4%, if they have a lower share, their taxes are raised for that figure. These are negative incentives that are the opposite of the positive in some sense. 

[[[Q114 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Fearn:]]] The European Social Fund and the additional funds from the Youth Employment Initiative are the main financial contributions to tackling youth unemployment at a European level. What in your view are the ways in which member states have used ESF to address the current problems and are proposing to use these instruments in the new programming in the new period? What value do they add, if any? 

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: The ESF has supported policies targeted at unemployed young people in a variety of ways. The main types of policies can be summarised as those that are aimed at preventing early school leaving. There are some successful examples like the second-chance schools across Europe, and in France in particular that has very good reintegration rates. However, there is concern even from the Commission that the availability of data and monitoring needs to be improved for the policies that target early school leaving. Also we need to know more, even after all these years of doing research in this area, about the drivers of early school leaving.The other types of policies are to promote the skills that are relevant to the labour market in a variety of ways, like curricula reforms. At the moment Poland is undergoing a major curricula reform to link learning outcomes to employer requirements. Cyprus is undergoing a major curricula reform as wellThe other area is supporting first work experience and on-the-job training, for the simple reason that employers across Europe repeatedly say that one of the major barriers to them employing a young person is lack of work experience. There is a big push towards traineeships—internships in the UK; traineeship is the commission-speak for internships and work experience placement—and there is a big push for apprenticeships.The third one is improving access to the labour market for the first job, through subsidies and voucher schemes, and promotion of entrepreneurship and self-employment among young people. There are a number of programmes supporting this.You can imagine that the effectiveness is mixed because of this wide range of policies in a wide range of countries. There are some examples where it has been very effective. Apprenticeship schemes, if they are well designed, tend to be very effective in a particular context. We have just finished an EU-wide overview of apprenticeships and traineeships across Europe for the Commission, and we saw that the labour market integration rate ranges between 60% to even 90% in some cases. Traineeships can be effective, but less so unless they are well designed and targeted. Again, the integration rate ranges, but there the lowest is 35% and the highest&#xad;—if it is to do with graduates, not surprisingly—can be 90%. My point is that effectiveness is not black or white, it is mixed, and it depends on the particular context of implementation, co-ordination and also employer buy-in.

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: Member states have used ESF, as Kari said, through three main ways. One is investment in education and training that can be preventing or reintegrating early school leavers or providing training. In this regard, from 2007 to 2012 20 million young people under 25 benefited from the ESF through the participation in one of these programmes. In some countries young people account for almost half of all the participants in ESF activities. A good practice in the UK, for example, is the hothouse project in Cornwall that aims at preventing early school leaving.The other strand of activities is to bridge the gap between education and the labour market through various activities such as individual career guidance, apprenticeship, fostering mobility or through helping young people to set up their own business. These are the sort of ESF activities that have been used by the member states.In recent years there is evidence that approximately €16 billion has been reallocated in the chapter of employment in order to speed up the access of young people into the labour market in training and employment. This is expected to help around 1 million young people in Europe and 55,000 small companies.Giving a chance to all young people is another area where member states have used the ESF, especially for removing practical and logistical barriers for the most vulnerable, for example the Danish Hold on Tight Caravan project. That helps to support the integration of those with an immigration background into society. This has contributed to a decrease in school leaving from 20% to below 14%, more or less.Finally, the future. I think that these instruments, the youth employment initiatives and the ESF, will be potentially used for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee because it guarantees a longer-term programme. It is a national commitment, so member states have to finance the Youth Guarantee and the budget. The European Commission can top up the Youth Guarantee through the Youth Employment Initiatives and the ESF. The youth employment initiatives that are the €6 billion will be used for programmes that are linked to individuals, such as vouchers for training apprenticeships or financial support to help young people to set up their own business. Conversely, the ESF still would be used for the individual but also to promote and support structural reform in the countries, for example education, the Public Employment Services and job search strategies, at least in the member states that need it. 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you think there is a confusion between the two? Is it right to have two or could they not be consolidated? Going back to the question that Lord Fearn asked, what value do they add? 

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: I think the value that they add is that they provide the opportunity to implement the new programmes, for example. 

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: I just have a couple of points to add. In some ways it is a difficult question to answer because it is a highly variable situation between different European nations. Success or otherwise relates very much to individual state-level policy. That is one difficulty in answering the question. The other difficulty is that in many ways it is quite early in the process to evaluate it. Traineeships were mentioned earlier. In the UK context in particular, that is a very recent development, so it is quite hard to say.One general observation is that entrepreneurship and so on has probably been done less well through this initiative than it could be. In particular in the UK context, historically we did this quite well. I am thinking of things like the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, an MSC programme back in the 1980s, that was really quite successful and many businesses that exist today were brought on through that as seed corn. My impression is that that particular element of this initiative is perhaps not as well developed as the education and training initiatives and so on.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is probably too formulaic and does not allow for the inspiration and the pizazz.

[[[Q115 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] Forgive me if you have touched on this already. It is following on in the same vein. All the things you have listed that are being done by member states you would have thought any self-respecting member state would do with or without European involvement. Is there a redistributive point in here? Is one trying to get more cash from the north to the south or the south-west to the east, and/or is there a best-practice transfer? Is it just a money point? Are we trying to add some more money to what the member states would be paying anyway, and is that not just pooling the money and putting it back out again? Where is the slice of added value? 

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: I do not know whether my answer will satisfy you, but it is definitely the case that the user base varies across the EU and for the southern European countries. I am Greek so I should know that. Also for the eastern European countries and some smaller countries like Malta, the European Social Fund in general has been a key driver in developing policies in areas where there was no money or even no policy expertise. So there has been a transfer of learning from countries that are more developed in certain areas to others, especially in the youth employment area and social inclusion. In that sense, there is a transfer of learning. On the other hand, learning is two ways, so I was surprised when I read recently—not for youth unemployment—that the German Labour Inspectorate was totally reorganised after a peer review visit in another country. Learning is two ways. I would not like to think that it is only that the northern European countries teach the other countries how to do things. There are other kinds of learning, for example through the European Mutual Learning Programme and the peer reviews that exist. There was a recent one in the Hague at the end of November where the countries presented their policies and there was a synthesis paper. There is a lot of interaction in learning so I would not like to minimise the importance of the ESF and the structure of funds, but it is not just the money, it is the whole learning and exchange of experience process that goes with it.

[[[Baroness Valentine:]]] Is there a trend to give the money to the newer countries?

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: The allocation of funds depends on the need. Also the ESF is helping the UK. For example, TAPS is an apprentice scheme in the UK that is funded by the ESF, so it is not just that the money goes to the eastern European countries.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You have a huge amount of information available in your head. Do you think that you could share it with us, not now because we obviously have a time limit today?

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: Yes, by all means.

[[[The Chairman:]]] If you could give us another example, like you gave us from the Hague, it would be most helpful.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: Yes, we can definitely do that, and I am very happy to.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you very much. Also let me say to the two other witnesses, if you feel that there is some experience that you suddenly think about that could shed some light on this whole thing it would be very useful to have it.  We never know the nuggets we have not managed to find.

[[[Q116 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] My question is to Professor Simmons. If we could look back now over the last 50 years—you very helpfully have just mentioned one lesson that we could learn—are there other lessons that we can learn from past recessions and past high levels of youth unemployment?

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Yes, I think there are lessons that can be learned. Each recession has a disproportionately large effect upon young people. Although it affects the population in general, the effect upon young people is deeper. The way that successive Governments have tried to address that, particularly since the 1970s, has been largely through focusing on the supply side. Education and training of various sorts is, of course, very important. However, it is only part of the equation and I think largely the demand side has been neglected. Where demand-side initiatives have been tried, I think they have been relatively successful. I look back to some of the MSC programmes, which at the time were highly criticised. For example, the community programme was a nationwide MSC-funded programme that stimulated the demand for labour and provided work-based learning for trainees on it.I guess that is the main thing, although the other thing to say is that in some ways it is a false dichotomy to talk about a division between supply side and demand side because the two things interact. Poor-quality work and poor-quality training can have a deleterious effect upon young people and discourage them from further labour market engagement. There needs to be a concentration on quality because poor-quality provision, whether that is in the workplace or education and training, can in some ways be more damaging than waiting for something that is more suitable.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Very helpful, thank you.

[[[Q117 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] You have referred to the situation that persists in other European Union countries. I am concerned about the approach in this country. Do you think what the Government is doing is effective, relevant, can be improved?

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: I am happy to answer that. I think there are some things to be praised, for example the promotion of apprenticeships is broadly a good thing but the way that it is being delivered in many ways is highly problematic. Many of the programmes labelled as apprenticeships stretch the meaning of the term beyond reality and the quality is highly variable. So the principle of increasing apprenticeships is really good but the practice is problematic. Other than that, I think there are three problems with the UK approach. One I have mentioned already, which is the overconcentration on the supply side and the lack of recognition that supply and demand interacts. Another area that is problematic is a marketised system of delivery, particularly for education and training. For example, within one local authority you could have 100 providers of education and training programmes, public, private, voluntary sector, charitable organisations and so on. I think for young people and their parents that is a very difficult mishmash to see through and to negotiate. Also organisations competing against each other for business sometimes works very well but on the ground that can be problematic for young people who are put on programmes that are sometimes not suitable because the funding is attached to the young person as a unit of resource. So I think the marketised thing is problematic.

[[[Lord Clinton-Davis:]]] Are these points raised in the debates that occur about the issue in Europe? Are we doing something quite unique as far as this is concerned? Is it being followed by other people?

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: I do not think it is unique. There is highly variable practice in the different European nations although in many ways the UK context is more similar to other Anglophone nations, for example Australia and New Zealand. If you look at how well the UK is doing, in a way it is EU average, so okay, but in reality the UK is doing much worse in terms of youth unemployment than the countries that it would traditionally compare itself to, particularly Germany. It depends how you look at it but, compared to Britain’s traditional industrial rivals, it is doing relatively badly.The third point is that the other problem with the UK approach is coercion. I think there is a balance to be had between carrot and stick. I am not a hopeless romantic, some young people do need to be robustly encouraged; the minority as well by the way but there are some. However, if they are encouraged into low-quality provision, that will have a further deleterious effect. That would be my overall observation of the UK context.

[[[Q118 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[T]]]

[[[he Chairman: ]]]Thank you very much. Do you think that the UK approach is consistent in other EU countries, a similar sort of approach, or are we doing things so differently that maybe this is why the differences come up between UK and Germany?

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: The UK system is very different to Germany. For example, I mentioned apprenticeships earlier and people are probably aware of the traditional German system of apprenticeship, and also Austria. Other northern European nations are much more robust than the UK system. I think there are some qualitative differences there.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Going though this today, I have the feeling that there are many initiatives and not all of them can be of the same value. What are the better ones? Lord Kakkar, you would like to come into that.

[[[Q119 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] You mentioned a few moments ago that the approaches are quite different and youth unemployment has been a particular feature of every recession and the responses are different in different member states. Has the recovery of the youth element from those recessions also been different across Europe? Cumulatively, recession after recession, has the position of youth employment in this country been left at a particular disadvantage in comparison to the rest of Europe as the member states come out of recession?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Sorry, we have not given you notice of that question but I am sure you can deal with it.

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Again, it is variable. The condition of youth unemployment in the Mediterranean states is much worse than that in the UK. I think that is related to some degree to socio-historical traditions and particular labour markets or the absence of a solid youth labour market that used to exist in the UK. Youth unemployment levels in Germany, Belgium, Finland and so on have held up much better than those of the UK since 2008. There is evidence, looking at all these dimensions, that there is good practice to spread. The evidence is there, but I think it is difficult to get certain Governments to recognise that.

[[[Lord Kakkar:]]] Does that mean that in times of economic growth we have a structurally weaker youth employment market as a result of a previous lack of attention?

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Yes, that would be my observation. In particular in the UK what we are getting is many adult workers competing for what was traditionally youth employment, so trading down and squeezing young people out of what were, essentially, pockets of the youth labour market. That is a particular feature of the UK that is quite observable.

[[[The Chairman:]]] May I just remind everybody that we are now running out of time. We have about 15 minutes left so would you keep the answers quite short.

[[[Q120 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] A quick supplementary, which to some extent we have bypassed: when you first referred to the broad definition of apprenticeships in the UK as being not an advantage, what would be your preferred definition?

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Just to put a little flesh on the bones, for example calling a six-month programme in a retail outlet an apprenticeship is extremely different to a robust three-year programme with high-level qualifications, let us say within Rolls-Royce or British Aerospace. I think there needs to be a definition about level, length and content. That could be debated but I think at the moment it is too fluid.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: In response to a previous question, a distinctive characteristic of the crisis that we have had in the last few years—and Massimiliano can correct me—is that it affected graduates, highly skilled young people, much more than in previous recessions. I was just checking the latest figures for NEET in Europe and for young people with upper secondary, post-secondary and tertiary education levels—the so-called more skilled than the usual group of NEETs we tend to associate with—over 50% are classified as NEETs in countries such as the UK, the southern European countries, Ireland, Sweden, the Baltic countries, Czech Republic and the rest of it. I think there is an issue around also the highly skilled because the policy focus is usually NEETs and we feel that the general youth population, especially the highly skilled ones, will integrate more easily. But after this recession things are not like in the past so graduates find it difficult to integrate in a number of countries.

[[[The Chairman:]]] The graduates who several years ago knew they had jobs at the end of their degree and that is not the case now? 

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: Yes.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, I think that we do have evidence of that.

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: I would like to just briefly enter into the discussion. Responses to youth unemployment have been different in Europe because the problems of the member states are different in Europe. For example, in some member states the crisis has exploded youth unemployment but the labour market was already difficult before for young people. If we analyse, for example, the population of NEETs, they have very different characteristics among member states, even in countries with similar rates. For example, in Spain and Italy—I am Italian—they have similar NEETs rates but the population is completely different. In Spain the population of NEETs has increased as a result of the crisis, so the majority of NEETs are unemployed males with work experience. On the other hand, in Italy the majority of NEETs are inactive females without work experience because there was a problem of youth accessing the labour market even before the crisis. It is more a structural problem than a problem related to the crisis and this has created different responses to the crisis.

[[[Q121 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Earl of ]]]

[[[Liverpool]]]

[[[:]]] There seem to be so many different situations in different countries that you are telling us about and obviously there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but we are trying to write a report on how to resolve the situation. If you were writing the report for us, what magic wand could one use to produce an idea to get everybody singing off the same hymn sheet?

[[[The Chairman:]]] A nice quick answer, please.

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: To anybody in particular? I will give you an answer then. There is no silver bullet. However, what individual nation states and the EU need to do is to develop a coherent industrial strategy, and by that I do not mean trying to reopen shipyards and coal mines that were closed 30 years ago. There are different ways of doing industrial strategies and different nation states need to think that through. For example, in the UK we need an industrial strategy for green, renewable, high-tech infrastructure projects, housing and so on, so my answer would be for the supply and the demand side to interact. That is far harder to implement than it is to say, but I suppose that would be my vision.

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: It is a $1 million question, but I think that we can be as creative as we want with our supply side initially, the training, retraining, fostering apprenticeship or integrating early school leavers and apprenticeship and internship, but if we do not have jobs how, after six months of training, do we tell our young people that there is more training for the next six months? So supply side measures are important as well.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: To reinforce what the previous speakers said, as we are doing this over youth apprenticeships I was speaking to the Public Employment Services in Greece and Cyprus and they said to me, “Apprentices are free to employers. We pay everything”. They do not want them because they are not sure whether they will have a business in a year’s time, and maybe this is the extreme case but this is the need for balance of supply and demand.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Yes, I can understand that. Lord Clinton-Davis, do you want to ask your question? No. If you have an answer to that prepared perhaps you could let us have it because we are up against the pipes, You have just been too interesting.

[[[Q122 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I think my question, which again is about the balance between supply and demand, has been answered to a fair degree already, but I have an additional point to make. One of the traditional ways in the public service in the past in the UK was to retire people at 65 or 60 to create opportunities to bring young people in. Now with the changed legislation on retirement policy and people having to stay longer and older people competing for jobs in the market, we have a difficulty there in the UK. Is that common in other parts of Europe, where I believe they still have rather earlier retirement ages in some of the European countries than we have in the UK, or is there freedom for people to argue that they can stay on as long as they wish regardless of what the public policies are on retirement age?

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: In most European countries now there is the tendency to increase the minimum age that people can retire at, for budgetary reasons as well. I think that there is conflicting evidence about the effect of increasing retirement age on the share of young people who are at work. We have observed that during this recession older workers have suffered the crisis in a very marginal way in comparison to the other age categories. We do not know basically because, for example, those countries that have a higher share of older workers are also those with a higher share of young people at work, so it is more general and broader labour market participation. However, for certain types of jobs there is no replacement of an older worker for a young worker. For other jobs, as you indicate, there is an increase in older workers being competitive in the labour market, but there is no conclusive evidence on that because we can find studies that indicate opposite directions.

[[[Q123 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I ask, if the demand side is the answer, what is the responsibility of employers? A quick response, please, or you could even think about it and write to us. Would that be all right? I am talking about the responsibility of employers if the real problem is on the demand side.

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: I could give you a very quick response. I think largely employers are the missing voice in this. We talk about education, training, state policy and so on but I think largely the employer voice is missing, with some exceptions, some noble exceptions by the way.

[[[The Chairman:]]] It is interesting you should say that because we have had some really cracking evidence from some employers, but there are always good eggs.

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: Yes, absolutely.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: It depends again which country we are talking about. There are countries where employers are very much present, and I am not going to mention the Germans, who are the usual suspects here. For example, in Luxembourg a very successful traineeship programme, with over 85% of labour market integration rate, was introduced on the initiative of the Chambers of Commerce and it was designed with the Public Employment Services in close co-operation with the employers. I think if employers see young people as the investment for the future then you see the whole thing on a different footing.

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: There is variability among the member states because, for example, in Scandinavian countries Youth Guarantees are a partnership between public, private and people, and employers play their role. Also in Germany and Austria there is the question, “Why do you offer apprenticeships?” because we do. It is in our tradition to play our role there. This is a complement and it is important.

[[[Q124 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Baroness Hooper:]]] I think the evidence base about how youth employment should best be tackled and where the gaps in knowledge are has been pretty well covered, but is there anything you would wish to add, perhaps particularly in terms of gaps in knowledge?

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: In our studies we found some gaps in evaluation of those programmes that try to involve the filters from the labour markets, so multiple disadvantages that require a multiple approach that is not just the integration into labour market but also at the beginning management schemes and then labour market schemes. We found a lack of evidence for those kind of programmes in some cases.

[[[Ms Hadjivassiliou]]]: In our overview, it is not about content although content is an issue. For example, existing evidence shows that active labour market policies targeted at young people tend to perform less well in general across the EU than programmes for adults. I think there is a need for further exploration especially with training, but at the more general level, impact evaluations are missing, proper rigorous impact evaluations. We have monitoring data, like so many people took part in that programme, so many people finished the programme, but in terms of labour market outcomes—and I was struck as we were doing the overview this year—I expected to find a lot of impact evaluations and, especially after the six months, how many young people who took part in this programme were still employed. It is very uneven, very patchy and overall there is a big gap there for proper impact evaluations, counterfactual evaluations and the rest of it.

[[[Q125 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] You have given us a lot of very interesting examples of different practice in different countries in the EU. How valuable is sharing good practice and in the past how effective has it been to do that? A final bit of that, if it is valuable, is what is a way of doing it? Is it useful to pass on good practice? In the past has it been useful? If it is useful, what is the right mechanism for doing it within the European Union?

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you want to write to us on that.

[[[Mr Mascherini]]]: I can try to answer shortly. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time. If we have a formal evaluation of good programmes and we know that they work very well, they can serve as inspiration. All member states are different, they have their national context and their own problems, so the successful programmes need to be adapted to the other member states.How can we learn from each other? The European Commission has peer reviews of most of our learning programme. It has thematic and multiple-learning programme events. There is the database of good practices. In some sense it is a process that is strengthening every year in order to find new ways of learning from each other. For example, an increasing number of member states have reported to have drawn inspiration from each other in the field of small and medium enterprises, education for apprenticeships and youth apprenticeships. This is the whole communication of the European Commission in that direction. This is just one small example.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Quick two-sentence answer.

[[[Professor Simmons]]]: It all depends what you mean by best practice. If best practice means creating highly flexible labour markets and pools of labour to pull on, we have best practice within the UK, because that is what we do. We churn young people through various sites of participation and non-participation. If we are talking about best practice as a model of social justice and high employment, I think we have talked about various examples, various nations where we can draw on good practice. Having said that, I think there is generally a gap between policy and practice.The EU is a large unit and set of committees and organisations and so. How that drills down to practice on the front line, to careers advisers, teachers, training providers, it is creating that link between policymakers and practitioners that is really important.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is very instructive. Thank you all very much indeed. You have really given us of your best and it has been most interesting. You are leaving us confused, at least me confused, not the rest of them I am sure. We are very grateful to you for spending the time and thank you. The last thing I do say is that if there is anything you think we should have asked you please answer it and write to us. Thank you.&#xa0;
