[normal]“Most studies indicate that it would be unwise to pin much faith in new railways as an engine of growth. That is not to say a growth stimulus is entirely absent.
[normal] In 1997 the European Commission 
[normal]estimated 
[normal]that the major TENS would add only 0.25 per cent to EU GDP, and 0.11 per cent to employment over the next 25 years. 
[normal]The literature review of Preston and Wall produced the conclusion that the growth of HSRs was lik
[normal]ely 
[normal]to lie 
[normal]within the modest range of 1-3 per cent of GDP.”
