"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Royal Society of Chemistry (AMR0050)&#xa0;The Royal Society of Chemistry is the world’s leading chemistry community, advancing excellence in the chemical sciences. With 48,000 members and a knowledge business that spans the globe, we are the UK’s professional body for chemical scientists; a not-for-profit organisation with over 170 years of history and an international vision of the future.  We promote, support and celebrate chemistry. We work to shape the future of the chemical sciences – for the benefit of science and humanity.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry welcomes the opportunity to respond to the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee ‘Call for Evidence: Antimicrobial Resistance’.  We have chosen to comment on those areas that we feel are of particular relevance to the chemical sciences, and have therefore chosen not to comment on aspects relating to public health trends, behaviour and antimicrobial administration practices.\n&#xa0;\nKey Recommendations\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Q1. How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?\n&#xa0;              \nNo comment\n&#xa0;\nQ2. What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q3. Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ4. What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?\n                            No comment\n&#xa0;Q5. What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q6. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nChemistry for Better Health: a white paper from the Chemical Sciences and Society Summit (CS3) 2011\n&#xa0; \n Jang, K.
