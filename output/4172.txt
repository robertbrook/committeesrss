[[[Executive Summary]]]&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The Commercial Broadcasters Association (COBA) is the industry body for multichannel broadcasters and their on-demand services in the UK. ]]]

[[[Q1 ]]]

[[[What]]]

[[[ should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Commercial broadcasters in the multichannel sector are one of the fastest growing parts of the UK TV industry. The sector has doubled direct employment in the last decade, increased investment in UK content by 30% in the last three years, and increased commissioning from independent producers by 50% last year. The multichannel sector now accounts for 18% of all new UK TV production. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This growth fuels the UK’s status as a global TV hub. The multichannel sector now has a turnover of £5 billion a year, helping provide the UK with the critical mass it needs to compete with other major media centres around the world. And, with many having strong international networks, multichannel broadcasters help drive exports of UK content, reinvesting that income into UK production. Last year, 35% of multichannel commissions in the UK were part funded through their international divisions. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In many areas, this commercially-funded content is comparable to PSB content. Sky’s commitment to the arts includes commissioning The South Bank Show, while Disney funds the production of Art Attack, historically commissioned by PSBs. But just as importantly, non PSB broadcasters add diversity. For example, according to producers body Pact, the multichannel sector commissions a substantially higher proportion of UK content from smaller producers than PSBs. This creates more opportunities for SMEs in the supply base. Pact’s census states that 34% of multichannel spend went on producers with a turnover of less than £25m per annum. This compares to 16% at the BBC, 8% at Channel 4, 19% at Five and 11% at ITV. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We therefore believe that the future of the BBC needs to be seen within the changing landscape of the UK’s TV sector. The UK is a more mixed, more global ecology than ever before. The BBC has a key role to play, as do commercial broadcasters and others. Maintaining a healthy, competitive market that enables a range of players to develop is key to future growth, and robust governance of the BBC is key to this.

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We comment on the nature of the BBC’s public purposes below.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q2 ]]]

[[[How]]]

[[[ well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes? Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The number of the BBC’s public purposes – in addition to other goals set by the Trust – can dilute the BBC’s impact and is at times conflicting. For example, BBC Worldwide has a public purpose to promote the BBC brand through its overseas channels. However, broadcasting BBC programmes on those channels, rather than selling them to third-party channels on a commercial basis, risks restricting the amount of revenues Worldwide is able to return to the BBC from exploiting its IP.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe that it is worth considering whether the number of overall purposes should be limited, or the priority of relevant purposes should be made clearer for each service.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q3 What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Scope, scale and remit&#xa0;3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are concerned about proposals to augment certain BBC services. Firstly, the Government has put forward proposals to enhance PSB prominence requirements. Currently, PSB services are entitled to privileged positions on the Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) for TV channels. The new proposals are focused on extending the prominence of PSBs onto on-demand platforms. While we appreciate the importance of such services being readily available, we are not convinced that there is a need for legislation, as PSB on-demand services are widely used already.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We therefore ask the Committee to call on the Government, as part of the DCMS’s forthcoming consultation on these proposals, to consider a) whether PSB services are already readily available on on-demand platforms and b) whether extending prominence in this way would have a negative impact on innovation by crowding out new services. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, as part of these proposals, the Government is also considering enhancing PSB prominence on well-established linear TV platforms. Proposals to take a more prescriptive definition of ‘appropriate prominence’ under the 2003 Communications Act would move the BBC children’s channels to the top of the Sky children’s section. This would have a negative impact on investment in UK children’s content, as such a move would inevitably mean moving other channels down, reducing their audience share and impacting on their content budgets. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Over the last three years, COBA children’s channels have increased their investment in UK children’s content by 60%, to nearly £30m. This has gone a long way to replace declines in children’s investment at commercial PSBs, but this commissioning would be likely to be damaged by forcing those channels to move down the EPG. In contrast, the BBC does not depend on its EPG position to determine its income, which of course comes from the licence fee. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC children’s channels already have privileged prominence, being entitled to the best available slots (non PSB channels go automatically to the bottom of the EPG section when launching). 

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Perhaps most importantly, however, the BBC children’s channels are already highly successful, being the most watched channels in their demographics. The Director General outlined their success to the Committee in October, saying:&#xa0;“So Newsround now is not on BBC One but the figures for Newsround are growing. Likewise with Blue Peter the figures are growing, so these two channels are working and they’re finding their audience.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Anne Bulford, the BBC’s Managing Director, Operations and Finance, expanded on this in her evidence, saying: &#xa0;“[C]hildren’s awareness of children’s channels and digital channels is very high and Cbeebies and CBBC are the first place they go, so nought to six 95% of them are aware of it and six to 12s 89% are aware of CBBC, so I think that’s very encouraging. Where the channels are, how we cross-promote them, how we take people to those channels is what’s important and everything Tony said about the app and how its broken up I think shows that content is very key and children love it and they find it and they come to it.”

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We therefore ask the Committee to call on the Government, as part of any consultation on these proposals, to consider fully the impact of investment in UK’s children’s content.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Separately, the BBC recently announced a raft of changes to on-demand services, including extending the iPlayer catch-up window from seven to 30 days, premiering content on the iPlayer before it has been broadcast on linear channels, and a download-to-own service, BBC Store. Taken together, these are potentially significant moves in the market and could have a negative impact on commercial services. They also entail, in our view, substantial changes to the current service. We will be asking the Trust to investigate the market impact of these proposals fully, and ask the Committee to support our request for a full Public Value Test.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the manner in which these services were announced, without full scrutiny by the Trust, does also in our view raise questions over the oversight of the BBC, as we outline in response to Question 7. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[Q4 ]]]

[[[How]]]

[[[ have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is of concern that the BBC’s reigning in of Lonely Planet and also BBC Jam came relatively late, after widespread concerns were raised, including by this Committee, and, as a result, at considerable additional cost to the licence fee payer, as well as after unnecessary uncertainty in the wider market. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q5 ]]]

[[[What]]]

[[[ role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?]]]&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our concern here is that the BBC should not have an undue impact on the market. We are not convinced that the BBC governance system is robust enough, as we outline in response to Question 7.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q6 ]]]

[[[How]]]

[[[ should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC? What comparisons can be made with the provision of public serv]]]

[[[ice content in other countries?]]]&#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Funding is already being distributed beyond the BBC, for example to support S4C. Whether licence fee funding should be distributed to other parties is a major debate that may warrant discussion during the Charter renewal process.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Q7 ]]]

[[[How]]]

[[[ should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016? In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?]]]&#xa0;7.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Charter clearly requires separation between Management and the BBC Trust, stating that: “The members of the Trust and the members of the Board shall never act together as a single corporate body.” &#xa0;7.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Charter goes on to say that: “The Trust must maintain its independence of the Executive Board.”&#xa0;7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Yet Management and Trust have acted together on issues of the highest importance. Most recently, in the wake of the critical NAO report and PAC hearing, the Director General and the Chairman of the Trust wrote jointly to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media &amp; Sport to promise a review of the BBC’s governance. This letter promised that the Director General and the Chairman “will together lead this piece of work, drawing on internal resources from both parts of the BBC.”&#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We view this joint approach as raising serious questions over the effectiveness of the Charter’s requirement for separation, and as particularly ill-advised as it is a review of the BBC’s governance systems. Put simply, the body being governed is jointly leading the review into how it is governed. This is a scenario we cannot envisage happening for any other UK broadcaster, yet the BBC, with its privilege of public funding, should be held to the highest standards. &#xa0;7.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also note that this form of joint response has occurred before, when Management and the BBC Trust issued a joint response to Ofcom’s second review of Public Service Broadcasting (which was looking at granting some of the licence fee to other services).&#xa0;7.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, as we have noted previously, the way BBC Management announced changes to the iPlayer recently raises questions as to the level of oversight that the Trust has. The changes to the iPlayer could have negative consequences on the rest of the market. Yet Management made public announcements regarding the new iPlayer features as if they were a near certainty, despite the fact that they had not received Trust approval. In a highly competitive commercial online marketplace, where UK media companies are striving to gain even a minimal foothold, this creates unnecessary uncertainty, and calls into question how the BBC is governed.

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; To restore the confidence of industry, not to mention the public, BBC governance will require a far greater level of transparency, robustness and clarity – and crucially there must be a clear and guaranteed separation between Management and whichever body oversees it. It may also require greater resources being allocated to the oversight body, in order to ensure it is able to perform this function properly.&#xa0;Constitutional framework&#xa0;7.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Charter and Agreement are sufficiently high level for the BBC to have an appropriate level of flexibility in most areas.
