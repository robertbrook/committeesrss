[normal]Written evidence submitted by RCUK Energy Strategy Fellowship (LCI0018)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]In[bold]trod[bold]uction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The RCUK Energy Strategy Fellowship
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]recently launched 
[normal]a Prospectus
[normal] 
[normal]exploring research, skills and training needs across the energy landscape. 
[normal]The Prospectus was commissioned by Research Councils UK 
[normal](RCUK)
[normal] 
[normal]who 
[normal]constitute
[normal] the primary audience for the report. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Prospectus contributes to the evidence base upon which the RCUK Energy Programme can plan research 
[normal]and training 
[normal]activities
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]a number of the findings 
[normal]and recommendations 
[normal]concern
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]wider 
[normal]UK energy innovation system
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]Fellowship 
[normal]Team acted independently in producing the 
[normal]Prospectus
[normal], drawing on
[normal] 
[normal]an extensive series of workshops, stakeholder 
[normal]interviews and literature reviews
[normal]. The recommendations
[normal] are
[normal] grouped 
[normal]according to their main focu
[normal]s:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This evidence draws on both the Prospectus and the judgements of the Fellowship team,
[normal] 
[normal]focussing on the question posed in the Call for Evidence.
[normal] 
[normal]We have raised wider issues where we believe these to be relevant to the question being posed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While 
[normal]there 
[normal]is a very large overlap between 
[normal]low-carbon
[normal] 
[normal]innovation
[normal] (the subject of this Inquiry)
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]energy
[normal] innovation
[normal] (the subject of our work)
[normal], there are differences
[normal]. 
[normal]Low-carbon
[normal] innovation 
[normal]could cover 
[normal]land-use change, as well as materials and manufacturing development
[normal]. 
[normal]Energy
[normal] innovation includes advances in technologies in the fossil fuel industri
[normal]es, which 
[normal]would not typically
[normal] be 
[normal]viewed 
[normal]as low-carbon.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 1: [bold]Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 2: [bold]Does[bold] the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other [bold]low carbon technologies?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question 3: [bold]What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve? How should its forthcoming strategy drive more investment into low carbon innovation, and how should it measure success?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 4[bold]:[bold] [bold]Are the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation pr[bold]ocess, including over the long-term?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question 5: [bold]What is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 6: [bold]How should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low [bold]carbon innovation will be spent wisely, after two years of underspend?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Question 7: [bold]How is the Government maximising [bold]opportunities to learn from and partner with international partners within and beyond the EU?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]
