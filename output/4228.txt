[[[evidence from]]]

[[[ Dr Arman Sarvarian, Lecturer in Law, University of Surrey (PCD 05)]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This is a submission of written evidence in response to the call published by the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee ('the Committee') concerning its inquiry on ‘Parliament’s role in conflict decisions: an update’. The main question of the inquiry is: ‘Given the commitment made by the Foreign Secretary in March 2011, how can progress be made on enshrining in law the necessity of consulting Parliament on military action?’ This submission is made in my personal capacity as an academic lawyer specialising in public international law. 2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I have submitted this evidence in order to assist the Committee's forthcoming report by illustrating the importance of clarifying the constitutional convention on consulting the House of Commons on military action for the purpose of identification of the legal position of the United Kingdom concerning the lawfulness of humanitarian intervention in public international law. The central issue that it examines is whether the legal position has changed as a consequence of the House of Commons vote on the Government motion of 29 August 2013, in which the House declined to support the lawfulness of the principle of humanitarian intervention. 3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the process, this submission sets out the difficulties of identifying the legal position of the United Kingdom in light of the complex constitutional position concerning the initiation of military action. It has been tailored to address the terms of reference for this inquiry. In preparing it, I have had the benefit of consulting the Committee's report of 6 September 2013, the written evidence of 17 October 2013 and 21 November 2013, and the oral evidence of 17 and 24 October 2013 which this submission is intended to supplement. 

[[[The formation of c]]]

[[[ustomary international law]]]4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unlike in national legal systems, public international law lacks for most purposes a centralised authority for legislative purposes. In its centrifugal system, the primary legislators are States which make law by two principal means: 1) treaties; and 2) custom. Whereas treaties are concluded through relatively clear forms, custom is a less well-defined instrument. In 2012, the International Law Commission decided to include the topic ‘Formation and evidence of customary international law’ in its programme of work. In light of the importance of the work of the Commission, this indicates both the importance of the topic and its underdeveloped state.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The two well-known criteria for the formation of customary law are: 1) the practice of States; and 2) the legal opinions or positions of States (opinio iuris sive necessitatis). In shorthand, the former criterion entails ‘what States have done’ whereas the latter concerns ‘why (legally) States have done it’. The formation of a customary rule is necessarily a retrospective exercise: to determine whether a customary rule exists, international courts and scholars of international law examine the precedents of State practice to distil whether the rule commands sufficient support amongst States. 6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Practice can be generated by any organ of a State, in particular by those with competence in the subject-matter of the rule concerned. For example, a resolution by the London Borough of Islington regarding the doctrine of humanitarian intervention would not manifest the practice of the UK in light of the lack of competence for that body in foreign affairs. By contrast, the note published by the Office of the Prime Minister on 29 August 2013 (entitled 'Chemical weapon use by the Syrian regime: UK government legal position') and incorporated into the statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 29 August 2013. However questionable in quality, the Note constitutes relevant practice for the purpose of defining the UK legal position, as does the House of Commons vote. 7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The criterion of opinio iuris entails a subjective expression by a State of its legal position. This can either entail a view as to the State of the law today or an opinion as to what the law ought to be tomorrow. Leaving to one side the paradoxes well-known to international lawyers in this field, the prominence of the question of the legality of humanitarian intervention in the Government motion, Opposition amendment and debate in the House, in my view, renders the votes of the House an expression of opinio iuris for the purpose articulating the legal position of the United Kingdom. The problem created thereby is that the decision of the House rejecting the Government motion necessarily creates an inconsistency between the established legal position of the United Kingdom on humanitarian intervention and the newly-expressed view of the House.    8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Consequently, a relevant factor to this inquiry is not only the constitutional position concerning consultation of Parliament on military action but also the effect of such consultation on the articulation of the legal position of the country on international law. In light of the increasing willingness by Governments over the course of the past decade to consult Parliament on military action and the novel position created by the Syrian vote in which the House of Commons refused (in a first in modern times) to support the Government on such action, there is a need for clarification of the respective legal values of the positions adopted by the Government and the House of Commons concerning the lawfulness of humanitarian intervention. This may apply to other forms of military action as well, such as self-defence.       

[[[Assessing the legal value of the House of Commons vote]]]9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In light of the vagueness of the process of formation of customary international law and the immense diversity of constitutional practices amongst States, assessment of the legal value of State practice is necessarily a highly relative and fact-sensitive exercise. In assessing the legal value of the defeat of the Government motion, a number of constitutional and practical factors must be taken into account: 1) the royal prerogative on the use of force and legally non-binding character of the motion; 2) the emerging constitutional convention that the House of Commons be consulted on military action save in an emergency; 3) the legislative supremacy of the House of Commons due to its collective electoral mandate; and 4) the prominence of the issue of legality in the consultation. At present, the variable practice of consultation renders an assessment of the legal value of the vote overly complex.  10.&#xa0;&#xa0; In the first place, the constitutional position suggests that the House of Commons vote does not have the effect of defining the legal position of the United Kingdom on humanitarian intervention. As the Royal Prerogative on uses of force remains intact, it was open to the Government to proceed with its own legal view concerning the lawfulness of humanitarian intervention in its exercise of the Prerogative. On this approach, notwithstanding the political import of the vote of the House, it is valueless for the purpose of stating the legal position of the country.11.&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the constitutional position appears to be qualified by an emerging convention that the House of Commons be consulted prior to taking military action. Moreover, on this specific occasion, the significance of the vote is amplified by the decision of the Government to not exercise the prerogative in response:‘Let me say that the House has not voted for either motion tonight. I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons. It is very clear tonight that, while the House has not passed a motion, the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the Government will act accordingly.’This suggests that, in practice, the vote does carry normative weight in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. This weight was linked to the electoral mandate of the House of Commons, which imbues its collective will with magnified importance. 12.&#xa0;&#xa0; The legal value of the vote is further strengthened by the prominence of the issue of legality in the debate on the motion. The Government motion, inter alia: ‘Notes that the use of chemical weapons is a war crime under customary law and a crime against humanity, and that the principle of humanitarian intervention provides a sound legal basis for taking action’. In his statement, the Prime Minister asserted: ‘We have a summary of the Government’s legal position, which makes it explicit that military action would have a clear legal basis.’ A number of interventions and responses in the debate addressed the question of legality. It is clear that legality was not secondary or peripheral to the vote but, to the contrary, was a core issue at the forefront of the debate. Concordantly, this enhances the legal value of the decision of the House to reject the lawfulness of the principle of humanitarian intervention.13.&#xa0;&#xa0; Taking these factors into account, my view is that the House of Commons vote should have the effect of defining the legal position of the United Kingdom for the purpose of customary international law. At present, it is too soon to reach a definitive conclusion concerning whether its position has in fact changed. Although the constitutional position is that the Royal Prerogative may be exercised regardless of the view of the House of Commons, the particular circumstances of this vote vested it with such persuasive weight that the Government chose to respect the will of the House. Consequently, the legal position of the United Kingdom on humanitarian intervention has changed: whereas the country has promoted the principle at least since Kosovo, it no longer supports its lawfulness. 

[[[Clarifying the legal value of the House of Commons vote]]]14.&#xa0;&#xa0; The implication of this conclusion is that the Government will cease to support the principle of humanitarian intervention in its conduct of foreign affairs in the United Nations and elsewhere. Although it is formally open to the Government to pursue its own legal position, its undertaking to ‘respect the will of [the] House of Commons’ and the invidious inconsistency of ignoring the vote in its future position on humanitarian intervention render such a course inadvisable. At the least, the credibility of its legal position in relation to other States would be undermined by the fact that the House of Commons is on record as adopting a contrary position. 15.&#xa0;&#xa0; The question of enshrining in law the necessity to consult Parliament prior to military action engages a variety of issues for the Committee to consider for its Report. However, in all cases a state of confusion concerning the legal position of the country is patently not a desirable outcome. Where the Government, as it did in the case of Syria, consults the House of Commons, receives a negative answer concerning the lawfulness of military action and respects the will of the House, it is essential for the conduct of foreign relations that the value of the consultation be clarified. 16.&#xa0;&#xa0; For this purpose, it is not necessary to enshrine in statute or resolution a duty to consult the House of Commons. A constitutional convention has the same effect of ensuring that the House expresses its view concerning, inter alia, the legality of the Government’s proposed military action. The important question is the following: where the House of Commons, as on 29 August 2013, rejects the lawfulness of the Government’s proposed military action and the Government respects its will, is the Government bound by convention to align its legal position with that of the House?  17.&#xa0;&#xa0; The aforementioned complexities of the constitutional position introduce difficulties to the legal assessment that can be ameliorated. For this purpose, 

[[[I recommend that the Committee: ]]]1) include in its Report a statement of the importance of the House of Commons vote of 29 August 2013 for the identification of the position of the United Kingdom on the lawfulness of the principle of humanitarian intervention; and 2) question the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on whether, in light of the vote, it considers itself bound to not support the principle of humanitarian intervention.  

[[[The importance of legal advice]]]18.&#xa0;&#xa0; Although the Government – in particular, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office – is conversant with and long-accustomed to the intricacies of international law-making, the historically more limited role of the House of Commons in the field of foreign affairs (particularly military action) means that the submission of legal advice is even more important to guide and inform the House in its deliberations. Although the question of legality was prominent in the 29 August debate, there is no indication from the record that the Honourable Members were conscious of the fact that their decision would have the potential effect of defining the legal position of the country on humanitarian intervention for the future. 19.&#xa0;&#xa0; This underscores the concerns that have been expressed in written and oral evidence in this inquiry, in particular by Professor Philippe Sands QC, concerning the decision of the Government to submit to the House of Commons only a summary of its legal position in its Note. I respectfully concur with their views on the unsatisfactory nature of the summary presented to the House. It is evident that full, original legal advice is necessary for the House to consider its position with the benefit of professional guidance. Although I do not comment in detail on the mechanics of achieving this result, I emphasise its importance in light of the preceding analysis on the effect of the House of Commons vote in defining the legal position of the United Kingdom. 20.&#xa0;&#xa0; Consequently, 

[[[I recommend ]]]

[[[that]]]

[[[ the Committee]]]

[[[ ]]]emphasise in its Report the importance of the provision of full, original legal advice to the House in future consultations. Although the Prime Minister asserted that the changing practice of submitting a ‘summary of legal advice’ to the House of Commons when consulting it upon a proposed military action is sufficient, it is suggested that the importance of the House of Commons vote for defining the legal position of the country militates against this view. Whilst a range of models are being examined by the Committee, my own view would be that the submission of the legal advice of the Attorney to the House of Commons as a ministerial statement would ensure the professional independence and accountability of that advice.

[[[Conclusions and summary of recommendations]]]21.&#xa0;&#xa0; I conclude that, though it is too soon to reach a definitive conclusion concerning the effect of the House of Commons consultation of 29 August 2013 on the legal position of the United Kingdom, an initial assessment suggests that the legal position of the United Kingdom should change as a consequence of the decision of the Government to respect the will of the House of Commons in that vote.22.&#xa0;&#xa0; For the purpose of clarifying the position, I recommend that the Committee: 1) include in its Report a statement of the importance of the House of Commons vote of 29 August 2013 for the identification of the position of the United Kingdom on the lawfulness of the principle of humanitarian intervention; and 2) solicit a statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office concerning whether, in light of the vote, it considers itself bound to desist from supporting the principle of humanitarian intervention in international fora.  23.&#xa0;&#xa0; I also recommend that the Committee emphasise in its Report the importance of the provision of full, original legal advice to the House in future consultations in light of its importance to define the legal position of the country.09 December 2013&#xa0;6&#xa0; Although the vote of the House on the Opposition amendment is also relevant, this submission focuses upon the vote of the Government motion as it directly pertains to its central issue of divergent Government and House of Commons positions on legality. See the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, Part II.  The International Law Commission is a committee of experts created in 1947 by the UN General Assembly to work for ‘the promotion of the progressive development of international law and its codification’.   It has been instrumental in the inspiration of a number of important treaties and other works of international law, such as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, the Statute of the International Criminal Court 1998 and the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2002.  Examples of practice include: diplomatic correspondence, policy statements, press releases, opinions of government legal advisers, official manuals on legal questions, comments by government on ILC drafts, national legislation and international and national judicial decisions. See, e.g. – Crawford, Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law (2012), 24.    https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chemical-weapon-use-by-syrian-regime-uk-government-legal-position.  HC Deb, 29 August 2013, col. 1426.  The UK legal position gradually shifted from scepticism of the lawfulness of humanitarian intervention to open endorsement of it from August 1992 until the Kosovo air campaign in 1999. See, e.g. - Gray, International Law and the Use of Force (2008), 35-50. E.g. – a scenario akin to the Falkland Islands War of 1982.
