[normal]What an inspiring and impressive document!  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have nothing to add, except that to emphasize, as the fortunate owner of my home and acre of land, surrounded by a large estate which is in turn bordered by other large estates, the position in 
[normal]which tenant farmers and tenants in general find themselves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All are fearful of making any sort of representation to such a committee or indeed making any sort of complaint about their situation, for fear of repercussions.  Many have no contract whatsoeve
[normal]r and can be evicted with a couple of weeks’ notice from home or business premises, almost all live in properties which through lack of maintenance are often almost uninhabitable:  is it any wonder that the bulk of submissions to this inquiry have come fro
[normal]m estate owners?  There is also the state of resignation prevailing among many of the older generation, as typified by my neighbour: ‘that’s the way it has always been and that’s the way it will always be’.  Folk have lost faith in th
[normal]e government doing som
[normal]ething to help them. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Estate owners in general (there are two notable exceptions on this island) spend nothing on maintenance or upkeep of tenanted properties, and do nothing to provide land for affordable accommodation:  but are only too willing to sell 
[normal]plots at £100,000+ for holiday homes – the blight of rural communities.
[normal]How much sense I have read in the submissions to this document, summed up by the submission by David Cameron of the Community Land Fund.  Will anything come of it?  - one can but dream
[normal]!
