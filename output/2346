[normal]Peter and Janet Young – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Regarding the above legislation which I understand is being scrutinised at present I wish to state that: My wife and I have witnessed  the damage caused by recreational vehicles being driven on the green lanes in the Yorkshire Dales, and we believe that this is a problem which exists in other parts of the country.  We know that damage caused by these vehicles does not heal quickly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We agree whole heartedly with the proposal to re-classify all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) an all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) as Restricted Byways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These two categories of BOATs and UCRs should be recognised as not part of the ordinary roads network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs):[bold] I feel there should be a right of appeal against a local authority which declines to impose a TRO which is widely supported by the public.  The appeal should be to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am a member of the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA) and fully support the formal submissions made by this organisation along with others.  These are the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLPG), the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), 
[normal]the
[normal] Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My wife also supports the above proposals and adds her signature.
