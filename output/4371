[normal]Written evidence from TravelWatch NorthWest (LTD0009)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. Introduction [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 TravelWatch NorthWest (TWNW) is an independent Community Interest Company representing all public transport users in NW England. We are pleased to give our views as follows to this inquiry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to d[bold]evolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 
[normal]TWNW subscribes to the current all
[normal]-
[normal]party consensus that transport funding should be 
[normal]devolved to sub regional Combined Authorities (CAs)
[normal]. 
[normal]CA’s boundaries are generally based on journey to work areas in large sub regional City wide conurbations.
[normal] 
[normal]Care will be needed to ensure that their rural hinterlands are not neglected. There are histori
[normal]c and more recent precedents supporting this model 
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]The 
[normal]Local Democracy etc Act 2009[bold] and the 
[normal]Localism Act 2011 [bold]are surprisingly
[normal] complementary with the former paving the way for new structures and the latter granting new powers and allowing the Secr
[normal]etary of State to “pass on” functions, such as determining transport and economic strategies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]In pursuit of localism the 2009 Act created 
[normal]statutory[bold] Economic Prosperity Boards (EPBs) and the 2011 Act created 
[normal]voluntary[bold] Local Enterprise Partnerships (LE
[normal]Ps).  Although a future government could abolish EPBs 
[normal] in favour of LEPS there appears in any case to be little enthusiasm in the North West for their creation primarily as a mechanism for forming Combined Authorities (CAs),  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 
[normal]TWNW 
[normal]is
[normal] not yet aware of the creation of any EPBs  but 
[normal]is
[normal] aware of CAs being formed by the mechanism of Integrated Transport Authorities (Local Transport Act 2008) embracing other partners
[normal]. Also CAs may themselves take on the function of an EPB
[normal].
[normal] T
[normal]he creation of
[normal] a CA is a step in the formation, by partnership with relevant LEPs, 
[normal]of Local Transport Bodies[bold] (Act 2009)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 
[normal]EPB’s and LEP’s functions and boundaries are not necessarily co-terminal and TWNW 
[normal]is
[normal] concerned that new sub regional groups of local authorities 
[normal]could establish 
[normal]statutory[bold] (Act 2009) EPBs in a manner that would override 
[normal]LEPs who are 
[normal]voluntary[bold] non statutory Partnerships between local government and others
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6 
[normal]More clarity is needed in respect of the 
[normal]evolving roles of EPBs and LEPs[bold], and especially the role of both in the context of the establishment of 
[normal]Local Transport Bo[bold]die[bold]s (LTBs).[bold] [bold]We are particularly [bold]concerned [bold]at the level[bold] of bureaucracy engendered by the establishment of [bold]non-elected LEPs and how they and LTBs relate to the establ[bold]ished and experienced Local Transport Authorities.  [bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal] Overarching all this in the North is the recent decision on 
[normal]rail 
[normal]franchi
[normal]sing
[normal] renewal and partnership 
[normal]announcement between the 
[normal]DfT
[normal] and 
[normal]Rail
[normal] 
[normal]North
[normal] as a step towards devolution. We see devolving this responsibility to a more local level to be in the best interests of rail passengers provided that adequate funding is available to tackle the significant backlogs of rolling stock replacement and enhance
[normal]ment and to enable 
[normal]full 
[normal]investment in the Rail Strategy for the North.   
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3. [bold]Do local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport authorities and local transport boards) have t[bold]he capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 
[normal]The new devolved structures [Act 2009], powers and functions [Act 2011] of both elected
[normal] and unelected
[normal]  bodies are bound to create demographic deficits and also a “churning” of staff and probably in the short term unavoidable 
[normal]skills shortages[bold]. However we are partially reassured by the general powers of wellbeing and competence [Act 2011] given to these bod
[normal]ies and to allow the Secretary of State to “pass on” functions as most appropriate. We would like to see these used to simplify the complex relationship between EPBs and LEPs whose boundaries and functions too rarely coincide.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. What is the best way of d[bold]ealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1 
[normal]These may involve National agencies such as Network Rail and the Highways Agency, but they will also be funded from the EPBs’ Single Growth Fund (
[normal]SLGF) which the LEPs will need to have already prioritised. A way will need to be found of resolving inevitable territorial, planning and financial discrepancies.  Whilst welcoming the capital in the Local Growth Fund
[normal]  this comes at a time of growing reve
[normal]nue budget challenges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1 
[normal]Local transport bodies have a poor record of co-operation. Even duties such as section 88 Transport Act 19
[normal]86 requiring transport, social services and education providers to co-operate 
[normal]within an authority
[normal] are often observed mainly in the breach
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]We are concerned that devolving powers to local government could result in 
[normal]conflicts[bold] (sometimes with transport e
[normal]xpenditure consequences) between different tiers. This is currently manifest in the disagreement between the elected mayor of Liverpool and Merseytravel’s Integrated Transport Authority (and proposed Combined Authority) over the issue of the removal of the
[normal] City’s bus lanes
[normal]. 
[normal]It would be possible (Act 2011) to legislate for the election of Combined Authority mayors, which could remove this obstacle.
[normal]6. Do the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements? [bold] [bold]What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and th[bold]e introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?[bold]6.1 
[normal]These can be inadequate. TWNW sees the impact of devolving a Single Local Growth Fund to Local Transport Bodies (LTBs) being beneficial overall but only if its transport element is ring fenced and if
[normal] Local Transport Bodies are given the ability to 
[normal]vire
[normal] funds between capital and revenue. This is doubly important if the present Integrated Transport Block Grant is to be administered by LTBs.
[normal]7. How can local authorities attract greater investment from th[bold]e private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?[bold] [bold]How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expenditure?[bold]7.1 
[normal]There are
[normal] encouraging signs of local authorities beginning to attract transport investment but TWNW would 
[normal]emphasise 
[normal]that Local Transport Authorities, rather than appointed bodies such as LEPs, should be the accounting bodies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2 
[normal]Whilst Greater Manchester Combine
[normal]d Authority is a model for others to follow, it should also be noted that CAs must additionally resource other economic strategies which may or may not impinge on their transport remit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1 
[normal]Overall the devolution to local level of much of 
[normal]the expenditure incurred by local transport is welcomed
[normal].
[normal] However t
[normal]he mechanisms for doing so are over complex 
[normal]and there is a real danger of too much bureaucracy. It is probably
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]fortunate that 
[normal]EPBs have largely failed to materialise but 
[normal]the relationships 
[normal]b
[normal]etween 
[normal]LEPs, CAs
[normal],
[normal] LTBs 
[normal]and LTAs  
[normal]are 
[normal]complex and 
[normal]do not help the cause of devolution. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2 
[normal]Efforts will need to be made to repair the 
[normal]depleted skills base[bold] of staff administering public transport and a more co-operative 
[normal]modus operandi
[normal] will be required.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3 
[normal]Should you wish TWNW to expand on this response, either in writing or verbally, we are prepared to do so.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]you for the opportunity to respond
