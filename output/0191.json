"Written evidence submitted by Keith Borer Consultants (FSS007)FAO Science and Technology CommitteeI was forwarded details \nby the Forensic Science Society \nof the consultation \ninto the closure of the Forensic Science Service \nby the Select Committee on Science and Technology, but thought it appropriate to respond directly.\nI am a Director of\n a consultancy \nwhich \nprovides \nforensic science services to the legal profession throughout the UK, Republic of Ireland and overseas\n, and to some p\nolice forces/prosecuting authorities within the UK\n.  Within the jurisdiction of England and Wales\n,\n part of our \nservice\n is “defence examinations” \nof prosecution \nforensic \nevidence in \ncriminal\n cases\n.  Currently we conduct this exercise in \naround \n2000 criminal cases per year\n,\n largely on instructions from solicitors and barristers.  I believe \nwe \nperhaps \nhave \na \nunique perspective derived from \na \nprominent\n \nrole in the \nscrutiny and evaluation of the provision of forensic science to police forces \nin \nthe prosecution of criminal matters.\nAs regards the questions raised in the consultation \ndocument, \nI would respond as follows:\nQ1.              Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R &amp; D and criminal justice?A.              \nIn my view the current provision of forensic science service\ns\n to police forces and the prosecution component of the Criminal Justice System does not represent effective implementation of a coherent strategy.  Irrespective of whether the government’s strategy for forensic science\n,\n either in research \nand \ndevelopment or criminal justice\n,\n would be effective if properly applied\n,\n \nour experience \nsuggests there is either an ineffective strategy or ineffective \nimplementation.\n Q2.              Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?A.              \nI do not have direct knowledge of whether the FSS closure \nand \ncase \ntransition \nwas within budget\n, but it is our\n experienc\ne that it did not run smoothly in\n all cases.  \nA\npplication\ns to the FSS \nArchive for\n copies or delivery of FSS case file\ns\n, \nwere met \npromptly in \nonly \na small proportion of cases\n. T\nhe process was more often slow and \nsometimes \nincomplete.  \nThere was also inconsistency in the way disclosure was provided.  \nIt was of particular concern to us that\n,\n while the archive could \nusually \nprovide the case file (or a copy thereof)\n,\n they \noften \nseemed unable to recover \nother \nretained material\n. \n \nIrrespective of whether the closure of the FSS was considered a\n success, the integrity of the a\nrchive files and materials continues to cause concern.\n \nQ3.              What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R &amp; D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained?  Q4.              What should be the role of the Forensic Science Regulator?Q5.              What is the size of the forensic market and how stable is it?A.               \nThis is not a question I can address given that the size of the forensic market is largely dictated by the procurement process between police forces and the forensic providers tendering for those contracts.\n  Our particular exper\nience is in the scrutiny of the end product.\n \n  \nIt is evident however, that as Police forces seek to reduce the spend on forensic services, there is an increase in forensic examinations \nconducted \non behalf of defendants (or on Court instructions) largely funded by Legal Aid.\nQ6.              How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?Q7.              Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? (please provide evidence/examples).Q8.              Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory?  How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?General CommentThe nature of our work and the number of cases in which we sc\nrutinise the forensic provision\n of all the major forensic providers to police forces in the UK, means we have a close working relationship with the professional staff of those providers (many of whom \npreviously \nwork\ned\n for the Forensic Science Service) and a clear understanding of the pressures that have been applied to forensic provision over the last few years.  As a barometer of attitudes\n,\n there is clear indication that the overall quality of forensic science provision has not improved in the perception of forensic science professionals, notwithstanding that budgets may have been reduced and \nsome \ntesting may have \nbecome \nmore focused.  It is our direct experience that forensic science strategies applied to cases (which drive the forensic provision) are not always \neffective \nand often result in wasted resources.  \nWe \nalso \nobserve many cases in which important forms of forensic examination and analysis have been omitted\n when they should not have been\n.  While the relationship that now exists between police forces and forensic science providers \nmay be more focused\n on the requirements of police forces, it \nappears to us \nthat the needs of the criminal justice system have not been given appropriate consideration.  We would be happy to provide further information \nor casework examples \nif the Science and Technology Committee considers it appropriate.\nJanuary 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
