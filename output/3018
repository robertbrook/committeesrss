defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Welcome to our first evidence session on the performance of the Department.
default 
defaultJust for our record, if you all could just give your name and your position, that would be a good start.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Bob 
defaultKerslake
default, Permanent Secretary of the Department, and Head of the Civil Service.
defaultDavid defaultRossingtondefault: David 
defaultRossington
default, Finance Director.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Peter Schofield, Director General for Neighbourhoods.
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: Helen Edwards, Director General for Localism.
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: Mike Pitt of the Planning Inspectorate.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Andy Rose, Chief Executive of the Homes and Communities Agency.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Thank you all for coming; you are all most welcome.
default 
defaultWe understand there may be a vote on the programme motion at some point, so it is likely we are going to have to interrupt
default the sitting
default—
defaultto suspend and come back again
default—
defaultbut we will deal with that issue when we get to it.
default 
defaultCan we begin by looking at the focus of the Department, how it is changing, and the skills that are needed?
default 
defaultClearly, it appears that the work the Department is doing now is much more commercially focused than it might have been a few years ago.
default 
defaultDoes that need, and is it getting, a change in the skills that are available within the Department?
default 
defaultMaybe, in the future, would we assume that the Permanent Secretary might come with a commercial background?
default 
defaultIs that the sort of change we might anticipate?
default 
defaultI am not suggesting any time soon, of course.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Let me say first of all, Chair, that you are absolutely right to say that we are seeing a significant change in the way in which the Department works.
default 
defaultWe have calculated that, by 2015, the financial instruments will constitute potentially up to £15.7
default&#xa0;
defaultbillion in terms of spend, so there is undoubtedly a shift in the Department, and it is away from predominantly 
defaultgrant
default­
defaultgiving
default and towards an investment model much more linked to a return on that investment, and therefore a commercial decision.
default 
defaultFirst of all, I think it is right to say that we are changing.
default 
defaultSecondly, have we clocked this, and are we taking it very seriously?
default 
defaultAbsolutely.
default 
defaultIt is clearly a priority for the whole of the team to deal with this issue.
default 
defaultLet me just give you a few examples of what we are doing here: we have developed what we call a commercial core skills programme
default. 
defaultWe have now run that programme twice, first in March and then in July, and we have seen 130 on the first course and 220 on the second.
default 
defaultWe are going to go beyond that and run an enhanced programme to a higher level of skills in November.
default 
defaultWe have brought in commercial expertise from outside, so we have a couple of people with a background of commercial expertise.
default 
defaultWe are in the process of completing a review organised with the Shareholder Executive to specifically focus on how we manage this new portfolio of investments
default. 
defaultWe have quite a wide range of activity, which includes, actually, the Homes and Communities Agency taking on a strengthened role in relation to investments.
default 
defaultJust on your last point, it is perfectly conceivable that we would have a Permanent Secretary with a commercial background.
default 
defaultI have, as you know, done a number of commercial deals both in local government and in the Homes and Communities Agency, but it is also worth saying that Andy himself comes from a commercial banking background.
default 
defaultWe have expertise in the Department, but, as I said earlier, a lot of expertise in the Homes and Communities Agency as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I will come back to the Homes and Communities Agency in just a minute.
default 
defaultClearly, one of the biggest changes is the guarantees that the Department is going to be giving in housing, both in the social rented and private rented sector.
default 
defaultSpecifically, did the Department look at the skills that would be needed to manage that, and did you bring in particular expertise to deal with that, or to re-skill people who are already there?
default 
defaultThat is a massive programme, and potentially there is a major cost if it all goes wrong.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We have done both, in effect.
default 
defaultWe have both brought in expertise to help us with some of the guarantees, and, of course, created the task force that you will be aware of in the Department.
default 
defaultWe have appointed a number of 
defaultsecondees
default to work on this area, and we also look to strengthen the capability of our existing staff within the Department.
default 
defaultWe are doing both in relation to the guarantees, and we have also created
default a credit c
defaultommittee, where we will establish a much stronger governance of this area in order to ensure that every decision is properly assessed for the level of risk involved.
default 
defaultYou will know
default that
default, for the affordable housing 
defaultguarantees, we have taken on a contract in order to establish an aggregator for that work.
default 
defaultI do not know if, Peter, you
default want
default to add anything to that.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Just to add to that, as Sir Bob just said, for the affordable housing guarantee scheme
default—which is potentially up to half of the
default £10 billion
default—
defaultwe have got an agreement with Affordable Housing Finance, which is a subsidiary of the Housing Finance Corporation.
default 
defaultThis is going to be acting as an aggregator, and it has been doing the first round of due diligence before proposals come forward to the credit committee.
default 
defaultThe credit committee is partly staffed by existing members of staff in the Department, but we have also brought in some expertise with a banking background to sit on that credit committee.
default 
defaultThe credit committee will also be there to assess proposals that come forward for the private rented guarantee scheme, so it is a combination of the two.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just picking up on the outside expertise, recognising that salaries in the commercial sector, and particularly the finance sector, are often very much higher than they are in the public sector, are you going to have to pay more to get this expertise in?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: So far, we have managed to make quite a lot of progress by prevailing on the banks themselves to give us secondments in to do pieces of work, so it has not cost huge amounts of additional cost to the Department.
default 
defaultObviously, as Peter said, the advice on the credit committee will be advisory rather than necessarily full
default­
defaulttime, but obviously one of the things we will have to look at
default, 
defaultas we move forward and as the 
defaultportfolio grows, 
defaultis the nature and mix of the staff that we have.
default 
defaultWhat I am clear about is that whatever we do there, we will stay within our overall budget and staffing numbers.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But you could see some people get paid an awful lot more in order to attract the right people in?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We will clearly look at this issue of ensuring we have got the right people, and we will look at the market salaries.
default 
defaultWe will aim to get people in as 
defaultcost
default­
defaulteffectively
default as we can, and there is good evidence in other parts of Government, like the Shareholder Executive, that people are willing to come in to central Government, because of the nature of the work, at lower salaries that they might have commanded in the private sector.
default 
defaultThat is something we will look at in more detail.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I will just turn to Mr Rose for a second.
default 
defaultClearly, you have been mentioned in terms of the particular skills that you are bringing to the HCA.
default 
defaultDid you find a skills gap there that you needed to fill?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: No.
default 
defaultMy first impression was actually very positive about the skills.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I suppose I might ask, then, what the point was of bringing you in.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: I applied for the job that was offered, because I thought it was a fascinating opportunity.
default 
defaultThat was my role.
default 
defaultAs I say, I am impressed with the skills.
default 
defaultI think what Sir Bob was identifying was the scale of some of these programmes, and that they have the potential to increase quite significantly: you identified the guarantee scheme.
default 
defaultMy own view was that it was absolutely appropriate to ask a body like the Shareholder Executive to look at the skills sitting across the Department and the HCA to see what is required in terms of taking these programmes forward, but I think there are some very good skills in the HCA.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default I would like to ask some questions about the fact that, for the first time, you have had the accounts qualified, and you have not got an unqualified arrangement.
default 
defaultYou are up there with 
defaultBarroso
default, so congratulations.
default 
defaultI never thought that the Department would be in the same state as 
defaultEurope
default and the Commission.
default 
defaultIt is astonishing.
default 
defaultWhat is your feeling of how that came about?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Let me say, first of all, that it was very disappointing that we had these qualifications.
default 
defaultWe took the qualifications very seriously; we have conducted two internal audit reviews of the areas where we had qualifications.
default 
defaultWe have looked at them in depth, and identified how and where we need to improve how we operate.
default 
defaultI would make two points, not in any sense to reduce the significance of the qualification.
default 
defaultIt is worth saying first of all that there was no issue here of either spending outside budget or spending inappropriately that led to these qualifications.
default 
defaultThey both related to particular forms of parliamentary control totals that we breached, and those bring with them an automatic qualification.
default 
defaultThat was inevitable, but it is important to be very clear that there was no issue of either a breach in budgets or spending inappropriately.
default 
defaultI would ask David to say a few more words, if I can.
default 
defaultDavid defaultRossingtondefault: 
defaultL
defaultet me underline that point
default: t
defaulthere were two breaches.
default 
defaultThe first was to do with cash, and that was caused by not taking account of a payment that moved over from one financial year to another.
default 
defaultWe were monitoring our cash right through the year, actually very well; we were very high on the 
defaultWhitehall
default league table, but we did not have the processes in place to take account of the overhang cash from the previous year.
default 
defaultAs soon as we became aware of that, which was late in the year, we managed down spending so that the overall breach was £55 million rather than
default what it could have been—
defaultas high as £340 million.
default 
defaultThen, as Sir Bob has said, we immediately conducted an audit report and had a look at exactly what went wrong.
default 
defaultWe have got recommendations there; they will all be implemented by the end of this month, so that we do not get a recurrence.
default 
defaultThe other breach was in relation to local government 
defaultDEL
default, and that was caused by two arm’s-length bodies spending more on capital than was set out in their control total.
default 
defaultOnce again, there was no overspend overall in either of those agencies.
default 
defaultOnce again, we immediately conducted an audit investigation of what went wrong, and there were really two things that came out of that: first of all, a need for greater awareness of 
defaulthow G
defaultovernment accounting works in the arm’s-length bodies, and secondly, a need for better liaison between the Department and those arm’s-length bodies.
default 
defaultWe are actually centralising in our finance function the arrangements for sponsoring the smaller arm’s-length bodies in the departments, again, to prevent any recurrence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default No overall overspend, two technical breaches, so nobody gets sacked?
defaultDavid defaultRossingtondefault: There are clearly systemic problems here, and it was not a case of individuals wilfully doing things wrong.
default 
defaultThe system was wrong; we have looked hard at that, and we want to put it right.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default A final thing, then: as another knock-on effect, with the retention of business rates, you are now going to be withholding £120 million from local councils, which they had not expected to be the case.
default 
defaultThey would be expecting more like £50 million, or something like that.
default 
defaultIt is a huge jump, and although, if it all works out all right, that money
default—or what is left to it—will go back to the councils, how can
default councils budget when decisions like that are being made?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I think you are talking about decisions that
default relate to judg
defaultments about how much we might retain for specific initiatives like the transformation budget.
default 
defaultWe have signalled them well in advance of them happening, and we have sought, wherever possible, to keep holdbacks to a minimum.
default              defaultHeather Wheeler:default It is an additional £95 million holdback.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: In the context of total funding under the 
defaultDEL
default of £25 billion, it is a relatively small amount, and we have sought to do it only where we think there is a specific need and where we want to
default, as I touched on, 
defaultincrease the level of funding to promote and support transformation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default With respect, it might be a small amount to you, but to district councils it is £100,000, £200,000, £300,000 or £400,000.
default 
defaultThat is a huge amount of money that is being held back from them, which they were not expecting and that they have not budgeted for.
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: Some of the money we hold back is to help authorities.
default 
defaultFor example, on business rate retention, we hold back £50 million in case local authorities do not get the rate income that they expect when an employer goes bust, or something like that.
default 
defaultSome of that is there to help people, and it does make its way back into the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default But that is only after.
default 
defaultThey have set 
defaultfive
default­
defaultyear
default budgets.
default 
defaultThey have now had 20% taken off them, and they have got to start all over again; otherwise the rates go up 9%.
default 
defaultThat is not going to happen, is it?
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: As part of the settlement, we did set out for each local authority, as a result of the latest spending round, what their figures were for 2015-2016, so that they would have time to plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default Yes, they have been given three months to plan for a five-year budget that is 20% down on what they thought it was going to be.
default 
defaultThis is very serious for district councils.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Nobody would suggest that the settlement overall is not challenging.
default 
defaultThat is true across the whole of the public sector, but I do not think
default—
defaultand this is the point I was seeking to make
default—that the challenge faced by local government
default relates specifically to the issue of holdback.
default 
defaultWe have only sought to hold back in very particular circumstances related to the safety net, which Helen spoke about, the need to promote transformation of local authority services in order to deliver the savings, and specifically in relation to the troubled families initiatives.
default 
defaultThese are relatively small amounts done in order to tackle particular needs and promote particular agendas around greater efficiency and greater transformation of services.
default 
defaultTaken as a whole, we have actually reduced a lot of the 
defaultring
default­
defaultfencing
default and direct specification of funding inside local government.
default 
defaultIf you compare that against the amount by which we reduced 
defaultring
default­
defaultfencing
default and specific grants, that would far outweigh whatever we have done in relation to 
defaultholdback
default.
default              defaultHeather Wheeler:default Chairman, indulge me.
default 
defaultWhen was the last time any of you guys sat down and helped set a district council’s budget for five years?
default 
defaultI would think it is probably some time ago, if at all.
default 
defaultGiving them three months’ notice of another 20% cut really 
defaultdoesn’t
default fly, ladies and gentlemen.
default It really doesn’
defaultt.
default 
defaultI am not talking about 
defaultunitaries
default; I am not talking about 
defaultmet
default; I am talking about districts.
default Okay?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default In 2011, the Secretary of State said, “The ERDF programme has been plagued by a legacy of poor administration and fines that dates back to 2000.
default 
defaultThe Coalition Government has overhauled the management of these schemes, bringing them in-house, and successfully minimising the liabilities.”
default 
defaultImagine our surprise when we learned in May 2013 that the European Commission has imposed payment interruption, blaming inadequate management checks and lost files.
default 
defaultCould you explain what happened, or what difficulties you met?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Shall I try and address that one?
default 
defaultThere are two broad issues here.
default 
defaultOne is to do with the level of the liabilities
default, which
default have come down very dramatically, and Mr 
defaultRossington
default can say more to the Committee about that in a moment.
default 
defaultIn terms of the interruption, the original issues that were raised by the auditors have all been addressed, and the auditors themselves have accepted that.
default 
defaultThey have now raised a new issue about the design of our systems, despite this never having been an issue in the past over the course of what is obviously a seven-year programme starting in 2007.
default 
defaultHowever, we are working very closely with them.
default 
defaultWe are in dialogue with them on a regular basis, looking at ways to address the concerns that they have raised, and we are looking to see the interruption lifted as soon as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Could I ask you whether you are being helped 
defaultor 
defaulthindered by the abolition of the RDAs here, in terms of lost expertise?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Let me come in on that one.
default 
defaultActually, the systems now are more consistent across the country, more effective, more accurate and more reliable than they were before.
default 
defaultWhat we had before was variation
default—
default              defaultChair:default Sir Bob, could I just ask you to speak up a little bit?
default 
defaultIt is just a bit difficult to hear
default.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: What I was saying was that what we inherited was a set of very different, varying models of handling ERDF across the RDAs, and what we have been able to do, as a consequence of it coming into the Department, is to establish a consistent approach to this.
default 
defaultThat has tack
defaultl
defaulted a lot of the issues.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default But would you say it has been a learning curve?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: It has inevitably been a learning curve, bringing it together and establishing the common systems, and indeed some of the issues being raised by the Commission
default—
defaultI think Peter can confirm this
default—
defaultrelate to issues that are still there from the previous model.
default 
defaultI would say that we have now developed a much more consistent and robust system of handling ERDF.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Have you been helped or hindered by the Government’s willingness to extend the boundaries over which ERDF is distributed regionally, or has that not impacted?
default 
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I do not think that has at all impacted on this particular issue.
default 
defaultAs I say, we have tightened the systems, but there are clearly issues that the Commission want us to address.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default When do you expect the interruption to be lifted?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We are looking to see the interruption lifted as soon as possible.
default 
defaultAs I say, we have now, to the auditors’ satisfaction, addressed all of the issues that they first raised.
default 
defaultThere are another set of issues around our systems that they have recently raised, and we are in active dialogue with them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Despite the interruption, do you think you are going to spend all of the ERDF?
default 
defaultNot fully spending the ERDF has obviously been the big problem for years.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We are confident.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default You are confident you will spend all of it.
default 
defaultThere was going to be an England-wide evaluation in 2012, was there not, with implementation reports?
default 
defaultIt has not appeared yet.
default 
defaultIs it going to appear soon?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: There are 10 annual implementation reports that are produced each year
default—10 because there are 10 programmes.
default 
defaultW
defaulte send that to the Commission for assessment in June, which we did, and we plan to send them to the Committee once the Commission have assessed them all.
default 
defaultSo far, four have been assessed and approved; 
defaultthere are 
defaultsix remaining to do, and we plan to send them to the Committee as soon as we have got all 10 approved.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default The estimate for write-offs, disallowances and financial corrections, I think, is something like £73 million.
default 
defaultIs that still correct?
defaultDavid defaultRossingtondefault: The figures for the 2000 to 
default2006 scheme are that more than £100
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion out of a total spend of £3.7 billion had to be written off.
default 
defaultThere is still £8 million that is potentially alive in the Department.
default 
defaultIf you look at th
defaulte 2007 to 
default2013 scheme
default—i.e. the current scheme—
defaultthe figures are much less.
defaultJohn Pugh:default So, in percentage terms, it is better.
defaultDavid defaultRossingtondefault: Much better.
default 
defaultThe potential liabilities at the moment are £8.6
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion.
default 
defaultWe paid a self-correction of £5 million earlier in the year, and that is obviously a lot less for a scheme that is still £2.8 billion in total value.
default              defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default We have had a briefing from the National Audit Office, and they have talked about their report on the financial sustainability of local authorities.
default 
defaultYou, Sir Bob, have spoken about the challenges that local authorities face.
default 
defaultWhilst they did not exactly speak about the potential for financial disaster, they did speak about things being riskier than ever before in terms of local government finances.
default 
defaultWhat action would you take in the event of widespread financial failure in local government, Sir Bob?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: First of all, I think I should say that we do not think there will be widespread financial failure.
default 
defaultWe have good evidence about the management of resources by local authorities that, I think, backs that view up.
default 
defaultOur view is that we are much more likely to face individual authorities where issues arise, and we have a number of tools at our disposal to help those individual authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Just before you go on to those tools, to be clear, the National Audit Office said that they raised this in a particular report because
default—I got the impression—
defaultthey thought it more likely than ever before that there was going to be financial failure in local authorities, and they said that it was local authorities that were raising it with them.
default 
defaultWhilst you might not think it, local authorities clearly do think it, because they have raised it with the National Audit Office.
default 
defaultThey also said that it was an increase in the demand for services that was putting local authorities under more severe pressure, but tell us what the tools are that you would use if it occurs.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Just dealing with that point about demand, we are absolutely alive to some of the pressures on local authorities.
default 
defaultIn particular, we know about the rising cost of adult care, and that is why
default, as you know, the Government have put £3.8 billion into funding across the health and care
default sector: to seek to address some of these pressures and to change the way services operate.
default 
defaultWe are acutely aware of those rising areas of demand, and we have taken action to assist local authorities in dealing with them.
default 
defaultIn terms of specific authorities, we have, obviously, the accounts produced by those authorities.
default 
defaultWe have the fact that local authorities are under a legal duty to produce a balanced budget.
default 
defaultWe have considerable information from a range of different forms of inspectors who go to local authorities, and we have good intelligence from our localities teams, who go and talk to local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Sorry, Bob.
default 
defaultThat is all about the monitoring; I understand that, but my question is what you would do in the event of widespread financial failure.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: As I say, I do not think we believe there will be widespread financial failure.
default 
defaultWe have powers to intervene in relation to specific authorities when they have difficulties, and they have
default—very rarely, but have—been used.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default We were told about Section 30, or something, where you can intervene and provide a grant to the local authority.
default 
defaultIs that right?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We have a power to fund, and we have the power to support them in capitalising the expenditure.
default 
defaultUltimately, we have the power to intervene and take over services, as has happened, but that has not been required in very many cases.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default How close have you come to using any one of those powers in the last 12 months?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: In terms of capitalisation, that has been a feature of a number of years where we have allowed local authorities to bid for the ability to capitalise the expenditure.
default 
defaultWe have intervened
default—in a very limited way, 
defaulta
defaults you will be aware, of course—
defaultin 
defaultDoncaster
default.
default 
defaultI do not think there has been an occasion, although I will check with Helen, where we have actually paid a specific grant to a local authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default 
defaultHas
default the number of interventions increased or decreased over the last one, two, or three years?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I do not think they have increased, no.
default 
defaultI can go back and check, but I would not say we have increased what we have done in relation to either capitalisation or anything else.
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Let me move onto my final question.
default 
defaultI noted that the Secretary of State had spoken about chief officers’ pay.
default 
defaultEric Pickles, the Secretary of State, said in the 
defaultDaily Mail
default in March 2012, “It is the height of hypocrisy that you have chief execs at Labour-run authorities awarding themselves bumper pay rises whilst subjecting their staff to a pay freeze.”
default 
defaultI was reading that excellent newspaper, the 
defaultDaily Mail
default, today, and it pointed out that it is proposed to give the 
defaultChief Executive of Rochdale a £40,000 pay rise on Wednesday for this year, so he will get an increase from £130,000 to £170,000.
default 
defaultWhat is the Department’s view of those sorts of pay rises, Sir Bob?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: The Secretary of State has been very clear that local authorities, in a period of quite tight restraint, should be bearing down on senior salaries.
default 
defaultWe are also clear that these are decisions for individual authorities to make, but when they do so, they need to be very transparent about those decisions, and they need to be taken by the full council.
default 
defaultChanges have been made to make that requirement.
default 
defaultWe have not sought to impose a view about these things, but we have been clear that they should be very careful about senior salaries, and they should be very transparent and decisions should be made by the full council.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Would you have concerns about that sort of increase in one year: £40,000, and not performance-related?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: On the face of it, it sounds a very large increase.
default 
defaultI do not know the circumstances of this particular council, so I would not want to comment further.
default              defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default On the point about risk management, I just wondered what role you saw the Department playing in risk management.
default 
defaultYou say you are gathering a lot of data about what is happening on the ground in local authorities, but what do you perceive the role of the Department to be in risk management?
default 
defaultWhat do you do with the data that you collect?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Helen, do you want to come in on that?
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: Part of our role is to assess where local authorities are in terms of the reductions in income and the impact it will have on them.
default 
defaultWe use the data that we get, for example, to try and skew the distribution of the grant to help those who are going to feel the effects to a large extent—so those who are particularly grant-dependent and who are not necessarily going to benefit as much from rates retention, for example.
default 
defaultWe use some of the data to do that.
default 
defaultWe use it in the assessment of spending power.
default 
defaultWe have said that we will not allow authorities’ spending power to fall below a certain amount, so that is our way of working out everything that a council gets by way of income.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default So you see yourself playing a very active role in risk management?
default 
defaultIt is not just that it is interesting information; it will lead you to make specific interventions on local authorities.
default 
defaultIs it an interventionist role for the Department?
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: No, it is not, in that sense.
default 
defaultBy and large, we regard it as the responsibility of local authorities to manage their own affairs and to manage them well, and, by and large, they do manage them very well.
default 
defaultHowever, as Sir Bob was saying, if a local authority appears to be getting into difficulty for whatever reason, there are a number of things that we can do.
default 
defaultOf course, we do work very closely with the Local Government Association, and they do a lot through their peer-led reviews and sector-led support.
default 
defaultThere are a number of ways in which we try to assess what is happening with particular local authorities, and if there is a need for intervention, then we will do it in different ways.
default 
defaultBy and large, it is for them to manage the risk.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: The way I would characterise it is that local authorities want to run their own affairs, and we believe that intervention should be an absolute last resort.
default 
defaultThe thing we do actively is to understand where local authorities are, where they might be running into difficulties, and where we might need to assist them in any way.
default 
defaultIt is about active management of 
defaultthe information, but we would be very reluctant to intervene, unless there were compelling reasons to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Just on that point, my final question is, in terms of the evaluation, 
defaultis there 
defaultin the Department some kind of dashboard that is giving indications of “red, amber, green” across the country, and has the way that you evaluate changed over the last two or three years?
default 
defaultAre you putting more variables and factors into your risk?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I do not think it is the case that we hold a sort of “red, amber, green” assessment of each authority.
default 
defaultIt is much more likely to be comparing of intelligence for a particular authority at a particular point in time.
default 
defaultOur view is that the vast bulk of authorities are, and have been, able to manage their
default affairs effectively and not ge
defaultt themselves in this position.
default 
defaultIndeed, on the latest poll data from the BBC, we see that satisfaction levels have actually gone up in relation to a lot of local authority services.
default 
defaultTaken in the round, local authorities have found efficiencies and managed a quite challenging period pretty well.
default 
defaultWe are much more focused on individual authorities at particular points in time.

defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House.
default 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultOn resuming—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default The whole issue of local authority finance is quite contentious.
default 
defaultWhat normally happens is the local authorities say they are destitute; DCLG say they have given them a king’s ransom, and we argue about the numbers.
default 
defaultThe difficulty we have at the moment, though, is that local authorities present their figures slightly differently than DCLG choose to do.
default 
defaultFor example, I have tabled questions trying to find out exactly how much money has left the 
defaultExchequer 
defaultand gone to my local authority, and all I get back is an answer talking about the spending power.
default 
defaultTherefore, no precise sum is ever given and no agreed numbers are ever arrived at.
default 
defaultIs there anything you can do about that, either by making local authorities present their figures in the same way as you do, or by giving information in a different way?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We do try to come up with a consistent approach to presenting information, and we have now used the spending power calculation for a number of years, but we do not just show spending power.
default 
defaultWe show the changes in relation to direct funding from Government and from business rates for local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default I do not want to belabour the point, but I have asked 
defaultfairly persistently
default in regard to my own local authority in 
defaultSefton
default 
defaultexactly how much money has left the Government
default E
defaultxchequer and gone into the wallets of 
defaultSefton
default.
default 
defaultI have asked that in a range of ways and at different times, and in a series of questions.
default 
defaultI have still not got a figure.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I am very happy to go back and look at those questions and see whether we have done justice to you.
default              defaultJohn Pugh:default If you would, please.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: The point I just wanted to finish on is that we have made quite big changes to the way local government finance works, with the increase in the amount that is retained locally.
default 
defaultThere has been quite a lot of change, and that has often been where people have struggled to see how the numbers all relate to each other.
default 
defaultHelen?
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: Yes.
default 
default70% of local authority income is now raised locally.
default              defaultJohn Pugh:default I understand that.
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: That is a big change.
default 
defaultThat is why we came up with the notion of spending power, because it is looking at the income that people have and not just the money that comes in from central Government.
default 
defaultIf we have not been giving you satisfactory answers, then we must do that.
default              defaultJohn Pugh:default I welcome Sir Bob’s assurance.
default 
defaultI look forward to his answer.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We will have a look at that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just before I pass over to James Morris for the next question: reference was made
default 
defaultto working closely with the LGA.
default 
defaultHowever, Sir Merrick 
defaultCockell
default, on behalf of the LGA, has said—and he is not a man given to hyperbole, I do not think—that the funding of local government in this country, looking forward to the next two years and beyond, is unsustainable.
default 
defaultDoes that wording from the LGA not at least give you the occasional sleepless night?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We take everything that the LGA says very seriously.
default 
defaultWe have had many discussions with them about the impact of the settlement, so we are not in any sense denying the fact that there are some challenges for local government in delivering these numbers, but we do not agree with the view that says it is unsustainable.
default 
defaultThe evidence so far is that local authorities have been very effective in delivering savings.
default 
defaultW
defaulthat we are clear about, though—
defaultthis is one of the reasons why we retained a relatively small amount for the transformation fund—is that delivering this does require local authorities to think radically about how they organise their services.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Does it not give you at least some concern—going back to your old authority of Sheffield—when they show their current spending, and outside the statutory services of adult care and children’s care and then the commitments on contracts, the waste management scheme and the new PFI scheme, what is left is about 15% of their budget; yet, by 2018, they are going to have to make 15% more cuts.
default 
defaultAll that discretionary spend has gone.
default 
defaultIs that not a crisis?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: That suggests that the only areas in which they can secure savings are from that particular discretionary set of budgets.
default 
defaultAs I said earlier, we are looking to work with local authorities through the joint funding we have secured with Health in order to transform the way some of the other services work, including adult care.
default 
defaultWe do not see this as simply a question of looking at discretionary services; you have to look across the board
default at
default the way in which the local authority operates.
default              
defaultChair:default I think that is what the LGA were saying they are doing.
default 
defaultThey are coming up with slightly different answers to you, maybe.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default I wanted to ask some questions of your modelling of the New Homes Bonus.
default 
defaultThe National Audit Office, in their report, said that they had found errors in the Department’s modelling that, when corrected, reduced the estimated number of new homes the bonus would lead 
defaultto by 25%, or 32,000 homes over 10 years.
default 
defaultGiven the importance of the New Homes Bonus as a flagship policy, why were you so wrong?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: If you look at the 
defaultreport in 
defaultdepth that the NAO produced, what it was describing was the original assessment we made in the introduction of the New Homes Bonus.
default 
defaultIt was an estimate of the likely impact, and it gave a range of impacts in terms of the New Homes Bonus.
default 
defaultWe have acknowledged—and we did this at the time—that there was an error made there.
default 
defaultIt was an error in something that was an estimation of what the impact would be, and we now have a scheme in place and so we can see what the impact is.
default 
defaultPeter would be happy to take you through the numbers on that, but it is worth saying that we have also committed to—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Sorry; can I just interrupt?
default 
defaultIn an impact assessment, you are talking about a range of plus or minus 32,000 as an estimate from the Department about a flagship policy.
default 
defaultIs that not something that is rather extraordinary?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We have already said that it was a regrettable error.
default 
defaultWhat I said was that this was an estimated range of impacts, and this clearly did impact on that range, but it did not lead to a view that you would not support the policy or that the policy did not have a justification.
default 
defaultIt still had a net benefit from it in the calculations.
default 
defaultClearly, that benefit was lower in the calculation as a result of this error being corrected, but the point I am making now is that we now have the policy in place; we have taken steps to improve our work on impact assessments to avoid these sorts of errors occurring; and we will do a full evaluation of the New Homes Bonus by Easter of next year.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default How are you going to make sure that your next set of estimates is not so wildly wrong?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: As I said, we have reviewed the way in which we do these calculations.
default 
defaultWe have added a further step in the process within the Department to 
defaultquality
default­
defaultassure
default these exercises, so that we reduce the risk of any error of this sort occurring.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Through the single local growth fund, there has clearly been some top-slicing of the New Homes Bonus occurring, to the tune of about £400
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion, I think.
default 
defaultI presume that you have estimated the impact of that on local authority funding and the number of new builds that may emerge out of the New Homes Bonus?
default 
defaultIs that a factor in your calculations?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Again, we have just done a consultation on this issue.
default 
defaultWe have heard back on local authorities on the potential impact, but it is important to say that this money is 
defaultimportant
default to local areas.
default 
defaultWhat we have said is that it should be pooled and determined by the local enterprise partnerships, which of course, as you know, include representation from the local authorities.
default 
defaultThis money has not been top-sliced and brought back to 
defaultG
defaultovernment; it is money that remains in the local area to invest in local growth initiatives.
default 
defaultI do not know if Peter wanted to add anything to that.
default 
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: One of the questions we have asked in the consultation is exactly how this process shou
defaultld be done—
defaulthow to ensure that that localisation works and that pooling works in a way that still enables local authorities to achieve their growth objectives.
default 
defaultAs Sir Bob said, that consultation finished on 19 September, and we will be coming back with a response to that in due course.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Would you have chosen this top-slicing as being a suitable modification to the New Homes Bonus policy when you first launched the policy?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: The important thing is using the money in
default a way that helps to reinforce l
defaultocal 
defaulte
defaultnterprise 
defaultp
defaultartnerships locally.
default 
defaultOne of the positive effects of the pooling will be that it really does bind in local authorities to the priorities that are developed through the strategic economic plans by 
defaultl
defaultocal 
defaulte
defaultnterprise 
defaultp
defaultartnerships, and we will be seeing some of that as they produce their strategic economic plans over the coming years.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Have a number of local authorities not been planning on the basis of a particular level of the New Homes Bonus, which they are effectively not going to have control over?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: 
defaultOne of the questions we have asked, as I say, in the consultation is about how you might deal with commitments for the year 2015-2016, which is the year that this is referring to.
default 
defaultWe will respond as part of the consultation response in the light of representations made.
default 
defaultCrucially, what this enables is local enterprise partnerships to respond to the growth priorities of all of the local authorities in their area, and, in a way, that aspect of this is quite a positive development.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: It is worth seeing it in context.
default 
defaultBetween now and 2021, the effect of the decisions that the Government made will bring something like £17 billion into the direct responsibility of local enterprise partnerships, which, in turn, will drive local growth and benefit all the local authorities in those areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Just a final question, 
defaultwhile we are
default talking about growth: I think, Sir Bob, you are the accounting officer of the Regional Growth Fund.
default 
defaultYou were criticised for failing to complete an impact assessment for the Regional Growth Fund.
default 
defaultHow do you respond to the criticism?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We clearly have done impact assessments for all new funding initiatives.
default 
defaultThe Regional Growth Fund—this was right back at the inception of the fund—had an issue about the timing of that, and we have acknowledged that in an ideal world you would undertake such impact assessments.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default The NAO have said that “the Fund’s management board did not translate the 
defaultf
defaultund’s high-level objectives into quantified, measurable success criteria for the Fund as a whole, nor were timescales for its expected impact established.”
default 
defaultDo you accept that criticism?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Clearly, we have accepted the NAO report in its entirety, so we would accept that more could have been done on that issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Just moving on to permitted developments, and the new role of local authorities and neighbourhood consultation, the Government announced that they were going to change the rules on this in September last year, and then i
defaultncluded those rules i
defaultn the Growth and Infrastructure Bill
default. T
defaulthe consultation process was developed during the passage of the Bill over about three days.
default 
defaultHow did you go about assessing the impact of those changes on neighbourhood consultation?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: The introduction of permitted development was based on the analysis that around about 200,000 householder applications are received by local planning authorities every 
defaultyear.
default 
defaultSomething like 90% of them get approved, and routinely they are approved by officials, rather than going to members.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Frequently, they are approved after consultation and after neighbours have put their views in, and then there is a process of mediation that takes place.
default 
defaultThat generally is the case on these smaller extensions.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Many of those points were made during the passage of the Growth and Infrastructure Act, as you say.
default 
default              defaultBob Blackman:default I know; I made them.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Exactly.
default 
defaultThe result of that was that the Government listened to that and introduced, as you say, the neighbourhood consultation arrangements, which are a 
defaultfast
default­
defaulttrack
default approach that achieves all of the positive aspects of the previous regime, while also achieving the 
defaultbenefits
default of a light-touch approach for what are generally the non
default­
defaultcontroversial types of planning applications that come into local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Previously, local authorities would receive a fee for a planning application for a relatively small extension.
default 
defaultThey now receive nothing.
default 
defaultHow have you assessed what the cost will be to local authorities of doing this work, where they are going to be doing it for nothing, as opposed to getting some form of fee, which, I accept, was not necessarily covering the cost of doing it?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Our analysis took into account the fact that by stripping out a large number of applications that were previously received—
defaultBob Blackman:default But they all have to be notified to the local authority, and then the local authority have to ask the neighbours whether they object.
default 
defaultThat is no different 
defaultfrom
default the consultation process that used to take place, effectively.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: The next stage of the operation is much, much reduced.
default 
defaultTo give you an example, in the London Borough of Enfield, they tell us that between May and August, when they gave us these numbers, they had received something like 67 notifications and only something like seven objections in total.
default 
defaultAlthough there will be some objections, the numbers we are talking about are significantly lower than the process that you would have to have done routinely under the old regime.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default 
defaultI
defaultt could be that the local authorities are not consulting properly, which is another consideration.
default 
defaultIn the London Borough of Harrow, 40% of the applications were rejected because neighbours objected to them for very good reasons, so there is a wide disparity right across 
defaultLondon
default and across the South-East.
default 
defaultI accept that outside the South-East, there are probably not the same concerns, but clearly there is going to be an impact on planning authorities in terms of their income and what resources they can apply.
default 
defaultHave you considered how much that will downsize as a result?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We have looked at the fact that the cost side of the equation is also lower, for the reasons I have described.
default 
defaultOur view is that, overall, this should be something that is manageable for local authorities, and for many, the balance will be a net reduction in the overall 
defaultburden that they have from this.
default 
defaultAlso, it is a much quicker, light-touch approach that benefits the applicants as well.
default              
defaultBob Blackman:default This may not benefit the people who live next door to it, which is the main consideration I have.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: But, as I say, they have all the protections that you have described.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default They say that.
default 
defaultIt remains to be seen.
default 
defaultSir Michael, these are new schemes.
default 
defaultWhat application do you see them possibly having in other planning applications that may be coming forward?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: It seems to me that this is most suited to relatively modest developments.
default 
defaultI think that, at the moment, they have struck the right balance in that respect.
default 
defaultOne would want to look very carefully at any view about extending significantly that range of devolved development.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Do you see any effect on your agency as a result of these changes?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: At the moment, the total volume of work coming to the Planning Inspectorate in terms of appeals is easing downwards slowly, by a few 
defaultper cent.
default each year.
default 
defaultI think that is a good sign.
default 
defaultWhether it is going to have a more dramatic effect in due course, I could not say, but at the moment, as I say, there is this very gentle reduction in total numbers of appeals.
default              defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Bob, staff surveys and employee engagement are very important to any organisation; it is a barometer of performance, well
default-
defaultbeing, etc.
default 
defaultLast year, the Department did not do particularly well.
default 
defaultAlthough there has been a slight improvement, its position within the other Departments is
default still at the bottom, or second-
defaultbottom.
default 
defaultLast year, you partly blamed redundancies.
default 
defaultWhat excuses this year?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: There was an increase this year, as you say, on the year before—2% on the year-on-year—and we saw, very encouragingly, improvements 
defaulti
defaultn the specific areas that we had focused on in the Department, such as improving leadership, visibility of the senior management, and so on.
default 
defaultThere were some key areas where we saw quite significant movements in the scores.
default 
defaultBecause we were very keen to focus on this in the Department, we also undertook what we call a Pulse survey, which was a slightly reduced survey but following similar questions, in the summer of this year.
default 
defaultThat Pulse survey, the detail of which we would be very happy to share with you, if you wanted, showed a 5% increase 
defaultin
default staff engagement.
default 
defaultThat, I think, demonstrates good progress.
default 
defaultIt similarly showed that certain areas where we focused have moved by quite significant percentages—that is the individual questions—and it brought us up to a higher figure of 48% 
defaultfor
default our engagement.
default 
defaultThat said, we know we have still got to go further, and we have committed ourselves to seeing if we can achieve year-on-year increases of that order over the next few years.
default 
defaultWe have seen improvements.
default 
defaultThe latest Pulse survey is encouraging, but we know we have got a way to go still.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default When you are sitting here next year, will you be in a much better position than you are now?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: As I said, we have already improved on the year before last.
default 
defaultWe increased it by 2%.
default              defaultJohn Stevenson:default You are still second
default-
defaultbottom.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: If we deliver the increase we expect to see from the Pulse survey, we would hope to add at least another 5% to that number.
default 
defaultThat will move us significantly away from the bottom, but it will not be where we want to be yet.
default 
defaultWhat I hope you will see next year, when you see me here, is further improvement 
defaulti
defaultn the areas we have identified as priorities and a commitment to go further.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Sir Michael, your department has done much, much better compared 
defaultwith
default the Department overall.
default 
defaultWhat lessons can be learned?
default 
defaultWhat benefits or ideas can you pass to Sir Bob that can improve the Department’s performance?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: I am not entirely satisfied with the figures in the Planning Inspectorate either, and all parts of DCLG are working hard to try to improve performance.
default 
defaultI guess it can be different in a smaller organisation; we have about 700 people within the Planning Inspectorate, and it is sometimes easier to have a stronger focus and identity, which can help with the overall results.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default Sir Bob, you have two roles.
default 
defaultCan I ask you just to give me a breakdown of the time spent as head of the Civil Service and time spent as the head of the Department?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I would say the time spent is roughly three days in the job of head of Civil Service and two with the Department, but it does vary enormously between different weeks and different periods.
default 
defaultI have recently increased the amount of time spent on the head of Civil Service job to reflect the scale of the reform agenda, so 
defaultthose are
default broadly the numbers at the moment.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default On that basis, there is an argument or an implication that the role as head of the Department could actually be a part-time job.
default 
defaultWould you agree?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I would say that the job at the moment, obviously, is being done as part of another job as well.
default 
defaultI would not say the job is part-time, because there is a lot of overlap between the two roles.
default 
defaultFor example, I would attend a meeting of the Permanent Secretaries as Permanent Secretary of CLG; I now chair those meetings, so there is quite a lot of overlap between the two roles, but clearly I am doing two roles.
default 
defaultWhat makes that possible is a very strong team that you see around you, and a very strong level of delegation as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default But if you are talking to local government, where there is an emphasis now on sharing chief executives, etc
default., and they have said that the c
defaulthief 
defaulte
defaultxecutive only needs two days a week, would you not argue that perhaps they should marry with another council or just have a part-time 
defaultc
defaulthief 
defaulte
defaultxecutive?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: No.
default 
defaultI would say to them, “You need to make your own decisions on the right way to lead your local authority”.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default That is fine.
default 
defaultHelen, you are the number two.
default 
defaultDo you think that the Department requires a full
default­
defaulttime Permanent Secretary, or not?
defaultHelen Edwardsdefault: I think we have a good arrangement at the moment.
default 
defaultAs Sir Bob said, we are a good, strong team.
default 
defaultThere are certain things that we can take on for him that he used to do personally within the Department, but he is very much a presence within the Department.
default 
defaultI do not think he feels part-time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Stevenson:default I do not know whether to comment on that.
default 
defaultFinally, there is a lot about City Deals, and as one council leader said about the City Deals, there is clearly a turf war going on.
default 
defaultThe Cabinet Office tells us one thing, and then BIS tells us something else; we meet a Minister, and they tell us a further thing.
default 
defaultYou are the head of the Civil Service, and you are also head of this Department.
default 
defaultWhat is happening?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I think City Deals have been a success, and the core cities that were the front-runners on that would testify to that.
default 
defaultWe are now in the second wave of City Deals, and good progress is being made.
default 
defaultThe Departments work very closely together.
default 
defaultI, as you rightly say, am the accounting officer for the City Deals across Government, and I meet on a regular basis with the Departments involved to reach a shared view on the issues involved.
default 
defaultThese are negotiations, so inevitably issues will arise, but taken as a whole it has been a success.
default 
defaultWe have made good progress, and we work very collaboratively on these deals.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That has not answered the question, has it, really?
default 
defaultThere is a turf war going on, is there not
default? T
defaulthat is why a decision has not been reached on the second round of City Deals.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I do not think there is a turf war going on.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default When is the decision going to be announced?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: The City Deals in the second wave will not be announced as one batch.
default 
defaultThey will be announced as we reach conclusions on the deals.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default When do we get the first one announced?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We have already had the first one, in fact, with the 
defaultPreston
default deal.
default 
defaultI can say categorically that the process of negotiation was not held up through turf wars between Government Departments.
default 
defaultIt was about reaching the right deal.
default              
defaultChair:default We can feed that back to all of the authorities awaiting a decision, then, and say it is down to them.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: No, I am saying it is down to them and us completing the negotiations.
default 
defaultThese are meant to be deals, so we are looking for something from them, and they are looking for something from us.
default 
defaultThey take time; they have to be individually negotiated, but we are making good progress on a lot of those deals, and I expect us to make good progress in the next six months.
default              defaultChair:default We will watch that.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Just going back to HR issues, you ended up in court with the PCS trade union over check-off of union subs.
default 
defaultWhat was the cost to the Department for legal fees, etc?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We think the cost will be in the order of £40,000.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Not the £100,000 that has been suggested?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I am not sure where the £100,000 came from.
default              defaultSimon Danczuk:default I
defaultn terms of time.
default 
defaultNot just what you have paid out—if you have paid out—but in terms of internal person hours, etc.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I can only give you the figure that I can estimate.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default And what is that?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: It is the £40,000 that we will incur in legal costs.
default 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default That is legal costs to external bodies?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Yes.
default 
defaultIn effect, because we lost the court case, we will need to pay to PCS.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default What are their costs on top of that, then?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: No, that is the figure.
default 
defaultWe obviously currently have not finalised that, yet.
default 
defaultWe are still in discussions with them.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Sorry; just to be clear, Sir Bob, there is £40,000 for the costs for PCS trade union.
default 
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Yes, and there is a modest amount of cost for our own time and costs as well.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default You did not seek advice from outside.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We have sought some advice, yes.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default They charged you for that, presumably.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I will give you the figures on that in due course.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default You will come back to us.
default 
defaultThank you.
default 
defaultI appreciate that.
default 
defaultYou sought and received Queen’s Counsel
default advice
default on whether to fight this case.
default 
defaultIs it right to say that that advice was not to proceed, and not to fight it?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I am not going to comment on individual advice that the Department has.
default 
defaultThe Ministers felt it was right to make this change and pursue this issue, and in court cases, you win some and sometimes you lose some.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default But the Queen’s Counsel advice was not to fight it.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: As I said, I am not going to comment on Queen’s Counsel advice, whether it was positive or negative.
default 
defaultIt is not appropriate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Finally, Sir Bob, am I right in saying that a letter has been issued from your HR department stating that—I am summarising—although Ministers accept the High Court decision, they still have the intention to remove 
defaultcheck
default­
defaultoff
default?
default 
defaultIs that right?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: It is still their desire, and they have been very clear.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Has a letter to that effect been issued?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I have not got the precise letter we sent to staff in front of me, but let me just be clear where the Department stands.
default 
defaultThe view of Ministers is unambiguous that they think it is inappropriate to provide the facility of 
defaultcheck
default­
defaultoff
default.
default 
defaultThat is their position.
default 
defaultThey recognise that a court case has been had and the judgement has been reached, and clearly we are going to abide 
defaultby the outcome of that court case, but it does not change their view.
default 
defaultWhere change can be made on this, they are considering making changes in relation to new staff and 
defaultpromotees
default.
default 
defaultThat is the position.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default And a letter to that effect has gone out to staff?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Yes.
default              defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably, Sir Bob, you thought t
defaulthat expenditure was appropriate;
default otherwise you would have asked the Min
defaulti
defaultster to issue you with a direction.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: It was perfectly appropriate for Ministers to take a view on this issue, and clearly, you cannot be certain what costs will flow in a legal action.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just to come onto a completely different issue, it is not very often when
default we have officials before us Select C
defaultommittees that we are genuinely surprised, but when Mr Ashby came to give evidence as the regulator for social housing, I think we were quite astounded at what he had to say to us.
default 
defaultWe obviously wrote to the Secretary of State, and we understand then that the Secretary of State asked Mr Schofield to follow that up with Mr Ashby to try to seek clarification.
default 
defaultHow far have we got in seeking that clarification?
default 
defaultClearly, it was a very important issue that we raised.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I think Andy is probably best placed to deal with that.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Yes.
default 
defaultI am very aware of the concern that the Committee had, and Mr Ashby has written to you, as Chairman of the Select Committee, and to Peter Schofield.
default 
defaultI think, in those letters, he has given a very clear account of what the Regulation Committee view is and the view of the HCA, and hopefully that letter clears up any understandable concerns that came out of the prior event.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You are quite content, are you, with that response that we received, and the Department is as well?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: I am content with the response in the letter, which highlighted how important we feel financial viability standards are and how we enforce them.
default 
defaultI am content that the letter gives a clear account of that, yes.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Just to endorse that, as you say, Chair, I wrote to Mr Ashby, and Mr Ashby replied.
default 
defaultThe contents of that letter were pretty similar to the contents of his letter to your Committee.
default 
defaultFollowing that, I and the Housing Minister met Mr Ashby to discuss that, and at the end of that we were reassured that what he said in his written evidence gave us all of the comfort we needed in terms of how viability is assessed by the regulator.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So we are going to have a much more open and transparent arrangement in future.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: It is exactly as he set out in his evidence.
default 
defaultIt is, and will continue to be, a very robust approach on viability.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default “Continue to be” is hardly the right wording, is it?
default 
defaultIt certainly has not been in the past, has it?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: The Regulation Committee has clearly seen the report from this Committee, and they are actually meeting this week and will be responding.
default 
defaultThere are certain approaches that they welcome in the Committee’s report.
default 
defaultThey will look at giving earlier information where they have concerns around deteriorating situations.
default 
defaultThere will be elements in the response from the committee that will address the matters raised in the report that was sent to them.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So we are not going to continue with this charade we had before.
default 
defaultBecause that is what it was; we should not dress it up, should we?
default 
defaultWe were being told one thing when it was completely different.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Again, I am very much focusing on the letters and the process that I am witnessing.
default 
defaultThey take any provision of financial viability very seriously and are very robust in how they report it, and I think those were the comments addressed in the letter.
default 
defaultClearly, the Regulation Committee will take this report very seriously and respond very shortly.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The fundamental problem is that we had a throwaway comment, almost—probably not quite throwaway, but an attempt at an explanation by Mr Ashby, who was saying, “If you get into financial difficulties as a housing association, it is down to bad governance anyway, so if I mark them down on governance, that is really the same thing, is it not?”
default 
defaultThat was almost hinted at again in the letter back to the Committee.
default 
defaultIn the end, bad governance can lead to financial problems, but the financial problems themselves should be scored as they are seen, not
default with
default some surrogate on governance being used instead.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Again, it is wrong for me to speak on behalf of the committee, but my understanding, having had several conversations and attended, is that they would agree that it is important to score financial viability as they see it.
default 
defaultI do think they feel that governance plays a very important role, and that often poor governance can lead to poor financial viability, but I think they would agree that financial viability should be scored as it is seen.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Just to add to that, having read Mr Ashby’s oral evidence caused me to want to write the letter that I wrote.
default 
defaultIn the light of his response to me and the follow-up meeting, I was reassured that viability is scored exactly as it should be.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So we are not going to see the problems we had in the past repeat
defaulted
default in the future?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We need to have robust—
default              defaultChair:default What I am trying to get at is whether you simply think that all that is going to happen is more of the same but with different wording, or whether we are actually in the future going to get a change.
default 
defaultThat is what we are after.
default 
defaultIt almost seems like the Department is trying to cover this up now.
default 
defaultAre you signalling that, in the future, we are going to get a change in these arrangements so that if an association is getting into financial difficulties, that will be up-front scored in that way?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Absolutely.
default 
defaultIf a housing association is in financial difficulty, then it needs to be scored as such.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default One of the things that we were told was that an intended review was going to go ahead of what happened with regard to Cosmopolitan, but that the Department was stopping that.
default 
defaultWhat is the truth of that?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: No, a review is under
default 
defaultway.
default 
defaultThere was some discussion about the nature.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Will that be published?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I think we intend to publish that at the end of that, yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default So we can have a copy for the Committee.
default 
defaultI will just turn to Mr Rose for a second.
default 
defaultWe understand that the HCA is now guaranteeing over £20 million of loans for the Home Group.
default 
defaultIs that the case?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: I am not sure.
default 
defaultIt may be under one of the programmes that we run.
default 
defaultAgain, I am not sure of that specific transaction.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It just seemed that it was maybe flagging up another issue of concern, if guarantees are having to be found for one housing association’s loans.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: We have a number of programmes across the HCA that we run.
default 
defaultThe guarantees would tend to be under the Affordable Homes Guarantee programme, so I would need to see the specifics of where we are providing a specific guarantee.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default It is the DCLG’s annual report and accounts that says that.
default 
defaultThat is where we got the information from.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: I joined the 
defaulta
defaultgency less than six months ago, so I am very happy to look into that and see the specifics of that transaction.
defaultChair:default You will come back on that.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Sure.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default We had Mary 
defaultPortas
default at this Committee a few weeks ago, and it left me with the impression that she had been somewhat neglected by your Department.
default 
defaultShe went on to say, “It has also been quite tough for me personally to be on the receiving end of it.
default 
defaultThere have been times when I have had to be answerable to the press and the Government has been silent on that.
default 
defaultI would have liked a bit more support.”
default 
defaultDo you have a d
defaultuty of care to G
defaultovernment advisers, Sir Bob?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I think we do, and I think we feel we have given good support to Mary 
defaultPortas
default, but, as importantly, to the agenda that she was promoting, which is the improvement of the high streets.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default But in terms of the support to her, and the duty of care—I am talking about a very personal dimension to the support that you provide someone with.
default 
defaultShe obviously feels that she has been left out to dry somewhat.
default 
defaultHow did you care for her?
default 
defaultHow did you protect her and help her?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I would be happy for Peter to come in on the detail here, but we have had extensive discussions and correspondence and so on with Mary 
defaultPortas
default.
default 
defaultThere ha
defaultve been meetings with Ministers and
default with officials, and visits.
default 
defaultIndeed, I think, a visit is happening today 
defaultthat involves the new Minister.
default 
defaultWe feel we have put a considerable amoun
defaultt of effort into supporting her,
default a) because she rightly should be supported wh
defaulten we appoint her as an adviser, 
defaultand b) because the agenda is extremely important to us.
default 
default              
defaultSimon Danczuk:default I have been worried about her, Peter.
default 
defaultPut my mind at rest.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I do not think you should, Mr Danczuk, be worried about it, because I have a team of people who are leading our work on town centres, and they spend a lot of time in discussions.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Supporting Mary?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Hopefully supporting Mary 
defaultPortas
default.
default 
defaultAs Sir Bob has said, the Government ha
defaultve
default accepted the vast majority of her recommendations, and she is also part of the Future High Streets Forum, and she has been involved, as Sir Bob said, in the visit today.
default 
defaultWe see her as very much part of the agenda, and someone we want to work closely with.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Let me move on.
default 
defaultWhat criteria were used to select the 
defaultPortas
default pilots?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: They were based on the bids that we received
default—
defaultwhat they said about the commitment, the leadership and the innovation that was being proposed by each of the local leaders.
default 
defaultThey were assessed, and we awarded 24 
defaultPortas
default pilot awards, and the Mayor of London awarded three within 
defaultLondon
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default I will come onto those in a second.
default 
defaultWho in Government gave the express permission for the Channel 4 TV programmes to be made?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Obviously, Mary 
defaultPortas
default had her arrangement with Channel 4.
default 
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I do not think it was an issue for us to give express permission.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Permission was not given?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: As I say, I do not think it was for us to give permission on it.
default 
defaultWhat we wanted to be sure about was that her role as an adviser was not in any way affected by the programme, and that was the issue.
default 
defaultIt is not for us to give specific approval.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default There are a lot of people out there who think the two clash, are there not, Bob?
default 
defaultYou are saying 
defaultthat did not need to
default happen, but a good proportion of people think there has been a conflict of interest
default, because of
default this TV programme being made and the fact that the Government have awarded these pilot projects to various local areas.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Obviously, we ensured that there was no conflict of interest.
default 
defaultI can assure the Committee that Mary 
defaultPortas
default had no involvement in the decisions that were taken as to which areas should be successful as 
defaultPortas
default pilots.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default On that point, you mentioned the Greater London Authority.
default 
defaultI am referring to a report in that excellent newspaper, the 
defaultGuardian
default, where David Morris, who is a civil servant in your Department, is emailing the TV producers—the programme-makers—saying “I have told them you are interested in 
defaultRoman Road
default! … Are Ch4 interested in any of the others?”
default 
defaultThat is 
defaultwhat he is saying.
default 
defaultWhy is the civil servant asking the programme-makers which areas or localities they are interested in?
default 
defaultWhy is a civil servant asking that question?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I am afraid, Mr Danczuk, I do not know the precise context of the emails, but I can assure the Committee that neither Channel 4 nor Mary 
defaultPortas
default had any involvement in the decisions about which were the pilots.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default You do not know why one of your civil servants would be asking that question.
default 
defaultDo you think it is unreasonable?
default 
defaultDo you think that the public will be suspicious of why he is asking that question?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I can entirely understand why the newspaper in question might have asked questions about it.
default 
defaultI can come back to the Committee with the precise context.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk: defaultI
defaultt is not like this conversation has not been had, is it?
default 
defaultThe Select Committee, when Mary came before it, debated it.
default 
defaultThere has been a lot of press coverage around the relationship between Channel 4, Mary 
defaultPortas
default and the Department, and who chose the pilots.
default 
defaultIt is no good coming here and giving the impression that it is fresh and new and you are curious and interested in what the newspaper has asked.
default 
defaultWhy is a civil servant asking which areas Channel 4 would prefer?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: There are two different points here.
default 
defaultThe question you raise, or the suggestion you are raising, is that, in some way or another, Mary 
defaultPortas’s
default involvement in the programmes gave her a role in relation to the selection of the pilots.
default 
defaultIt did not; the pilots were selected separately, and our concern as a Department was to ensure that we had a robust, fair and vigorous process for the selection of the pilots, and that is what we did.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default But one of your civil servants involved in the process is asking which areas Channel 4 would prefer.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: That email was not in relation to a decision about the pilot.
defaultSimon Danczuk:default So you are going to come back to us on that.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I will come back to you.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default My final question, then—it is a simple yes
default&#x2011;
defaultor
default&#x2011;
defaultno
default question—is whether the Department was aware that Mary 
defaultPortas
default was receiving £500,000 from Channel 4 for producing the programmes about the pilots.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I am not sure that she—
default              
defaultSimon Danczuk:default It is a simple yes-or-no question.
default 
defaultYou were either aware of £500,000 going to Mary 
defaultPortas
default, your adviser, or you were not.
default 
defaultYes or no?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I was not personally aware.
default 
defaultI do not know if Peter was.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultSimon Danczuk:default Peter, were you aware?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: No.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We will check back in the Department whether there was an awareness.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default We heard some evidence about risk management and modelling in earlier questions.
default 
defaultI want to ask about the risk management modelling that was done before Help to Buy was introduced, and specifically the 20% significantly 
defaultinterest
default­
defaultfree
default loan that the Government is giving on the first part.
default 
defaultWhat modelling was done, and what assumption was made, about the future direction of house prices, given that house prices have historically been very difficult to predict?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: The Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced off the back of the previous First Buy scheme, which equally offered an equity loan.
default 
defaultI would argue that it is not a free loan; it is an equity loan, so the value of the loan appreciates in line with the value of the property.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default That is the critical point: what happens in respect of new properties?
default 
defaultMany new properties are sold, and immediately they are worth 5% less than the purchase price, so what would happen if somebody were to redeem their Help to Buy loan very early on 
defaulton
default a new property?
default 
defaultWould that not involve some form of loss to the Government?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Not in that case, of course, because a Help to Buy equity loan requires a 5% deposit by the borrower.
default 
defaultI would also add on that that what we have seen coming into the housing market is an increase in confidence, some increase in transactions, and small increases in prices, and what we are seeing is Help to Buy being one of the factors that is helping to provide greater confidence into the housing market.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Going back to my original question, then, what change in house prices did you allow for in your modelling when you brought the proposal forward?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We looked at a range of modelling, with house prices staying constant or, indeed, going up.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default What does your model tell you about house prices over the next five years?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: The point that Peter is making is that we did not make an assumption about where prices would go: what we did was a sensitivity analysis, to look at what would happen in terms of our investments if they went up and what would happen if they went down.
default 
defaultThat analysis then formed part of the risk assessment, which in turn addressed the issue of what we would need to cover within our budgets to cover any potential losses.
default 
defaultIt was not about the question of predictions on house prices.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default By how much would house prices need to rise for there to be no loss at all to the Government from the scheme?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: As I say, remember that the scheme requires the borrower to put down a deposit of 5%, and that is the thing that takes the first hit in any price reduction.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Why, in that case, is the Scrutiny Unit of the House of Commons saying that—and I quote—“the Government is relying on house prices of new-build properties included in the scheme rising by two thirds over 25 years (2% per year) to cover its own borrowing costs?”
default 
defaultDo you disagree with that?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I have not seen that particular report.
default 
defaultI would have to look at that to understand what the assumptions are that they are making, but all I would say, Mr 
defaultPawsey
default, is that given the 
defaultstructure of the way that the Help to Buy equity loan scheme works, house prices would have to fall in the case of any individual loan for the Government to take a loss.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Can I put it to you that one of the criticisms of Help to Buy, and particularly the mortgage guarantee scheme coming forward now, is that we are going to get a very significant rise in house prices over the coming years, so those who have concerns about losses to the Government in the short term are misguided
default? 
defaultDo you accept that there might be a bubble, and that prices could rise very quickly over the next year or two?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I do not accept that there is a bubble, for a number of very clear reasons.
default 
defaultWhen you look at what is happening in terms of the number of transactions in the property market at the moment, we are still a considerable way down from where we were back in 2005, and certainly back from where we were in 2007.
default 
defaultLikewise, mortgage approvals are something like half of where they were in 2007 at the moment.
default 
defaultWhat we are seeing—very much as the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club report suggested this morning—is a scheme that is targeted and well-timed.
default 
defaultThat is the equity loan scheme, which has been in place, as you say, since April.
default 
defaultThe mortgage guarantee scheme, which you also referred to in your question, is introduced in January.
default 
defaultI think the Chancellor has been very clear in what he has said about the way in which there will be a role for the Bank of England going forward, on an annual basis, to assess what is happening in terms of demand.
default 
defaultAs I say, where we currently stand, there would be a long way to go before we get anywhere near where we were, for example, in 2007.
default 
defaultIn the event that we do, the Bank of England have a role in advising the Chancellor about criteria in terms of who could be eligible.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default In terms of your modelling of both parts of the scheme, how many new homes do you expect each part to deliver?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I can speak for the equity loan scheme, which is the one that we are responsible for.
default 
defaultWhat we have talked about is providing funding for around about 75,000 new homes over the course of the three years.
default 
defaultI am delighted to say that so far, in the first six months, we have seen 15,000 reservations, so we are on track for quite a considerable uptake and a considerable contribution to new supply.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default I want to ask Sir Michael some questions about planning a little later on, but Sir Bob, we have heard an awful lot from Peter about the schemes and Help to Buy, and it has been very heavily in the news recently.
default 
defaultDo you think we are putting too much emphasis on the demand side of Help to Buy, and not enough on the supply side?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: No.
default 
defaultIt is really important to say that the demand side has had the profile recently in the press, but there is a huge amount going on 
defaulton
default the supply side in relation to large sites, infrastructure, funding, and support by way of affordable housing, so there is a whole raft of things that are happening on the supply side, and have been for a number of years.
default 
defaultI do not think you should see this as an agenda where it is just about the demand side.
default 
defaultI would also say—just adding to Peter’s answer—that what we are seeing now in terms of things like house prices is generally to do with rising market confidence.
default 
defaultIt is not to do with the Help to Buy scheme; that is quite clear.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default So, from your answer, you would suggest that the mix between supply-side initiatives and demand-side initiatives is currently about right?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: The demand side now is strengthening for a whole range of reasons, and we are doing a lot on the supply side that will improve the situation as far as new housing is concerned.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Schofield, I listened very carefully to the answer you gave to Mark 
defaultPawsey
default a minute ago.
default 
defaultYou did not give an answer
default, on
default the other side of the Help to Buy scheme—the mortg
defaultage guarantees—
defaultabout how many new homes would be built in, say, the next 12 or 24 months as a result of that scheme.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: In part because, of course, that scheme is eligible for all transactions, whereas the equity loan scheme is focused entirely on new build.
default 
defaultOne of the things that that scheme will do is promote wider confidence across the housing market
default, as well as promote new house 
defaultbuilding.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Presumably, given your problems with the impact assessments in the past, someone must have done an impact assessment about this new scheme as to what effect it is likely to have on the construction industry.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I think that is a question for the Treasury, as the authors.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default They have not discussed that with you at all.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We have had a number of discussions with them about the scheme, about the scheme rules, about how the—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What about the impact on the construction industry?
default 
defaultHave you had any discussions about that?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: 
defaultWe have had discussions about what this could do in terms of wider confidence into the housing market.
default              defaultChair:default No, I have asked you a specific question.
default 
defaultHave you had discussions about the impact on the construction industry, and how many more houses are likely to be built?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We have not had a discussion about how many more houses will be built.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Just coming back to the other answer you gave, about 25,000 homes per year under the equity share scheme, that is 25,000 homes that you are going to be helping to finance; it is not necessarily 25,000 more homes than would have been built without the scheme, is it?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: No.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What is that figure, then, please?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: It is always very difficult to do the counterfactual, but I can give you some marks on the ground that may help.
default 
defaultThe signs are that there has been a 30% increase in demand for new homes this year compared to last year.
default 
defaultBefore the equity loan scheme was introduce, there was something like an 8% increase in the period—the 12 months, year on year.
default 
defaultWhat is very di
defaultfficult to assess, of course, i
defaults the rising confidence and interest in new build.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Again, you must have done an impact assessment as to what impact this would have on the construction industry.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Absolutely, we did an impact assessment.
defaultChair:default So what was the figure?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We did an impact assessment ahead of the announcement.
default 
defaultAll I would say, though, is that these are things that you need to keep up to date, in terms of what has been happening.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default What is the figure?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Something between, I would say, 10% and 20%.
default 
defaultIf you take the 30% increase, you net off the 8%, and you assume that there is some increase in confidence going forward—
defaultChair:default So somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 a year?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default My question is largely directed at Mr Rose.
default 
defaultIn 2011, the then Housing Minister said, “We are very much on target to build 170,000 more affordable homes.”
default 
defaultIt is 2013 now; are we still very much on target to build 170,000 more affordable homes?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Yes, I think, is the answer.
default 
defaultWithin the HCA, we are responsible for, I think, 107,400 of those 170,000, and based on where we a
defaultre half
defaultway through the scheme, we are 
defaultalmost exactly half
defaultway towards that.
default 
defaultThere are schemes within that 170,000 that we are not responsible for, but certainly my understanding, both in our own delivery and wider, is that we still are on target.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default In terms of your own role, have you been involved in challenging providers about their willingness and alacrity?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Willingness, yes.
default 
defaultI have certainly tried to get out as many visits as possible, and get out and meet with a lot of the registered providers.
default 
defaultMy own background is not in housing, so it has been really important for me to get out and meet a lot of the registered providers in the market.
default 
defaultSo, yes, I have, and I have found them to be broadly quite positive.
default 
defaultThey clearly articulate certain issues, but the main feel I get from the market is quite optimistic.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Has the cost of the programme actually been affected by having a deadline in terms of construction costs?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: It was set up, as the question implies, as a four-year programme.
default 
defaultThat gave the registered providers the opportunity to plan across the programme; I think that was one of the thoughts behind it.
default 
defaultThey also have significant visibility about the future programmes, which, from my understanding, is quite unusual, so they have a four-year programme up to 2015, and now visibility of the three-year programme from 2015 to 2018.
default 
defaultIt gives them quite a lot of ability to plan for their delivery over quite an extended period of time.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default Have there been any issues of probity—or, I might say, just cheating—where people endeavour to build houses for affordable rents but actually put them on the market for market rents?
defaultAndy Rosedefault: I am not aware of cheating going on.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Pugh:default You are not aware of the case in Kirklees, where property was built for affordable rents but then let at market rents.
default 
defaultYou are not aware of cases like that.
defaultAndy Rosedefault: Not in particular.
default 
defaultI am not personally aware of that particular case, no.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The National Housing Federation have said that they are estimating that the development programme will be cut by about £1.5 billion a year because of the concerns about rising rent arrears and cost of collection with regard 
defaultto some of the welfare changes—
defaultuniversal credit, etc.
default 
defaultHave you looked at those figures?
default 
defaultHave you got a view of them?
default 
defaultHave you taken them into account in future planning?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Of course, we are working very closely with DWP and the Chartered Institute of Housing 
defaultin
default looking at the implications of universal credit 
defaultfor
default arrears, and we published some of the findings in May 
defaulton
default what is coming out of that.
default 
defaultWhat we are seeing is that various mitigations 
defaultsuch as
default switch
default­
defaultback help to reduce the arrears, and as those demonstration projects have gone on so far, we have been able to see how mitigations can reduce those arrears by half in some cases, and in some cases by more.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default You think the National Housing Federation are exaggerating the likely consequences.
default 
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I understand why they are saying what they are saying, but as I say, the analysis that we have done, which we are doing very carefully—
defaultChair:default Would it be possible for us to have a note on that?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Yes, of course.
default The data were
default published in May, but we can certainly let you have that.
default              defaultChair:default That would be helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Moving onto the Immigration Bill,
default obviously
default this is going to place new duties on landlords to conduct checks.
default 
defaultWhat is the Department going to do to ensure that landlords know what they have got to do and when they have got to do that, and is there any advice 
defaultyou are
default going to give to them as to how to carry out these tasks?
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We will come on
default 
defaultto 
defaultthe detail through Peter, if we
default can, but I just have two specific points to make on this.
default 
defaultOne is that the D
defaultepartment has
default been very clear that any such checks have to be proporti
defaultonate to the issues involved 
defaulthere, and they have to be practically possible for landlords to deliver.
default 
defaultYou know that we have undertaken quite an extensive consultation on this, which will form part of our thinking on the practical application.
default 
defaultWe do see it as a clear responsibility for the Department to ensure that landlords are aware of their responsibilities and given practical support.
default 
defaultPeter, do you want to add anything?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Absolutely.
default 
defaultMr Blackman, there will be an enquiry service that is available for landlords to give them the clarity that they need—for example, in terms of what is the appropriate documentation that they need to be aware of, and what are their responsibilities and the issues around that.
default 
defaultOf course, many landlords do straightforward identity checks before they take on new tenants, so what we are looking to do is, in a fairly light-touch way, build on that in a way that provides all of the assurances that are required but keeps the burden down to manageable levels.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Clearly, there is a range of things here, is there not?
default 
defaultThere are large agencies that conduct checks on all sorts of things—credit checks, etc—before they will allow properties to be let.
default 
defaultEqually, there are small landlords with maybe one or two properties, where maybe they do not employ anyone to do anything.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: Indeed, and we are acutely aware that in this country, the private rented sector is typically someone letting out quite a small number of properties.
default 
defaultAnything we design will be very much done with that in mind.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Obviously, the Immigration Bill has only just been announced, and I accept that, but what work have you done already to lay out what you are going to do to assist landlords?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: We have been working very closely with the Home Office as they have developed this, and what we have tried to do is be very clear about the types of document that would be appropriate in order for a landlord to satisfy themselves under this.
default 
defaultThere are a number of very clear things: for example, a passport, a birth certificate, a driver’s licence, or an EU identity card.
default 
defaultThere are a number of fairly straightforward types of document that should be available, and we are going to be very clear with landlords, saying, “This is what you need to look for.”
default 
defaultIf they have got any questions, then, as I say, the 
defaulti
defaultnquiry service will be available to answer their questions, and provide them with the information that they need as quickly as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Sir Michael, we heard from Sir Bob earlier about some of the initiatives on the supply side of housing, and part of that is to do with changes to the planning system.
default 
defaultI just wanted to ask you about one particular change, which was the September 2012 housing stimulus package, which gave powers to the Secretary of State for application to be made directly to him where local authorities were underperforming.
default 
defaultIs it right, as reported in 
defaultPlanning 
defaultmagazine
default 
defaulton 27 September, that Blaby, 
defaultWorthing
default and 
defaultHalton
default councils have been designated to have their planning powers removed?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: I think, Peter, you are going to deal with that.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: The Government set out what the threshold would be for designation up-front, and then, at the end of September, exactly as you say, we had the final one of the eight courses of performance, which are the ones that are going to be taken into account.
default 
defaultWhat is very clear, and what Ministers were very clear about as the Bill went through Parliament, is that this is an approach that
default will be applied reasonably
default.
default 
defaultWe are currently in a process where we have invited all those districts and 
defaultunitaries
default and, indeed, county councils—because there are some planning matters as well—to provide a response to Government in terms of what the issues were around their performance.
default 
defaultThe deadline was lunchtime today for them to come back, and on the back of that, Ministers will make a decision based on all the evidence—partly, obviously, about performance, but also, “Are there any other mitigating circumstances?”
default 
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: We should just be clear that it is not removal of planning powers; this relates to major applications and the right of developers to go to the Planning Inspectorate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Yes, but is it likely that in the case of those three specific councils I have mentioned, applicants will be able to make their applications directly to the Secretary of State through the Planning Inspectorate?
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I do not know whether those three councils have submitted any further evidence, and I do not want to prejudge what will come out in the assessment of the evidence, if they have provided it.
default 
defaultWhat I would say is that Ministers have said that they want to designate by the end of October, so the Committee does not have long to wait on that, but bear with us while we assess it.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default It is a pretty low barrier, is it not?
default 
defaultThose councils have determined fewer than 30% of major applications within 30 weeks, and we are talking about initiatives to bring forward additional supply.
default My question to Sir Michael is, 
defaultif your inspectorate gets those powers—you have told us you have got about 700 people in the inspectorate—are you sufficiently resourced to have these applications coming directly to you?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: Yes, indeed.
default 
defaultClearly, the work of the Planning Inspectorate is demand-led, and therefore it depends on decisions being made by third parties, which will determine the size of our caseload.
default 
defaultWe do have a flexible organisation that can grow and shrink quite quickly according to that demand, but I am completely confident that we have both the necessary funding and levels of staff to deal with those extra pieces of work.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Can I ask you about levels of local knowledge?
default 
defaultFor example, in most local authority planning departments, there are people who know their area pretty well, and your staff, I think, are based in Bristol; how are they going to make better decisions?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: The first thing is that there is a requirement on the local authority to cooperate with the Planning Inspectorate in undertaking this work if it arises.
default 
defaultAlso, our inspectors are distributed throughout the country.
default 
defaultAlthough we are very careful to make sure they are far enough away not to have some sort of vested interest in any application, nevertheless, they are often very familiar indeed with the locality.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Moving on, we are now in a regime where we need local plans, but in March of this year, only 49% of authorities had an adopted local plan in place.
default 
defaultWhat progress has been made over the last six months, and where are we now?
default 
defaultWhat percentage of authorities now have an adopted local plan?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: The figure now is just over 50%; it is 51% of local authorities.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default So we have not got very far in six months, Sir Michael—2%.
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: There is an encouraging sign here.
default 
defaultIn terms of the examination of local plans being undertaken by inspectors, we have never been so busy.
default 
defaultWe currently have 81 plans under examination within the Planning Inspectorate.
default 
defaultNot all of those are core strategies; some of them are area action plans and so on, and we know that there are another 68 plans in the pipeline, coming towards us at the moment.
default 
defaultThere seems to be a 
defaultspeeding
default­
defaultup
default of local planning at the local planning authority end.
default 
defaultThe other thing I would just like to add is that the LGA, the Planning Inspectorate and DCLG have invested a great deal of energy in working with individual local authorities and the groups of local authorities to give them as much advice as we possibly can to help speed along the local planning process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default But there remain some authorities who would rather be slow about getting a local plan, be reluctant to allocate the resources to 
defaultplan
default­
defaultmaking
default rather than development 
defaultcontrol, wait for the applications to come in, turn them down, and then blame you.
default 
defaultWhat steps are you able to take to encourage local authorities to put more resource into 
defaultplan
default­
defaultmaking
default?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: It is by a process of encouragement.
default 
defaultMany statements have been made by Ministers and civil servants about the importance of local planning; in fact, the whole national planning system depends on having local plans in place as far as possible.
default 
defaultI am very strongly in favour of local authorities getting on with this work and making it a priority.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default In terms of the new system, the core level is neighbourhood plans, and I am very pleased that I have a neighbourhood front-runner in my constituency that I pay lots of attention to.
default 
defaultCan I say that they were absolutely horrified when they got stuck into the process and discovered very substantial amounts of bureaucracy and a great deal of power with the local authority?
default 
defaultAs the process moves forward, how can we make it easier for neighbourhoods to get on with their neighbourhood plan without feeling that it is going to be very bureaucratic and they are constantly going to have to be looking over their 
defaultshoulder at the local authority?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: Again, I wonder whether Peter would want to come in on that.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: There has been a lot of innovation in the way that we have supported neighbourhood planning.
default 
defaultWe have got something like 500 communities up and down the land who are producing neighbourhood plans.
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Still only one per constituency, if we have got 500.
default 
defaultThat is not very many.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: I had not thought about it that way.
default 
defaultThat is true, but there are some parts of the country where there is more intense activity than others.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default So that means that there are some parts of the cou
defaultntry where nothing is happening.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: And there are some parts of the country where there is an awful lot happening.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default The question is about how we make it easier in those parts of the country where there is not so much happening, where it is perceived to be bureaucratic, and the local authority is going to be constantly looking over their shoulder.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: There are a number of different things that we can do.
default 
defaultOne is the engagement with those communities to help them address barriers, if they exist, and there has been a wonderful approach in terms of the network of social media that has been used in order to reach out and build those communities and, actually, get quite a lot of cross-sharing going on amongst them.
default 
defaultThe Department funds quite a lot of advice to those groups, as well, and incentives, through the way that 
defaultC
defaultIL works, in order to encourage local authorities to take this very seriously.
defaultSir Bob defaultKerslakedefault: I think it is just worth adding that we now have some that have gone through the complete process, including the referendum, and they are terrifically strong examples that it is possible to do this.
default              
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Certainly, the front-runner in my constituency has been very appreciative of the support provided by RTPI in planning aid.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Sir Michael, one of the issues around local plans is not merely getting them in place—and there is sometimes a temptation for authorities to sit back and think, “Oh, that has been 
defaulta hard job; we do not have to do it again for another 10 years”—but actually keeping them up to date.
default 
defaultDo you think the systems are really in place to allow that sort of light-touch revision on an ongoing basis, which is really needed if plans are going to be realistic and relevant?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: Indeed.
default It is a combination
default of getting those local authorities that have never had an adopted plan moving as quickly as possible to have one, and also keeping an eye on the ones that were adopted quite some time ago to keep them u
defaultp to date, because the data do
default move on.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ134 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Is the system there flexible enough to allow that to happen in an easy way?
default 
defaultLocal authorities do not 
defaultoften 
defaulttend to do that, seemingly.
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: There is a statutory process that they have to go through, which includes, of course, consultation and all the analysis that is required.
default 
defaultI do not think there is any way that you could amend a local plan easily without taking into account the work that would have to be done by the officers of the local authority concerned.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Just to add to that, it is possible just to address a small number of policies.
default 
defaultRather than completely re-opening the plan, what you can do is focus that work on one or two policies.
default              
defaultChair:default Like the five-year housing supply update.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: Yes.
default 
defaultIf there are just one or two things that need to be updated in light of evidence that has come in, then there are, as Sir Michael says, some fast-track ways of doing that that do not require you to completely redo a plan from scratch.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ135 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default 
defaultI am asking this
default question because I ge
defaultnuinely do not know the answer. I
defaultn the old days, when one had emerging local plans, if there was a planning application that came in, even though the old plan was redundant or whatever, inspectors would deal with it on the basis of the emerging local plan.
default 
defaultWhen district councils are putting a huge amount of effort and cost into re-consulting for the third time—and this will be the final consultation—that is practically it: that is the emerging local plan, and we are still seeing lots of speculative planning applications coming in.
default 
defaultThere does not seem to be the feel that they can be fought off, because the emerging local plan is so close.
default 
defaultHow do you feel your inspectors are coping with that?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: The inspectors are required to give an appropriate amount of weight to an emerging local plan, and that depends on what stage it has got to.
default 
defaultAt the very initial stages, then very little weight at all would be attached to it.
default 
defaultIf it is extremely close to adoption, it becomes quite a powerful document, and it is a matter for the inspector in each individual case to make a judgement about how much weight to attach to that emerging local plan.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ136 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default Councils have been given that nod, have they?
default 
defaultI do not know that they are hearing it.
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: No, I think that has been the standard practice for many years, and it is well understood that that is the way things are done by the inspectorate.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultHeather Wheeler:default So why are planning officers saying, “We cannot fight this off”?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: As I say, it will depend on the status of their particular draft plan.
default 
defaultClearly, it is in a much better place if it has already been adopted by the local authority, in which case it then becomes the major determinant of the outcome of the appeal.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Turning to planning call-ins, the changes from the last Government to this Government, and over the last three years, have seen quite a considerable reduction in the number of call-ins by Ministers.
default 
defaultWhat are the criteria now being applied for a planning call-in?
default 
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: The criteria were 
defaultset out in a written m
defaultinisterial statement in October of last year, and I would refer the Committee to that.
default 
defaultSomewhere in my briefing pack, I have that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Have they not changed since then?
default 
defaultObviously, there has been quite a drop this year in terms of the number of call-ins.
defaultPeter Schofielddefault: As I say, the call-in criteria were revised in October last year, and they have not changed since.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default Sir Michael, what effect has the drop in the number of call-ins had on your department?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: In the case of a call-in, which is a decision by the Secretary of State, it is then referred to a planning inspector, who will examine the evidence for and against and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State.
default 
defaultWhat we look at is a balanced portfolio of workload.
default 
defaultIt always seems to me that as one goes down, another one is going up, and by and large, we try and get our resources as close as we possibly can to meet the requirement.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default So the reduction in call-ins has enabled you to speed up work elsewhere?
default 
defaultWhat has been the effect?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: That is right.
default 
defaultThere is always a backlog of appeals, so we re
default­
defaultallocate inspectors and staff on
default to those appeals
default and speed them up as quickly as we can.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default I do not know the answer to this: has the appeals process speeded up considerably?
default 
defaultCan we look at statistics that show that you are performing much better?
default 
defaultWhat is happening?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: The appeals process will be speeding up quite dramatically from 1 October, arising from the planning reform process, where we are being set much tighter targets for dealing with written representations, hearings, and public inquiries.
default 
defaultI do hope, in a year’s time, my successor will be able to report to you that there has been a dramatic improvement in the speed.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultBob Blackman:default One final question, then, on written appeals: is the determination of a written appeal made by the inspector now, or is that on consideration of both the appellant and objectors?
defaultSir Michael Pittdefault: It does not really matter whether it is by written representation, hearing, or public inquiry as to the outcome.
default 
defaultIt is just that as a case gets more complex, then a hearing or a public inquiry becomes more appropriate.
default 
defaultBut the decision on a transferred appeal is made by the inspector weighing up the evidence for and against, and, of course, the inspector can ask further questions if he or she is not satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to make a choice.
default              default              defaultChair:default Thank you all very much for coming to give evidence this afternoon.
