Ofcom response to the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications&#xa0;

[[[Memorandum]]]

[[[ by Ofcom]]]&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Under the Communications Act 2003, Ofcom is required to set standards for programmes on television and radio in order to secure a range of objectives, such that news on television and radio services is presented with due impartiality and due accuracy and that broadcasters preserve due impartiality on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy. &#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofcom is also required under the Act to put these standards in a code. In 2005, Ofcom published the first version of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code which sets out these standards in the form of rules that broadcasters must abide by. This Code applies to all broadcasters licensed by Ofcom. A copy of the current version of our Broadcasting Code (dated 21 March 2013) can be found on our website. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Ofcom’s]]]

[[[ role during elections]]]&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofcom has a clearly defined set of duties in relation to elections in the UK. In summary, these are in the following two areas:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Party Election Broadcasts]]]&#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Under section 333 of the Act, Ofcom is required to make rules determining the political parties on whose behalf party political and referendum broadcasts may be made, including party election broadcasts, which are broadcasts allocated to registered parties during election campaigns. The television and radio channels obliged to carry party election broadcasts are Channels 3, 4 and 5, Classic FM, Talksport and Absolute AM. The BBC and S4C also allocate party political and referendum broadcasts on a similar basis. However, the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts do not apply to the BBC or S4C.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts contain minimum requirements set by Ofcom which broadcasters must abide by in deciding the allocation, length, frequency and scheduling of party election broadcasts. Ofcom applies the Ofcom rules on party political and referendum broadcasts in determining any disputes in relation to party election broadcasts referred to it by a political party or broadcaster.&#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The current version of the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts was published on 21 March 2013 following a public consultation. In its consultation, Ofcom in particular sought views on changing the rules to ensure they cover the new local television services that are beginning to launch throughout the UK.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Broadcasters’ editorial coverage during elections]]]&#xa0;1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is no obligation on any broadcaster to transmit any of its own broadcast coverage of election campaigns. However, if a broadcaster chooses to do so, it must ensure that the programming complies with the Broadcasting Code. Broadcasters will typically cover election campaigns in the form of news and current affairs programmes. This coverage must comply with the following two sections of the Broadcasting Code in particular:&#xa0;Section Five (due impartiality) &#xa0;1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Section Five of the Broadcasting Code requires broadcasters to ensure that they reflect alternative viewpoints in their output when they are dealing with “matters of political or industrial controversy and matters of current public policy”.&#xa0;Section Six (elections) &#xa0;1.10&#xa0;&#xa0; Due to their importance, elections are automatically regarded under the Broadcasting Code (see Rule 6.1) as “matters of major political or industrial controversy and major matters of current public policy [emphasis added]”. As a result, as well as the rules in Section Five applying, special rules laid out in Section Six of the Code also apply during election periods. In summary, these rules affect two types of broadcast content about elections:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Major parties]]]&#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0; Both the Broadcasting Code and the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts afford a special status to the major political parties. The Ofcom list of major parties reflects the fact that some political parties have a significant level of electoral support, and number of elected representatives, across a range of elections within the UK or the devolved nations. Until March 2013, the list of major parties was listed in both the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts and Section Six of the Broadcasting Code. However, following our consultation revising the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts, and in response to stakeholder concerns that the existing list of major parties was too inflexible, we removed the list of major parties from the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts and Section Six of the Code. Instead we placed the list in a standalone annex to both documents, so that it can be reviewed periodically in an efficient way.&#xa0;1.12&#xa0;&#xa0; As a result, we have been conducting our first consultation since March 2013 on possible changes to the list of major parties ahead of the European Parliamentary elections due to take place on 22 May 2014. We intend to publish any new list of major parties by early March 2014.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The Ofcom Election Committee]]]&#xa0;1.13&#xa0;&#xa0; In carrying out its duty to regulate broadcast content related to elections, Ofcom may convene its Election Committee. This is a delegated committee of the Ofcom Board whose role is to consider and adjudicate on complaints received with regard to: the allocation by Ofcom licensed broadcasters of party election broadcasts; the scheduling of party election broadcasts, or their duration; and, due impartiality in programmes transmitted by Ofcom licensed broadcasters during an election period.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The Broadcasting Code and General Election debate cases]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.14&#xa0;&#xa0; Since the Broadcasting Code was introduced in 2005, Ofcom has recorded a number of breaches of the rules in Sections Five and Six of the Code. Details of our decisions can be found in our fortnightly Broadcast Bulletin. Although these breaches of the rules were concerned with a variety of issues, they were all principally concerned with a lack of due impartiality in certain broadcast editorial coverage of elections, and contraventions of the rather technical rules in Section Six about constituency/electoral area reporting.&#xa0;1.15&#xa0;&#xa0; It should be underlined that Ofcom is a post-broadcast regulator. This means that Ofcom has no role in determining the structure, format and style of any broadcast General Election debates that might take place in future. Rather, our concern would be whether any election debates comply with the rules in relation to due impartiality and elections in Sections Five and Six of the Code once they have been broadcast. It is worth noting that in the 2010 General Election, Ofcom was required to reach and publish decisions in relation to two of the Election debates that took place.  &#xa0;1.16&#xa0;&#xa0; The ITV 1 Debate: Ofcom received separate complaints from the Scottish National Party (“the SNP”) and Plaid Cymru concerning the ITV1 Debate, broadcast on 15 April 2010. In summary, the two parties each considered that ITV1 had breached the Code rules on due impartiality by not including the SNP and Plaid Cymru in this Election Debate. In response to these complaints, Ofcom convened its Election Committee. In summary, the Election Committee decided that the SNP and Plaid Cymru’s complaints should not be upheld. This was because principally this Election Debate was presented as an opportunity to hear from the three major UK political parties, one or more of which had a realistic prospect of forming the next UK Government. In addition, ITV1 signalled to the audience for the Election Debate that viewers in the devolved nations could see separate televised debates between leading figures of the major parties in those nations (including the SNP and Plaid Cymru as appropriate) on issues of policy most relevant to those nations. &#xa0;1.17&#xa0;&#xa0; The Sky News Debate: Ofcom received 671 complaints about the Sky News Debate, broadcast on 22 April 2010. In particular complainants objected to a reference, by the Sky News debate moderator Adam Boulton to a critical newspaper story about Nick Clegg. Complainants considered that Adam Boulton’s comment showed bias against the Liberal Democrats, because he made no such personal references to David Cameron or Gordon Brown. Others complained about alleged breaches of the agreement governing the format of the Election Debates, drawn up between broadcasters and the political parties participating in the Debates, and aspects of the presentation and format of the Sky News Debate. On 5 July 2010, Ofcom published its decision in relation to the Sky News Debate. In summary, Ofcom did not uphold any of the complaints it had received concerning this Debate. This was for the following reasons:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Annex – Ofcom list of major parties]]]&#xa0;A1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This document sets out the definition of “major parties” as applies to Section Six of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code and the Ofcom rules on Party Political and Referendum Broadcasts. A1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ofcom will periodically review the definition of “major parties”, taking account of relevant evidence, such as changes in the electoral landscape, across a range of elections. A1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At present in Great Britain, major parties are defined as: the Conservative Party; the Labour Party; and the Liberal Democrats. A1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition, major parties in Scotland and Wales respectively are the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru. A1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The major parties in Northern Ireland are: the Alliance Party; the Democratic Unionist Party; Sinn Fein; the Social Democratic and Labour Party; and the Ulster Unionist Party. &#xa0;23 January 20145              See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code/              http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/ppbrules.pdf               Ibid.              The Government made clear its policy preference for the new local television services to carry PEBs, as reflected in the Local Digital Television Programme Services Order 2012 (See http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/292/pdfs/uksi_20120292_en.pdf  (made 13 February 2012).              The first local television service to launch, Estuary TV located in Grimsby, commenced broadcasting in late 2013.               See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/831190/section5.pdf   Ofcom’s published Guidance to Section Five of the Code can be found at http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/831193/section5.pdf               See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/831190/section6.pdf   Ofcom’s published Guidance to Section Six of the Code can be found at http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/831193/section6.pdf   Section Six applies to all elections taking place within the UK down to and including Local Government Elections, Mayoral Elections and Police and Crime Commissioner Elections.              See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/831193/section6.pdf               Rule 6.2 of the Code states: “Due weight must be given to the coverage of major parties during the election period. Broadcasters must also consider giving appropriate coverage to other parties and independent candidates with significant views and perspectives”.               See paragraph 1.7.              See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/guidance/major-parties.pdf and Annex 1.              See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/parties2014/summary/condoc.pdf               See http://www.ofcom.org.uk/about/how-ofcom-is-run/committees/election-committee/               See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/              It should be noted that Sections Five and Six do not apply to BBC services funded by the licence fee, which are regulated on these matters by the BBC Trust. Therefore, Ofcom could not pursue any due impartiality and election complaints relating to the 2010 Debate broadcast on the BBC.              See http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/tv/updates/election10_snp.pdf               See http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/tv/updates/election10_pc.pdf               See http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb161/issue161.pdf, pages 8, 9, 12 and 13.
