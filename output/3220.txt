[[[1.0 ]]]

[[[Introduction]]]1.1              My name is Nicholas Palmer and I work for the National Kidney Federation (NKF), the leading patient charity in the United Kingdom, as Head of Advocacy.1.2              My role is to support patients and carers individually through advocacy, and collectively by working in partnership with NHS England, the Department of Health and other health related organisations, charities and industry. I have a team of Advocacy Officers who cover the UK. The NKF use the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group to communicate at a political level.1.3              In support of my role I am a lay member on NICE (National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence) Guideline Development Groups (GDG’s), currently serving on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) update, and Anaemia Management in CKD;  and also acting as a lay member on the NHS England Clinical Reference Group (CRG) for Renal Transplantation.1.4              Furthermore, I am a member of the Strategic Clinical Network (Cardiovascular) in Thames Valley, South East Coast and London regions, where I represent the interests of kidney patients, working with clinicians, patients and NHS England to improve the delivery and quality of renal services.1.5              Individually I am a member of the Guys &amp; St Thomas Kidney Patient Association.1.6              After presentation to the All Party Parliamentary Kidney Group on 21st October 2013 I have been asked by the NKF Chief Executive and Chairman, to make written representation to the Select Committee on the subject commonly referred to as ‘Bedroom Tax’ (otherwise known as ‘under occupancy rules’, ‘spare room subsidy’ or ‘housing benefit reduction’ ).

[[[Supporting Statement]]]3.1              While some patients with CKD, on dialysis or with a transplant are able to lead normal lives, it is fair to acknowledge that renal patients on benefits are some of the most vulnerable people in our society today. It is not uncommon for them to have more than one long-term condition; the nature of CKD means that many have a severely compromised cardiovascular system, suffer chronic mobility issues often caused by CKD or Diabetes; suffer depression; have hypertension or hypotension, can generally be fatigued and suffer from bouts of acute anaemia – many are therefore reliant on carers, family, friends and mobility devices to get around. Emotional support for these individuals importantly can also be lacking, and for those living alone the struggle to be heard

[[[ ]]]and battle a benefits system are a step too far and they become drowned by a system that fails to see their need and recognise their dignity. I know this from the patients I and my Advocacy Team meet and talk to in response to their NKF Helpline calls.3.2              Many renal patients of a working age have lost their jobs through ill-health or have found a route back into work blocked by a restrictive treatment regime; others have found education or training cut short.  There are three options for those patients who reach Established Renal Failure (ERF): 3.4              Conservative Care is for patients, who are generally too frail, and after detailed discussions have decided that Dialysis and a Transplant are not for them; Conservative Care eventually leads to Palliative Care and death.  Dialysis and Transplantation are more commonly referred to as Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) and are the only two treatment options which extend the lives of individuals with ERF. 3.5              Notably for some patient’s dialysis is the only treatment option due to existing heart conditions or tissue type sensitivity. There are two type of dialysis; Peritoneal Dialysis which is commonly undertaken at home/work four times a day lasting about half an hour each time, and Haemodialysis undertaken within Hospital or ‘Satellite’ units requiring three visits per week with treatment sometimes lasting between 4 - 5 hours each time, together with travel it is not uncommon to be away from the home eight hours a day.3.6              Against this background there is a supported move in the kidney community (NKF Home Dialysis Manifesto) to enable more patients to undertake Home Haemodialysis (HHD), collectively with Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) this is referred to as Home Therapy, and provides an essential option of choice for dialysis patients allowing many benefits:3.7              There is support from NHS England and through five Domains with their outcomes statement we can see that Domains one, two and four are directly related to Home Therapy:1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions3 - Helping people to recover from periods of ill health or following injury4 - Ensuring that people have a positive experience of care5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment; and protecting them from3.8              In terms of the Bedroom Tax, it is the Home Therapies patients who are the prime focus of this submission. However, the unfairness of such a tax must not be forgotten against the financial burdens that many renal patients are under who face further assessments when applying for Employment Support Allowance/Disability Living Allowance and now Personal Independence Payments. 3.9              Benefits allow patients to ‘get by’ to enable a quality of life that many of us take for granted – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ is making that impossible for those patients affected and forcing them to take decisions that will have a negative impact on their long-term health and outcomes such as deciding against having Home Therapy (which has been reported widely to the NKF) – this is causing actual harm to a choice of modality that we try so hard to encourage and promote; the potential damage could be significant.3.10              The NKF believe that seeking an exemption for Home Therapy patients is a fair ask in light of existing exemptions for foster families, families with adult children away on duty with the armed forces and severely disabled children. We also feel that this is a very small request in light of the numbers affected and the range of benefits that Home Therapy brings.3.11              Let us not forget this is a tax on vulnerable people carrying out life-saving treatment in their own home, which can extend their life expectancy and without such treatment would be dead within two weeks. We also believe that Home Therapy brings unquestionable savings for the ‘national purse’, a turn of phrase often used to defend the reasoning for the ‘Bedroom Tax’. The next two sections will look at the benefits of the extra room and could be broadly classed as Health Economics.

[[[Need for room]]]4.1              The extra room (which for HHD are specially adapted) brings benefits for the individual patient including:

[[[5.0 ]]]

[[[Benefits]]]5.1              There are many benefits that Home Therapy brings including cost savings, improved clinical outcomes and social benefits all described below.5.1.1              Reduced transport costs – Patients have a total of six journeys to make each week for hospital-based or satellite haemodialysis. There are none for HHD and therefore savings can be made. For example at Southend Hospital 2008/09 for 66 patients the total cost of transport to the Trust was £277,000; individually transport costs can be as much as £300 per journey. Patient transport costs which are picked up by each Hospital Trust can be erased.5.1.2              Reduced clinical costs – It is widely acknowledged through research papers and by physicians within the kidney community that the need for blood pressure medication, phosphate binders, and anaemia treatment can cease with improved frequency of haemodialysis at home. Hospital in-patient stays are less likely as are infections with the upside being patients are healthier getting more dialysis.5.1.3              Hospital/Satellite capacity increased - Home dialysis or home therapy frees-up capacity in satellite or hospital-based dialysis units. 5.1.4              Cost saving per session of HHD –I t is comparably cheaper after initial outlay to have HHD, no nursing is time involved and it has been reported that there can be a saving of £25.00 per session.5.1.5              Healthier patientsIncreased dialysis frequency allows:&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.6              Social benefits&#xa0;5.2              Looking at all the costs and benefits as a society the best we can do for individual human beings is improve quality of life, reduce mortality and increase life expectancy – Home Therapy does this – the ‘Bedroom Tax’ prevents it.&#xa0;

[[[Challenges]]]&#xa0;6.1              There have already been a number of challenges across the country to the ‘Bedroom Tax’ which highlights the dissatisfaction felt, but also the widely held view that this is a bad policy affecting vulnerable individuals whose existing health problems mean they already struggle financially. The United Nations have voiced their concerns while Local Authorities have taken measures to help people.6.2              Westminster - A housing association tenant in central London won an appeal against the imposition of the bedroom tax by Westminster city council - the first such victory in England. The blind man argued successfully to a tribunal that a room in his flat classified as a second bedroom had never been used as one and had always been where equipment helping him to lead a normal life was kept.6.3              Glasgow - A judge ruled that housing benefit officials breached the human rights of a severely disabled woman after docking her benefits under the ‘Bedroom Tax’. The lady, who has Multiple Sclerosis and her husband were legally entitled to a bedroom each because her condition was so severe she needed a specially adapted bed and bedroom.6.4              United Nations - The Government's so-called ‘bedroom tax’ has been described as a "shocking" policy "my immediate recommendation is that the bedroom tax is abolished”, said a UN Inspector invited to the UK by our Government. A final report will be presented in Geneva to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014.6.5              Leeds Council - Leeds council has confirmed it will reclassify hundreds of rooms in council houses in a bid to help residents avoid the so-called ‘Bedroom Tax". Across the city 837 houses will have their bedrooms reclassified as non-specific 'rooms', the council said. This will allow residents to avoid their benefits being docked under what the government insists is a ‘spare room subsidy’ not a tax.&#xa0;

[[[ayment (DHP)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1              As an organisation we know individuals can seek DHP to help bridge the shortfall between their reduced housing benefit and cost of rent. However we are aware of a number of negative issues concerning DHP:&#xa0;&#xa0;7.2              In the DHP guidance produced by the Department for Work &amp; Pensions Local Authorities (LA’s) have the power to give indefinite awards for DHP. The interpretation and use of the policy by LA’s is lacking and as a result the NKF is aware of individuals whose only option is dialysis (for optimal quality of life) being completely unfairly treated. Let us not forget dialysis is carried out in the home in order to secure the best possible care and that this reduces the cost to the ‘national purse’. This has been reported to us by Welfare Officers in England who support kidney patients. Simply put DHP is not working for our patient community.&#xa0;

[[[Support]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]8.1              The NKF has strong links with Renal Social Workers (RSW) through their chair Bernie Boruch based at the Manchester Royal Infirmary and she has forwarded a number of issues reported through the RSW Network which offer a supportive case and include:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;8.2              NHS England has already made a supporting submission in favour of helping kidney patients to have relief/exemption from the ‘Bedroom Tax’ – this was made by the National Clinical Director for Renal Services, Dr Richard Fluck.&#xa0;8.3              Furthermore the British Kidney Patient Association (BKPA) has seen an overwhelming demand on their counselling service associated with benefits and ‘Bedroom Tax’ in particular while grants applications have increased.

[[[Conclusion]]]&#xa0;9.1              Nationally it has been reported that 660,000 people have been affected by the ‘Bedroom Tax’ - one third of social sector claimants. However in terms of kidney patients we are looking small numbers, 30 - 40 cases, there is potential harm to the very Home Therapy programme that we are trying to encourage though. While there is a wider crisis across many sections of society we plead leniency for our patients wanting or having Home Therapy.

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.2              We ask that common sense prospers.9.3              The policy is intended to encourage (singles or couples) people to move into smaller properties in order to free up accommodation for larger families.  A freedom of information request published in the Independent in August highlighted the general problem of the tax and that 96 % of those affected had nowhere suitable to move to.9.4              In Birmingham 13,557 households were affected but there were only 368 suitable properties; while in Cornwall there were only 65 suitable properties for the 3,300 people eligible to be charged for under occupancy.9.5              There has been insufficient, sustained building of affordable housing through successive governments over the last thirty years which deeply flaws the policy to reduce housing benefit because of under occupancy. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]9.6              Finally, it cannot be right that some of the country’s most vulnerable people who currently have or are seeking to have treatment that improves their quality of life and costs the country less are effectively penalised financially or prevented from having Home Therapy.&#xa0;9.7              This is simply wrong.&#xa0;9.8              We are talking about a very discrete group of patients with very specific needs, and I kindly ask that this committee recommend exemption for our specific group of patients from this damaging policy. &#xa0;9.9              Many patients who seek Home Therapy may never get the opportunity of freedom that a kidney transplant would bring; Home Therapy brings a freedom of sorts and in no way should it mean that patients face a financial levy for seeking it.&#xa0;9.10              Therefore we kindly ask that renal patients undertaking Home Therapy in receipt of housing benefit should be exempt from the ‘Bedroom Tax’.&#xa0;28 October 2013&#xa0;
