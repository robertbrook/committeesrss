"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Dr Nigel Perry (CYS0122)SummaryThe Committee did not explicitly ask for views on the role of helmets in cycl\ning safety. However, while British I have been resident in New Zealand for some years and have first hand experience of how wrong and counterproductive promoting or legislating bicycle helmets is. It is important than the UK does not make the same mistakes\n.\nBicycling is Beneficial7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDoes the safety risk of cycling outweigh the health benefits?7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe answer is, quite clearly, no: the actual risk of cycling is tiny. There is one cyclist death per 33 million kilometres of cycling, while being sedentary presents a much greater risk. Over 50,000 people die in the UK eac\nh year due to coronary heart disease related to insufficient physical activity, compared to around 100 cyclists killed on the road. Research suggests that safety risks are outweighed by the health benefits by a factor of around twenty to one.\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe individual choosing to cycle wins; they gain a health benefit, they reduce their transport costs, etc. Cyclists on average live longe\nr.\n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSociety also benefits; there is less demand on health services, reduced congestion on the roads, lower environmental pollution (which incidentally is a significant killer), etc.\n8.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBusiness also benefits; healthier people are happier, and healthier happier\n people are more productive –\n&#xa0;\nsome countries have run schemes where employers donate bicycles to their employees if they use them a few times a week to ride to work, and businesses have participated because it makes financial sense to do so.\nWhy Bicycle Helmet Legislation And Promotion Is Bad14.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt creates the false impression that the costs of bicycling outweigh the benefits, while the reverse is true, however\n much effort is put into avoiding this problem\n.\n14.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHelmet promotion has therefore, wherever undertaken, over sold the minimal protection that helmets provide\n in order to counter the false impression of the dangers of bicycling.\n14.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverselling any safety device\n is counterproductive, due to risk compensation.\n14.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe result is that the, already minimal, benefit is negated.\n14.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBicycle helmets are commercial products; marketing is up to the manufacturers not the Government.\n14.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever as safety devices there marketing must b\ne controlled, that is where the Government has a role –\n&#xa0;\nin avoiding specious claims etc.\n15.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYou start with an activity where the benefits outweigh the costs and yet argue that participants are somehow irr\nesponsible if they don’t wear helmets\n.\n15.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nToday in Australia and New Zealand it is a common view among the public that un-helmeted bicyclists should not be covered by national health care.\n15.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYet those bicyclists are \nreducing\n Society’s costs.\n15.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnd are invariably\n the \nvictims\n when serious injuries or deaths occur.\nConclusions&#xa0;\n \nActive Travel Strategy\n, Department for Transport/Department of Health, UK, 22 Feb 2010\n These standards are by no means new, we find them in liberalism in the 17C:\n… the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either phy\nsical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so … because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating\n with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil, in case he do otherwise.\nfrom On Liberty, John Stuart Mill, 1859\nEchoes of these ideas are found in our present day views on \nhuman rights, discrimination and justice.\n The New Zealand Government, when working on an active transport strategy, once stated that they had “shot ourselves in the foot” with the promotion of bicycle helmets.\n Bicycle helmets are designed, due to unavo\nidable limitations, for cycle-only incidents below about 10mph.\n For example the New Zealand Government chose the slogan “Bare head, Knucklehead”… with obvious connotations. But what could they have chosen without negative connotations?\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n"
