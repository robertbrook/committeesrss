[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]1. 
[normal]The National Children’s Bureau and Council for Disabled Children welcome
[normal] the Education Select Committee’s inquiry on the under-achieveme
[normal]nt in education by working class children.  
[normal]There are
[normal] a wide range of factors, both within and outside the school environment, which are having a deleterious effect on the 
[normal]educational attainment of children and young people from disadvantaged families.   
[normal]The Centre for Social Justice’s recent report ‘
[normal]Requires Improvement: the causes of educational failure’
[normal] highlights the critical need to gain a better understanding of why white working class children, and in particular boys, are falling behind their peers
[normal] and not meeting their full potential. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal] [bold]Our response draws on NCB’s [bold]recently published[bold] [bold]report ‘[bold]Greater Expectations’[bold] 
[normal]This
[normal] compares 
[normal]current 
[normal]data on different aspects of children’s lives 
[normal]with that of 
[normal]NCB’s national cohort study 
[normal]‘Born to Fail?’ 
[normal]of 
[normal]11-year olds born in 1958
[normal], and
[normal] published in 1973
[normal]. 
[normal]3.
[normal] [bold]NCB sets out a number of recommendations in ‘Greater Expectations’ to request that immediate action is taken to tackle child poverty and redu[bold]ce inequality experienced by children and young people.[bold] We would welcome the Education Select Committee’s 
[normal]consideration of
[normal] the following, which we believe will lead to improved educational attainment for the most disadvantaged children:
[normal]• [bold]The government should create a Children and Young People’s Board with full ministerial representation to develop and implement a genuinely cross-government multidimensional strategy to reduce the inequality and disadvantage children 
[normal]and young people face;
[normal]• [bold]The Office for Budget Responsibility should disclose the impact each Budget would have on child poverty and inequality in the report it publishes alongside th
[normal]e Chancellor’s annual statement;
[normal]• [bold]At the next general election, each political party should set
[normal] out in their manifesto the full range of measures they will take to improve the lives of children and young people, reducing inequality in the key areas set out in 
[normal]this report;
[normal]• [bold]Parliament and civil society should establish a common set of indicators tha
[normal]t are used as a matrix to hold government to account for what it is doing to address the inequalities and disadvantage that children face.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Greater Expectations[bold]: key findings[bold]a) C[bold]hild poverty[bold]4. 
[normal]Children who live in poverty a
[normal]re far less likely to do well at school than their more affluent peers. Too many children are still living in poor living conditions and go to school hungry. 
[normal]In order to [bold]raise[bold] educational attainment,[bold] 
[normal]it is [bold]imperative that measures are taken to taken to imp[bold]rove children’s experiences within the home environment. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]5. 
[normal]The 
[normal]‘
[normal]Greater Expectations’
[normal] 
[normal]report identifies that there are 1.5million more children living in poverty today than there were in 1969. These children are more likely to be obese, less likely to a
[normal]chieve a good level of development at age four, liable to under
[normal]-
[normal]achieve at age eleven and prone to attaining poorer GSCE results than children from a 
[normal]more affluent
[normal] background. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]In 2013, the 3.5million children living in poverty are more likely to be 
[normal]the victim of an unintentional injury or accident in the home. They are nine times less likely than those living in affluent areas to have access to green space, places to play and to live in environments with better air quality.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]‘Greater Expectations’
[normal] compares our children’s quality of life with other 
[normal]industrialised
[normal] countries and finds that, if the UK was the best place to grow up:
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Almost one million children could be lifted out of poverty
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]The deaths of 172 children through unintentional injuries 
[normal]could be prevented     
[normal]     every year
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]320,000 more 15 to 19-year olds would be in education or training
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]Nearly 45,000 fewer 11-year olds would be obese
[normal];
[normal]•
[normal]              
[normal]And 770,000 children under 5 would not be living in poor housing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal]An analysis of Free Sch
[normal]ool Meals data shows the impact of child poverty on educational attainment. Young people who 
[normal]are 
[normal]eligible for Free School Meals 
[normal]are
[normal] less likely to continue in 
[normal]post-16 
[normal]education, employment and training – 82% compared to 90% of young people not claiming Fre
[normal]e School Meals
[normal] - and
[normal] more likely to be 
[normal]categorised
[normal] as NEET (16%) 
[normal]compared to non-FSM pupils (8%)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In addition
[normal], p
[normal]upils with special educational needs are much more likely
[normal] to be eligible for and claim
[normal] free school meals than those 
[normal]pupils with no SEN: t
[normal]wo 
[normal]thirds of the secondary school pupils eligible for Free School Meals have SEN
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]We must respond
[normal] to these findings and stop the
[normal] widening gap between poverty and affluence to avoid increasing social division and rising costs to society. 
[normal]Improving the qu[bold]ality of social housing[bold] a[bold]nd access to outdoor play areas[bold], [bold]supporting parents’ career development and childcare needs, [bold]improving pastoral support for pupils,[bold] [bold]and enhancing healthcare [bold]and SEN [bold]provision are all measures that will lead to improved educational [bold]attainment for white working class children.[bold] 
[normal]b) E[bold]arly education[bold]9.
[normal] [bold]High quality early education [bold]is[bold] vitally important in narrowing the gap [bold]in[bold] attainment between disadvantaged and more affluent children at age five. [bold]However, m[bold]ore needs to be done to [bold]improve the quality and sufficiency of early education and childcare in disadvantaged areas.[bold]10. 
[normal]The significant increase in
[normal] 
[normal]the proportion of children access
[normal]ing
[normal] early
[normal] 
[normal]education since 
[normal]‘
[normal]Born to Fail?
[normal]’
[normal] was published
[normal],
[normal] reflects
[normal] 
[normal]a growing understanding of the 
[normal]long-term benefits
[normal] 
[normal]of good quality early education, and in particular
[normal] the previous G
[normal]overnment’s decision to invest in free
[normal] 
[normal]early years services for children and families
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]including fifteen hours of free nursery education for three and four year olds and ac
[normal]cess to Children’s 
[normal]Centres
[normal]. 
[normal]The vast majority of 3 
[normal]and
[normal] 4 year
[normal] 
[normal]olds 
[normal](96 per cent) 
[normal]in England 
[normal]now 
[normal]attend early education: 93
[normal] 
[normal]per cent of 3 year-olds and 98 per cent of 4-year
[normal]-
[normal]olds
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal] [bold]Y[bold]oung children living in poorer economic circumstances are less likely[bold] to develop well than their more affluent peers[bold]. We know
[normal] 
[normal]that children from poor backgrounds can develop
[normal] 
[normal]equally 
[normal]well if they have access to good quality early years
[normal] 
[normal]provision
[normal]; however,
[normal] the quality of early years services is
[normal] 
[normal]often 
[normal]weakest in areas w
[normal]ith hig
[normal]h levels of deprivation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he likelihood of a young child achieving
[normal] 
[normal]a ‘good level of development’ in the Early Years
[normal] 
[normal]Foundation Stage – for example being able to
[normal] 
[normal]listen to stories, have good hand-eye coordination
[normal] 
[normal]and communicate and play well with others 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]varies significantly when we look at children from
[normal] 
[normal]poorer backgrounds. While nearly two thirds
[normal] 
[normal](64 per cent) of all 4-year-olds achieve ‘a good level
[normal] 
[normal]of development’ during their early education,
[normal] 
[normal]only half (48 per cent) of children
[normal] eligible for free scho
[normal]ol meals achieve this level
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. 
[normal]We welcome the expansion of free early education for two year olds, 
[normal]in enabling
[normal] children from the 
[normal]40% most
[normal] disadvantaged families 
[normal]to
[normal] attend pre-school provision for 15 hours a week.
[normal] [bold]Access to early education is also 
[normal]valuable in
[normal] engaging parents and 
[normal]provides a route in to 
[normal]supporting families most in need through early intervention support and services
[normal], as identified through NCB’s Raising Early Achievement in Literacy (REAL) project
[normal].
[normal] [bold](Please see 
[normal]NCB’s submission
[normal] to
[normal] the Education Select Committee’s inquiry on Sure Start Children’s 
[normal]Centres
[normal].)
[normal]13. 
[normal]It is apparent that society must do
[normal] more to support
[normal] 
[normal]disadvantaged young 
[normal]children to develop as well
[normal] 
[normal]as their more affluent peers.
[normal] 
[normal]While the UK has above average levels of participation in early education,
[normal] 
[normal]according to the most recent available comparative international data we
[normal] 
[normal]are not doing as well as the best performing count
[normal]ries – France, Belgium and
[normal] 
[normal]Denmark 
[normal]– who have 100% enrolment
[normal]. 
[normal]If [bold]the UK[bold] were performing as well as these countries, 300,000 more young children under 3 – a quarter of all children of that age – would be[bold] [bold]accessing services to help them develop well.[bold]c) S[bold]ch[bold]ool years[bold]14.
[normal] [bold]Greater emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring that the education system meets the individual learning and development needs of each and every child. [bold]This coupled with improvements to the home environment, would reduce the attainment gap between disadvantaged and more affluent children. [bold]15. 
[normal]In 
[normal]Born to Fail?
[normal], NCB found that growing up in disadvantaged circumstances had a negative impact on children’s e
[normal]ducational outcomes, and on their expectations of continuing in learning beyond the age of 16.
[normal] [bold]Nearly five decades on
[normal] 
[normal]there is no indication of the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged
[normal] 
[normal]children at school disappearing. 
[normal]Today, a child from a disadvantage[bold]d background is still more likely to achieve a lower academic level than their peers. [bold]Although eighty per cent of 11 year olds achieve to the expected level in English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal], those children who are eligible for Free School Meals do not do as well with 
[normal]only 66 per cent achieving to the expected level. The gap between the achievements of disadvantaged children and their peers continues at GCSE level, with far fewer achieving at least five A*–C grade GCSEs including English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]16. 
[normal]Although literacy rates for children in the UK are above average for OECD countries, we are underperforming when it comes to translating children’s learning into education, training and job opportunities post-16. 
[normal]If we were[bold] 
[normal]doing as well as the best perfor[bold]ming country, 166,700 more 15–19-year[bold] [bold]old[bold] 
[normal]males  ([bold]nearly 10 per cent more[bold]),[bold] and 152,500 more 15–19-year old[bold] 
[normal]females ([bold]8 per cent more[bold])[bold] would be in education and training.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]17. 
[normal]Children living in poverty or deprived areas are doing considerably less well tha
[normal]n their more affluent peers. Children who are in care have particularly poor educational outcomes compared with other children; and too many children with special educational needs (SEN) are not being supported to reach their full potential. 
[normal]91% of pupils 
[normal]without special educational needs go on post-16 education, employment or training, compared to 84% of pupils with a SEN statement, 84% of pupils on School Action and 75% of pupils on School Action Plus.  
[normal]The performance gap between children from poor backg
[normal]rounds and those living in richer homes remains just as wide today. A quarter of children from poor backgrounds fail to meet the
[normal] 
[normal]expected attainment level at the end of primary school compared with 3 per cent from affluent
[normal] 
[normal]backgrounds
[normal]. The gap widens at 1
[normal]6 with just one in five children from the poorest families achieving five good GCSEs, including English and 
[normal]Maths
[normal], compared with three quarters from 
[normal]more affluent
[normal] families
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d) H[bold]ealth inequalities[bold]18.
[normal] [bold]Children from poorer backgrounds continue to be more [bold]likely than better off children to suffer from ill health, with consequences for their education, employment and health into adulthood[bold].[bold] This is despite the fact that, thanks to medical developments and rising standards of living, we have seen a decline in
[normal] illness and death in childhood since the publication of 
[normal]‘
[normal]Born to Fail?
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]19. 
[normal]In his review of health inequalities, Michael Marmot found that ‘
[normal]there is a social gradient in health – the lower a person’s social position, the 
[normal]worse his or her health
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] These social inequalities affected children in 
[normal]‘
[normal]Born to Fail?
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]in 1969, and they are still having a sign
[normal]ificant an impact on children’s 
[normal]well-being today. Today, a child’s socio-economic circumstances have an effect on some aspects of their health 
[normal]behaviou
[normal]r
[normal]. For example, the more affluent school age children are, the more likely they are to eat
[normal] 
[normal]fruit daily
[normal] and children living in more affluent areas have better access to play or leisure spaces than children in deprived areas.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]20. 
[normal]In the most deprived area
[normal]s 45% of children reported two or more 
[normal]unfav
[normal]ourable
[normal] 
[normal]environmental conditions compared to 5% of children in
[normal] the least disadvantaged areas. 
[normal]Poor housing was used as a key indicator of disadvantage in the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Born to Fail
[normal]?’
[normal] study, in recognition of the negative effect of living in a cold, damp and overcrowded home on children’s lives. Almost 50 years on, 7 per cent of children – one in 14 – are still growing up in overcrowded housing conditions, having a detrimental impact o
[normal]n their education, health and well-being. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal] [bold]More [bold]must be done to improve the living environments of children and young people [bold]experiencing[bold] poverty. Conditions such as sharing crowded rooms, lack of access to outdoor play environments or a poor diet wil[bold]l directly impact on children and young people’s attainment and their [bold]level of [bold]concentration within the classroom. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Additional evidence[bold]([bold]i[bold])[bold] [bold]The National Children’s Bureau’s and Council for Disabled Children’s[bold] response to consultation[bold]s[bold] on GCSE reforms[bold]22. 
[normal]To improve educational attainment it is
[normal] crucial that children and young people are provided with access to a curriculum and assessment
[normal] processes
[normal], which meets their needs, skills and interests, and enables them to evidence what they are capable of achieving
[normal]. In 
[normal]our 
[normal]response to consultations on 
[normal]GCSE reforms
[normal], we set out a number of recommendations to 
[normal]improve and widen access to Key Stage 4 curriculum and assess
[normal]ment, particularly for disadvantaged or vulnerable pupils.
[normal] Those which are of relevance to the th
[normal]eme of this inquiry include:
[normal]23. 
[normal]Please see our 
[normal]consultation response
[normal] on GCSE reforms, which was informed by a

[normal]organisation
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](ii)[bold] [bold]Centre for Excellence and Outcomes (C4EO) [bold]research review[bold]24. 
[normal]In 2011, the 
[normal]Centre for Excellence and Outcomes published a research review on ‘
[normal]Effective classroom strategies for closing the gap in educational achievement for children and young people living in poverty, including white working-class boys
[normal]’
[normal].
[normal] [bold]The report sought to exa
[normal]mine what 
[normal]works in closing the gap in educational achievement for children and young people living in poverty, including white working-class boys. 
[normal]It identified that that schools are adopting a number of promising strategies to improve outcomes for 
[normal]children living in poverty including:
[normal]25. 
[normal]The report also highlighted
[normal] the valuable contribution that 
[normal]the sector can play in
[normal] improving 
[normal]the attainment and achievement of children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds:
[normal] 
[normal]26.
[normal] [bold]Childr[bold]en and young people[bold] living in poverty respond to classroom interventions that improve instructional processes and teaching methods. Well-specified and well-supported programmes and practices provide the greatest learning outcomes, which motivate and engage
[normal] all learners, not just those from poor backgrounds. Children from deprived areas respond positively to opportunities that raise their aspirations for learning and future success. 
[normal]27.
[normal] [bold]Parents and carers[bold] should be actively engaged by schools to support th
[normal]eir child’s development and learning. Breaking cycles of low aspiration and disenfranchisement with education is an important step for narrowing attainment gaps. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal] [bold]Strong and visionary leadership[bold], provided by head teachers and principals, is often the 
[normal]driving force behind improving outcomes for children living in poverty. Senior decision-makers play a key role in improving teaching strategies, by providing extensive professional development in evidence-based programmes and practices. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29. 
[normal]As the direct
[normal] contact point with pupils in schools, 
[normal]education staff[bold] are the key route to inspiring children from low-income families into learning. They need to develop their teaching methods to meet the needs of these young people in line with evidence-based strategies drawn from the profession and research. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal] [bold]Local [bold]authorities[bold] need to work across the Early Years Foundation Stage sector, primary and secondary schools to support the adoption of evidence-based programmes and practices in schools. They should encourage changes in pedagogy through extensive, school-based 
[normal]professional development. They should plan targeted approaches to raise the aspirations of children from low-income families and engage parents in school life. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In a climate of financial austerity it is crucial that schools target any new resources for po
[normal]or children into interventions that are proven to raise outcomes. 
[normal]National policy-makers[bold] should support the use of evidence-based strategies and interventions, and build more widespread access to programmes of this kind.
