default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefault1. 
defaultThe National Children’s Bureau and Council for Disabled Children welcome
default the Education Select Committee’s inquiry on the under-achieveme
defaultnt in education by working class children.  
defaultThere are
default a wide range of factors, both within and outside the school environment, which are having a deleterious effect on the 
defaulteducational attainment of children and young people from disadvantaged families.   
defaultThe Centre for Social Justice’s recent report ‘
defaultRequires Improvement: the causes of educational failure’
default highlights the critical need to gain a better understanding of why white working class children, and in particular boys, are falling behind their peers
default and not meeting their full potential. 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default defaultOur response draws on NCB’s defaultrecently publisheddefault defaultreport ‘defaultGreater Expectations’default 
defaultThis
default compares 
defaultcurrent 
defaultdata on different aspects of children’s lives 
defaultwith that of 
defaultNCB’s national cohort study 
default‘Born to Fail?’ 
defaultof 
default11-year olds born in 1958
default, and
default published in 1973
default. 
default3.
default defaultNCB sets out a number of recommendations in ‘Greater Expectations’ to request that immediate action is taken to tackle child poverty and redudefaultce inequality experienced by children and young people.default We would welcome the Education Select Committee’s 
defaultconsideration of
default the following, which we believe will lead to improved educational attainment for the most disadvantaged children:
default• defaultThe government should create a Children and Young People’s Board with full ministerial representation to develop and implement a genuinely cross-government multidimensional strategy to reduce the inequality and disadvantage children 
defaultand young people face;
default• defaultThe Office for Budget Responsibility should disclose the impact each Budget would have on child poverty and inequality in the report it publishes alongside th
defaulte Chancellor’s annual statement;
default• defaultAt the next general election, each political party should set
default out in their manifesto the full range of measures they will take to improve the lives of children and young people, reducing inequality in the key areas set out in 
defaultthis report;
default• defaultParliament and civil society should establish a common set of indicators tha
defaultt are used as a matrix to hold government to account for what it is doing to address the inequalities and disadvantage that children face.
default&#xa0;
defaultGreater Expectationsdefault: key findingsdefaulta) Cdefaulthild povertydefault4. 
defaultChildren who live in poverty a
defaultre far less likely to do well at school than their more affluent peers. Too many children are still living in poor living conditions and go to school hungry. 
defaultIn order to defaultraisedefault educational attainment,default 
defaultit is defaultimperative that measures are taken to taken to impdefaultrove children’s experiences within the home environment. default&#xa0;default5. 
defaultThe 
default‘
defaultGreater Expectations’
default 
defaultreport identifies that there are 1.5million more children living in poverty today than there were in 1969. These children are more likely to be obese, less likely to a
defaultchieve a good level of development at age four, liable to under
default-
defaultachieve at age eleven and prone to attaining poorer GSCE results than children from a 
defaultmore affluent
default background. 
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultIn 2013, the 3.5million children living in poverty are more likely to be 
defaultthe victim of an unintentional injury or accident in the home. They are nine times less likely than those living in affluent areas to have access to green space, places to play and to live in environments with better air quality.
default&#xa0;
default7. 
default‘Greater Expectations’
default compares our children’s quality of life with other 
defaultindustrialised
default countries and finds that, if the UK was the best place to grow up:
default•
default              
defaultAlmost one million children could be lifted out of poverty
default;
default•
default              
defaultThe deaths of 172 children through unintentional injuries 
defaultcould be prevented     
default     every year
default;
default•
default              
default320,000 more 15 to 19-year olds would be in education or training
default;
default•
default              
defaultNearly 45,000 fewer 11-year olds would be obese
default;
default•
default              
defaultAnd 770,000 children under 5 would not be living in poor housing.
default&#xa0;

defaultAn analysis of Free Sch
defaultool Meals data shows the impact of child poverty on educational attainment. Young people who

default - and
default more likely to be 
defaultcategorised
default as NEET (16%) 
defaultcompared to non-FSM pupils (8%)
default.
default 
defaultIn addition
default, p
defaultupils with special educational needs are much more likely
default to be eligible for and claim
default free school meals than those 
defaultpupils with no SEN: t

default 
default9
default. 
defaultWe must respond
default to these findings and stop the
default widening gap between poverty and affluence to avoid increasing social division and rising costs to society. 
defaultImproving the qudefaultality of social housingdefault adefaultnd access to outdoor play areasdefault, defaultsupporting parents’ career development and childcare needs, defaultimproving pastoral support for pupils,default defaultand enhancing healthcare defaultand SEN defaultprovision are all measures that will lead to improved educational defaultattainment for white working class children.default

defaultvaries significantly when we look at children from

default 
defaultonly half (48 per cent) of children

defaultWe welcome the expansion of free early education for two year olds, 
defaultin enabling
default children from the

default disadvantaged families 
defaultto

default defaultAccess to early education is also

default.
default default(Please see

default13. 
defaultIt is apparent that society must do
default more to support
default 
defaultdisadvantaged young 
defaultchildren to develop as well
default 
defaultas their more affluent peers.
default 
defaultWhile the UK has above average levels of participation in early education,
default 
defaultaccording to the most recent available comparative international data we

defaultare not doing as well as the best performing count
defaultries – France, Belgium and
default 
defaultDenmark 
default– who have 100% enrolment
default. 
defaultIf defaultthe UKdefault were performing as well as these countries, 300,000 more young children under 3 – a quarter of all children of that age – would bedefault defaultaccessing services to help them develop well.defaultc) Sdefaultchdefaultool yearsdefault14.
default defaultGreater emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring that the education system meets the individual learning and development needs of each and every child. defaultThis coupled with improvements to the home environment, would reduce the attainment gap between disadvantaged and more affluent children. default15. 
defaultIn 
defaultBorn to Fail?
default, NCB found that growing up in disadvantaged circumstances had a negative impact on children’s e
defaultducational outcomes, and on their expectations of continuing in learning beyond the age of 16.
default defaultNearly five decades on
default 
defaultthere is no indication of the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged
default 
defaultchildren at school disappearing. 
defaultToday, a child from a disadvantagedefaultd background is still more likely to achieve a lower academic level than their peers. defaultAlthough eighty per cent of 11 year olds achieve to the expected level in English and 
defaultMaths
default, those children who are eligible for Free School Meals do not do as well with 
defaultonly 66 per cent achieving to the expected level. The gap between the achievements of disadvantaged children and their peers continues at GCSE level, with far fewer achieving at least five A*–C grade GCSEs including English and 
defaultMaths
default.
default 
default&#xa0;default16. 
defaultAlthough literacy rates for children in the UK are above average for OECD countries, we are underperforming when it comes to translating children’s learning into education, training and job opportunities post-16. 
defaultIf we weredefault 
defaultdoing as well as the best perfordefaultming country, 166,700 more 15–19-yeardefault defaultolddefault 
defaultmales  (defaultnearly 10 per cent moredefault),default and 152,500 more 15–19-year olddefault 
defaultfemales (default8 per cent moredefault)default would be in education and training.default&#xa0;
default17. 
defaultChildren living in poverty or deprived areas are doing considerably less well tha
defaultn their more affluent peers. Children who are in care have particularly poor educational outcomes compared with other children; and too many children with special educational needs (SEN) are not being supported to reach their full potential. 
default91% of pupils 
defaultwithout special educational needs go on post-16 education, employment or training, compared to 84% of pupils with a SEN statement, 84% of pupils on School Action and 75% of pupils on School Action Plus.  
defaultThe performance gap between children from poor backg
defaultrounds and those living in richer homes remains just as wide today. A quarter of children from poor backgrounds fail to meet the
default 
defaultexpected attainment level at the end of primary school compared with 3 per cent from affluent
default 
defaultbackgrounds
default. The gap widens at 1
default6 with just one in five children from the poorest families achieving five good GCSEs, including English and 
defaultMaths
default, compared with three quarters from 
defaultmore affluent
default families
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultd) Hdefaultealth inequalitiesdefault18.
default defaultChildren from poorer backgrounds continue to be more defaultlikely than better off children to suffer from ill health, with consequences for their education, employment and health into adulthooddefault.default This is despite the fact that, thanks to medical developments and rising standards of living, we have seen a decline in
default illness and death in childhood since the publication of 
default‘
defaultBorn to Fail?
default’
default.
default&#xa0;default19. 
defaultIn his review of health inequalities, Michael Marmot found that ‘
defaultthere is a social gradient in health – the lower a person’s social position, the 
defaultworse his or her health
default’
default.
default These social inequalities affected children in 
default‘
defaultBorn to Fail?
default’
default 
defaultin 1969, and they are still having a sign
defaultificant an impact on children’s 
defaultwell-being today. Today, a child’s socio-economic circumstances have an effect on some aspects of their health 
defaultbehaviou
defaultr
default. For example, the more affluent school age children are, the more likely they are to eat
default 
defaultfruit daily
default and children living in more affluent areas have better access to play or leisure spaces than children in deprived areas.
default 
default&#xa0;default20. 
defaultIn the most deprived area
defaults 45% of children reported two or more 
defaultunfav
defaultourable
default 
defaultenvironmental conditions compared to 5% of children in
default the least disadvantaged areas. 
defaultPoor housing was used as a key indicator of disadvantage in the 
default‘
defaultBorn to Fail
default?’
default study, in recognition of the negative effect of living in a cold, damp and overcrowded home on children’s lives. Almost 50 years on, 7 per cent of children – one in 14 – are still growing up in overcrowded housing conditions, having a detrimental impact o
defaultn their education, health and well-being. 
default&#xa0;
default21.
default defaultMore defaultmust be done to improve the living environments of children and young people defaultexperiencingdefault poverty. Conditions such as sharing crowded rooms, lack of access to outdoor play environments or a poor diet wildefaultl directly impact on children and young people’s attainment and their defaultlevel of defaultconcentration within the classroom. default&#xa0;defaultAdditional evidencedefault(defaultidefault)default defaultThe National Children’s Bureau’s and Council for Disabled Children’sdefault response to consultationdefaultsdefault on GCSE reformsdefault22. 
defaultTo improve educational attainment it is
default crucial that children and young people are provided with access to a curriculum and assessment
default processes
default, which meets their needs, skills and interests, and enables them to evidence what they are capable of achieving
default. In 
defaultour 
defaultresponse to consultations on 
defaultGCSE reforms
default, we set out a number of recommendations to 
defaultimprove and widen access to Key Stage 4 curriculum and assess
defaultment, particularly for disadvantaged or vulnerable pupils.
default Those which are of relevance to the th
defaulteme of this inquiry include:

default&#xa0;default(ii)default defaultCentre for Excellence and Outcomes (C4EO) defaultresearch reviewdefault24. 
defaultIn 2011, the 
defaultCentre for Excellence and Outcomes published a research review on ‘
defaultEffective classroom strategies for closing the gap in educational achievement for children and young people living in poverty, including white working-class boys
default’
default.
default defaultThe report sought to exa
defaultmine what 
defaultworks in closing the gap in educational achievement for children and young people living in poverty, including white working-class boys. 
defaultIt identified that that schools are adopting a number of promising strategies to improve outcomes for 
defaultchildren living in poverty including:
default25. 
defaultThe report also highlighted
default the valuable contribution that 
defaultthe sector can play in
default improving 
defaultthe attainment and achievement of children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds:
default 
default26.
default defaultChildrdefaulten and young peopledefault living in poverty respond to classroom interventions that improve instructional processes and teaching methods. Well-specified and well-supported programmes and practices provide the greatest learning outcomes, which motivate and engage
default all learners, not just those from poor backgrounds. Children from deprived areas respond positively to opportunities that raise their aspirations for learning and future success. 
default27.
default defaultParents and carersdefault should be actively engaged by schools to support th
defaulteir child’s development and learning. Breaking cycles of low aspiration and disenfranchisement with education is an important step for narrowing attainment gaps. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default defaultStrong and visionary leadershipdefault, provided by head teachers and principals, is often the 
defaultdriving force behind improving outcomes for children living in poverty. Senior decision-makers play a key role in improving teaching strategies, by providing extensive professional development in evidence-based programmes and practices. 
default&#xa0;
default29. 
defaultAs the direct
default contact point with pupils in schools, 
defaulteducation staffdefault are the key route to inspiring children from low-income families into learning. They need to develop their teaching methods to meet the needs of these young people in line with evidence-based strategies drawn from the profession and research. 
default&#xa0;
default30.
default defaultLocal defaultauthoritiesdefault need to work across the Early Years Foundation Stage sector, primary and secondary schools to support the adoption of evidence-based programmes and practices in schools. They should encourage changes in pedagogy through extensive, school-based 
defaultprofessional development. They should plan targeted approaches to raise the aspirations of children from low-income families and engage parents in school life. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn a climate of financial austerity it is crucial that schools target any new resources for po
defaultor children into interventions that are proven to raise outcomes. 
defaultNational policy-makersdefault should support the use of evidence-based strategies and interventions, and build more widespread access to programmes of this kind.
