[[[Camden Council]]]&#xa0;1.1. The London Borough of Camden includes some of the wealthiest and the most deprived neighbourhoods in London. Housing costs are extremely high and it has one of London’s largest social housing stocks with a third of the population living in social rented accommodation. Another third of households live in the private rented sector, the sixth highest proportion in England and Wales. &#xa0;1.2. 28,000 or 30% of all households in the borough claim Housing Benefit. The Council estimates that around 5,400 of these have been affected by one or more of the three major Housing Benefit changes. According to analysis by Sheffield Hallam University, Camden is by no means the most affected borough in London (ranking 15th of 33 and 112th of 384 nationally for overall loss of benefit per working age adult). However high housing costs and high demand for social housing make the impacts more severe in Camden. The Labour-controlled council has made preserving the social mix a priority for the Council. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1. An important indicator of success or failure for a local authority in dealing with the Housing Benefit changes is the number of households who are statutory homeless or in temporary accommodation (TA). Both have remained at low levels so far contrary to London and national trends. Just 11 households a month on average have been accepted as statutorily homeless (Part VII) since May 2012 and TA numbers are still on a long term downward trajectory. &#xa0;2.2. Camden has been helped in its response to welfare changes by its 

[[[long term investment in homelessness prevention services]]], a response to the long standing housing issues in the borough. The Council has an excellent track record in placing households at risk of homelessness in sustainable tenancies. The service has supported nearly 500 households affected by the LHA cap; 30% of them were helped to stay in their homes and 32% were helped to make a successful bid for a council property in the borough or move to other private rented sector accommodation. Only 11 of these households ended up making a Part VII homelessness application. &#xa0;2.3. The Council has also been proactive in supporting households affected by the Social Sector Size Criteria (SSSC) primarily by encouraging moves to right-size accommodation and to provide advice and support, including DHPs where needed. Since January 2013, housing officers have advised over 1,000 council tenants. Support for under-occupying households includes a scheme called “First Choice Plus” through which council voids are decorated to a higher standard than usual and reserved for under-occupiers, cash incentives, handholding and proactive help with moving, and advice and assistance to help under-occupiers maximise their chances of achieving a move through various social tenant mobility schemes, including HousingMoves.&#xa0;2.4. Another success factor for the borough has been 

[[[close collaboration between council departmen]]]

[[[ts and with local partners]]]. The best solution for families who may be affected by total benefit cap (TBC) is finding work over 16 hours thus exempting them from the cap. This requires close work with the family, Job Centre Plus and other local agencies. Housing officers are referring people to Job Centre Plus, advice agencies or children’s centres for employment support. As of September 2013, Job Centre Plus had supported 150 people who would have been affected by the cap into employment. When the Council recently let new advice contracts, it completely changed the relationship with local advice agencies by setting up the Camden Advice Partnership to foster a more equal and collaborative relationship. &#xa0;2.5. However finding work is not viable for all affected households. Many face multiple barriers to employment. In these cases, the Council has been making flexible use of Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) – in one case, the family moved out of London but a DHP was used to pay for the daughter’s rail season ticket to allow her to remain at school in Camden and sit her exams. The purpose of DHPs is to buy households time to find a long-term solution to their housing needs. To do this effectively, the Benefits service (which authorise the payment) and housing officers (who provide advice and support) must work closely together. In this respect, Camden has benefitted from retaining its housing stock in-house – working relationships with housing associations have been less close and anecdotal evidence from elsewhere suggests that boroughs with ALMOs have struggled to respond effectively to the challenges of welfare reform. &#xa0;2.6.  Camden Council believes that its response to welfare changes have once again demonstrated the effectiveness of local government and its local partners against a back drop of major pressures on budgets. While the government have of course provided additional funding to support councils, this is in a wider context of large scale cuts to their budgets. Local knowledge, partnerships and relationships with residents of local authorities have been a major factor in this effectiveness. This is why Camden along with other local authorities has deep concerns about the end of its role in the administration of Housing Benefit and the ability of the DWP to deliver Universal Credit effectively. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1. As noted above, one of the major impacts of the changes for local authorities is 

[[[on homelessness and ]]]

[[[TA]]]. If, as a result of Housing Benefit changes, a household becomes homeless, the council’s statutory duties have resource implications especially if they are placed in TA. The introduction of the TBC will make it harder to procure TA at an affordable rate and in some cases, the council has leased properties for several years that will no longer be fully covered by Housing Benefit for which the Council will need to make up the shortfall. The Council has been working with TA households at risk of the cap to place them in more affordable accommodation.&#xa0;3.2.  As well as the impact on households currently in TA, there is a significant risk that Housing Benefit changes will increase demand for TA over the medium term. This did not happen with the LHA changes, largely due to the new Localism Act power, the inherent greater mobility of private rented sector tenants and not least the council’s interventions. These interventions cost the council money both through additional placements in the private rented sector and the fact that some LHA households moved to the social rented sector thus taking that housing away from other needs groups. However there are reasons to think that the SSSC and TBC will result in increased homelessness and demand for TA. Already a majority of our tenants affected by the SSSC are in arrears and some will eventually become at risk of eviction. This will result in additional costs to the council regardless of whether they become homeless or are prevented from becoming homeless by council intervention.&#xa0;3.3. The new power to discharge their homelessness responsibilities by placing households in the private rented sector has helped local authorities in this area. In addition, the DWP have greatly increased funding for Discretionary Housing Payments – Camden received £1.6m in 2012/13. We are using DHPs to prevent homelessness in the short term. For example, we are giving DHPs to all households affected by the TBC to give them time to adjust to their reduced benefit. However we do not know from year to year what our DHP allocation will be and our concern is that the full effects of housing benefit changes will be felt in future years when there may not be sufficient DHP funding to cope.  We are anticipating that DHP claims will increase significantly from now on as the combined effects of welfare changes, especially the Benefit Cap, impact on claimants alongside increasing cost of living pressures from fuel and food bills. We are doing all we can to alert households to the consequences of burying their heads in the sand but we cannot oblige them to take action. In addition, DHPs can only be used to top up Housing Benefit payments, they do not cover the costs of these interventions which the council has had to fund itself (see below). &#xa0;3.4. Although we cannot quantify it at this stage, homelessness, TA and prevention activities are a clear example of how reducing the welfare spend could result in increased costs for local authorities. This ‘cost shunting’ is creating pressures on local authority budgets not least because funding from central government continues to be reduced. It will result in further difficult budget decisions for councils and thus to ‘blame shunting’ from government to local authorities&#xa0;3.5. A further concern and pressure on DHPs and Council funds is the DWP’s decision not to exempt Local Authority-owned 

[[[supported accommodation]]] from the Benefit Cap in Metropolitan and Unitary authorities. The support given to these vulnerable claimants through supported accommodation is vital and we cannot understand the DWP’s rationale for exempting such people in District Authorities but not in a London Borough such as Camden.  &#xa0;3.6. Welfare changes have resulted in additional short-term 

[[[demands on council ]]]

[[[services]]] for example visiting affected households and working with RSLs to identify households affected by the SSSC. In 2013/14 the Council expects that over £800,000 of existing resource will be diverted to work related to responding to the welfare changes, including staff in housing and benefit teams offering support and advice to residents.

[[[ ]]]&#xa0;3.7. In the longer term, the introduction of UC will mean councils will no longer be responsible for administering Housing Benefit. In theory this should be cost-neutral to the council. However in the interim period this makes it difficult for the Council to retain or recruit benefits officers. This issue is compounded by the uncertainty regarding the timetable for rolling out UC – it is difficult for the council to allocate resources in this context. &#xa0;3.8. Breaking the link between councils and Housing Benefit has other unintended consequences. Housing Benefit is a gateway benefit for other benefits such as free school meals and Blue Badges which will continue to be administered by local authorities. This will require real-time accurate information flows from the DWP to the local authority. We are concerned that the DWP has not given sufficient consideration to these future data needs for local authorities. &#xa0;3.9. There are impacts on other council services resulting from households moving because of welfare changes. We know that over 1,000 children resident in Camden and attending Camden schools are affected by housing benefit changes (note that many children attending Camden schools live outside the borough and vice versa). If these children have to move schools, this not only potentially disrupts their schooling but also creates transactional costs for the school and the local authority. We are planning to produce an estimate of how many children have moved schools as a result of the LHA changes. &#xa0;3.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In theory, the 

[[[SSSC]]] could provide an additional impetus for council’s tenants to downsize, thus making better use of the council’s limited housing stock, reducing overcrowding etc. This is a particular issue in Camden as we have a large stock of 1 bed properties and fewer larger properties. 28% of affected tenants have registered to downsize and 46 households affected by the SSSC have moved since 1 April. However evidence suggests many affected tenants are not prepared to move and those that are are not bidding on available smaller properties. This could be because these smaller properties are unsuitable or not attractive.  There are additional transactional costs associated with an increase in moves within the council’s housing stock, most notably in properties which have received adaptations for disabled residents. In these cases, we are currently meeting shortfalls with DHPs but this is not sustainable in the long term. &#xa0;3.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Nearly three quarters of SSSC-affected households said they will manage the shortfall in their Housing Benefit when contacted by council officers. The council is concerned that some of these households, along with those who have registered to downsize but have not moved, are storing up trouble for the future rather than genuinely managing their finances. This concern is borne out by arrears data - the percentage of SSSC-affected households in arrears has increased from 42% in April to 54% in August and is far higher than the rate for all tenants (40%). While this rate includes all households in arrears, no matter how small the amount or when the debt was accrued, the average amount owed by SSSC-affected households is £557.42, far higher than for all tenants. The council faces a difficult choice if and when arrears reach a critical point for these households – eviction (which may result in further costs to the council in homelessness and TA) or somehow handling the arrears (e.g. by writing them off). We are not yet at this point, but again we are concerned that the government is robbing Peter to pay Paul – saving money from the benefits budget at the expense of local authorities. &#xa0;3.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If this is true of the SSSC, it is all the more so of 

[[[Universal Credit]]]. Over the years, a shortage of social rented properties in Camden and across London has had the effect of a general increase in the vulnerability of council tenants (for example, lone parents make up 10% of all households in the borough compared with 23% in council rented properties). Council tenants on Housing Benefit are unused to budgeting for their housing costs which is likely to result in increased arrears. We are also concerned that the digital by default policy is misguided given the vulnerability of many Housing Benefit claimants and this has been borne out by the findings of the UC pilots concerning digital exclusion.&#xa0;3.13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The replacement of Council Tax Benefit (CTB) with a localised 

[[[Council Tax Reduction ]]]

[[[(CTR)]]] 

[[[Scheme]]] posed a dilemma for the Council. If we had adopted a scheme that offered the same level of support by absorbing the 10% reduction in funding from central government, we would have created a permanent funding pressure of around £2.5m a year. We accepted the one year transitional  grant which allowed us to limit the minimum amount people had to pay to 8.5% of their council tax liability (between £1 and £4 a week). &#xa0;3.14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are consulting on the scheme for 2014/15 – our preferred option is to retain this year’s scheme but with an amendment to increase the earnings disregard by £10 a week to improve incentives to work. This will add to the ongoing funding pressure but we feel it is the right thing to do. &#xa0;3.15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We feel the CTR is a particularly blatant example of ‘blame shunting’ to local government. We understand that all parts of government need to make savings and local government does have a strong track record in this area. We have been faced with a difficult choice between increased costs and creating additional financial burdens for low income households which may end up being self-defeating if they are not able to pay. We have chosen a middle way but this has still resulted in a budget pressure for the council. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1. The changes to the 

[[[LHA]]] are the only Housing Benefit change for which we have information about longer term impacts. However the council has limited information because we only know who claims and has stopped claiming in the borough.&#xa0;4.2. There is no doubt that there have been changes since the LHA changes were introduced in April 2011. Of the 1,800 households which were capped in April 2011, only 44% were still claiming LHA in Camden in June 2013. 15% had secured a council or RSL tenancy in Camden and 40% had stopped claiming LHA in Camden – they may have moved, found employment etc. &#xa0;4.3. The overall stock of LHA claimants has decreased by just 2% so while some have left the borough, there are more taking their place. However the geographical distribution of LHA claimants in Camden has changed with increases in cheaper areas and decreases in Central London. The profile of LHA claimants appears to have changed as well - the trend seems to be towards smaller households with fewer children. &#xa0;4.4. This evidence appears to support the commonly held thesis that the impact of welfare changes in London is for people to move out of Central and Inner London to Outer London and beyond. However we cannot say for sure how much of this change in down to the LHA changes and how much would have happened anyway, especially given LHA claimants are generally more mobile than other HB claimants. &#xa0;4.5. There are also a large number of households (44% of the original capped cohort) who are still in the borough. Anecdotal evidence from the households supported by the council’s housing department is that they would rather struggle with rent and/or become overcrowded than leave their community and the networks they have built up. The impacts of these coping mechanisms will only be felt over the longer term. &#xa0;4.6. We are finding it increasingly difficult to place vulnerable households at risk of homelessness in the private rented sector in the borough. Before April 2011, 62% of placements in the private rented sector were in the borough - this has fallen to 35% since April 2011. Moving outside the borough can cause disruption to children’s schooling, social networks etc and risks increasing a household’s vulnerability.&#xa0;4.7. We are concerned about the long term impact of the LHA changes on the social mix of the borough. Market rents in the private rented sector are steadily increasing while LHA rates in Camden are capped or kept at a very low rate of increase. If this continues for several years, even the relatively affordable area around Kilburn High Road will become unaffordable for LHA claimants. Although one of the stated aims of the LHA changes is “housing benefit should not support people who are not working to live in accommodation that would be out of the reach of most people in work”, around half of current claimants in Camden are in work. Any further divergence between LHA rates and market rents will mean that workers on low incomes will find it increasingly difficult to rent in the private sector in Camden, especially as Camden’s social housing stock is under such pressure.&#xa0;4.8. The effects of the 

[[[SSSC]]] have largely yet to be felt. However as noted above, we are concerned about arrears for this group - over half of affected households are in arrears. &#xa0;4.9. By definition this group has few dependent children. However we are concerned that disabled people may have to leave an adapted home. In particular, households with disabled adult children do not get an additional room under SSSC and we know of families in this position in Camden. &#xa0;4.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We do not yet have full data about the group of people who will be affected by the 

[[[TBC]]]. However based on May 2013 DWP data, 80% of households that are at risk of the cap have children. The total number of children is 1,647 (about 4% of all children in Camden). 63% are in households with 4 or more children. The scale of the shortfalls involved (on average £70 per week per affected households, much higher in many cases) mean that households are unlikely to be able to absorb them and will need to move or find work. Although some claimants at risk of being affected have found work (see above), the profile of many of the households involved  – number of children, language issues (many affected families are from BME backgrounds) and poor health – means that finding work will be difficult. Some households in the private rented sector may be able to move to the social rented sector although this is not guaranteed to bring them under the cap (40% of households are already in the social rented sector). For many households, leaving the borough and probably London entirely may be the only viable option.&#xa0;4.11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Council believes that the LHA changes and the TBC do not reflect the very high housing costs in Inner and Central London and it seems unreasonable to apply the same caps to London as to the rest of the country. The TBC is based on the national average household income of £26,000 whereas average household income in Camden is more like £33,000. The effect is to make most of the borough unaffordable to housing benefit claimants (at least in the private rented sector), reducing the social mix of the borough and in some cases, requiring households to leave their community.&#xa0;4.12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The impacts of the new 

[[[Council Tax Reduction]]]

[[[ scheme]]] on residents are discussed above. We have tried to set CTR at a level which is not too burdensome on either individual CTR claimants or council budgets. For many, this will come on top of the changes to Housing Benefit and thus may have a cumulative impact. However CTR is a relatively small proportion of it and we are confident that the support available for housing benefit claimants described elsewhere above will help these households to cope. &#xa0;27 September 2013&#xa0;
