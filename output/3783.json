What evidence is there to support this view?The following background may be helpful:\nPrions are infectious pathogens which cause lethal degenerative brain diseases in humans and other mammalian species. These diseases include scrapie in sheep \nand\n goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in human\ns. Prions are distinct from other infectious agents in \nthat they \nlack their own genetic material. They are thought to be composed of misfolded and aggregated form\ns\n of one of the body’s own proteins, the prion protein, and propagate by a process of seeded p\nrotein polymerisation\n (for review see\n1\n)\n. \nThe prion proteins in different mammalian species are closely similar in structure and p\nrions from one species are able to infect another although usu\nally with much lower efficiency than between individuals of the same species.\n \nVariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) \nwas first recognised in the UK in 1995 and \nis caused \nby \na \nstrain of prions quite distinct from those causing classical CJD and which was \nshown to the same as that causing BSE\n2-4\n. \nExposure of the UK population to BSE prions via dietary and other routes was widespre\nad. It is estimated that up to three million UK cattle were infected with BSE of which around 750,000 were slaughtered for human consumption\n5\n. In addition to primary infections from direct dietary or other exposure to BSE prions, concerns of secondary, human-to-human transmission have \naffected endoscopy, ophthalmology, surgery, dentistry, organ transplantation, blood products/transfusion, and emerging stem cell therapies. S\necondary \ninfe\nctions have \nbeen documented from use of contaminated blood and blood products\n6-8\n. \nAlthough the number of clinically recognised patients with vCJD has been thankfully relatively small (~200), the number of silent infections \nappears to be \nfar l\narger.\nP\nrion infections are associated with long \nasymptomatic incubation periods. Studies of the epidemic prion disease kuru in Papua New Guinea\n,\n and of iatrogenic CJD resulting from exposure to contaminated human growth hormone\n,\n demonstrate incubation periods spanning decades\n. Cases of iatrogenic CJD oc\ncur every year in the UK, with recent incubation times estimated to be over 35 years. Approximately 3% of patients exposed to human growth hormone have developed clinical disease. I\nncubation periods in excess of 50 years have been documented in kuru\n9\n. \nIt is important also to appreciate that these incubation periods arise from same species (human-to-human) \ntransmission, cross-species transmissions are typically associated with much longer incubation periods which may approach the natural lifespan of the species concerned. \nAnother important consideration is that \nit has been know\nn\n for some years that infection\n of animals with prions from another species can result in a long\n-\nterm infection or carrier state. Such subclinically infected animals may not develop the neurological disease during their lifespan but develop high levels of infectious prions. Transmission\n of such prions to more animals of the same species is typically associated with 100% lethality\n10\n.\nUK prevalence estimates\nMy laboratory reported in 1997 that in vCJD, in sharp contrast to classical CJD where prio\nns are largely confined to the brain and spinal cord, prions were \nmuch \nmore widespread \nin the body \nand may be readily detected in so-called lymphoreticular tissues including the tonsil \nand appendix\n11, 12\n. I \nsuggested at\n that time to the Department of Health that this finding potentially allowed an estimate of the prevalence\n of silent vCJD prion infection in the community by an anonymous screen of archived or discarded surgical appendix or tonsil specimens. \nA number of such studies have since been conducted\n13-17\n. \nA retrospective study of 12,674 archived surgical lymphoret\nicular specimens (predominantly appendix) in 2004 found three positives and estimated a prevalence of infection in the UK population of 237 per million (95% confidence interval 49-692 per million)\n14\n. Based on this study a prevalence estima\nte of 1 in 4000 was recommended by the \nformer \nSpongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) for managing public health risks\n18, 19\n. Further studies of tonsil specimens did not significantly refine these estimates\n15, 16\n and a further study was initiated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on advice from SEA\nC with the aim of analysing a minimum of 30,000 appendix samples. The study found 16 definite positive appendices out of 32,441 suitable samples examined\n,\n equating to a final prevalence estimate of 493 per million (95% CI: 282 to 801 per million)\n17\n.\n The prevalence in those born in 1941-60 (733 per million, 269 to 1596 per million) did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985 (412 per million, 198 to 758 per \nmillion) and was similar in both sexes and across the three broad geographical areas sampled. \n This rate is consistent with the range of previous studies but is more precise and has a higher central estimate of around 1 infection in 2000\n equating to around\n 20-30,000 infected carriers in the UK\n. \nThe extraordinary range of incubation periods seen in natural human prion infections and the existence of subclinical carrier states in animal models exposed to prions from another species offer potential explanatio\nns for the huge discrepancy between estimates of infection prevalence and clinical cases\n20\n. While such carriers may live a normal lifespan without overt neurological disease, same species subpassage of infectivity is associated with 100% lethality\n10\n arguing that asymptomatic human carriers would pose a distinct risk of transferring a fatal prion infection to others via medical and surgical procedures. Although the risks of iatrogenic prion transmission through s\nurgery and solid organ transplantation should not be underestimated, the greatest threat to public safety is thought to be posed by the transfusion of prion-infected blood. The reality of vCJD transmission by this route has been known for some years and st\nudy of a small cohort known to have received blood from donors who subsequently developed vCJD suggests the risk is very high to such recipients\n6, 7, 21\n. Emerging experimental evidence from sheep scra\npie\n22\n (thought to be a good model of vCJD\n) are unexpectedly indicating blood transfusion may be a more efficient infection route than direct inoculation into the brain. Indeed, as little as 200\n\nl of infected blood is \ne\nfficient in transmitting disease by transfusion in sheep\n23\n.\nIt is conceivable that there could be some hitherto unknown explanation for abnormal PrP in the appendix, unrelated to vCJD prion infection (\nthat is, \nfalse positive\ns\n). Further work looking at this possibility is being done by HPA using\n appendices removed before the BSE epidemic. However, b\nased on a wealth of data from examination of \nhumans and animal tissues\n, a\nbnormal \nprion protein \nin the appendix \nis highly likely to be an accurate \ndiagnostic \nmarker for vCJD infection. \nI\nt should be note\nd that even the alarming estimate of 1 in 2000 infections in the UK population \ncould \nbe an underestimate since the sensitivity of the method used on appendix samples in carriers is not known and there could be significant numbers of false negative\n (true ca\nrriers in which abnormal prion protein is not detected in the appendix by these methods)\n, indeed disease-related PrP is sometimes not detected in appendix samples \nfrom\n patients who have died of definite vCJD \n24\n. \nIn summary, our best estimate today is that ~1 in 2000 of the UK population is infected with vCJD prions. However, it is important to understand that what is really important from a public health risk management perspecti\nve is how many people ha\nve\n detectable prions in their blood rather \nthan \na\nppendix \nsince it is blood that presents the greatest risk of transmission to others. Consequently, \nprevalence studies using a blood test are \nalso \nneeded (see below).  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How might this subclinical infection rate translate to future cases of vCJD?&#xa0; What are the key uncertainties in the relationship between subclinical and clinical vCJD?In order to predict the number of future cases of vCJD we \nwould \nneed to know \nwhat \nproportion\n of subclinical carriers will develop clinical disease, the\n range of \nincubation \nperiods\n, and the mortality from other causes in this group\n prior to the development of clinical prion disease\n. \nIt is possible that, as in some animal models, many of these indi\nviduals will be healthy carriers throughout their lives even if they live to advanced age. However, it will be many years before we know how many such subclinically infected individuals \nultimately \ndevelop disease. \nRecently published \nexperiments in mice th\nat were genetically engineered to \nmake \nhuman prion protein showed that inoculation of these animals with vCJD usually result\ned\n in prion infection in \nlymphoreticular \ntissue, \nbut \nonly a minority of \nthese \nanimals developed clinical disease in their lifetime\n25\n. These experiments are a striking parallel with the current situation in the UK with a remarkably high prevalence of vCJD infection, but a much lower incidence of clinical disease\n20\n.\nWe do not under\nstand what determin\nes whether a person will \nremain a \nhealthy carrier\n of \nprion infection or develop \nthe clinical state, for example whether there are environmental triggers that might lead to a carrier developing the disease. We do know\n,\n however\n,\n of powerful genetic factors that affect susceptibility to, and incubation periods, of prion diseases including vCJD. \nThe most important of these is a polymorphism in the human prion protein itself which exists in two common forms known as M and V so there\n are three genetic types in the population: MM, MV and VV\n26, 27\n. All definite vCJD patients to date have been MM (a genetic type seen in abou\nt a third of the population). It is likely that clinical cases will occur in the other genotypes (VV and MV) but may have longer average incubation periods and also may present with a different pattern of disease that may not meet the diagnostic criteria o\nf vCJD and indeed may be mistaken for classical CJD\n28, 29\n. One pa\ntient with probable vCJD was of the MV genotype\n30\n. \nAll three genotypes were represented in the 16 appendices found to show subclinical vCJD infection in the HPA prevalence \nstudies. \nOther genes have been identified with an effect on disease susceptibility or incubation period (for review see\n31\n)\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What are the likely routes of infection for vCJD? How have the potential modes of transmission changed over time?The most likely cause of the primary epidemic of vCJD was \ndietary \nexposure to food products \ncontaining brain or spinal cord tissues from cattle \ninfected with BSE. \nBSE prions also readily infect sheep and it is conceivable sheep-passaged BSE prions could also have been involved. Bovine products were widely used for other \npurposes, for instance in cosmetics and production of certain medicines including vaccines although no epidemiological link with vCJD has been demonstrated. The number of primary vCJD cases has fallen steadily in recent years. Secondary \ntransmission \nis now\n the principal concern \nthrough blood\n, blood products, tissue or organ donation and contamination of surgical (including dental) instruments\n. \nWhile transmission of classical CJD by surgical instruments and tissue grafts has been well documented, to date vCJ\nD transmission between humans has only been documented by via blood transfusion and use of blood products. However, the apparently high carrier state of vCJD prion infection in the UK population and much wider distribution of prions outside the brain and s\npinal cord in vCJD would argue that secondary vCJD cases arising from contaminated surgical instruments or tissue or organ transplantation should be anticipated in the years ahead. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What procedures are currently in place to monitor, control and prevent further spread of vCJD across the UK population? What more could be done to reduce the risk posed by vCJD?Monitoring of vCJD clinical incidence is primarily the responsibility of the National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit \n(NCJDRSU) \nin Edinburg\nh. Most cases are identified following the referral of \nsuspect cases by local neurologists, psychiatrists, general physicians and GPs to NCJDRSU or the NHS National Prion Clinic\n (\nNPC\n) in London\n. Telephone conversations several times weekly, and a formal mo\nnthly meeting between \nthe NCJDRSU and NPC\n,\n \nensures complete case coordination. There are concerns that cases \nmight be missed in elderly patients\n where other causes of dementia are common\n, either because the classical clinical features of \nv\nCJD are not manif\nest, or that investigations required to raise concerns about CJD are not requested, or are misinterpreted. \nSeveral measures have been taken to minimise the risks of transmission by blood \ntransfusion \nor \nuse of \nblood product\ns\n. \nThe ongoing disruption and cos\nts to the NHS as a consequence of \nthese \nmeasures\n -\n of uncertain efficacy or necessity\n -\n&#xa0;\nare\n&#xa0;\nremarkable. From 1997-2005 a series of measures were introduced, including leucodepletion of blood, sourcing of plasma from non-UK sources, exclusion of transfusion\n recipients from donation, use of recombinant clotting factors for patients with bleeding disorders and ceasing the use of UK plasma for fractionation and export\n32\n.\nIn 2010 the cumulative costs to the NHS Blood and Transfusion service were estimated at £540M, with a recurrent annual cost of £40M. Costs associated\n with other parts of the NHS have not been precisely estimated, however, the recurrent annual cost of synthetic clotting factors for patients with bleeding disorders is approximately £200M\n33\n.\nConcern regarding secondary transmission of vCJD has also had major effects on public health policy internationally. For exa\nmple, the USA and Australia exclude those with a cumulative residence of six months or more in Europe as blood donors\n,\n with considerable disruption to the blood supply in some areas\n and for the US military\n. \nWhat more could be done to reduce the risk posed\n by vCJD? Risk could be effectively managed by: \n(i) \nthe development of a blood test to allow screening of donated blood for \nvCJD \nprion \ninfection \nthereby allowing exclusion of infected units from use for blood transfusion or production of blood products; (i\ni) screening patients due to undergo certain surgical procedures involving tissues at higher risk for prion infection (for example brain, spinal cord, the back of the eye, or certain dental procedures involving nervous tissue) so that particular precaution\ns could be taken with those testing positive to minimise risk of infection of other patients; (iii) use of effective prion decontamination methods \nto prevent vCJD transmission on surgical instruments\n (prions \nstick avidly to surgical stainless steel and oth\ner surfaces and \nare partially resistant to normal hospital sterilisation methods)\n; (iv) effective treatments for prion infection are being developed and might allow not only treatment of patients with the disease, but also treatment of asymptomatic infecte\nd individuals (for example those testing positive on suitable blood or other tests) to eradicate the infection before symptoms develop.\nOver a decade ago, \nthe Department of Health invited and funded a large number of research proposals to develop novel met\nhods for prion decontamination. This led to several products that might be used in a hospital environment. The MRC Prion Unit undertook a significant research project funded by this programme and developed an effective enzyme/detergent mixture that effecti\nvely destroyed prions on metal surfaces\n34, 35\n. We were successful in obtaining an industrial partner (DuPont) to turn this laboratory research into a practical product but this was not used in the NHS and is no longer in produ\nction. The product was formulated for use as a \nsimple \npre-soak to prion decontaminate instruments before they went into the standard hospital washer\n-\ndisinfector machines. The \nlack\n of take up of this or other prion decontamination technologies \nin the NHS \nprobably\n precluded further commercial investment to develop a second generation product which might have been integrate\nd\n into washer\n-\ndisinfector\n cycles for \nimproved\n ease of use. \nExtensive research effort internationally has gone into developing a blood te\nst for vCJD. My Unit developed the first such test which was reported in the \nLancet\n in 2011\n36\n. \nI\n discussed the test at high level with the Department of Health (Public Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer) in 2011 who advised they were not in \na \nposition to fund further evaluation or pre\nvalence screening and recommended transfer to a commercial partner. Despite further discussions with diagnostics companies\n,\n facilitated by MRC Technology\n,\n no such \ncommercial \npartner was identified. The clear feedback \nwas \nthat further \ntest development and \ne\nvaluation of the test specificity and a UK prevalence study to determine the market for such a test would be needed to make a business case. In order to maintain momentum in translating our technology \nto protect the public health \nthe Unit has, with additio\nnal assistance from MRC, confirmed our initial specificity estimates with a much larger control \ncohort. This study was initiated following discussions with Professor Mark Turner (Chair, Prion Working Group of the National Blood Service) and Dr Lorna Willia\nmson (Medical &amp; Research Director, NHSBT) regarding the requirements of the UK’s blood services. \nThe NHS Blood and Transfusion (NHSBT), in consultation with other European partners, formalised a common technical specification requiring screening tests achi\neve a minimum diagnostic specificity of 99.5% determined from a cohort of 5000 samples\n37\n.\n \nWe have now analysed 5000 anonymous donor samples provided by the American Red Cross. This is a cohort of samples from a nation with very low exposure to BSE. The conclusion of this study has been no pos\nitive reactions from the total of 5000 US samples\n demonstrating adequate \ns\npecificity\n for our proposal to \nconduct \na \nlarge \nscale comparison of \n \n20,000 \nanonymous blood samples from \nthe \nUK and USA.\n \nThe establishment of accurate prevalence estimates for \nprionaemia will provide the essential information to determine if routine screening for vCJD infection in blood donations, and in patients prior to high risk surgical procedures and tissue and organ donation\n,\n is required. This is not only important from th\ne perspective of risk management and protecting the health of the public but also to \ndemonstrate a business case to justify the \ncommercial investment required to \nproduce a \nrobust \nhigh throughput test from our laboratory prototype.\n The primary benefit of co\nmmercialising the assay would be the availability of a cost-effective screening test for use with donated blood and organs to prevent iatrogenic infection and safeguard the blood supply. The ability to screen human blood may ultimately obviate the need to \nimport frozen plasma from the USA and allow UK based industries to recommence processing and sale of UK sourced plasma and plasma products.\nIn addition to routine screening applications, knowledge of the background level of infection in the general populat\nion is required for the interpretation of test results if offered to individuals deemed to at risk of iatrogenic disease some of whom have already sought testing. After the successive tragedies of HIV and HCV infection in groups \nmultiply exposed to blood p\nroducts, \nthere is understandably heightened concern about risks of prion disease transmission in blood products. A useable predictive test in these groups may offer an opportunity both for individuals to resolve issues of personal risk, and for anonymous s\ntudies to resolve issues of risk for groups of individuals following the formal notification exercise instigated by the HPA. \nFinally, the large international research effort on understanding prion diseases since the arrival of BSE has led to them becoming\n arguably the best understood cause of dementia. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the fundamental molecular mechanisms seen in prion disease may be relevant for much commoner neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and motor neuro\nne disease (see\n38\n for lay review). \nA number of potential therapeutics are in development at the MRC Prion Unit and elsewhere internationally that might allow both effective treatment and post-exposu\nre prophylaxis to prevent development of clinical disease in healthy but infected individuals.\n&#xa0;\nReference List\n              \n1.   \n  \n              \nCollinge,J. &amp; Clarke,A.
