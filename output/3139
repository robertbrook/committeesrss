[normal]Written evidence from Scott Electrotechnical Assessment Link Ltd [bold]Re: Building Regulations applying to electrical installations and repairs in dwellings[bold]I am an Electrician and registered Electrical Engineer, with in excess of 36 years 
[normal]experience, including the assessment of the technical standard of electrical contractors and electrical installation work; I am very aware of the hazards of unsafe installation practices. I have been moved by dismay to write to you after watching the prese
[normal]ntation to Communities and Local Government Select Committee on the 02 September 2013.
[normal]The presentation by the Electrical Safety Council and other interested parties associated to the current voluntary electrical registration schemes reflected their object
[normal]ive of self survival; and nothing else.
[normal]Whilst I do not believe the consumer; or the electrical contracting industry would benefit from a statutory register; the current arrangement and the Electrical Safety Council has achieved very little to raise consum
[normal]er safety awareness or provided recognised guidance for the selection of a competent electrical installer. The competitive market between registration bodies also creates many negative aspects and wasting of revenue; the two registers of domestic installer
[normal]s is one result of this wasted energy.
[normal]The majority of consumers are not aware of the existence of either of the registers, or any of the registration schemes; let alone the Electrical Safety Council; further despite over 50 years of operation few members 
[normal]of the public have heard of the NICEIC; the same is now sadly true of NAPIT, ELECSA et al. This is a result of poor marketing ability, complacency and lack of vision within all of the organisations.
[normal]The consequential in-fighting that is now evolving betwee
[normal]n registration bodies is also negative to the industry and significantly detracts from the objective of consumer safety.
[normal]Any register of electricians must cover the whole of the industry, including commercial and industrial providers, since the smaller con
[normal]sumer's knowledge in these specialist fields are no different to that of the domestic consumer; and the risk to the public is no less. It is acknowledged that places of work are within the scope of the Electricity at work regulations (SI 635 1989); however
[normal] this is a reactive, rather that a proactive approach to the issue.
[normal]There is also another specific field which lacks control; that is not sufficiently addressed; that of inspecting and testing of existing installations; where many electricians lack the r
[normal]equisite skills and experience to evaluate and report on work that has been completed by a third party. We are currently in a ludicrous position where domestic installers are acknowledged as competent to verify third party installations; whereas experience
[normal]d inspectors are excluded from the opportunity to offer this service; because they choose not to be registered as domestic installers.
[normal]The development of a single unified voluntary register of competent organisations and individuals is a simple task; it co
[normal]uld be easily achieved at minimal cost; if it is provided by a new body; that is independent of all scheme providers including the Electrical Safety Council. Funding for both the new register; its administration and all promotion of the register should be 
[normal]available from the Electrical Safety Council's resources.
[normal]All competent persons would be eligible for inclusion in the register; and would maintain their registration subject to satisfactory assessment and revue of complaints. Complaints would be administe
[normal]red by the independent registration body; but investigated by the individual scheme providers.
[normal]An additional function of the registration body would be to monitor the performance of each assessment scheme provider; thereby ensuring consistency of their ass
[normal]essment standards; this is currently a significant issue; with disparity of standards viewed sceptically by registered contractors.
[normal]If the register is recognised by both the industry and the greater public it will operate successfully without the need for 
[normal]statutory regulation.
[normal]The existing competitive market should be maintained for the provision of assessment; but with a single regulated fee; competition would be for added value from the scheme provider.
[normal]Little can be gained from comparison to existing reg
[normal]ulated schemes, such as Gas Safe; as this is a derivative of CORGI; which was introduced with high public profile following the Ronan Point incident; there have been no such comparable instances of electrical installation failure. Although a single scheme 
[normal]would unify standards of assessment and little consumer benefit is achieved from the current competitive assessment market.
[normal]Currently the Electrical Safety Council can claim little success in raising public awareness; the vast majority of the public have n
[normal]ot heard of them let alone any campaign or survey they have undertaken. There is a need for targeted promotion by an organisation that knows both the public perception and the electrical contracting industry, the ESC is not that organisation; but should be
[normal] the source of funding for the promotion which can be very cost effectively provided. The industry also needs a clear definition of what can be regarded as appropriate qualifications for recognition of competency; try asking the scheme providers to define 
[normal]a qualified electrician; taking account of historic recognition of electricians.
[normal]The Government does not need to resolve issues; such as providing a searchable directory; this information is already available from all scheme providers and just requires col
[normal]lation and promotion. The existing complaint process's can be retained within each scheme; and simply routed to the scheme provider from the central register administrator. This will provide a single initial point of contact and closure for the consumer.
[normal]T
[normal]he over-riding question must be; what has been achieved to date and will any benefit be gained from a further two years of the current provisions administered by 
[normal]the self appointed; self interested and impotent scheme providers; for the benefit of those at
[normal] the Electrical Safety Council.
[normal]Reference to on-line consumer campaigns is a smoke screen; many viewers of the site will be from outside of the United Kingdom; and many more will be as a result of redirection. I am active within the electrical industry and
[normal] have not seen any of the purported ESC consumer promotions.
[normal]Having seen that the Committee share my frustration; I ask that they act to urge the Government to end this unsuccessful attempt at consumer protection; which to date has only resulted in financi
[normal]al reward to self appointed regulators.
