[[[LC]]]&#xa0;The BPI Group of companies is the largest manufacturer of polythene films, bags and sacks in Europe with an annual manufacturing capacity in excess of 400,000 tonnes. We have 26 manufacturing businesses  located in the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Canada and the PRC employing more than 3,500 people worldwide.&#xa0;BPI Recycled Products is the largest recycler of waste polythene films in the UK and Europe with an annual recycling capacity in excess of 140,000 tonnes supporting more than 1,800 full time jobs in the UK.&#xa0;

[[[BPI does not manufacture, or have any commercial interests in the sales or distribution of supermarket carrier bags.]]]

[[[BPI does not have a formal position on the proposal to introduce a minimum charge for carrier bags, we are neither for, or against – we are strictly neutral in this debate.]]]

[[[However, we are totally opposed to any exemptions for biodegradable bags, this would be environmental madness. Far from benefiting the environment, any exemption would inevitably lead to an increase in the use of carrier bags containing a degradable additive, these bags would – after use – enter and contaminate the plastic films waste stream. This contamination would cause huge damage to the UK plastic films recycling industry and inevitably lead to a reduction in the amount of waste plastic films recycled in the UK.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It is difficult enough to remain competitive as a UK recycler at present with high energy prices (compared to our overseas competitors), together with the disadvantages all UK plastic recycling businesses face as a result of the current PRN/PERN regime which so obviously favours exporters of waste polythene film for recycling overseas.If biodegradable carrier bags are given preferential treatment in any Regulation it is inevitable the use of these bags would increase and subsequently enter and contaminate the plastics films waste stream. If this were to happen the integrity of the products we manufacture from our recovered/recycled plastics such as refuse sacks, agricultural  and building films will be compromised to such an extent this could threaten our entire UK recycled products manufacturing operations.&#xa0;We have recently completed installation at our Heanor factory, at a cost of £2 Million, a prototype washing and recycling line designed to recycle polythene transit packaging and bags from UK supermarkets. This waste inevitably includes supermarket carrier bags. The recyclate recovered from this recycling line is then used to produce a range of products including refuse and recycling sacks plus general purpose films. We could not risk supplying these products to UK Retailers or Brand Holders which could ultimately fail because of the inclusion of a biodegradable contaminant. &#xa0;The latest investment at our Heanor factory is part of our on-going commitment to recycling waste polythene films in the UK with more than £20 million invested in new equipment in the last 10 years alone. This fits current Government strategy of re-balancing the economy in favour of manufacturing and recycling. Currently more than 95% of all UK supermarket ‘back of store’ polythene waste – circa 120,000 tonnes p.a. is exported for recycling overseas. Our latest investment is aimed at retaining waste polythene films for recycling in the UK, not exporting these valuable materials, which currently happens with the majority of UK Retailers. If biodegradable materials enter the waste stream, which as we have already said is inevitable if these materials are given preferential treatment, our current investment strategy will come to an immediate halt.  &#xa0;We are of course aware of the claims and counter claims being made by the suppliers of biodegradable materials and additives. We can only base our comments on our 40 years experience of recycling waste films. If a biodegradable option for carrier bags were to be introduced it is reasonable to assume that the Oxo Degradable materials would be used, purely based on cost considerations. These materials will be impossible to commercially segregate or separate in a polythene film waste stream – to suggest otherwise is completely unrealistic.&#xa0;The recently published draft report from the European Parliament  - Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – chaired by MEP Vittorio Prodi (PE516.911v01-00) “European strategy on plastic waste in the environment” (2013/2113(INI) is more forthright. Page 8, Amendment 5 states: “ Believes that the most dangerous plastics, those that by scientific evidence are shown to be the most disruptive to human health and the environment (such as micro- and oxo-biodegradable plastics) and those which contain heavy metals and other substances that can also make recycling processes more difficult, should be phased out of the market or banned outright.”&#xa0;There are two other issues which we consider it appropriate to comment on, these are the suggestions that the introduction of biodegradable carrier bags would be beneficial to the UK manufacturing sector, plus the inclusion of paper bags in any exemptions.&#xa0;The supposition that the introduction of biodegradable carrier bags would see these products manufactured in the UK – or even elsewhere in the EU – is quite simply fantasy. The manufacture of all single use carrier bags for use in the UK (and in fact most of the world) transferred to ‘Pacific Rim’ countries some 10 to 15 years ago. The reasons are quite straightforward, the cost of manufacturing and especially the price for prime raw materials used to manufacture supermarket carrier bags, are on average between USD250 to USD300 per tonne cheaper when compared to northern Europe, this means European manufacturers of carrier bags cannot compete. The manufacture of an Oxo Degradable carrier bag simply requires the addition of raw material additive which can easily be done on existing manufacturing plant – which nowadays is 100% concentrated in the Far East.No UK manufacturer is going to invest the £ millions that would be required to establish new carrier bag manufacturing equipment in the UK when the economics remain unaltered from 15 years ago.&#xa0;We were also somewhat surprised that the proposals have included paper bags in the exclusions. DEFRA will know that the well accepted scientific evidence over the last 20 years clearly shows that the overall environmental impact of manufacturing paper carrier bags, as opposed to plastic carrier bags is significant.  When producing equivalent sized carrier bags, the manufacture of paper bags increases water consumption by 400%; Increases acid rainfall by 90% and increases emissions of greenhouse gasses by 300%. We are sure DEFRA must have access to these statistics, thus our surprise at the inclusion of paper bags in the list of exclusions.   &#xa0;

[[[In conclusion, we would suggest that if a minimum charge for carrier bags is to be set, the best environmental and business option has to be that there are NO EXCLUSIONS. All single use bags whether manufactured of plastic – bio degradable or not – plus paper bags, should be inc]]]
