[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[About Keoghs]]]&#xa0;Keoghs is the only “top 100” law firm to focus exclusively on the handling and defence of both mainstream and specialist insurance claims.&#xa0; We offer an “end to end” claims service to insurers, public sector bodies and self-insured corporates which includes pre-litigation, litigation and costs negotiation activities.&#xa0; We represent insurers who, between them, provide around 70% of the motor insurance purchased in the UK.&#xa0; With almost 1,200 dedicated staff Keoghs is a recognised leader in the field.&#xa0; In the last 12 months we have been instructed to handle in excess of 35,000 separate matters in total across all classes of personal injury claim.&#xa0;Keoghs has been closely engaged in the broader Government reforms to the civil litigation system as enacted in Part 2 of the LASPO Act 2012 and other ancillary CPR changes as recommended by Lord Justice Jackson.&#xa0; &#xa0;

[[[Introduction.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We welcomed the Committee’s Fourth Report on “Cost of Motor Insurance: Whiplash” released on 31st July 2013. Whilst there were some points upon which we disagreed, we saw the overall response as both balanced and pragmatic. We have also seen Mrs Ellman’s letter of 29th October to the Secretary of State for Justice. We concur that whilst the Government’s own response to the whiplash issue should be broadly welcomed, that response was light on detail and timeframes. Certain key points raised were simply not mentioned and as always, our concern is that “the devil will be in the detail”.&#xa0;We will deal with what we consider to be the key outstanding points in turn:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Conclusions]]].&#xa0;We welcome the TSC’s continued engagement and scrutiny in this important policy area.&#xa0;We have articulated our concerns and would welcome the chance to discuss these further with members of the TSC. We would also express an over-arching concern in terms of timeframes. We are all of course aware that an Election will take place in May 2015. Realistically therefore, much of this important work will have to be undertaken and delivered against in the next 12 months. The MoJ have stated that they intend to work “at pace” - a comment which we welcome.&#xa0;It is now for all stakeholders to support the MoJ in their work and to help both the Committee and Government to implement meaningful change which will ultimately benefit the end consumer in the form of reduced motor premiums.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
