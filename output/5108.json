"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by Lisa Riley (PhD, MSc, MRes, MSc, BSc (Hons))&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\nPersonal BackgroundI am a primatologist currently working as an independent consultant in an\nimal welfare and as a part-time lecturer in Higher Education Animal Management at Sparsholt College Hampshire (UK).\nPreviously (2011-2012) I held the position Senior Scientific Officer (Captive Wild Animals), Wildlife Department, RSPCA where I set up a reh\noming project in association with Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre (Dorset, UK) to rehome the increasing number of UK pet primates rescued by the RSPCA.  \nI have worked as a Primate Keeper at Colchester Zoo (Essex, UK)\n, and as an independent consultant have \nworked with zoos and sanctuaries in the UK and Europe advising on education, enrichment and campaigns relating to the keeping of primates. \nThe opinions expressed in\n this submission are my\n own and should not be considered as the opinion of any establishmen\nt for/with which I have \nworked. \n&#xa0;\nEvidenceThe exotic pet industry in the UK is a \ngrowing\n industry that involves the trade and private keeping of a wide range of both wild-caught and captive\n-bred\n mammals, marsupials, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians and i\nnvertebrates. \nThe UK\n pet \nprimate \nindustry is one facet of this\n wider exotics\n industry. \nThe number and species of primates kept in the UK is unknown, partly due to a lack of regulation and partly due to a lack of enforcement of exi\nsting legislation\n. Common\nly kept sp\necies (like common marmosets\n, pygmy marmosets and numerous tamarin species) are excluded from the Dangerous Wild Animals \nAct 1976 (and associated (Modification) (No. 2) Order\n 2007\n)\n. This Act is ineffectively e\nnforced, with non-compliance reported\n to be 85-\n95%\n. Thus frequently kept species like capuchin monkeys\n,\n \nthe keeping of which requires a licence,\n are often kept without a licence.  \n \nWithout a national survey of pet keeping numbers will only ever be \nestimates \nand thus\n the proportion of pet primates being kept well and those who are neglected or abused\n remains unquantifiable\n. \nHowever, i\nt is clear that\n the\n total number of pet primates\n in the UK\n requiring rescue and rehoming has increased. The \namount of resource (money, h\nours of work, projects ini\ntiated and research undertaken)\n animal welfare charities\n and professionals are \ninves\nt\ning\n into rehoming pet primates and prosecuting unknowledgeable\n, neglectful\n owners is escalating. \nI believe that this increase is due\n in part\n to \ninternet trade. \nEvidence of both\n private sales (through classified sites) and \ncommercial sales from specialist online pet shops is abundant. Simply Google search “marmoset for sale”\n. These sales raise concern about current legislation\n. The Pet Animals Act \n1951 refer\ns to a \npet shop premises \nand when I have \ndealt\n with local authorities in the past some have express\ned confusion as to whether\n online pet shops require a licence because they do not sell from a physical premises. Private sales are of course exempt\n from licensing currently. \nInternet trade not only increases the accessibility of owning a pet primate, making such ownership easily attainable for many, but it fuels the spread of erroneous information and poor practice. \nThe industry is currently \npeppered with owners who do not understand the complex needs of their pet primate\n(s)\n. Primates require complex physical and social environments, specialist veterinary care and \nmany\n,\n like marmosets\n,\n have specific dietary requirements (both in terms of the t\nype of food and the presentation). They are susceptible \nto physical and psychological abnormality and have the cognitive capacity to suffer profoundly when their needs are not met. \nConcerning\n the rescues in which I have been involved even basic requirement\ns are not understood by owners. For example, owners have failed to provide vit\namin D3 supplement. C\nonsequently \ntheir pet primate has \ndeveloped metabolic bone disease\n leading to permanent bone deformity\n. Owners also misunderstand \nthe need for company, even \nthose who reference the \nDEFRA Code of Practice fo\nr the Welfare of Privately Kept\n \nNon-Human \nPrimates. Primates must have company of their own kind, humans and traditional companion a\nnimals like dogs and cats are no\n substitute. \nMost primates are sold individually on the internet, are advertised as “easy to look after” and are intended to be kept individually. \nI believe that internet trade in primates, both commercial and private should be banned. \nA seller has a duty of care to t\nhe primate they are selling (according to the Animal Welfare Act 2006) and a prospective owner should be given care information specific to that primate, including medical history. Internet trade does not support this and any \nattempt to regulate\n would be e\nxtremely difficult to enforce. \nI further believe that the practice of keeping primates as pets should be banned\n,\n that only specialist keepers should keep a primate for welfare or conservation reasons (e.g. in a sanctuary)\n. \nA primate’s needs cannot be met \nin a domestic situation. Zoo and laboratory housed primates have extensive legislation protecting the\nir welfare. The only reason why zoo and laboratory\n legislation is effective is that the location of the primates is known to \nthe inspectorate. This cannot \nbe achie\nved regarding pet keeping, t\nhe DWA demonstrates this clearly. \nIt would be a huge benefit if the Government would define pet ownership\n (keeping as a companion in a domestic situation)\n and specialist keeping (keeping by academically trained and tech\nnically experienced individuals\n in specialist facilities\n)\n so that the two can be differentiated\n. T\nhe keeping of primates as pets\n should be banned, while s\npecialist keepers should \nbe\n subject to rigorous licensing conditions. \n \nThe burden of licensing should \nnot fall to the local authority\n which is under-\nresourced and unable to effectively enforce existing animal related \nlegislation,\n but should be centrally administered by the Government. The cost of licensing should be \nfunded by sp\necialist keepers\n. The standa\nrd of licensing conditions should equal \nthose of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. \n \nThe\n prohibition of \npet \nprimate \nkeeping\n, internet trade in primates and the\n licensing of specialist keeping\n should be achieved using secondary legislation created under the Anima\nl Welfare Act 2006. I believe the Act is sufficient\nly broad and that prohibition of internet trade and pet primate keeping is\n proportionate given the level of suffering primates can \nexperience \nwhen their \nneeds are not met, while licensing of specialist kee\nping permits rescue and rehoming as a ban in pet keeping is phased in and would provide life-long sanctuary to ex-pet primates.  \n \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
