"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Derek Craston, The Government Chemist (CCS36)&#xa0;As Government Chemist, I am responsible under certain Acts of Parliament for providing independent analytical measurement and expert opinion t\no help avoid or resolve the disputes over scientific data which arise from time to time between local authorities and the businesses that they regulate. My public remit also covers wider advice to \nUK\n government and other affected parties on the role of ana\nlytical measurement in effective policy, standards and regulations. \n&#xa0;\nThis \nsubmission\n covers the potential analytical measurement issues which need to be considered for carbon dioxide\n (CO\n2\n)\n \nstreams intended for geological storage. There \nis\n a wide range of \npotential contaminants and other trace compounds in these CO\n2\n streams, arising from different sources of CO\n2\n. These constituents/components \nare capable of promoting different physico-chemical effects during introduction \nto, \nand storage\n in geological reservoirs\n.\n&#xa0;\nAlthough the major risks associated with\n carbon capture and storage (\nCCS\n)\n are from leakage of the stored CO\n2\n, and accidents arising from the injection of CO\n2\n under pressure into the geological storage site, there may be other ri\nsks arising from the nature and concentration of contaminants in the CO\n2\n stream, although these have been much less widely reported or studied. The technology applied to CCS is relatively young, and the volume of information relating to measurements of con\ntaminants in CO\n2\n streams and problems arising from these contaminants is limited. There have been limited developments on CCS in the United Kingdom.\n&#xa0;\nSources of \nContaminants in CO\n2\n streams\n&#xa0;\nThe identity and quantity of contaminants in CO\n2\n streams destined\n for geological storage depends on the source of the CO\n2\n. Different industrial processes give rise to a different contaminant profile. \nThe majority of current and projected applications of CCS technology relate to emissions from power stations which burn \nfossil fuels. Other industrial processes which could be considered amenable to CCS technology include:\n•\n              \nCement and Lime production\n•\n              \nFermentation to produce ethanol\n•\n              \nIron and steel production\n•\n              \nAmmonia production\n•\n              \nHydrogen production\nThe contaminants wh\nich can be found in CO\n2\n streams from these sources include:\n•\n              \nWater\n•\n              \nOxides of Nitrogen (NOx)\n•\n              \nOxides of Sulfur (SOx)\n•\n              \nMethane (CH\n4\n) and other short-chain hydrocarbons\n•\n              \nHydrogen sulphide (H\n2\nS)\n•\n              \nArgon\n•\n              \nNitrogen\n•\n              \nCarbon Monoxide (CO)\n•\n              \nOxygen\n•\n              \nChlorine\n•\n              \nAmmonia (NH\n3\n) and volatile amines\n•\n              \nToxic metals (Hg, As, Se)\n&#xa0;\nEffects of Contamination\n&#xa0;\nCCS technology therefore needs to guard against levels of one or more of these contaminants which could adversely affect the integrity of the storage site o\nr the relevant transport infrastructure (corrosion and impact on fluid characteristics), which do not pose a significant risk to the environment and human health, and do not breach applicable UK or EU legislation. This would normally be achieved by clean-u\np of the CO\n2\n stream prior to injection into geological storage. \n&#xa0;\nFor example, the presence of water in the CO\n2\n stream at an elevated level can produce acidic conditions CO\n2\n which could cause corrosion of the pipe through which the stream is \ntravelling. \nA \nlimit of 500 ppm water \nhas been\n recommended as postulated in the Dynamis project (EU 6th Framework Project, 019672).\n&#xa0;\nHydrogen \nsulphide (H\n2\nS)\n can also present problems in storage, particularly in acidic conditions, even mildly acidic conditions. In such si\ntuations, iron can be removed as iron sulfide from rocks, which may influence the integrity of the storage area.\n&#xa0;\nContaminants in CO\n2\n streams can also have an effect on the physico-chemical properties of the stream, including density, viscosity and interfa\ncial tension. Variations in these properties can affect the interaction between the CO\n2\n stream and the reservoir boundaries. \n&#xa0;\nThe exact identity and concentration of impurities in CO\n2\n streams is dependent on the individual emission source. Compositions va\nry both within generic source types, and can be affected by factors such as the fuel or other process material, the process and the processing plant. Therefore, although the type of facility producing the emission can indicate the generic composition of th\ne stream, and the likely impurities, only analysis of the stream can give the detailed information necessary to fully understand the potential effects on the integrity of the storage.\nCarbon capture and sequestration is in its relative infancy, and few pro\njects have been undertaken to capture and store carbon dioxide in geological storage. A number of contaminants have been identified which can be found in these streams, depending on their source. The potential problems which undesirable levels of these con\ntaminants, particularly water, can cause are also well understood.\nThere does not appear to be any specific analytical methods recommended for determining these impurities in \nCO\n2\n streams\n, although chromatographic methods for separating and measuring \ngaseous impurities can be used, and absorption of trace metal impurities for subsequent determination by techniques such as ICP-MS and ICP-OES, or direct determination in flowing gas streams, are also feasible.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThank you for this opportunity to co\nntribut\ne\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
