"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Keith Thompson [FBB00108]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am given to understand that you and your colleagues on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee are looking, or may be about to look, into the management, structure, financing and culture of the BBC.  I also understand that the BBC has already presented a submission to your Committee defending, it would appear, the unsatisfactory status quo of the BBC’s activities.  In case you may not have seen them previously, I am enclosing two recent press cuttings (2\nnd\n and 3\nrd\n January respectively) from The Times newspaper, one of which appears to bolster the retention of that status quo.  I have been paying both tax and licence fee for over 45 years; in relation to the BBC, I feel most strongly that it no longer offers the type of service it once did. I no longer feel content to support the BBC financially as it is no longer of value to me or my family; it is no longer fit for purpose and hence the licence fee is no longer justifiable.  My children, both university graduates and their graduate friends simply do not watch television anymore.  The BBC needs to realise that there is a whole new world out there in the 21\nst\n Century.\n&#xa0;\n2. As a concerned, responsible and tax paying citizen of this country, I must strongly urge that you and your Committee colleagues, irrespective of your differing political viewpoints, take a very tough line with the BBC. At this moment in time, the BBC is simply not providing value for money or quality that stems from an income in excess of £5billion per annum!\n&#xa0;\n3. The BBC appears to be defending the retention of the status quo with some spurious reasoning that does not stand up to detailed scrutiny.  Firstly, the BBC argue that retention of the licence fee of £145.50 per annum per household is “very likely to remain the most cost-effective way to fund the BBC”, that is, the continued provision of a large sum of money that the BBC does not have to produce for itself and can wastefully spend without proper public scrutiny and examination. That argument may have been a reasonable one say, ten years ago, but it is no longer a valid one given the BBC’s entry into the world of commercialism (ie through its various enterprises) and advertising. Despite the huge income of the BBC (in excess of £5billion per annum), the BBC wastes far too great a proportion of its funds in producing low standard, poor quality programmes and the payment of excessive salaries and golden handshakes to staff. And all of this without proper scrutiny and auditing. How has this situation been allowed to happen by successive governments?                          \n        \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n4. I do not need to point out to you that since the poor standard and quality of many of the programmes now provided by the BBC is of limited interest to much of the population, paying a licence fee for the ”service” (and I use the word generously) that many now do not use, can no longer be justified. The entire television programming output delivered by the BBC over the recent 10-day Christmas period consisted of dire, crass and cheap programmes and repeats. My family did not watch the television at all; nothing appealed to us; nothing was new or fresh; it created debate within our household about the validity of paying a TV licence for nothing!  \n&#xa0;\n5. The BBC appears to “reject calls for funding from subscriptions or advertising” because, amongst other things “the BBC would not be able to produce high quality \nprogrammes”.  I am afraid that the general level of quality has long ago been dissipated by the excessive number of soap operas, game shows, reality programmes, quiz shows – all cheaply produced and recycling the same small number of TV “luvvies”.  Consequently, the changeover to a subscription service from 1 January 2017 is now clearly the best way for the paying customers to acquire, purchase or to subscribe to services or programmes that they wish to see offered by the BBC. And by operating in a more competitive market, it might actually result in improved quality programming. The BBC no longer has a meaningful case in rejecting subscription.   The BBC argue that a subscription service would “turn the BBC into a commercial operator”, but is it not already a commercial operator?\n&#xa0;\n6. The BBC also appears to reject the “sharing of the £3.5billion annual licence fee funding with other broadcasters”. Of course they do! They want to maintain the status quo!  Income without accountability!  I favour the abolition of the licence fee altogether, as it is no longer fit for purpose in the 21\nst\n Century.  If, however, different governments felt sufficiently strongly for the retention of the licence fee and could present to the British public very strong reasons for its retention, then the fee should be shared between the main terrestrial broadcasters (but certainly not to any digital broadcasters such at the evil empire of Sky!).\n&#xa0;\n7. The BBC receives, it would seem, £3.5 billion per annum from the licence fee. It also receives substantial funding as a result of its BBC Worldwide enterprises (£1, £2, £3 billion or more per annum?).  With such an income from that latter source together with the introduction of a subscription service, the BBC would have more than enough funds to exist and manage a reasonable level of service; assuming of course that the BBC was properly managed from top down, that excessive salaries are not paid to mediocre talent and unnecessary and undeserved payments and golden handshakes were curtailed. And if it did operate as a competitive business, perhaps some of the current distasteful practices of the BBC would disappear?\n&#xa0;\n8. Of course, there are other issues about the BBC that your Committee should thoroughly investigate. One such area of scrutiny should be the actual cost of TV Licensing and detection.  I have been unable to find, anywhere on the Internet, how much this “service” actually costs, how many staff are employed, how many detection vans or others means of detection are used and the cost of that element.  The ending of the TV Licence quango (for that is what it is) would provide substantial financial savings.  Your Committee should seek out this information AND PLACE IT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.  Why is this information seemingly held back by the BBC in order to prevent public scrutiny?  Why is this surveillance and cost so secret?\n&#xa0;\n9.  Other areas for detailed scrutiny by your Committee might include:\n&#xa0;\n*the structure of the BBC Trust and its value;\n* the structure, competence and worth of the individual and collective membership of      the Board of Governors;\n* why Lord Patten is still in post given his poor leadership and failure of his management of the BBC;\n* getting to the bottom of the Savile affair;\n* why were huge payments were made to staff;\n* why “paid off” senior staff were subsequently re-hired:\n* investigate the whole culture (and put an end to it) of paying huge and unjustified salary levels (using tax-payers money) to the same small coterie of supposed “stars”;\n* why it appears that the BBC relies on, and uses, the same group of “stars and personalities” in all programmes, including some used to present programmes or documentaries for which they are not especially suited;\n* why the BBC appears to be doing very little in the way of giving opportunities to new, young and emerging talent, as it appears that the BBC operates a “closed shop” (ie who you know and not what you know).\n&#xa0;\n10. . And many more questions of accountability to boot!   In my view, the BBC’s Royal Charter should NOT be renewed after 31 December 2016. The TV licence fee should be abolished.  The BBC should operate a subscription service. There should be no funding of the BBC (or any other broadcasters) from British public taxation. The BBC should be left to stand (or fall) on its own two feet.\n&#xa0;\n11. Thank you for your time in reading these observations.  I hope that you are able let your colleagues on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee have sight of this letter.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
