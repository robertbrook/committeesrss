Written evidence from the defaultRdefaultoyal defaultCdefaultollege of defaultGdefaulteneral defaultPdefaultractitioners (LTC 93)default&#xa0;defaultThe Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is the largest membership organisation in
default&#xa0;
defaultthe United Kingdom solely for GPs. Founded in 1952, it has over 46,000 members who are committed to improving patient care, developing their own skills and promoting general practice as a discipline. We are an independent professional body with enormous expertise in patient–centred generalist clinical care. 
default&#xa0;defaultExecutive Summary default&#xa0;
defaultWe welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Inquiry. Caring for patients with long term conditions is at the core of day-to-day practice for GPs, with such patients representing over 50% of GP appointments
default.
default 
defaultGPs have a vital role to play in supporting those living with long term conditions because:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe increasing prevalence of long term conditions is one of the biggest challenges currently facing our health and social care systems. We need a shared vision for how we adapt to meet this challenge at a time when the UK's population is ageing and funding is predicted to remain flat.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe following will be vital to delivering a successful strategy on long term conditions:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default
default              
defaultShiftdefaultingdefault resources into primary care: defaultThe primary care team
default will be vital to any successful future model of support for patients with long term condi
defaulttions. H
defaultowever, the system of funding for NHS services remains skewed towards hospitals care. Over 2010/11 and 2011/12 spending on general practice fell in real terms (compared to real terms increases for hospital care, mental health and community health services). If we are serious about anticipating the 
defaultcare needs of those with long term conditions and putting them in control of their care, we must look at how we can provide primary care – where 90% of patient contact with the NHS takes place – with better resources.
default&#xa0;
defaultResponse to specific issues highlighted by the Select Committee default&#xa0;default1. Defining 'long-term conditions'default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the Committee's stated aim to review the definition of long-term conditions, RCGP offers the following proposed wording:
default&#xa0;
defaultA long term condition is any medical condition
default that cannot currently be cured but can be managed with the use of medication and/or other therapies. This is in contrast to acute 
defaultc
defaultonditions which typically have a finite duration such as a respiratory infection, an inguinal hernia or a mild episode of depression.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs with many concepts in healthcare, there are likely to be many different interpretation
defaults
default of what constitutes a long term condition. Ultimately, the best means of defining what is an
defaultd
default isn't a long term condition, and making decisions about 
defaultcare requirements
default, is as part of a conversation between an individual and their doctor (usually a GP). 
default&#xa0;
default2. Moving care out of hospitals and into the community default–default are we ready?default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultt is vital that in the coming years we see a major shift towards managing and planning 'whole person' patient care in the community, moving away from the focus on treating individual 
defaultepisodes
default of illness in secondary care. The 
defaultincreasing
default prevalence of long term conditions and multiple morbidity mean that the ‘status quo’ is not an option
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, 
defaultwe 
defaultabsolutely must avoid moving care out of hospitals without 
defaultfirst establishing
default a clear plan for how services in the community 
defaultshould
default to be organised and resourced to accommodate this
default change
default. In RCGP's view we need to effect change in three key areas:
default&#xa0;
default(defaultidefault) Service redesign, defaultcare planningdefault and ‘communities defaultofdefault practice’default&#xa0;
defaultWe need to establish new models of generalist-led care in the community in order to meet the changing needs of patients with long term conditions. Currently 
defaultit is s
defaultt
defaultill the norm
default that different professionals work within their own organisational silos, funding systems and cultures. We need to redesign services in a way that encourages shared ownership and responsibility for ensuring that those with long term conditions are supported to manage and plan their own care.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn
defaulte potential model is to create multi-disciplinary teams
default 
defaultbased with
defaultin primary care
default.
default This consists of different health care professionals, drawn from the wider primary care team, working together to deliver routine care, health advice and case management to high-risk patients. The model ensures such patients have access to longer appointment times, and health professionals are trained in skills such as chronic dise
defaultase management, shared decision
default making and prevention. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAnother
default powerful 
defaulttool
default is care planning
default, an approach pioneered by the diabetes ‘Year of Care’ initiative (se
defaulte section 5 below)
default. This involves agreeing
default a plan to improve an individual’s health and well-being, and co-ordinating across a range of health, social care and other professionals to ensure the provision of support and services to address the patient’s needs.
default 
defaultThere is strong evidence that care planning c
defaulta
defaultn improve outcomes for patients, reduced 
defaultunnecessary
default hospital admissions and save money
default.
default 
defaultWe
default now need
default to
default embed care planning into the 'core business' of general practice and other parts of the system.

defaultto develop

default.
default These 
defaultwill work together to break

defaultbarriers to change,

defaultservices
default,
default developing
default 
defaultshared 
defaultrisk stratification metrics, determining how to share resources and agreeing u
defaultse of IT to support the process
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, Under the right circumstances, pooled budgets can help to drive integration between health and social care, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients and reduced hospital admissions.
default 
defaultHowever, safeguards are needed to prevent cost shifting between service areas, by using means such as tying the use of funds to the delivery of jointly agreed outcomes based on shared needs analysis, and the application of open book accounting procedures.
default 
defaultPersonal health budgets potentially offer the opportunity to meet individuals’ health and social care needs in a more integrated way, but pose various practical challenges and risks.
default&#xa0;
default(ii) Investment in primary caredefault&#xa0;
defaultDelivering on the aspiration of moving more care out of hospitals, and at the same time integrating care more effectively around patients with long term conditions, will require a change in the balance of resources within the NHS. At the moment, the systems through which NHS care is funded continue to encourage activity in hospitals. In cont
defaultr
defaultast there has been 
defaultmarked 
defaultunderinvestment in general practice, as indicated in the following chart from the Nuffield Trust
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBalancing resources towards primary care would enable general practice to:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition
default, an urgent review of Payment by R
defaultesults 
defaultis needed. It 
defaultacts as a barrier to integrated care, because:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default(iii) Workforce planning and trainingdefault&#xa0;
defaultContinuing to move care out of hospitals and into the community has significant implications for the primary care workforce. The Centre for Workforce Intelligence has highlighted that the GP workforce is not growing quickly enough to meet predicted increases in demand
default.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultCfWI
default has recommended a 17% increase in recruitment into GP speciality training, which will necessitate a reduction in recruitment into training in hospital-based specialties. We need a robust long term approach to workforce planning, led by Health Education England, to ensure that patients with long term conditions are supported by an adequate GP workforce.
defaultAs the needs of patients change 
default–
default and as the rise of multiple morbidities 
defaultcontinues to lead to 
defaultincreases 
defaultin 
defaultthe complexity of care 
default–
default we also need to ensure that GP training reflects this. The RCGP's proposals for extending the length of GP training from 3 (currently the shortest of any medical specialty) to 4 years
default 
defaultare in the process of being considered by the Government, with a decision by health Ministers across all four nations of the UK expected in late 2013. Extending and enhancing GP training will mean that GPs of the future are better equipped to provide care and support to those with long term conditions.
default&#xa0;
default3. Can we deliver 'whole person' care for people with long term conditions?default&#xa0;
defaultPersonalisation is strongly associated with
default 
defaultbetter patient outcomes and experience and is rooted in the same values of holism
default 
defaultand patient 
defaultcentredness
default as general practice.
default 
defaultThe NHS and social care still focus too m
defaultuch on individual disease areas, and a
default shift in focus is needed towards supporting patients with two or more multiple morbidities. Potential solutions include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5. Current examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long-term conditions default&#xa0;
defaultWe would point to 
defaulttwo
default examples that the Committee 
defaultcould
default consider
default in this context
default:
default&#xa0;
defaultThe diabetes ‘defaultYear of caredefault’default and care planningdefault default&#xa0;
defaultThe ‘Year of Care’ programme
default 
defaultdemonstrated the potential for
default care planning 
defaultto deliver improved health outcomes for people living with long term conditions, using 
defaultdiabetes 
defaultas an exemplar. 
defaultPilots were undertaken in 
defaultthree diverse pilot sites (Calderdale &amp; Kirklees, North of Tyne and Tower Hamlets)
default. Key outcomes include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultJdefaultoint working between GPs and care homes in Sheffielddefault&#xa0;defaultPatients living with long term conditions who live in c
defaultare homes may suffer from poorer access to support tools such as care planning. In some areas, GPs are working collaboratively with local care homes to better meet the needs of their residents.
default 
defaultIn Sheffield
default,
default local GPs have been leading on the delivery of proactive, coordinated healthcare to care home residents through a Locally Enhanced Service (LES) first set up by NHS Sheffield in 2008. The initiative focuses on developing clear lines of communication between care homes and GPs and establishing effective access to community health services
default.
default 
defaultThe scheme has contributed to a reduction in hospital admissions in the area and has been popular with 
defaultboth residents and GPs, with 94% 
defaultof surveyed residents saying the se
defaultrvice provides for their needs.
default 
default&#xa0;default6. How can the new commissioning system deliver more integrated care for people with long term conditions?default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of clinically-led commissioning is an opportunity to deliver new ways of working that benefit people with long term conditions, but there are both risks and opportunities associated with the new NHS structure as it comes into force. Key factors include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7. As a contributory factor to conditions including diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease, how can we address obesity?default&#xa0;defaultObesity is well known to be a fundamental risk factor for a series of conditions, such as diabetes, heart failure and coronary heart disease
default. 
defaultIts impact on psychological problems, low self esteem and even suicide risk should also not be forgotten. The impact on health budgets, workload and service development is immense.

defaultPotential solutions include:
