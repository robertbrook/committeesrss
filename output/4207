[normal]Written evidence submitted by Professor Mike Stein[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Evidence: Ofsted Social Care Annual Report[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The proposed re-shaping of the inspection framework to address the question 
[normal]‘What difference did that make to the child’
[normal] by 
[normal]‘evaluating the performance of the local authority from end to end: from first contact 
[normal]to leaving care and everything in between’
[normal] is to be welcomed.  However, given that an inspection can only be based on a very small 
[normal]and selective 
[normal]sample of children and young people, the evidence base would be enhanced by the introduction of a 
[normal]systematic 
[normal]me
[normal]asure of progress.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The current re
[normal]liance on normative 
[normal]data
[normal] (mainly education, employment and training)
[normal] as the main measure of how the care system performs is very limited as it fails to recognise the very poor starting points of young people on entry to 
[normal]care: not only do many of these children come into care in their teenage years from very deprived social backgrounds, but also many have experienced different forms of abuse or neglect, potentially casting a long shadow on their cognitive and emotional dev
[normal]elopment.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For those young people who remain in care longer-term these official outcome measures fail to recognise the progress made by them, including major achievements, such as getting back into education, furthering leisure interests and vocational s
[normal]kills, and, often for the first time, developing consistent, positive and trusting relationships with a
[normal]dults – the foundation stones of future success
[normal].
[normal]  Research also shows that some of these young people do better by being in care, compared with stopping 
[normal]or returning home, which is not recognised. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This suggests that what is needed is a systematic progress measure of what is happening to young people at different points in time
[normal] from care to adulthood – up to the age of 25, to make this consistent with
[normal] the
[normal] legal responsibilities contained with
[normal] current leaving care legislation. In
[normal] addition to performance, 
[normal]such a measure could incorporate young people’s views 
[normal]of their well-being
[normal] (a welcome
[normal] platform of current policy)
[normal], as well as that of other important people
[normal] in their lives
[normal], especially those who care for them
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As is recognised in the 
[normal]A
[normal]nnual 
[normal]r
[normal]eport,
[normal] there is no room for complacency – 
[normal]a 
[normal]‘poverty of ambition’. 
[normal]But introducing a measure of progress
[normal] would recognise the severe and hazardous journey many young people have travelled, the efforts of those who have helped them, as well as more understanding of the complex roots and reasons for their vulnerability.  It may also provide a more sophisticated
[normal] way of identifying problems experienced by young people and a focus for intervention
[normal] which may well
[normal] contribute to improving normative outcomes, over time.
