default‘What difference did that make to the child’
default by 
default‘evaluating the performance of the local authority from end to end: from first contact 
defaultto leaving care and everything in between’
default is to be welcomed.  However, given that an inspection can only be based on a very small 
defaultand selective 
defaultsample of children and young people, the evidence base would be enhanced by the introduction of a 
defaultsystematic 
defaultme
defaultasure of progress.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current re
defaultliance on normative 
defaultdata
default (mainly education, employment and training)
default as the main measure of how the care system performs is very limited as it fails to recognise the very poor starting points of young people on entry to 
defaultcare: not only do many of these children come into care in their teenage years from very deprived social backgrounds, but also many have experienced different forms of abuse or neglect, potentially casting a long shadow on their cognitive and emotional dev
defaultelopment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFor those young people who remain in care longer-term these official outcome measures fail to recognise the progress made by them, including major achievements, such as getting back into education, furthering leisure interests and vocational s
defaultkills, and, often for the first time, developing consistent, positive and trusting relationships with a
defaultdults – the foundation stones of future success
default.
default  Research also shows that some of these young people do better by being in care, compared with stopping 
defaultor returning home, which is not recognised. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis suggests that what is needed is a systematic progress measure of what is happening to young people at different points in time
default from care to adulthood – up to the age of 25, to make this consistent with
default the
default legal responsibilities contained with
default current leaving care legislation. In
default addition to performance, 
defaultsuch a measure could incorporate young people’s views 
defaultof their well-being
default (a welcome
default platform of current policy)
default, as well as that of other important people
default in their lives
default, especially those who care for them
default.

default&#xa0;
defaultAs is recognised in the

defaultnnual 
defaultr
defaulteport,
default there is no room for complacency – 
defaulta 
default‘poverty of ambition’. 
defaultBut introducing a measure of progress
default would recognise the severe and hazardous journey many young people have travelled, the efforts of those who have helped them, as well as more understanding of the complex roots and reasons for their vulnerability.  It may also provide a more sophisticated
default way of identifying problems experienced by young people and a focus for intervention
default which may well
default contribute to improving normative outcomes, over time.
