[[[TOBACCO SMUGGLING – CONSULTATION RESPONSE ]]]&#xa0;Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this consultation which is of considerable interest to both my local authority and to my trading standards service. My comments are as follows:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;7.2 (Level1) At point of entry into the UK ;7.3 (Level2) at wholesale distribution level and;7.4 (Level3) at retail level.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;10.1&#xa0;&#xa0; Improved collection and sharing of data and intelligence between respective agencies. 10.2&#xa0;&#xa0; A tsar to co-ordinate action between respective Government departments and agencies as responsibility is currently divided between a number of different bodies and there is a perception that no one leads on this key issue.10.3&#xa0;&#xa0; Strengthen the powers available to local authority trading standards services to enable them to close down retail premises where there is evidence of selling illicit tobacco. If illicit tobacco is found on say two occasions – then local authorities should be able to apply to a magistrate’s court for a closure order and then be able to physically close a premise if necessary.&#xa0;&#xa0;Mike Pigrem, Head of Trading Standards &amp; LicensingEconomy, Community &amp; Corporate DirectorateHerefordshire CouncilSeptember 2013&#xa0;
