"&#xa0;\nBNI0015&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by IBOA The Finance Union&#xa0;&#xa0;1.              Introduction&#xa0;1.1\n              \nIBOA The Finance Union represents over 18,000 employees in the financial \nsector\n in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain – predominantly in banking \n– \nof \nwhom\n approximately 5,000 work in Northern Ireland. Members of the Union \nwork in\n many areas within the sector, including \nsome \nmanagerial grades.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nIn Northern Ireland, the Union’s membership is principally located within the four main retail banks: Bank of Ireland, \nDanske\n Bank, First Trust Bank and Ulster Bank. Since the banking crisis began, the Union has also secured the right to represent staff \nin\n the former Irish Nationwide Building Society – which, having merged with Anglo Irish Bank to form the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (now in special liquidation), also operates in Northern Ireland.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nThroughout its history, IBOA has contribut\ned\n to t\nhe development of the financial services sector in both jurisdictions in Ireland. \nAs well as representing employees \nin their own institutions on industrial relations\n and professional\n \nissues\n, the Union has \nalso \ncontributed to national discourse on \ndevelopme\nnts\n affecting the sector. \n&#xa0;\n1.\n4\n              \nAs the representative body for a \nkey \nstake-h\nolder interest in Irish banking,\n \nIBOA has a unique perspective based on its \nwork\n on behalf of bank \nstaff\n in three jurisdictions. After some general observations on recent developm\nents in Northern Ireland, we propose to focus \non\n four main \narea\ns:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe structure and governance of banks in Northern Ireland\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation: and\n(d)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \naccess\n to ba\nnking in rural communities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.              General Overview&#xa0;2.1\n              \nThe transformation of Northern Ireland’s major \nretail\n banks \nover\n the last five years has been unprecedented in its speed and depth. In terms of ownership\n,\n two banks are\n,\n to all intents and purposes\n,\n State-owned (although by different States); one bank enjoys minority State support with a significant North American shareholding; while the fourth remains in private ownership with its \nDanish\n parent driving the most ambitious changes in its operating mod\nel.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nNone of the banks\n,\n which have experienced \nmajor\n changes in ownership\n,\n \nactively \nsought \nthem: in each case State intervention w\nas a last resort to prevent \na worse\n outcome. But in all cases \nkey\n decisions about the ownership or operation of these institutions – which have profound implications for the\nir\n staff and customers \nin Northern Ireland \n– have been taken outside the jurisdiction – in \neither London\n, Edinburgh, Dublin or Copenhagen.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nNort\nhern Ireland may \nalso suffer \nin terms of the quality of investment in its economic, commercial and social infrastructure. Northern Ireland may not \nrate\n \nhighly in\n \neither strategic or operational priorities\n \n– as Ulster Bank\n’s customers\n will readily testify \nwhen \na\n temporary\n IT glitch for \nRBS and NatWest \ncustomers \nbecame\n an IT meltdown for Ulster Bank – lasti\nng weeks.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nThe\n absence of any locally\n-\nowned banking institutions\n may also have a negative impact on\n the availability of credit within Northern Ireland\n since it\n turn\ns\n on lending policy decisions made elsewhere – by \nparent board\ns \nwith no\n specific concern for the good \nof\n Northern Ireland.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nDanske Bank (formerly Northern Bank) is arguably the most financially sound of the major \nretail\n banks operating in\n Northern Ireland – since its more prudent\n \napproach to lending meant that it \nlargely avoided\n the surge in speculative property lending \nwhich drove\n Irish banking \nto the brink of \ncollapse in 2008-9. \nDanske\n Bank has recorded operating profits for a number of \nyears and expects to return to overall profitability by the end of \n2013\n – even after losses for impairments are \nincluded\n. However, the position of \nDanske’s\n Northern Ireland business contrast\ns\n \nwith\n its Republic of Ireland \noperation \n(formerly National Irish Bank) – which became heavily involved in \nproperty \nlending \nbefore \n2008 and suffered \naccordingly\n. The complete overhaul of \nDanske’s\n Republic of Ireland business – with the virtual elimination of its branch network and its \nremodelling\n as a niche business bank – has resulted in the transfer of some call centre traffic and processing work to units in Northern Ireland –\n enhancing\n the\nir viability.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nThe expansion in this activity has compensated in employment terms for the contraction i\nn \nDanske’s\n Branch network in Northern Ireland. Since 2005 the number of offices and sub-offices operated by the Bank has fallen from approximately 130\n \nto fifty-two – with \ncontinuing\n reduction\ns\n likely \nin\n 2014. \nUnlike\n other major banks wh\nere\n branch closures\n \nmay have emerged as desperate cost-cutting measures\n, \nDanske\n/Northern Bank has pursued a deliberate policy – over many years in terms of gestation and implementation – to make greater use of electronic channels to deliver services to customers. While all o\nf the banks in Northern Ireland have begun to \npromote\n e-banking for customers to some degree, \nDanske\n Bank \nhas gone furthest\n \nboth \nin terms of customer adoption of the technology and the reduction in the comparative density of its branch network.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n7\n              \nFirst Trust Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIB Group which in turn is 99% owned by the Irish State – as a result of the multi-billion euro public investment made to rescue the Group from the disastrous \nimpact of its impaired loans\n. As part of the restruct\nuring of the Group’s overseas holdings required by the EU Commission, AIB’s \nPolish and US \ninterests were sold. AIB also put its UK division – comprising First Trust Bank\n (FTB)\n and Allied Irish Bank (GB) – on the market. However, \nwith no\n significant interes\nt from prospective buyers, the division was withdrawn from sale. Following substantial engagement by Northern Ireland Ministers and Assembly\n \nmembers \nalong with\n concerted lobbying by members of IBOA, \nAIB\n committed to \nremain\n in Northern Ireland through \nFTB\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n              \nAIB Group’s initial decision in 2012 to close over \n70 branches was primarily focus\ned on its Republic of Ireland business. \nSome\n Northern Ireland \nlocations \nwere earmarked for closure under this \nprogramme\n \n– b\nringing to 9 the total of offices and sub-offices which have closed since 2008. However, since \nFTB\n continues to operate at a loss, management \nmay \nseek further branch closures in No\nrthern Ireland – requiring customers to make greater use of electronic banki\nng\n. As AIB Group \nattempts to \nrestructure its business to achiev\ne\n \na\n return to profitability \nand\n to exit State ownership, FTB may also come under pressure from its parent to transfer \nsome \n“back office” support operations to Dublin.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n9\n              \nAfter \nDanske\n Bank, \nBank of Ireland is probably\n the soundest of the four major \nretail\n banks in terms of its balance sheet performance. The Group \nreceived \n€4.7bn\n in State\n support. It \nis forecast to return to profit shortly\n and is keen to reduc\ne\n the State’s 15% shareholding\n by\n \n“e\nxiting the bailout” \nat the earliest opportunity.\n \nThe Bank’s Northern Ireland \noperations \nhave been restructured in the last three years from being a semi-autonomous entity to being a fully integrated part of an all-island business. Bank of Ireland also has \na significant presence in Britain as the provider of banking services to the Post Office. It also maintains a niche presence in business banking in Britain. However, the viability of this operation \nmay be in question following \nthe EU Commission\n’s decision\n \nthat the Bank should sell \nsome \nparts of \nthis\n operation.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n              \nAs for customer\n acces\ns, Bank of Ireland has committed to close the fewest locations of the four major banking groups. Since the onset of the crisis, it has closed nine offices and sub-offices in\n Northern Ireland. However, although it \nmay \nmaintain a presence on most of its existing sites, the Bank's “new branch model” is built on customers accessing services through a battery of electronic devices (monitors, ATMs and dedicated phone lines linked t\no a call centre) rather than by face-to-face interaction with bank worker\ns.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n              \nOf the four \nmajor retail\n banks operating in Northern Ireland, \nUlster Bank has probably suffered most from the crisis, rela\nti\nve to its size. While Ulster Bank is a very \nsignificant player in Northern Ireland\n’s banking sector\n, the majority of its business is located in the Republic of Ireland where it \nwas\n involved in \npre-crash \nspeculative property lending. Indeed Ulster Bank’s \nformer\n subsidiary, First Active (which has sin\nce been merged into the main business) was the first \ninstitutional lender\n in the Republic to offer 100% mortgages.\n&#xa0;\n2.12\n              \nTo\n address the consequences of \nits\n impaired loan book, Ulster Bank has relied on significant support from its parent, Royal Bank of Sco\ntland – which\n \nhas been sustained on “life support” \nby\n the State for almost five years. Ulster Bank has also embarked on two major cost-cutting initiatives – each involving 950 job losses achieved through voluntary severance. Although AIB has \ncut more jobs\n \nin absolute terms, Ulster Bank has cut deepest \nrelative\n to the size of its workforce. Of the 1900 job cuts already implemented or announced for Ulster Bank, Northern Ireland has ac\nc\nounted for around 700.\n&#xa0;\n2.13\n              \nUlster Bank has also engaged in branch closure\ns – primarily as a result of the merger of its First Active mortgage business. Having closed eleven offices and sub-offices in Northern Ireland since 2008,\n \nthe Bank is reviewing its branch network. However, s\nenior executives recently told \nNorthern Ireland\n’\ns\n outgoing \nFinance \nMinister\n, Sammy Wilson, that the number of b\nranches\n \nin Northern Ireland to be closed in 2014 would not exceed nine.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.              The structure and governance of banks in Northern Ireland&#xa0;3.1\n              \nAs outlined at 2.2, none of the four major \nretail\n banks in Northern Ireland are headquartered in the province. \nFTB\n and Bank of Ireland are subsidiaries of Dublin\n-\nbased banking groups. \nDanske’s\n parent is based in Copenhagen, while Ulster Bank’s Dublin Head Office reports to RBS headquarters in Edinburgh. \nOf Northern Ireland\n’s\n second tier of financial institutions, only the Progressive Building Society could be \nregarded as\n truly indigenous.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe distance between the board rooms where key decisions about cr\nedit and risk are made and the \nareas in Northern Ireland \naffected by them\n \nis a further\n concern – especially \nas many\n banks with international interests \nhave\n \nretrenched\n \nto\n their home markets\n since the crisis began\n. \nWithout the intervention of local public representatives, this trend may h\nave been more pronounced \nin Northern Ireland. \nT\nh\nese\n \ninterventions\n may have \nsecured \nadd\nitional\n traction because of the substantial level of State support for these institutions\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nNorthern Ireland’s\n four largest \nretail banks\n are\n supervised to some degree\n by three different regulatory bodies – none of which is \nlocated in\n Northern Ireland. The recently established Financial Conduct Authority does not have a \nphysical \npresence on the ground in Northern Ireland – nor did its predecessor, the Financial Services\n Authori\nty. Quality of oversight is \nan important issue – in view of the recent history of irresponsible\n \nbehaviour\n by\n the \nleaderships\n of key financial institutions in both Ireland and Britain – involving high risk property lending, \nmis\n-selling of insurance-\nbased products and interest rate\n manipulation – facilitated by \nlight touch regulatory regimes in each jurisdiction. In such lax regulatory environments, \nbanking leaders\n were facilitated in \nadopting \ncavalier a\npproach\ne\ns – partly \nbecause they believed, correc\ntly as it turned out, that if they got into major difficulties, the Stat\ne would assist them.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nAnother key factor in the near collapse of \nbanking has been \nthe shift in the \nsector\n’s prevailing\n culture from one focused on customer service to one dictated \nby sales targets \ndriven by\n the \npursuit of short-term profits\n. \nThe ongoing controversy around bonuses is one facet of culture. Equally troubling has been the pressure on bank workers to sell financial\n ‘products’ – rather than to \noffer\n dispassionate prudent financial advice to customers.\n \nThe\n pressure \non staff \nto meet targets\n is now based on\n the \n‘\nstick\n’\n of disciplinary action rather than the \n‘\ncarrot\n’\n of performance awards. At the same time, \nbank workers\n who speak out – even in the most \ngeneral terms about the state of the \nsector\n – \nrisk\n disciplinary action \nfor\n either breaching confidentiality or – with no hint of irony – damaging their employer’s reputation.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n6\n              \nThe\n \nState’s \npivotal\n role \nin the financial sector \nat this time provides\n a\nn\n op\nportunity to embed a new culture – \nwhich would promote\n the traditional values of prudential lending and \ngenuine\n customer service\n – with technological advances\n used to enhance such a development\n rather\n \nthan being viewed primarily \nas a means of cutting costs\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n7\n              \nThe\n composition of the boards of banks have been justifiably \ncritici\ns\ned\n \nas\n a circle of like-minded individuals (indeed with the same individuals frequently sharing interlocking memberships of a number of b\noard\ns). Greater diversity of membership is e\nssential \nfor\n avoiding the high\n level “group-think” which was \napparent \nbefore the\n banking crisis and, \nalso\n, \nperhaps\n, \nsince\n. The inclusion of employee representatives with those of other stake-holders should be \npriorit\nised\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n8\n              \nAt the \nsectoral\n level, IBOA h\nas advocated a Forum on Banking within Northern Ireland – which could bring together all of the stake-holders in the sector – to \ndiscuss\n \nits\n strategic\n \ndirection \nso that in future \nthe financial sector\n \nbecome\ns\n a loyal servant of economic and social development rather than its untrustworthy master.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.              The possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nThe possible break-up of RBS is a matter of concern to Ulster Bank’s staff and customers \ni\nn both No\nrthern Ireland a\nnd the Republic in light of the\n speculation \nabout\n \nthe future of Ulster Bank\n. The \nsuggestion that \nUlster Bank \ncould be acquired \nby the Irish State \nraises many\n difficult\nies\n. Apart from question\ns\n \nabout the capacity of the Irish State\n to take on the liabilitie\ns of Ulster Bank, the prospect of \nthe Irish State owning \ntwo of the three largest \nretail \nbanks in the Republic \nas well as a significant \nstake in the third – would have serious consequences for competition. In Northern Ireland, the competition issue \ncould b\necome\n even more significan\nt\n since the \nIrish Government would \nexercis\ne\n \nmore\n influen\nce over the economy by virtue of its greater presence in retail banking\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nFor customers\n, \nthis\n scenario would \nprobably involve\n an accelerated \nprog\nr\namme\n of branch closures \nas\n two directly owned State banks operating in parallel \nmight prove\n \nun\nsustain\nable\n in the longer term. \nFor staff, substantial\n job losses\n might\n \nalso result\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nFurther speculation \ncentres\n on\n a merger between Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB, one of the smaller State-owned lenders in the Republic, \nas\n a joint venture \ninvolving RBS, \nthe Irish State \nand\n unknown private interests\n.\n \nWhile such an alliance may\n \noffer some benefits to both institutions, i\nt\n \nc\nould \nalso exacerbate\n the prob\nlem of Ulster Bank’s toxic debt\n, since Permanent TSB also ha\ns significant impairment issues.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.              The position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation&#xa0;5.1\n              \nThe “special liquidation” of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) by the Irish Parliament earlier this year has created \nconsiderable\n difficulty for IBRC’s employees \nin Northern Ireland and the Republic\n – not least because the consequences for the I\nBRC workers \nwere not\n \nconsidered\n \nby Parliament\n. The employees \nbecame\n collateral damage in a\n legislative\n initiative designed to facilitate the restructuring of interest payments due on the IBRC’s promissory notes and payable by the Irish Exchequer.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \n \nThi\ns\n legislation \nmay \nbe subject \nto\n litigation\n – not least because, it has been argued, \nthe \ncompany\n was solvent\n at the time\n, albeit with the support of the Irish Central Bank.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nFrom the \nworkers’ \nperspective, th\ne\n liquidation \nis\n more \nakin to\n a receivership \nas\n the company \nhas \ncontinue\nd\n to operate as before in wind-down mode but with an accelerated timescale. IBOA has also raised \nconcer\nns with the EU as to whether the implementation of the \nOireachtas\n’ decision has frustrated the European directive on \nthe \nprote\nction of employment\n during the\n transfer of undertaki\nngs – in the case of IBRC\n \nstaff\n \ntransferring to other entit\nies – such as Capita \nand\n NAMA. \nIBRC\n employees in Northern Ireland\n are further concerned\n that the Irish authorities\n may have\n breached the terms of\n the Revised Credit Facility Agreement governing the bilateral loan of £3.25bn provided by the British Government at the end of 2010.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.              Access to banking in rural communities&#xa0;6.1\n              \nThe \nrationalisation\n of the branch networks of the four major banks in Nor\nthern Ireland raises questions about access to banking facilities in rural communities. While \nDanske\n Bank has implemented the most d\nramatic reduction \nprogramme\n, \nthe other banks are \nto be\n developing similar strategies involving a concentration of face-to-fa\nce banking operations in fewer locations while seeking to increase the use of electronic banking services.\n S\nome institutions may be tempted to accelerate the closure of branches \nto push\n the adoption of electronic bank\ning by customers rather than \nallow cust\nomers to move at their own pace or even retain the option of face-to-face interaction.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n2\n              \nIn some rural areas the e\n-banking\n alternative may not be as effective due to major infrastructural problems relating to internet connectivity. So customers in those\n areas may \nlose\n immediate access – both physical and online. Furthermore, our members' \ndirect\n experience suggests that \nmany \ncustomers \n– es\npecially in the older age groups - would prefer to bank with humans rather than el\nectronic devices\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nThe hollowing\n of the physical banking infrastructure may also have adverse consequences for social welfare recipients in both urban and rural areas\n who were previously \nencouraged to open bank accounts \nto receive \nState benefits \nafter\n \nearlier\n payment \nchannels\n were discon\ntinued. \nAny reduction\n \nin\n face-to-face banking \nmay bear disproportionately\n \non \ncustomers on low fixed incomes \nand\n \nun\nable to aff\nord the electronic alternatives\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nIBOA is \nconcerned that \nalthough\n each banking group is taking decisions incrementally based up\non its own \nspecific\n interest\ns\n, the c\numulative effect \nmay be to leave many rural areas in Northern Ireland with \nreduced\n facility. \nIn\n some parts of Britain, banks have come to an understanding that the last branch of any banking group remaining in an agreed \ncatchment area will \nnot face closure\n. \nT\nhis “last branch standing” approach should be considered in Northern Ireland to \nguarantee\n a minimum threshold of \nphysical as well as online \nservice. \nWith\n the new facility for easier account switching, such \nan approach\n would not necessarily be \ncommercially disadvantageous\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;7.              Final Thoughts&#xa0;IBOA thank\ns\n the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for \nthe invitation \nto \nmake\n this submission. We would welcome the opportunity to\n \nengage wit\nh you further. Banking \nis \nexperiencing\n an unprecedented transformation – mostly under duress \nafter\n \nits\n catastrophic mismanagement in \nrecent\n years.\n \nI\nn this context, Northern Ireland has particular concerns \nrequiring\n special attention. We welcome \nyour\n interest and will \nendeavour\n to assi\nst \nyour \ndeliberations.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
