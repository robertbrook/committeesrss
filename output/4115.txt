[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;1.1 This submission is made by Roger Farrow, retired NHS manager, in a personal capacity to express his profound dissatisfaction with the BBC and to press for:&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[2.0 Current status of the BBC]]]&#xa0;2.1 The BBC is, allegedly, the largest broadcaster in the world in terms of staff employed.  It is an anachronism, grown to its current dominant size thanks to nearly 70 years of generous income derived mostly from a TV/radio licensing system enforced by the criminal law.&#xa0;2.2 The huge size of the BBC is inappropriate in the digital age since its function can be achieved in cheaper, more flexible and fairer ways.  &#xa0;

[[[3.0 Market dominance by the BBC]]]&#xa0;3.1 It is suggested that approximately 70% of the UK population still get most of their news from television and approximately 70% of those viewers use the BBC. If true, this market dominance is unhealthy and does not encourage diversity of journalistic viewpoints.&#xa0;3.2 The BBC also has a large and powerful website where entertainment and information are offered free. Private sector media companies find it difficult to establish pay to view websites in the face of this unfair competition.&#xa0;

[[[4.0 Accountability of the BBC]]]&#xa0;4.1 Recent scandals such as the Jimmy Savile affair, Lonely Planet sell off, Newsnight blunders, excessive senior staff pay offs and the Digital Master Index fiasco, demonstrate the BBC to be an inward looking, self-serving and complacent organisation that is out of touch with its customers.&#xa0;4.2 The theoretical accountability of the BBC to the public is meaningless because it leaves TV licence fee payers without the option of “voting with their feet”.  The BBC simply tells individual complainants that their concerns have been noted. In other words, they have become a mere statistic with no hope of bringing about change within the BBC.&#xa0;4.3 The only practical way that TV licence fee payers can hold the BBC to account is to be able to take their money elsewhere and spend it with another broadcaster. In the 21st century, this is a sanction that any customer of a broadcasting service should be able to deploy. &#xa0;4.4 Approximately 10% of all criminal charges in the UK arise from the prosecution of viewers who do not wish to pay the TV licence fee.  This use of the criminal law is uniquely punitive in the media market because the TV licence fee is effectively a tax. The BBC should move without delay to a subscription service which can simply be withdrawn if a subscriber fails to keep up payments.&#xa0;

[[[5.0 Dangers of market dominance by the BBC]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.1 The dominant size of the BBC stifles the UK media market and poses a threat to democracy.  The BBC, just like every other media organisation, is guilty of bias and spin. It is therefore vital that UK citizens have a wide choice of broadcasters and internet sources to choose from.  This enables citizens to detect institutional bias by comparing and cross referencing not just the coverage of news items and current affairs but also the depiction of political issues embedded within all broadcast subjects e.g. comedy, drama and history programmes.&#xa0;

[[[6.0 ]]]

[[[Public service broadcasting]]]&#xa0;6.1 The current scale of public service broadcasting is inappropriate in the digital age.  There is no longer any justification for funding popular entertainment programmes from a flat rate TV licensing system enforced by the criminal law. The media market should be used to fund these popular programmes through voluntary subscriptions.&#xa0;6.2 The scope and quantity of public service broadcasting should be reviewed.  Fixed term contracts for public service broadcasting should then be allocated by a public broadcasting authority to a range of reputable broadcasters who are willing to provide content that the market will not fund.&#xa0;6.3 Public service broadcasting should be funded from general taxation at a level agreed annually by Parliament.&#xa0;

[[[.0 Conclusion]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7.1 The ubiquity of digital television and the increasing use of the internet require a new paradigm of public service broadcasting.  &#xa0;7.2 The BBC should be treated just like any other broadcaster and required to obtain its income from a combination of fixed term contracts for public service broadcasting and voluntary subscriptions for popular entertainment.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
