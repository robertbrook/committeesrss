[[[WRITTEN SUBMISSION FROM THE CHARITY BANK (REVISED)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[INTRODUCTION ]]]1.                Charity Bank (‘the Bank’) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the structure of the banking sector in Northern Ireland. 2.    The Bank operates throughout the UK and is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. Its mission is to finance charities, social enterprises and community organisations (CSOs). Since its launch in 2002 it has been a leading social finance provider, having approved over £180 million in loans to more than 1,000 CSOs.  3.                Charity Bank has established itself as one of the leading social finance providers in Northern Ireland.  Operating from an office in Belfast, it has provided loan finance to organisations ranging from Omagh Community House to the Women’s Resource and Development Agency and raised £3.5 million in deposits over the past five years.  4.               This submission contains the Bank’s views on the issues contained in the Committee’s call for evidence, especially question 4 concerning SME access to finance, which the Bank considers to be of key significance for the future performance of the Northern Irish economy. 

[[[ACCESS TO FINANCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND]]]5.               The Committee seeks responses to questions concerning the functioning of the banking system and any repercussions for the growth of the wider economy and the flow of funds for start-ups and expansions. An analysis of market conditions in the banking sector in Northern Ireland is not straightforward because of the absence of relevant data. Earlier this year the British Bankers Association released an analysis of the geographical distribution of UK lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (‘SMEs’) (Geographical Spread of SME Borrowing, British Bankers Association, 22 July 2013). Unfortunately, this exercise did not contain information identifying Northern Ireland. 6.               Charity Bank notes the enquiry of the Competition Commission into the Supply of Personal Current Account Banking Services in Northern Ireland published on 15 May 2007. Although this did not address banking services for SMEs and was conducted before the ‘banking crash’ of 2008, it did consider aspects relating to the general structure of the retail banking sector in Northern Ireland. Interestingly, it concluded insofar as personal banking was concerned “that Northern Ireland forms a separate geographic market…from Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland” (paragraph 3.37). The same enquiry also concluded that “by Q4 2006, the market was concentrated” (paragraph 4.23). Since the Office of Fair Trading (Review of barriers to entry, expansion and exit in retail banking, OFT, September 2010, paragraph 3.34) found that levels of market concentration for certain products had intensified between 2006 and 2010, it might reasonably be concluded that levels of market concentration in Northern Ireland have not relaxed and may have intensified since 2008. This is important because the level of concentration in a market is regarded as influencing the degree of competition existing within it, which in turn is frequently reflected in the availability and range of products and services and their price. 7.               A large portion of the organisations to which the Bank lends are unable to secure debt finance from mainstream providers on terms that are both affordable and appropriate to the sector’s specific characteristics. For instance, the practice followed by traditional lenders of seeking personal guarantees from charity trustees is not normally followed by Charity Bank. Trustees frequently act in a voluntary, un-remunerated capacity and it would be inappropriate for the development of social lending markets to impose this type of potential personal liability. Equally, if a borrower has been successful in raising funds on the back of the Bank’s support and is in a position to repay the loan early, it can do so without penalty. 8.               The financial position of CSOs in Northern Ireland will be affected by the outlook for public spending. The Whitehall settlement to the Northern Ireland Office indicates an extended period of reductions in public spending over the period of the Comprehensive Spending Review. Experience suggests local authorities and other bodies responsible for public service delivery respond to public spending reductions by prioritising statutory services, with the result that activities which are non-statutory are disproportionately affected by funding reductions. Inevitably CSOs and especially bodies reliant on grant-funding will not be immune. 9.               The data indicates CSOs in Northern Ireland play an important role in the economy. But there is evidence they tend to fragmentation and are reliant on grants distributed by public bodies for their funding. These factors contribute to a lack of scale amongst CSOs and as a consequence, can hinder&#xa0;their ability to fulfil the potential&#xa0;to deliver services beyond the local and across a broad geographic area. A recent survey by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) (Survey of Northern Ireland’s Third Sector and its Potential to become more Enterprise Driven, DETI, 2013) reported 77% of social enterprises had the intention to expand. But a number of barriers to expansion were cited, including “a lack of available finance”, “not having the right people” and “a lack of awareness of the support” available.10.               In assessing a loan application, the Bank reviews the salience of the organisation’s business model and business strategy and the effectiveness of its trustees and senior management in executing that strategy. The organisation needs to show that it is capable of securing sustainable revenue streams over an extended period of time and that it can exercise control over its costs and generate free cash flow. The Bank’s experience in Northern Ireland suggests a significant portion of CSOs are not sufficiently developed organisationally to use loan finance with confidence. Internal data covering the twelve month period to the end of August this year shows that very nearly a third of loan applications were declined by the Bank on the grounds they failed adequately to demonstrate an ability to satisfy repayment criteria.      11.               The Bank believes solutions must be sought to aid the growth of the social economy in Northern Ireland. Charity Bank has experience of successfully managing and delivering a range of debt and development programmes by way of an alternative approach to reliance on mainstream banking. Examples include;12.               Regarding the question of specific service areas that might be appropriate for the development of CSO provision, those organisations that have a substantial asset base and good visibility of future revenue are particularly attractive from a banking perspective. Social housing and social care are both services that fall within this category and therefore provide a good basis for further expansion.13.               Charity Bank would like to take this opportunity to register its willingness to maintain a dialogue with the Committee as it further develops its views. In particular and if it was felt appropriate, it would be delighted to amplify the evidence contained in this document. 7th October 2013 1
