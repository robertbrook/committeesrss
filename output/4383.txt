[[[Written evidence submitted by Christine Lord (BTO0003)]]]&#xa0;Has the threat of ongoing transmission of vCJD through blood and blood product supply been adequately mitigated?&#xa0;Here is my reply and experience I am also offering myself as witness to the inquiry committee. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;During my investigations I too have been intimidated, bullied and threatened, all of this and more is recorded in my book Who killed my son?  I have attached the NUJ the Journalist review of my book. &#xa0;&#xa0;VCJD has not gone away and continues to kill not just here in the Uk but globally. I have recently returned from meeting families affected by CJD in Italy. People continue to die of human BSE due to ingesting infected bovine material during the 1980s and 1990s, according to Professor Collinge there may be incubation periods of 50 years, generations remain at risk. Many of us who may incubate or carry the disease will be blood donors or hospital patients. All have the potential to pass on the deadly infection via blood and medical procedures. We face a secondary wave of vCJD infection via these routes. &#xa0;One of the most recent victims of vCJD who became infected due to ingesting infected beef during the 1990s or 1980s was a vegetarian. He incubated the disease probably for decades before symptoms appeared.  People of faith who cannot eat any part of the cow and also strict veggies have died of vCJD. Irhad Rivizo died of vCJD a few years ago a young Muslim man who had not arrived in the UK from war torn Bosnia until late 1992. Irhad and his family were awarded the compensation as he had contracted the human form of BSE from food medicines here in the UK.  We need to stop more deaths of vCJD through contaminated blood or blood producs. I have interviewed families who have lost a loved one to vCJD who had also been a blood donor, they were warned by the CJD unit and Department of Health officials ‘don’t tell anyone your child gave blood especially the press or your neighbours.’ These family members were terrified by the very officials who were supposed to offer help and support. This is a common theme in my personal and professional dealings with families who have been affected by vCJD. They have been kept isolated by government officials, many bullied this is totally unacceptable. As a parent who has lost a dearly loved only son to vCJD I have been continually appalled at the behaviour of many government officials present to victims and their families.  It’s a travesty that I am hopeful an inquiry will address too as this is part of the cankered core that created BSE, unleashing it on an unsuspecting public. There are thousands more ‘living victims’ who could decline just like my son, tens of thousand of us now carry vCJD, it’s the biggest political and health scandal of modern times and its finally time for the public to know the whole truth about BSE. I fear that the government will not welcome a blood screening test. It would be relatively cheap to mass screen blood donors compared with the spiralling cost of other safeguards which have limited value. I fear the UK Government will stall and block any mass blood screening test for vCJD as it would highlight the prevalence of BSE exposure within the population, it would also show the exact source of the original infections. This is a particular can of worms the incumbent Conservative led government do not want to address. With a blood screening test for vCJD available  more understanding and funding for treatments and cures would result as would much more understanding of other neurological diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer’s. &#xa0;&#xa0;I would like to give evidence at the inquiry committee meeting and will end this with an extract from my book, Who killed my son? Andrew could be any mother’s son, anyone reading this submission. I  can supply members of the committee a copy of my book, profits go back to the campaign. I do not want more innocent people dying of human BSE due to contaminated blood and blood products. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
