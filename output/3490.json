"&#xa0;\nFurther submission from Eastern Shires Purchasing OrganisationFollow up note to oral evidence provided by ESPO 4th November‘\nWhat is ESPOs estimate of the scale of savings potentially deliverable through improved collaboration in procurement?’\nPreamble \nAs the committee may be aware there have been \na number of \nempirical and qualitative studies on \nthe subject matter of collaboration and savings potential pan public sector\n. The common \nconclusions \nare often\n the recognition of\n variability \nin potential \nacross expenditure categories, the relative ‘starting positions’ across local government and\n the willingness/fitness\n for purpose of collaboration in a range of circumstances\n all impacting the assessment\n. \nESPO believes that as well as the typical understanding of the term ‘savings’  as an improved price point via collaboration, it is important to recognise the broader, sometimes hidden costs. These include the cost of undertaking procurement itself, the value of enhanced management information to guide strategic decision making and the cost avoidance that is associated with costs of poor procurement.\nAs a result of this complex context \nESPO deliberately does not make a ‘savings promise’ \nsuch as a return for every pound spent through its procurement solutions. I\nnstead \nthe demonstration of value is in positive \nengage\nment \nwith local government\n to\n understand opportunity and act as a delivery \nagent for realising it. The case study below is an example of this approach which has delivered a saving of circa 4% on a major area of LG expenditure.\nCase Study: A National Framework for Temporary Staff (MSTAR) Background\nIn\n April 2011\n \nan\n \nESPO led \nPro5 framework \nagreement for the supply chain management for the provision of t\nemporary \n(agency) labour\n was \nestablished \nby ESPO a\ns a replacement for a previous localised contract. The contract was let to cover a four year period.\nOne of the drivers was that t\nhe Local Government Professional Services Group (LGPSG) had been tasked with exploring best practices and identifying and establishing procurement solutions\n in this market\n. The LGPSG identified the need for a national framework for temporary staffing to be established by local government for local government. \nPro5\n were asked to run such a procurement exercise and through consultation with our Pro5 partners, ESPO agreed to lead the\n procurement\n exercise.\nThe key drivers for establishing the new framework were\n:\nThe Department for Education (DfE) w\nas\n also exploring the potential for reducing significant spend in\n the Education staffing arena. \nSchools had similar pressures to local government and the wider public sector in facing budget cuts, whilst being expected to deliver services; coupled with the essential requirement to ensure \nthe \nsafeguarding of children.  The DfE was very keen to join this collaborative process and wished to include its requirements into the overall solution.  \nAn exte\nnsive procurement project followed with\n emphasis on aspects which were identified as being key: project management, collaboration/consultation, and communication. The project was completed over a period of 12 months and a framework established with 11 suppliers covering 6 lots offering neutral and master vendor solutions. The framework \nis \nknown as MSTAR (Managed Services for Temporary Agency Resources).\nESPO has established and continues to undertake a robust framework management programme. Regular supplier and customer engagement activities are carried out and management information is captured and presented to stakeholders on a quarterly basis via e-mail newsletters and the Local Government Association Knowledge Hub.\nSavings\nUnder the MSTAR framework there is a wide selection of management information received from suppliers. This covers the core elements relating to contract spend and savings achieved\n as a result of paying lower agency margins\n, and also the finer details ranging from invoice accuracy to hours process\ned\n against each job category. The \ndata reuirement\n arose from the initial MSTAR tender, where ESPO engaged with \nits\n stakeholders to establish what information would be useful and required by the parties. \nM\nanagement information is received from suppliers on a quarterly basis, against the financial year, and ESPO then collate and analyse this\n information by way of contract \nmanagement.\n \nBased on the management information received, the collective spend across all customers is \nalready \n£434.8m and the collective savings are \n£19.9m. This information covers the life of the framework to date (April 2011 to October 2013).\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1 – quarterly client expenditure &amp; savings on mark up over pay\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAdditional\n Benefits\nAs well as \ndeliver\ning\n significant\n cashable savings there are other \nbenefits \nthat come from a \nnational, collaborative framework established ‘by the sector, for the sector’\n:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReduc\ning\n duplication of effort involved in running separate OJEU procurement processes\n, all timely and costly administration processes\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImprov\ning\n control and safeguarding and increas\ning\n provision and transparency of management information to enable visibility over working practices and a strategic view of \nexpenditure\n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncourag\ning\n supply chains to engage with the SME community recognising Government’s desire to see SMEs and local businesses play a significant role in public sector service delivery\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEasy, efficient and swift temporary workers recruitment process \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnabl\ning\n sharing of commercial knowledge, including supplier and market intelligence and expert advice and facilitat\ning\n strategic relationships with suppliers to gain better VFM, improve performance and align with organisational priorities and government agendas, developing the sector and supply market.\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImproved demand management and temporary/permanent workforce planning through far enhanced provision of management information.\n&#xa0;\nTestimonials:\n“Bracknell Forest are pleased to have achieved savings of approx\nimately\n 14% during quarter four of the 2012/13 financial year under the MSTAR framework, as a result of reduced margins and process efficiencies. \n&#xa0;\nThe MSTAR framework gave the Council an alternative approach to the sourcing and procurement of Agency Workers.\n&#xa0;\n Our Managed Service Provider has worked hard to aggregate spend \nand\n to ensure that the supply chain meets all of the Councils requirements, and this has been achieved through hard work on both the Council and suppliers side during implementation, as alternative suppliers had to be sourced in the absence of agreements in place with many of our historical suppliers.\n&#xa0;\nUsing the MSP’s web based system has improved the reporting information available \nand\n has given the Council much greater confidence in meeting AWR requirements.\n&#xa0;\nWe hope that the contract continues to perform and deliver year on year savings by offering \na consistent and reliable approach to the hire of temporary agency workers.”\nClaire Garton from Bracknell Forest Council“MSTAR has consistently generated savings for Gloucestershire County Council, with current indications being around 16% over £750,000 per quarter, in addition to promoting regional / national benchmarking and continuous service improvement.\n&#xa0;As an example of national collaboration the framework delivered by ESPO should be regarded as the ultimate blue print.\n&#xa0;\n The contract is flexible enough to encompass user requirements on a national scale but focussed enough to deliver significant savings.\n&#xa0;\n ESPO spent considerable time and resource ensuring they really listened to their Local Authority customers in setting up this framework and this has certainly paid dividends.”\nClaire Smart from Gloucestershire County Council&#xa0;Concluding Comments\nESPO has many case study examples of multiple benefits being derived as a result of collaborative procurement. These can stem from aggregated volume, aggregation of ‘know how’ and market experience cross sector, an ability to be able invest the required time and effort in pre-market engagement that lead to the running of well-conceived procurement processes. ESPO’s cost recovery in this case study is between 1p and 2p in the hourly rate. This represents as little as 0.0015% to 0.003% (based on a worker receiving the national minimum wage).\nESPO has not concluded that an absence of mandating or unwillingness of local government to collaborate is acting as a barrier to the non-achievement of latent savings that would stem from collaboration. Indeed ESPO is itself the result of a successful collaboration over three decades between seven local government authorities. Collaboration is commonly viewed as one of a number of tools and on the whole is a sensibly utilised tool.\nGovernment figures are sometimes criticised as being ‘optimistic’ in the scale of cashable savings directly attributed to just collaboration;\n however, they undoubtedly provide an indicative understanding of the potential.\n&#xa0;\nJohn Doherty, Managing Director, ESPO\nKristian Smith, Assistant Director, Procurement &amp; Compliance, ESPO\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n"
