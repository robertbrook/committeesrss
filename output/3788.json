"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence\n f\nrom Mr Stephen Bellows \n(CYS0041)\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI cycle for pleasure and fitness, usually alone, occasionally \nwith one other person.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n  I am increasingly concerned for my safety when cycling on the roads where I live.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n  This is due not only to so\nme people\n driving without due care and attention\n but primarily because of the hostile attitude of a significant minority \nof motorists.\nI use the word significant because that is what the consequences for me could be if an accident occurs.\n \nSome shout abuse or threats, some make it clear that in their view I should not be using the\n road\n.\nSome overtake at speed, without a\nny at\ntempt to give me any space, even if the road is wide and otherwise empty.\nSome overtake and pull back in very close to the front of my bike, rubbing their wheels into the \nverge\n.\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n  While these things do not occur every day\n,\n it is usual to experience hostile driving at some point every week.\nAll of these things make me feel as if I am being bullied off from the road. There is often little or no margin for error on my part.\nThere are some cycle paths in the area where I live b\nut they are unsuitable \nfor adult / competent cyclists\n who wish to \ncycle distances or at much above walking pace.\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n  \nI would like to see a high publicity safety and awareness campaign, with the backing of both government and police, aimed at establishing th\ne right of cyclists to use the national road network and re enforcing the responsibility in law of taking due c\nare and attention while driving.\n \nA clear and unequivocal statement from the\n \nPrime\n minister would make a good start.\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI realize that \nthe \nrecent \nfatal accidents in London must take some priority for cycle safety but rural roads are not the blissful places that others may believe.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
