[[[A view from the headteacher of an academy]]]A submission to the Select Committee inquiry into certain aspects of the academies programmeWhile the examples used in this document are taken from my own school and from other schools in Carlisle, the views expressed are just my own.  _________________________________________________________________________________1              Introduction 1.1              Trinity School had been a grant maintained school until April 1999, when we became a Voluntary Aided School. In September 2011 we became a Church of England academy. The conversion process for the school was extra-ordinarily difficult and complicated, with different interested parties (such as the Local Authority, Cumbria, and the Diocese of Carlisle) each wanting a say in how things were to be resolved and in such nuanced detail that it protracted the process.This meant that valuable time for senior leaders was taken away from the core work of the school. I do not think that we had anticipated that. We had hoped for something akin to ‘opting out’ in the 1990’s, but it was not and certainly our expectations of what would happen after conversion have followed in the same way: it remains very complex, and I think that I would say excessively so.1.2              In addition to that, the freedoms we had hoped for in education terms have not materialised. Rather we have seen an increase in centrally controlled and administered data evaluations of the school, as with all others, and we have not been able to develop the curriculum as we would have liked, given what we were led to expect as an academy. The freedoms offered have been organisational: to fix holiday dates, conditions of employment, collaboration with other schools etc. We had hoped to be able to develop our own pathways based curriculum, with something fairly bespoke for each student or group of students. Instead, we have to comply with the new measures, such as Progress 8, in designing the essence of our curriculum offer for our students. It is now far less fit for purpose as an academy than it was before, but that is not of our making.2              Narrowing the gap for disadvantaged students2.1              We feel that we had done this very well by 2010, with a diversified curriculum meaning that the difficulties of a formal exam based GCSE scheme were not imposed on all students but rather we had a good blend of vocational and experience based offers for students. We had not chosen diplomas or the fill-them-in-quick on-line schemes which have been rightly discredited and withdrawn. Our BTEC, ASDAN, and CoPE courses engaged students and then did well. For example, nine fairly disaffected Year 11 boys had places at the local FE college on the young apprenticeship scheme, and each was successful in completing the course, and securing an apprenticeship. That has sadly gone, as has so much else. 2.2              While the first style sponsored academies were established in demanding urban areas, the Academies Act of 2010 ushered in the new wave of converter academies, where the focus was something very different. These were the more successful often middle-class schools. Nevertheless, the freedoms offered by  academy status to such schools could have helped us to continue to develop a range of courses and combinations for students. Raise-online and other performance indicator data point the opposite way, and we worry for the return to disaffection which such an academic, exam based programme could produce in academies or in other schools.2.3              Centralised, data-based management of the school system to define a  ‘transformational impact’ as higher exam grades will not do the task hoped for it. Rather it runs the risk of having the exact opposite effect. 3              Compelling academisation 3.1              This has been one of the most unfortunate aspects of the current scheme. If it is thought that being an academy is the best way of being a school and running the school, then we should all be one. However, there then seem to be no time at all between a ‘failing’ Ofsted report and a move to require the school to become an academy, which almost sounds punitive rather than an opportunity for that school. This is an odd dichotomy in the system.3.2              The experience of secondary schooling in Carlisle has been badly marred by the 2008 reoganisation of schools, creating two sponsored academies, with local sponsors and more recently  a national company take-over. Both schools are now in Special Measures and the loss of good staff from them, and increased admission pressures on other schools, have been very detrimental to all parties, not least to the young people of the city and their families. This seems to present a clear case of enforcing academy status being ineffective.3.3              While just one example, the process of take-over, closure and replacement is not then guaranteed to  produce the desired changes. The picture must by definition be more complicated, which is what we ought to expect. 4              The role of the Secretary of State4.1              It seems very odd that one person should have such a hands-on role in this process in a national system of education. It should not be this office-holder or her/his office which is responsible – this is a huge scheme which needs a proper structure to oversee it. If there is to be a different structure, then it should not come as an addition to the present situation. Precisely because the present state cannot obtain in the longer term, whatever is new has to be replacement and simplification. 5              The wider organisation 5.1              With the increased powers of the Secretary of State, another new and punitive Ofsted framework, the uncertainty of the future of key players in the sector (what is to become of the National College for Teaching and Leadership?) and the crumbling of the local authority structure under budget cuts, the picture to someone like me inside the system is that it is fragmented and in parts chaotic. We do not have any free schools in our area to complicate things further, but we do have a UTC on the west coast of Cumbria, where there are already surplus places in the secondary sector. Something needs to be done, either to remove Local Authorities and be done with it, and then to replace them with a simpler and more effective structure, or to re-instate them, but again with their functions streamlined and competent. 6              Academy chains6.1              The loss of self-determination for a school is a significant thing, and the rise of the executive headteacher, with a wider role in several schools rather than ‘owning’ one, is a substantial part of the question we should be asking. The sense of the learning community of a school, with shared knowledge and history and traditions, is also an important part of defining what a village or part of a town is about. There seems to be an intent to do away with so much of that. I went to the dinner at the end of Habergham High School in Burnley, where I used to teach. It had been the former boys’ and girls’ grammar schools but had managed to go through the comprehensive programme, only to be swept away in a new and academy-based reorganisation. 1559 – 2007 the paperweight says. It was also very sad to see the demolition of the old Girls’ County High School in Carlisle, which had been St Aidan’s, and now has been replaced by a ‘dreadful’ (my view) building, a new 1960s prefab with atrium and green vinyl but without beauty and unlikely to create for itself a story which becomes a history. I am very unsure about why we are doing this.6.2              My  fear about academy chains: it is a business model, the local corner shops all join together, but they lose their identity and belonging by doing so, are taken over, and we have done something to state schools that independent schools would not countenance.7              Primary schools7.1              Of course they are too small to do become academies in the main, and it would not have been difficult to restrict academies to secondary (and all-through?) schools, and produce something different for primary schools, especially the many small ones. The insistence on academies has not been wise. Therefore,  the cluster/chain/consortium approach is produced. It does seem as if the schools are being massaged to fit the scheme rather than the scheme allowing schools to become what they want to be. The incremental notion of sustainable change is not part of the present approach, sadly. Schools do work together and should develop that strongly. In due course, this may lead to an academy chain or multi-academy trust. However, excessive speed and great complexity in arrangements are not good features in their own right and certainly not in one place.8              Failing schools 8.1              There may be some schools which are 100% outstanding – every lesson, every student etc. It seems unlikely: we are much more likely to have, say, 40% superb, 40% good, 15% OK and 5% not so good or poor, across every institution. The question is one of description and how far a single word can do justice to the state of play of one school, even a small village primary school. There is also a question about the likely long term success of a system which is ‘failure driven.’ 8.2              Before we ask what structure or system would work best to improve a school which, in some areas, is not doing so well as we would like, we ought to ask about what the ingredients are for a creating and describing a good school. It may have much more to do with the quality of the staff who work there and who lead the school, rather than a wider organisational scheme.8.3              Therefore there should be far less interest in academies or chains or free schools – and much more about the professions and the professionalism of the people who work in schools. I recall hearing about the Finland model and feeling that this was very much at the heart of things: a Masters trained teaching force, with a high tariff on professional development but within a non-evaluative non-data driven system, no inspections, no exams – but a real value on education not simply per se but because it is the knowledge, skills and understanding that the students actually have that matter, not the statistics of the grades they have achieved in tests.8.4              One school in south Cumbria went into Special Measures and then the follow-up inspection one year later found it to be Outstanding. This does trouble me. I wonder if Raise-online is actually a seriously damaging and deeply flawed piece of apparatus, but one which has achieved the status of an unchallengeable authority on school performance which it certainly is not. 9              Wrong priorities9.1              Perhaps whether a school is an academy or not may, in the longer term of things, prove to be not really important at all.9.2               ‘Grant maintained’ status was short lived, and ‘direct grant’ grammar schools slightly longer – but they have passed. The current fragmentation cannot stay in the longer term – and the present uncertainty is in itself unhelpful. The lack of any sense of direction for the whole vessel is troubling, with the removal of ‘old certainties’ from schools, such as the annual incremental progression, 1265 hours, 190 days, schools having the same holiday patterns, the validity of exam marking etc being corrosive for a profession criticised as never before. ‘Curriculum 2000’ was meant to be the defining change to post 16 A levels – but we have had five more since then..? So it may not be the nature of academies themselves but rather the chaotic upheaval, masquerading as deep system change, which will characterise these few years when we look back upon them. 9.3              That being the case, something different again will be needed from 2015-2020 in place of the current mincemeat mess that schools are being pressed into.December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
