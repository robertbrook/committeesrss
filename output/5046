defaultSummary of Key Points default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force areadefault.defaultSince taking up the new role of Commiss
defaultioner on the 22 November 2012, th
defaulte 
defaultCommissioner and 
defaulthis Deputy Commissioner have worked closely with the Force, 
defaultpartners, stakeholders 
defaultand the public to create a 
defaultmore holistic approach to problem solving. The focus has been clear, to forge stronger relationships with 
defaultcommunities
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThe Commissioner’s vision is to
default be
default the 
default‘People’s Commissioner’, defaultmaking himself available to individuals, victims of crime and communities and listen to their concerns. 
defaultThe Commissioners focus is on making people feel safer, remove criminality from their neighbourhoods and tackle the social cause behind offending to permanently interrupt this vicious cycle.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultThe Nottinghamshire 
defaultPolice and Crime Plan
default reflects the views and interests of everyone living and working in 
defaultNottingham and 
defaultNottinghamshire.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultCrime in Nottinghamshire is currently following a national trend which has seen a slight increase in comparison to last year. The increase (+3.2%) has slowed since the start of the year but remains a concern and 
defaultthe Commissioner and Chief Constable are 
defaultworking hard to address this fluctuation.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultOne way of addressing the rise is 
defaultthrough 
defaultsmarter working with our partners
default (Community Safety Partnerships for the City (CDP)
default, 
defaultthe County (Safer Neighbourhood Board
default and 
defaultLocal Criminal Justice Board
default)
default as well as commissioning services from crime reduction organisations so that we tackl
defaulte criminality from every angle. 
defaultIt is recognised that Nottinghamshire Police has had a more difficult financial challenge than many other forces, it needs to save £43.6m over the four years of the spending review (between March 2011 and March 2015). This savings requirement is 19% of the overall budget. T
defaulthe Commissioner recognises that there is to be a review
default of the funding formula, with the 
defaultsuggestion that this will not be introduced until 2016-17 at the earliest. 
defaultThe Commissioner is urging that c
defaultonsultation on the new formula needs to begin now. 
default              
default4.6
default              
defaultOne of the positive developments highlighted in the recent performance update relates to satisfaction levels among victims of crime. 87
default.1
default% of victims of crime are completely, very or fairly satisfied with the service they have received from Nottinghamshire Police which is just 2.
default9
default% away from the Police and Crime Plan target of 90%
default.
default The County is 87.8% and the City is 86.2%
default&#xa0;
default4.7default              defaultThe role of commissioners in holding thdefaulteir chief constables to account.defaultThe 
defaultPolice and Crime P
defaultlan sets out 
defaultthe Commissioner’s 
defaultgovernance and accountability arrangements
default; these are further outlined in the Commissioner’s Governance Framework
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.8
default              
defaultA range of performance indicators relating to the 
defaultseven
default strategic themes contained within the current Police and Crime Plan are monitored by the Office of 
defaultthe 
defaultCommissioner 
default(OPCC) 
defaultand where performance is identified as a risk the Commissioner holds the Chief Constable to account to seek assurances that action is being taken to address the performance concerns.
default The Commissioner will do this through bilateral weekly meetings with the Chief Constable and through an extended bimonthly 
defaultStrategic 
defaultResource and Performance 
defaultM
defaulteeting with the wider Chief Officer Team
default. These meetings are held at various venues across Nottingham and Nottinghamshire
default. In addition, the Commissioner, his Deputy and various members of his office attend a number of Force and Divisional performance meetings where necessary assurances are sought and obtained.
default&#xa0;
default4.9default              defaultThe role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners defaultto account.defaultThe Nottinghamshire County Council is the host authority for the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Panel.
default The Panel scrutinises the actions and decisions of the Police and Crime Commissioner and makes sure information is available for the public, enabling them to hold the Commissioner to account.
default&#xa0;
default4.10
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCommissioner provides the Panel with an update report on the performance, key decisions made and activities. Together with providing an update report on Domestic Violence and six monthly Police and Crime Plan monitoring reports.
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCommissioner’s 
defaultPolice and Crime 
defaultPlan was scrutinised and approved by the Police and Crime Panel 
defaultin 
defaultMarch
default 2013
default.
default The refreshed Plan will be reported to the Panel meeting 
defaultthe 3
default February
default 2014
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.12default              defaultThe division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform anddefault Social Responsibility Act 2011.defaultAs part of the stage two transfer process, 
defaultthe Commissioner was 
defaultrequired to advise the Home Secretary of 
defaultp
defaultlans for the 
defaultS
defaulttage 
defaultTwo T
defaultransfer of staff by 16 September 2013
default. 
defaultThe vision for the Stage Two Second Transfer has been agreed between the Commissioner and the Chief Constable.
default The Commissioner’s recommendation is that there is a ‘
defaultMdefaultaximum Transferdefault’ model for Nottinghamshire, which would mean the transfer of all police staff from Operational Frontline, Operational Support and Business Support
default functions to the employment of the Chief Constable. The Deputy Commissioner and the staff employed to work within the Nottinghamshire OPCC will remain under the employment of the Commissioner. In addition the Force will provide business support to the Commissioner as identified within the Working Relationship Agreement and in line with the Policing Protocol Order 2011.
default 
default&#xa0;
default 4.13
default              
defaultThere will be ongoing work to ensure a robust implementation plan once the Home Secretary has approved the Transfer Scheme.
default&#xa0;
default4.14default              defaultTdefaulthe role of commissioners defaultin budget and precept setting.defaultTogether with producing the Police and Crime Plan, the Commissioner has had to make some key decisions which have included setting the precept and the budget for the totality of policing. The Commissioner has also produced his first Annual Report
default which has been shared with the Police and Crime Panel. This Annual Report covers the whole of the financial year from April 2012 to March 2013, and highlights the key commitments made by the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, together with reflecting the performance improvements achieved by the previous Police Authority. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThe 
defaultC
defaultommissioner has set up the Community Safety Partnership Fund specifically to assist small local groups to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour and protect and support victims of crime at neighbourhood level. 
defaultThe projects complement those led by partners through the Community Safety Partnerships in each local authority area. Confirmation of the funding allocation for next year will be in January 2014.

The assessment includes consultation with communities in order to make sure that we are addressing the issues that matter the most to Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.
default&#xa0;
default4.22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA significant focus on performance is being progressed by three Partnership Gold Groups which have now been established following recent Crime Summits (i.e. Burglary, Violence and Shoplifting) and action plans are being developed and actions implemented where possible to tackle identified key risks.
default&#xa0;
default4.23
default              
defaultListening to local communities is essential for the Commissioner, but so too is getting first-hand insight into the issues and concerns they raise. 
defaultWith the Deputy Commissioner there are targeted Community walkabouts in priority areas, to gain a better understanding of the police and partnership working
default, areas covered have included: St Ann’s, Aspley, Arboretum, Bulwell, Newark, Worksop, Mansfield and Sutton, these neighbourhood visits include meeting local representatives to hear more about how we might help resolve local problems.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default4.25default              defaultProgress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, polidefaultcing organisations and partners.defaultThe Commissioner currently sits on a Regional PCC Collaboration Board which is addressing opportunities to develop future regional collaboration 
defaultagreements. In July 2013, the PCCs for the East Midlands region
default commissioned Her Majes

default witnesses, victims and the general public receive from local policing and community safety
default, a summary is provided below
default:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe financial climate continues to dominate the public sector risk registers. The current Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) required up to 20% cuts in grant funding to 2014-15
default, which means a saving of over £40 million
default. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultContinuing to lobby for more resources
default, with the cost of savings being a challenging £10m each year
default.

defaultFurther explore the opportunities for regional collaboration through the Regional PCC Board and the Regional Efficiency Board.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDespite the 
defaultcontinuing economic pressures, there is a commitment to
default increase the number of Police Officers and PCSOs working in our neighbourhoods in 2013-14. Visible, accessible policing helps to reassure people and increase their feelings of safety and wellbeing – effects which are worth their weight in gold as far as quality of life is concerned.
