[normal]Summary of Key Points [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area[bold].[bold]Since taking up the new role of Commiss
[normal]ioner on the 22 November 2012, th
[normal]e 
[normal]Commissioner and 
[normal]his Deputy Commissioner have worked closely with the Force, 
[normal]partners, stakeholders 
[normal]and the public to create a 
[normal]more holistic approach to problem solving. The focus has been clear, to forge stronger relationships with 
[normal]communities
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Commissioner’s vision is to
[normal] be
[normal] the 
[normal]‘People’s Commissioner’, [bold]making himself available to individuals, victims of crime and communities and listen to their concerns. 
[normal]The Commissioners focus is on making people feel safer, remove criminality from their neighbourhoods and tackle the social cause behind offending to permanently interrupt this vicious cycle.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]The Nottinghamshire 
[normal]Police and Crime Plan
[normal] reflects the views and interests of everyone living and working in 
[normal]Nottingham and 
[normal]Nottinghamshire.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Crime in Nottinghamshire is currently following a national trend which has seen a slight increase in comparison to last year. The increase (+3.2%) has slowed since the start of the year but remains a concern and 
[normal]the Commissioner and Chief Constable are 
[normal]working hard to address this fluctuation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]One way of addressing the rise is 
[normal]through 
[normal]smarter working with our partners
[normal] (Community Safety Partnerships for the City (CDP)
[normal], 
[normal]the County (Safer Neighbourhood Board
[normal] and 
[normal]Local Criminal Justice Board
[normal])
[normal] as well as commissioning services from crime reduction organisations so that we tackl
[normal]e criminality from every angle. 
[normal]It is recognised that Nottinghamshire Police has had a more difficult financial challenge than many other forces, it needs to save £43.6m over the four years of the spending review (between March 2011 and March 2015). This savings requirement is 19% of the overall budget. T
[normal]he Commissioner recognises that there is to be a review
[normal] of the funding formula, with the 
[normal]suggestion that this will not be introduced until 2016-17 at the earliest. 
[normal]The Commissioner is urging that c
[normal]onsultation on the new formula needs to begin now. 
[normal]              
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]One of the positive developments highlighted in the recent performance update relates to satisfaction levels among victims of crime. 87
[normal].1
[normal]% of victims of crime are completely, very or fairly satisfied with the service they have received from Nottinghamshire Police which is just 2.
[normal]9
[normal]% away from the Police and Crime Plan target of 90%
[normal].
[normal] The County is 87.8% and the City is 86.2%
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7[bold]              [bold]The role of commissioners in holding th[bold]eir chief constables to account.[bold]The 
[normal]Police and Crime P
[normal]lan sets out 
[normal]the Commissioner’s 
[normal]governance and accountability arrangements
[normal]; these are further outlined in the Commissioner’s Governance Framework
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8
[normal]              
[normal]A range of performance indicators relating to the 
[normal]seven
[normal] strategic themes contained within the current Police and Crime Plan are monitored by the Office of 
[normal]the 
[normal]Commissioner 
[normal](OPCC) 
[normal]and where performance is identified as a risk the Commissioner holds the Chief Constable to account to seek assurances that action is being taken to address the performance concerns.
[normal] The Commissioner will do this through bilateral weekly meetings with the Chief Constable and through an extended bimonthly 
[normal]Strategic 
[normal]Resource and Performance 
[normal]M
[normal]eeting with the wider Chief Officer Team
[normal]. These meetings are held at various venues across Nottingham and Nottinghamshire
[normal]. In addition, the Commissioner, his Deputy and various members of his office attend a number of Force and Divisional performance meetings where necessary assurances are sought and obtained.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9[bold]              [bold]The role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners [bold]to account.[bold]The Nottinghamshire County Council is the host authority for the Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Panel.
[normal] The Panel scrutinises the actions and decisions of the Police and Crime Commissioner and makes sure information is available for the public, enabling them to hold the Commissioner to account.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.10
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Commissioner provides the Panel with an update report on the performance, key decisions made and activities. Together with providing an update report on Domestic Violence and six monthly Police and Crime Plan monitoring reports.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.11
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Commissioner’s 
[normal]Police and Crime 
[normal]Plan was scrutinised and approved by the Police and Crime Panel 
[normal]in 
[normal]March
[normal] 2013
[normal].
[normal] The refreshed Plan will be reported to the Panel meeting 
[normal]the 3
[normal] February
[normal] 2014
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.12[bold]              [bold]The division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and[bold] Social Responsibility Act 2011.[bold]As part of the stage two transfer process, 
[normal]the Commissioner was 
[normal]required to advise the Home Secretary of 
[normal]p
[normal]lans for the 
[normal]S
[normal]tage 
[normal]Two T
[normal]ransfer of staff by 16 September 2013
[normal]. 
[normal]The vision for the Stage Two Second Transfer has been agreed between the Commissioner and the Chief Constable.
[normal] The Commissioner’s recommendation is that there is a ‘
[normal]M[bold]aximum Transfer[bold]’ model for Nottinghamshire, which would mean the transfer of all police staff from Operational Frontline, Operational Support and Business Support
[normal] functions to the employment of the Chief Constable. The Deputy Commissioner and the staff employed to work within the Nottinghamshire OPCC will remain under the employment of the Commissioner. In addition the Force will provide business support to the Commissioner as identified within the Working Relationship Agreement and in line with the Policing Protocol Order 2011.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 4.13
[normal]              
[normal]There will be ongoing work to ensure a robust implementation plan once the Home Secretary has approved the Transfer Scheme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.14[bold]              [bold]T[bold]he role of commissioners [bold]in budget and precept setting.[bold]Together with producing the Police and Crime Plan, the Commissioner has had to make some key decisions which have included setting the precept and the budget for the totality of policing. The Commissioner has also produced his first Annual Report
[normal] which has been shared with the Police and Crime Panel. This Annual Report covers the whole of the financial year from April 2012 to March 2013, and highlights the key commitments made by the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, together with reflecting the performance improvements achieved by the previous Police Authority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.15
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]C
[normal]ommissioner has set up the Community Safety Partnership Fund specifically to assist small local groups to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour and protect and support victims of crime at neighbourhood level. 
[normal]The projects complement those led by partners through the Community Safety Partnerships in each local authority area. Confirmation of the funding allocation for next year will be in January 2014. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the meantime 
[normal]there will be 
[normal]a 
[normal]review
[normal] of the 
[normal]application process for the Community Safety Partnership Fund 
[normal]to be 
[normal]ready for any future funding rounds.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.16
[normal]              
[normal]The Community Safety Partnership Fund provides small grants of £25,000 or less to voluntary and community groups for projects which 
[normal]assist in reducing crime and protecting victims, witnesses and vulnerable people.
[normal] There were 
[normal]89 applications received at the end of May, requesting £1.4m.  Following appraisal, 28 projects were approved to a value of £351,50.90.  There is a diverse range of projects working in the following areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.17
[normal]              
[normal]Some projects contribute towards more than one of the Police and Crime Plan Priorities.  
[normal]All the projects can be viewed at the Commissioners Web Page 
[normal]he[bold]r[bold]e[bold].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.18
[normal]              
[normal]The small grants fund is currently running at £380k which includes match funding for preventative and target hardening work in the County, with a further amount for supporting crime and antisocial behaviour through:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]D
[normal]evelop a multi agency process of identification of girls affected by gangs, identifying risk and developing pathways to enable appropriate support
[normal].
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Offer early intervention support to girls involved in gangs.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]£130k per annum for Domestic Violence Medium Risk Intervention Workers (X1 City &amp; x2 County - WAIS) &amp; NWAL)
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]£30K to the University of Leicester for academic research to identify innoavtive opportutnites to improve services to support and respond to victims’ individual needs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.19
[normal]              
[normal]The Commissioner also hosted a national “Facing up to Offending” Conference on the 3 December, 
[normal]outlining the 
[normal]recognition 
[normal]of 
[normal]the significant benefits of Restorative Justice and the need for a quality consistent approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]20
[normal]              
[normal]There are
[normal] 
[normal]various consultation exercises planned for refreshing the Police and Crime Plan and ensuring public opinion informs priorities, these include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2[bold]1[bold]              [bold]The effectiveness of commissioners in prom[bold]oting local policing priorities.[bold]The annual Joint Partnership Strategic Assessment provides the threat, risk and harm assessment of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire to ensure that we identity new and emerging issues and tackle the policing and community safety issues that are of most concern. The assessment includes consultation with communities in order to make sure that we are addressing the issues that matter the most to Nottingham and Nottinghamshire.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A significant focus on performance is being progressed by three Partnership Gold Groups which have now been established following recent Crime Summits (i.e. Burglary, Violence and Shoplifting) and action plans are being developed and actions implemented where possible to tackle identified key risks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.23
[normal]              
[normal]Listening to local communities is essential for the Commissioner, but so too is getting first-hand insight into the issues and concerns they raise. 
[normal]With the Deputy Commissioner there are targeted Community walkabouts in priority areas, to gain a better understanding of the police and partnership working
[normal], areas covered have included: St Ann’s, Aspley, Arboretum, Bulwell, Newark, Worksop, Mansfield and Sutton, these neighbourhood visits include meeting local representatives to hear more about how we might help resolve local problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.24
[normal]              
[normal]The Commissioner also opened the first Bingham Safety Fair which brought together a multitude of c
[normal]r
[normal]ime reduction organisations to provide free advice and information to the public.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.25[bold]              [bold]Progress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, poli[bold]cing organisations and partners.[bold]The Commissioner currently sits on a Regional PCC Collaboration Board which is addressing opportunities to develop future regional collaboration 
[normal]agreements. In July 2013, the PCCs for the East Midlands region
[normal] commissioned Her Majes
[normal]ty’
[normal]s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to conduct a review of the arrangements for collaboration between the five forces in the 
[normal]region.
[normal] The Final Report was published on the Commissioner’s website on 11 November 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.26
[normal]              
[normal]Previously three areas of collaboration were treated as Jointly Controlled Operations (JCO). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.27
[normal]              
[normal]These are all between Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire PCC’s and Nottinghamshire’s proportion is 27.6%.  There are five additional collaborations ac
[normal]counted for as JCO’s this last year:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.28
[normal]              
[normal]All of these arrangements are covered by Section 22 Agreements and financial information is included in note 13 to the accounts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.29[bold]              [bold]Transparency of and reporting by commissioners to date.[bold]The Commissioner has produced his Annual Governance Statement, reporting against the ‘Delivering Good Governance’ principles. 
[normal]There has been an 
[normal]annual governance review and the production of the 
[normal]Group 
[normal]Statement of Accounts for 2012-2013
[normal] which reflects the financial position of meeting continued savings of £10m each year whilst increasing visibility and accessibility of policing. 
[normal]There has also been the production of the 
[normal]Code of 
[normal]Corporate Governance which sets out the standard that the Commissioner and the Chief Constable will govern as separate corporations sole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.30
[normal]              
[normal]All decisions and reports are publish
[normal]ed on the Commissioners 
[normal]web
[normal]s
[normal]ite
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]31[bold]              [bold]There has been significant progress against the Commissioner’s election pledges, with a focus on making Nottinghamshire safer and improving the service
[normal]s
[normal] witnesses, victims and the general public receive from local policing and community safety
[normal], a summary is provided below
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The financial climate continues to dominate the public sector risk registers. The current Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) required up to 20% cuts in grant funding to 2014-15
[normal], which means a saving of over £40 million
[normal]. 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Continuing to lobby for more resources
[normal], with the cost of savings being a challenging £10m each year
[normal]. 
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Maintained the same level of funding of 
[normal]£3
[normal]m to local partnerships to provide community safety and victims’ services despite a reduction in the Community Safety funding provided by Government.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further explore the opportunities for regional collaboration through the Regional PCC Board and the Regional Efficiency Board.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite the 
[normal]continuing economic pressures, there is a commitment to
[normal] increase the number of Police Officers and PCSOs working in our neighbourhoods in 2013-14. Visible, accessible policing helps to reassure people and increase their feelings of safety and wellbeing – effects which are worth their weight in gold as far as quality of life is concerned.
[normal]
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Recruitment 
[normal]in this half year has been
[normal]: 
[normal]113.84 FTE

[normal]Following a commissioned research project, the Commissioner has approved the review and implementation of the x30 recommendations and report back to the BME Project Steering Group. 
[normal]A
[normal] Joint Working Group 
[normal]has been 
[normal]established
[normal],
[normal] chaired by the Commissioner with DCC Fish overseeing the programme of work which will be reported to the BME Project Steering Group on a regular basis.

[normal]The Force continues with its activities and implementation of its Public Engagement Strategy 2013-2018.
[normal] 
[normal]A paper has been prepared showing the approach being taken and the work that is required to achieve the aim in the long term.  
[normal]Current BME representation in Force stands at 3.9% (August 2013).  This shows little change from the proportion recorded in March last year, however the Force is in the process of recruiting new officers following a positive action campaign and therefore a change may be seen in the representation statistics in the coming months. The 3.9% figure is lower than the BME population of Nottinghamshire, which stands at 11.2% (Source: 2011 Census Data).
[normal]A[bold]Par[bold]t[bold]ner Activities[bold]PCP P1.11 Promote and develop opportunities for local communities, individuals and businesses to work together to reduce crime. 
[normal]There is the Commissioner’s Engagement and Consultation Strategy and forward plan of consultation to identify priorities from local communities and businesses. 
[normal]Nottinghamshire Police are running a pilot with the Co-Operative chain of supermarkets looking at minimum standards of evidence for reporting. Nottinghamshire Police are currently working as the Primary Authority for the C
[normal]o-Op
[normal], so any issues they get nationally in relation to retail crime on their premises, they will come to 
[normal]the Force 
[normal]first to advise / pilot, before putting anything into place in their stores in other parts of the UK.  
[normal]T
[normal]he Co-
[normal]o
[normal]p have dedicated a member of their management team to work closely and regularly with 
[normal]the Force 
[normal]to roll out the pilot.

[normal]A[bold]PCP F2.4 Digitalise the way case files are produced and transferred.
[normal]Digitalisation of case files update - everything is now sent electronically from the Bridewell and Mansfield Custody suites bar Crown Court upgrade files (trial files). Newark custody suite is fully digitalised.  Remand files are still sent via paper due to process issues 
[normal]with
[normal] the Crown Prosecution Service; capacity is lacking for dealing with these pre court, so whilst the files are digitalised ready for upgrade, hard copies are also sent.  Crown Court upgrades are in process- current progress is that all Early Guilty plea files are sent electronically.  There is still a lot of manual input from the Police side in terms of delivering electronic 
[normal]files, but the main focus of work is now Crime and Justice working to ensure electronic capture.

[normal] 
[normal]Year-to-date figures to July 2013 show that the current effective trial rate is 
[normal]43.5%[bold] for the Magistrates Court, and
