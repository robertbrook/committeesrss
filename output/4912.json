Counties account for more than half of all Gross Value Added (GVA) generat\ned outside of London.

However, \nto capitalise on the growth enabling potential of \ncounties\n we believe the role of counties in fiscal devolution and local growth needs to \nreassessed\n, with \nfuture \nprop\nosal\ns\n \nmore ambitious\n and not confined to certain areas.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe evidence presented in the submission is part of an on-going \nCCN \nwork programme \nfocusing on\n ‘counties \ndriving\n growth’\n, which includes plans to support an independent inquiry into \nwhat \npowers and flexibilities \nambitious local \ngrowth deals for count\nies\n \nshould\n include and how they would be implemented\n.\n \nCCN believe it is crucial to the outcomes of the committee’s inquiry that CCN are granted the opportunity to provide \noral evidence. &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFiscal devolution \nhas long been a \nkey priority for \nCCN\n. O\nur network \nhas been a leading\n advocate for increased fiscal devolution\n and the promotion of local growth opportunities\n, not just for counties, but for all types of loc\nal authorities.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is \nnow a wide-range of \ncompelling evidence to support the case f\nor increased fiscal devolution across academic studies, think-tanks, business\n, industry\n and local government, including \nLord Heseltine’s re\ncent review of economic growt\nh\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN \nacknowledges the progress made by the \nGovernment\n on fiscal devolution and local growth\n, including City Deals, the Regional Growth Fund and Local\n Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)\n. \nThe \nGovernment’s commissioning of, and response to, Lord Heseltine’s re\nview of economic growth continued to demonstrate \nsome\n \ncommitment \nto loca\nl growth and fiscal devolution, including the introduction of the\n Local Growth Fund (LGF) and Growth Deals\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 10 \nCCN member councils \ninvolved in City Deals are demonstrating \nhow \nthey c\nan \nuse \nadditional \npowers to invest in infrastructure \nand local economies. Examples are provided in Appendix 1.\n \n \n  \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough there has been welcomed progress, \nCCN believe that there is further scope for\n fiscal devolution\n in England\n, particularly in a\nreas not already benefiting from City Deals.\n \nIt is clear from our engagement with member councils involved in the Second Wave of City Deals that \nDeals\n were considerably less ambitious than those offered to the Core Cities in the First Wave, with significan\ntly less powers, funding and flexibilities available to areas. As one CCN member council told us, ‘\nour City Deal is unfortunately rather devoid of any fiscal devolution measures’.  \n \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe share the LGA’s view that the LGF fail\ns\n to \ngrasp\n the ambition set out\n in the Heseltine Review, with the \nlimited £2bn \np/a \nfunding simply \na reallocation of existing council\n resources\n or already-devolved funding.\n Limited \nWhitehall \nfunding and subsequent guidance leads us to the conclusion that Growth Deals do not represent \nthe same fiscal devolution opportunities accorded to the Core Cities and City Reg\nions. This undoubtedly\n creat\nes\n \ndisadvantages for many\n \nCCN member councils\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN maintain that fiscal devolution has been narrowly focused on the Core Cities and City Regions.\n Whilst this \nis \nnot a zero-sum game between cities and counties on who is better placed to implement fiscal devolution, t\nhere continues to be an uncritical acceptance of the view that groups of authorities serving large urban areas are more suited to devol\nution than counties. \nCCN \nstrong\nly\n dispute this.\n \nGiven the growth potential of county economies, and \nstrategic\n economic\n role of our member councils\n, there is no barrier to broadly symmetrical devolution across England, \npotentially \nallowing more independence for, and innovation from, county councils and \nunitary counties\n in England\n. \nCCN therefore believe that alongside a more ambitiou\ns approach to fiscal devolution\n, there\n needs to be a thorough re-appraisal of the role of counties in \npromoting growth and implementing fiscal devolution.  \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndependent Research by Shared Intelligence has initially scoped the background to \na \nproposal \nfor \n‘County Deals\n.\n’\n The research argued that t\nhe \nG\novernment’s current approach\n to fiscal devolution\n \ncreate\ns \na real danger that the full\n growth\n potential of the county areas not involved in the \nS\necond \nW\nave of \nC\nity \nD\neals will not be exploited to the full. \nShared Intelligence\n recommend that \na first wave of \nambitious \nlocal growth deals covering county areas\n should\n be negotiated\n. This would test how this type of deal might be developed and negotiated in the different types of economic geography and institutional configurations that exist in county areas.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEconomically,\n there is little justification for the\n \nexclusion \nof counties from fiscal devolution\n. \nCounties are \nnot simply\n ‘hinterland\ns\n’ \nbordering Cities. \nStatics show\n they\n outperform the Core Cities\n and metropolitan boroughs\n on a number\n key indicator\ns \n(tables provided in Appendix\n 3\n), \npotentially providing a\n better return on investment for Government funds and improved economic outcomes; \n&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN member council\n areas\n generat\ne\n over half of all GVA outside of London\n (ONS, 2012)\n;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nounty areas \ncontribute more GVA per head of population than many of the \nC\nore \nC\nities\n (\nONS, 2012)\n; \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCounties have the same proportion of workers in knowledge intensive jobs as the country as a whole\n (ONS, 2012)\n;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCounties account for more than half the jobs in key sectors such as manufacturing, construction and motor trades\n (ONS, 2012)\n;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAvera\nge employment in the public sector amongst CCN members has reduced for nine quarters in a row between Q1 2011 &amp; Q\n1\n 2013, whilst average employment in the private sector amongst CCN members has grown for nine quarters in a row between Q1 2011 &amp; Q\n2 2013 (NOM\nIS, 2013)\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN member \nareas \nhave a higher rate of new business re\ngistration compared to the Core Cities and metropolitan boroughs\n (ONS, 2012)\n;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN member areas\n have the highest rate of active enterprises amongst \nall local authority types\n (ONS, 2012)\n;\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN \nmember areas\n have the largest number of new enterprises created amongst \nall local authority types\n (ONS, 2012)\n;\n \n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere \nis\n evidence from across CCN member councils that broader based and more ambitious fiscal devolution policies\n could \nenable\n \ncounties\n to be\ntter\n invest in \nlocal economies\n and promote \ngrowth\n; however policy is currently preventing them from achieving their potential. \nExamples are provided in Appendix 2.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the coming week\ns CCN will be \nbuilding on th\ne \nresearch\n undertaken by Shared Intelligence\n.\n CCN will support\n an\n \nindependent inquiry i\nnto ambitious growth deals for counties. This will explore how the next phase for fiscal devolution can grasp the potential of county economies \nand exploit the\n count\ny role in securing improved economic performance \nfrom fiscal devolution\n, including \nthrough the\n LGF\n. \n \nIn designing bespoke fiscal devolution proposals\n for counties, CCN believe \nfurther devolution policies must \nconsider the \nfollowing points\n; \n \n&#xa0;\n2.10.1\n              \nCCN support a number of fiscal devolution p\nroposals\n fro\nm across the sector\n. \nIn principle we believe that these are equally applicable to cities and counties. \nCCN’s inquiry will explore the potential implementation and benefits of proposals, including; \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.10.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCounties can provide strategic leadership for \nfiscal devolution and local growth plans\n, based on existing historic boundaries, but with clear remits linked to growth and devolved powers from government.\n Their scale and capacity enables CCN member councils to play a genuinely strategic role in local economic development and maintain capacity to better co-ordinate and invest devolved budgets. \nCity Deal’s in two-tier areas have fundamentally relied on the c\napacity of county councils to design\n, \nnegotiate \nand now implement deals. \nD\nevolution shouldn’t focus moving powers and funding to the lowest level, rather devolving to the right level where it can make a real difference, including shifting services to a nat\nional level if appropriate.   \n&#xa0;\n2.10.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n    \nCounties have long established organisation\nal\n relationships, co-ordinating and convening local partners and other organisations within and across their e\nntire geographical boundaries. \nFor LEPs to support their economies \neffectively, invest\ning\n and coordinat\ning\n devolved budgets it is essential that they have a close and effective relationship with\n \ncounty councils and unitary\n counties\n. \nWith LEPs lacking capacity, counties are dedicating considerable resource to facilitate th\ne development of City Deals and \nGrowth Deals.\n \nFor instance, \nWarwickshire County Council provided significant technical support and capacity to the CWLEP to help them provide the evidence base to support the\nir\n City Deal bid.\n&#xa0;\n2.10.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt time of considerable reducti\nons in funding, fiscal devolution should bring with it strong incentives to grow and appropriate local retention arrangements.\n There are two important observations here;\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government must ensure that all Whitehall departments fully engage\n with the local\n growth agenda\n. Our member councils suggest that \nengagement\n varies widely across departments, with the Treasury, Cabinet Office and DCLG supporting \nfiscal devolution\n, whilst departments such as BIS, DWP and DfE clearly less \ncommitted\n. It is little surprise\n that only £850m of a potential £17bn worth of skills funding was included in the LGF. \n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrent growth incentives, such as CIL, NHB and Business Rate Retention, and any further localisation of funding or taxation powers, should reflect the resource contri\nbution of counties and their superior role in promoting growth. Schemes currently provide very little incentive for counties to grow. The growth dividend needs to be captured and distributed more fairly, acknowledging the county role in delivering growth a\nnd the higher resource commitment to City Deals and Growth Deals. In two-tier areas, the share of CIL and NHB gives too much weight to the \nplanning function of district authorities\n. Local shares in two-tier areas need reviewing and future proposals\n \nshould \nnot repeat this misalignment\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.10.5\n              \nAn important factor in \nthe City Deal\ns process \nwas Whitehall resource commitment and\n depth of the engagement with Ministers and civil servants. \nFor instance, Suffolk County Council used the engagement process to considerably widen the \nscope of their City Deal \nto cover the majority of Suffolk and secure additional funds, such as a £4m underspend from the \nY\nouth \nC\nontract. \nThe Government has indicated\n that each LEP will have a senior sponsor in Whitehall and that local growth teams will be created to work with clusters of LEPs\n on Growth Deals\n. \nIndependent Research by \nShared Intelligence\n, supported by CCN engagement with member\n councils\n,\n \nsuggests\n that g\novernment \nwill\n only \nbe \ncapable of maintaining \nextensive engagement\n with\n a relatively small number of councils\n.\n \nWhitehall must commit appropriate\n support\n and target\n resources \nto ensure Growth Deals do not further \ndisadvantage\n county areas excluded from the \nCity Deals process\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.10.6\n              \nThere needs to be sufficient critical mass for a devolved area, this applies t\no population (minimum thresholds\n), services (scope and linkages) and resources (budget), if it is to make a sig\nnificant impact. Counties can provide this critical mass, whether independently or in partnership with neighbouring authorities. \n&#xa0;\n2.10.7    \nPlanning for growth needs to be seen as a more strategic issue, not as it is currently more of an administrative \nprocess focused on development control with little/no consideration of implementat\nion, jobs and infrastructure. \nCombining strategic planning with infrastructure planning and funding, including through aligning incentives such as CIL and NHB,  would enable \ninitia\ntives such as Northamptonshire or Surrey\n County Council’s\n Revolving Infrastructure Fund to flourish with local geographies taking the lead \nto \ndriv\ne \ngrowth, rather than being reliant on government for funding through bidding.\n&#xa0;\n2.10.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n    \nEconomic geography i\ns clearly a consideration, but devolved geography should also complement existing functions and roles if there is to be a focus on delivery rather than governance\n,\n and \nshould \navoid creating further layers.  This is relevant to both LEPs and strategic autho\nrities.  Existing areas of LEP overlap \nshould be removed as Lord Heseltine recommended.\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact on Excluded Areas \n&#xa0;\n3\n.1\n              \nAs asserted above, \na concentrated policy focus on the economies of the \nCore Cities &amp; City Regions\n \nhas left \nmany county economies to be l\neft unsupported by \nexisting government initiatives\n on fiscal devolution\n. This has considerable\n national and local consequences. The \npotential impact\n for excluded areas can be summarised under the following subheadings; \n&#xa0;\n3\n.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nDisproportionate growth opportunities - Cities already enjoy greater effective freedoms, flexibilities, growth incentives and localised Whitehall budgets than their county council peers. This is a situation the CCN has demonstrated is economically counterproductive as well as man\nifestly unfair. As our independent research concluded, counties not involved in City Deals are already at a considerable disadvantage in negotiating and implementing successful Growth Deals before \n2015/16.\n  Extending further powers and funding to cities w\nhile excluding counties from the process could exaggerate this situation to the extent of defining access to decision-making power by where a voter lives, ignoring local needs and growth potential\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n              \nGrowing \nsocio-economic inequalities – \nFiscal devoluti\non is an important way of tackling the \nsocio-economic \nchallenges created by fiscal austerity, including the impact on deprived communities and the demand-led pressures of a rapidly ageing population. Greater independence, particularly over funding, can all\now counties and their partners to grow economies and use locally raised revenue to fund social care and support services for deprived communities. LGA projections on local authority funding already indicate how important fiscal devolution is for the future\n financial sustainability of these types of county council services.\n Projections show the average county council will have only 27% of its budget available for services other than social care (49%), children services (16%) and waste collection (7%) by 2019\n/20 compared to 35% for a single-tier authority. The LGA argue that expanding the freedoms given to cities under City Deals is essential to enabling counties to avoid such a sharp reduction in ‘other service’ expenditure and managing the 10% increase in so\ncial care expenditure.\n Extending further powers and funding to cities while excluding counties could exaggerate the socio-economic and demographic challenges facing counties\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nInhibiting a fully national recovery – Expert opinion, including the OE\nCD, is united in the view that a sustainable recovery cannot be restricted to\n a\n par\nticular region, indeed the OECD recommended a “clearly defi\nned rural policy and governance framework\n” \nfor growth \nas important for a sustainable recovery\n.\n Effective fiscal d\nevolution to county regions will allow CCN members to better support diversified growth across the UK; excluded areas may not have access to the necessary levers to kick start growth, particularly in low growth sub-regional areas that require high levels o\nf support. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConstraining county capacity to support growth by misaligning incentives and misplacing powers – Restricting access to growth related schemes creates striking discrepancies. In Essex for example, county exclusion from the Youth Contract negoti\nations has meant that eleven of twelve Essex districts have a higher percentage of 18-24 year old JobSeeker’s Allowance claimants claiming for longer than six months than Brighton, Reading or Oxford, yet the latter can access funding while the former canno\nt. Likewise, counties cannot reinvest the proceeds of growth bac\nk into their economies as they \ncurrently\n \nretain\n \nlittle of the \nproceeds of growth via routes such as Business Rate Retention\n or NHB (see point 2.10.4)\n. \nMoreover, Northamptonshire and Surrey’s\n \nR\nevolving \nInfra\nstructure\n Fund\ns\n could flourish \nfurther through self-sustaining growth if the government provided the necessary powers and flexibilities accorded to the Core Cities. \n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEconomic Geography, Governance &amp; Accountability&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN welcomes the general \nacknowledgement\n by \nG\novernment \nthat local government is the central element in the success of any potential governance arrangements surrounding devolved funding.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;4\n.2\n              \nCCN finds David Marlow’s definition of distinctive functional economic areas (FEAs) help\nful in defining economic geography. We contend that in many cases the functional regional economic area is coterminous with County boundaries and that fiscal devolution should reflect this reality.\n&#xa0;\n Given the overlap between functional economic areas and c\nounty boundaries, combined with Counties experience in leading strategic growth, CCN contends county councils should to be the primary accountable body for potential devolved funding within their boundaries.\n&#xa0;4\n.3\n              \nCCN acknowledges\n that\n governance has been a\n source \nfor\n tension previous\n subnational bodies devoted to growth, reflecting the needs to ensure transparency, accountabilit\ny and effective decision-making. These\n bodies have often been subject criticism regarding their complexity, their opacity to local \nstakeholders, their difficulty in delivering equal influence to all partners and the composition of governing executives, all of which feeds into a\n lack of effective leadership.\n \n&#xa0;4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo an extent, some of this criticism continues today regarding the operation\n of LEPs and City Deals, though both are continuing to improve and adapt.\n \nIn t\nheir initial form\n some\n LEPs did not adhere to their regions’ economic geographies, stifling their capacity to meaningfully support and direct growth.\n Centre for Cities described \nthe SELEP as “too big” and hence having “fallen at the first hurdle.”\n \nC\nC\nN member\n councils\n have particular experience of evolving and reshaping their LEPs relationships to create high performing partnership with inclusive governance arrangements, experienc\ne that indicates the importance of actively incorporating business leaders into delivering effective economic leadership. It’s notable that many successful LEPs, \nsuch as\n the Northamptonshire LEP, have built these relationships on the foundations establishe\nd by county councils. In general CCN agrees with the conclusion of Shared Intelligence’s independent research\n that the effectiveness of LEP\ns is directed related to the quality of the relationship with the relevant council(s).\n&#xa0;4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe active involvement of bu\nsiness stakeholder in decision making has been identified by CCN members as essential to the success of growth planning and LEP, to both lift the discussions beyond political negotiations and feed business insight into the discussions. David Marlow identif\nied three models of LEPs, as subnational agencies distributing funds, as local growth sounding boards and as \na \nlocal growth leadership forum; the third option being the most effective and desirable form. CCN acknowledge\ns\n the central place business stakeholders in achieving the third form of LEP, and the effectiveness of Business Forums attached to the executive boards of LEP\ns\n in facilitating business participation in decision-making.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;Holding ‘devolved areas to account’&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN contends that at their core, devolved financial arrangements should retain accountability to local people through the central involvement of local authorities, \nwho would retain a central strategy setting role regarding any devolved power. We acknowl\nedge that a one size fits all approach to these governance \narrangement will be unwelcome. \n \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcknowledging this diversity, there are two b\nroa\nd challenges facings bodies delivering local growth; the first is providing open and transparent governance of comp\nlex arrangements to enable accountability and the second is ensuring governance arrangement\ns\n come to clear, transparent and binding decisions for all partners. Every cohesive local solution needs to address these challenges.\n&#xa0;\n4.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe accountability of local devolved financial arrangements will be tested by both routine discussions, \nsuch as\n those associated with resource allocations\n,\n and particular challenges, \nsuch as\n imposing local interventions. Accountability can also be improved\n by linking back to a distinct package of measure\ns\n or programme\ns\n developed and articulated by the partnerships. As Leicester &amp; Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership, describe\nd and CCN agrees, LEPs need to ‘\nfront up and show they can be united and co-ordina\nted in matters of economic development… Government feedback has emphasised the need for a step-change in governance, for the arrangements to be able to make binding decisions, and f\nor clarity on accountabilities.’\n \n&#xa0;Economic Geography and Set Up&#xa0;\n4.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN welco\nme moves to strengthen the flow of devolved growth funding to the decision makers with the local knowledge to make best use of it.\n&#xa0;\n The devolved areas should fit as far as possible the Functional Economic Areas of local economic activity. \nAlt\nhough we agree\n with t\nhe Centre for Cities\n’\n assertion\n ’\nin defining the geography of the arrangement, it\n is\n important not to be confined by the existing governance structures and to make sure the areas accurately reflect the econo\nmic realities of a local area,’ \nas previou\nsly discussed, CCN contends\n that\n in many places the Functional Economic Areas are largely coterminous with county boundaries. When this coterminosity does not exist, CCN contends it is most effective to be guided by the geographies defined within existing \nGrowth Plans in establishing new arrangements.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\n4.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven that County council areas are more likely to be functional economic areas than just a city,  a single district or borough it enables us to be more strategic, identify spill-over effects (both positive\n and negative) of developments/interventions and maximise the impact of investment. Any new arrangements to devolve fiscal power need to reflect county capacities within growth.   However, counties recognise they are not complete FEA’s and we are not islan\nds. There is interaction and movement across county boundaries and therefore a need for any new arrangements to acknowledge strategic links across county areas (often in different regions, which hitherto ha\nve \noften been overlooked with regional economic \ndev\nelopment &amp; growth arrangements). \n&#xa0;\n4.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCCN notes that in order to succeed in setting up any planned devolved area, cross departmental support for the initiative must be forthcoming from Whitehall. As \nRaising the Capital\n notes, ‘\nPublic expenditure reviews cu\nrrently work in such a way as to inhibit any deviation from individual departmental priorities or, in\ndeed, overall Treasury control.’\n CCN supports this conclusion of the report and echoes concerns voiced by the Centre for Cities regarding the cultural shif\nt this would necessitate; \n“The culture of centralisation developed over decades will not be easy to change, and government departmental silos simply throw up more barriers to joining up policy in the cities where it is delivered.”\n&#xa0;\nAbout: The County Councils Network (CCN) \nrepresents 37 English local authorities that serve counties. CCN membership includes both upper tier and u\nnitary authorities who together have over 2500 councillors and serve 23 million people (46% of the population) across 85% of England.  CCN develops policy, shares best practice and makes representations to government on behalf of this significant proportio\nn of the country outside the big conurbations. \nCCN is a member-led organisation which works on an inclusive and all party basis and seeks to make representations to government which can be supported by all member authorities.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\nAppendix 1&#xa0;Staffordshire County Council – \nStoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire's City Deal offer to government covered an array of key areas including energy, employment sites and enterprise/innovation. A key element is the development of a local skills offer which will ensure that, subj\nect to getting a City Deal, the local workforce are able to access opportunities within the jobs market and share in the benefits of growth. A key element of this is the work (announced by Secretary of State Vince Cable at last years LGA Annual Conference)\n we are doing jointly with the Skills Funding Agency to pilot a local approach to encourage providers to adapt their offer, and create the right conditions to ensure a dynamic and adaptive skills system fully supports both the anticipated City Deal and the\n wider LEP approach to local growth. \nIn total the Deal expects to deliver a\n 50% increase in the area’s GDP and creation of 50,000 new jobs.\n&#xa0;\nWarwickshire County Council \n- the Coventry &amp; Warwi\nckshire City Deal has a number of unique features that fundamentally rely on the capacity and scale of the county council to deliver. The deal looks to \nbring together all business support services for the advanced manufacturing sector within one “clearing \nhouse”.  This will include co-location of support services, including UKTI (for trade &amp; exporting, and inward investment), and the Manufacturing Advisory Service, plus other local support.  \nA\n key strength \nof the county within the deal\n is\n their\n strong econo\nmic intelligence and analysis function to understand the issues\n and provide an\n “honest broker” role\n. \nThis places\n the county\n well to help shape and inform the skills market – something that is central to the Coventry &amp; Warwickshire City Deal\n. \n&#xa0;\nLancashire County Council is using its capacity and scale to underpin the key aspects of the Preston &amp; Lancashire City Deal, including the \n£450 million Infrastructure Delivery Programme\n. Alongside the allocation of their NHB share, £39.4m transport capital\n funds and £0.8m of capital receipts, the county is \nunderwriting \nthe \n£100m\n cash flow imbalance within the overall deal. \nNone of the other participants in the Deal ha\nve\n the financial scale or\n \ns\ntrength to undertake this role, meaning the county is \nshoulderin\ng the lio\nn's share of the financial risk. The Deal projects outcomes of \n20,000 new jobs, 15,000 new homes and generation of new economic activity worth £1bn over the next 10 years.\n&#xa0;Appendix 2&#xa0;Essex County Council’s ‘\nDeal for Growth ‘\n formed an integral p\nart of the council’s Whole Place Community Budget Pilot and followed their innovative ‘City Limits’ research.\n The Deal proposed a number of policy ‘asks’ to Whitehall departments to enable the council and its partners to create a\n £1bn\n revolving infrastructure fund; redesign local skills services through the devolution of funding and powers to make provision\n employer driven and developing a payment\n by results model for providers; and r\neinvest the proceeds of growth, including the reinve\nstment of a proportion of localised NNDR growth across Essex, and the retention of 100% of NNDR growth \nin key locations. If the Government was to meet the county’s policy asks Essex estimate that the Deal would yield an additional 60,000 new jobs and 25,50\n0 new homes to Essex, Southend and Thurrock.\n&#xa0;\nNorthamptonshire County Council’s ’\n10\n \nPoint Plan to Kickstart and Unleash Local Dynamism and Economic Potential’ \nsets out the Council’s ambitious local growth agenda. The County Council worked closely with its\n LEP to devise an extensive plan for fiscal devolution with a ‘growth offer’ and asks from Government including; the\n ‘Single Capital Pot’ to align with existing governance and accountable body activities\n; \n75% of the uplift in tax receipts generated by\n thei\nr\n INV-ENT\n business support fund \nto be retained locally for reinvestment i\nn innovation and business growth; and better investment of\n \ndevolved \nfunding on skills through the Northamptonshire Skills Board\n. \nThe partnership estimates that devolution of the neces\nsary powers, freedoms and centrally retained funding could result in 70,000 new jobs over the next 15 years and the potential for 80,00\n0 more homes. This would enable \nNorthamptonshire to exceed its projected £20bn contribution to the UK economy by 2020. \n&#xa0;\nSurrey County Council has been running a successful programme to increase apprenticeship take up and to reduce the number of young people not in employment, education or training which had been cut by 50% in the last 3 years. The county is developing a pr\noposal through the Public Service Transformation Network programme to increase participation for all young people which could be supported through devolution of some functions, particularly those of the National Careers Service; greater integration and loc\nalisation of some existing employment support programmes and an arrangement to allow the council and local partners to share in the savings in welfare benefits arising from increased participation. In particular the proposal would involve integrated inform\nation, advice and guidance for young people from Year 8 onwards including on apprenticeships which would form part of a more flexible and expanded set of vocational pathways for young people aged 14-19; specific Young Apprenticeship pathways for young peop\nle aged 14-16 for earlier entry to apprenticeship programmes; and increased apprenticeship opportunities developed with employers as part of an improved education and training offer.\n&#xa0;Buckinghamshire County Council \nhas argued that localised \nY\nouth \nC\nontracts\n would allow better support for young people and NEETs\n. In \nBuckinghamshire many are currently exclu\nded from the national programme, whilst half the fund (£50m) is allocated to the Core Cities &amp; City Regions. Additional powers, flexibilities and responsibil\nities for counties\n could allow Buckinghamshire to establish apprenticeship hubs and incentive schemes for small businesses to take on apprentices\n,\n or to establish a local skills funding model, giving more local control over how Skills Funding Agency resour\nces are allocated and spent by providers to deliver an increase in intermediate technical skills training.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAppendix 3&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3.6\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2\n \nLocal Government \nAssociation\n. \nOn the Day Briefing: The Government’s infrastructure plan\n (2013) \n \nShared Intelligence. \nCounties &amp; Economic Growth \n(2013)\n Shared Intelligence. \nCounties &amp; Economic Growth\n (2013) &amp; LG Inform modelling of ONS &amp; NOMIS statistics 2013.\n London Finance Commission\n. \nRaising the Capital\n (2013)\n &amp; LGA. \nRewiring Public \nServices: Business Rate Retention\n (2014)\n LGA. \nRewiring Public Services: Economic Growth\n (2013)\n \nLocalis. \nClearing the Hurdles\n (2013)\n \nTri-borough Partnership. \nDoing the Deal: the Case for a new approach:  Public Service Reform Deals\n (2013)\n \nNLGN\n. \nGrow\ning Your Own: Skills and infrastructure for local economic growth\n (2012)\n Shared Intelligence. \nCounties &amp; Economic Growth\n (2013), p. 12\n LGA. \nFuture funding outlook of AnyCounty Council\n (2013) &amp; LGA. \nFuture funding outlook of Single-tier Council \n(LGA)\n OECD. \nUnited Kingdom: Policies for a Sustainable Recovery\n  (2010)\n \nCentre for Cities, \nCause Célèbre Or Cause For Concern\n (2011), quote from Dover Express, 11\nth\n/11\nth\n/11\n \nShared Intelligence. \nCounties &amp; Economic Growth\n (2013)\n Essex County Council. \nCity Limits: why devolved economic powers should be made available in county areas \n(2012)\n Essex County Council. \nDeal for Growth \n (2011) \n \nhttp://www.wecb.org.uk/uploads/FINAL%20OP%20and%20BCs/Deal%\n20for%20Growth_20121031_Final2.pdfn\n \n Northamptonshire County Council. \nOur 10 Point Plan - Northamptonshire County Council \n(2013) \nhttp://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/economic/Documents/PDF%20Documents/10%20Point%20Plan_Digital%20FINAL.PDF\n \n CCN. \nCounties: Driving Economic Growth\n (2012)\n"
