[normal]Following my appearance before the Environmental Audit Committee on 18  December to give evidence on the plastic bag charge in England I promised to keep the Committee informed about Defra’s work on biodegradable bags. We are looking into the opportunities for developing a more sustainable biodegradable bag.  Providing these bags meet the right criteria they could be exempt from the charge.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of this work we recently launched an Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) project looking for innovative approaches to decrease the environmental impact of biodegradable bags and improve plastics separation techniques. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The SBRI bids have now been received and analysed. We are going to provide around £85,000 of funding for 4 short feasibility studies to be completed by March 2014. These include two studies into alternative bag materials and two studies into detection methods for different plastics in waste streams. If any of these prove promising we intend to invest further in 2014-15 to help develop them into prototypes, which can take a couple of years.  These projects will feed into our understanding of exemptions for biodegradable bags.  However a decision on exemptions will be based on the technical and environmental outcomes we seek, rather than specifying a particular material or technique
