Written evidence from The Society of [bold]Homeopath[bold]s (LTC 65)[bold]1. [bold]Summary[bold]The Society of Homeopaths 
[normal](hereafter ‘the Society’) 
[normal]is composed of 
[normal]approximately 
[normal]1300 practicing homeopaths and represents the majority of 
[normal]professional 
[normal]homeopaths practicing in th
[normal]e UK
[normal]. 
[normal]There is a 
[normal]significant trend for homeopaths 
[normal]working privately and in NHS settings 
[normal]to see 
[normal]many 
[normal]patients suffering from 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions
[normal] that 
[normal]have failed to 
[normal]respond to conventional medicine.
[normal] T
[normal]h
[normal]is document will 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]outline
[normal]:
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] document will 
[normal]also 
[normal]highlight 
[normal]the 
[normal]potential for homeopathy as a medical system
[normal],
[normal] treatment option 
[normal]and philosophy 
[normal]to address the following issues of interest to the Health Committee: 
[normal]2. [bold]The [bold]h[bold]omeopathic [bold]a[bold]pproach[bold]Homeopaths often see patients 
[normal]after they have received a medical diagnosis from their doctor and many of these patients have 
[normal]long-term
[normal] health
[normal] 
[normal]problems that 
[normal]fail to respond to conventional medicine. 
[normal]Some individuals seek a homeopath because they are experiencing side effects from conventional drugs and others because conventional tests have failed to find the cause of their problem. 
[normal]As a system of medicine, homeopathy aim
[normal]s to treat patients as whole people
[normal], rather than 
[normal]focusing on a course of action for each 
[normal]disease diagnosis
[normal], thus
[normal] offering a different approach
[normal]. A
[normal]s such
[normal], homeopathic treatment
[normal] can be considered 
[normal]as a supportive option 
[normal]in almost any 
[normal]condition
[normal] where tissue has not been irrevocably damaged.
[normal] Homeopaths working according to the Society’s code of ethics 
[normal]encourage
[normal] their patients 
[normal]to keep 
[normal]their appropriate
[normal] 
[normal]medical practitioners informed when they seek homeopathic treatment and as treatment progresses. When necessary homeopathic and conventional approaches can be used alongside one another to give the most appropriate care
[normal] to each individual patient, thus integrating all medical approaches and adjunctive advice the patient has been given to manage their health.
[normal]3. [bold]What is homeopathy?[bold]The 
[normal]MeSH
[normal] 
[normal]definition of homeopathy 
[normal]is
[normal]:
[normal]“A system of therapeutics founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), based on the Law of Similars where ‘like cures like’. Diseases are treated by highly diluted substances that cause, in healthy persons, symptoms like those to be treated. The dilutions are repeated so many times that there is less than one molecule per dose and it is suggested that benefit is from the energetic life force of the original substance”
[normal].
[normal]H
[normal]omeop
[normal]athy 
[normal]can therefore be seen as 
[normal]a 
[normal]‘
[normal]holistic
[normal]’
[normal] therapy
[normal], such that homeopathic care 
[normal]takes into account all aspects of th
[normal]e 
[normal]patient as an 
[normal]individual 
[normal]assessing 
[normal]their symptoms
[normal] on 
[normal]mental, emotional, physical and general
[normal] levels
[normal]. 
[normal]During a consultation the professional homeopath
[normal] 
[normal]will focus
[normal] on building up a complete picture of 
[normal]an 
[normal]individual’s unique make up considering all aspects of the patient’s health including diet, medical history, 
[normal]life events, 
[normal]lifestyle and personality. 
[normal]Homeopathic p
[normal]rescription
[normal]s are
[normal] based on the 
[normal]process of 
[normal]matching this unique collection of symptoms 
[normal]as closely as possible 
[normal]with
[normal] those of an appropriate 
[normal]homeopathic medicine (called a ‘
[normal]remedy
[normal]’), rather than automatically prescribing the same medicine for a named 
[normal]condition. This 
[normal]approach to understanding patients’ cases 
[normal]makes homeopathy well placed to treat those people with a diversity of complaints 
[normal]that
[normal] would 
[normal]conventionally 
[normal]be given a different medication for each condition. For example
[normal],
[normal] a 
[normal]person
[normal] with asthma
[normal], allergies and constipation would typically
[normal] require thre
[normal]e different medications, but would 
[normal]be most likely to 
[normal]require only
[normal] one homeopathic remedy
[normal] that covers the totality of the
[normal]ir
[normal] case
[normal].
[normal]4[bold]. [bold]Homeopathic philosophy[bold]The 
[normal]philosophy
[normal] 
[normal]that underpins the homeopathic medical system 
[normal]considers that physical 
[normal]ill 
[normal]health 
[normal](in the absence of inherited disorders, accidents or physical trauma) 
[normal]can 
[normal]reflec
[normal]t
[normal] unresolved life events
[normal], leading to 
[normal]prolonged underlying 
[normal]emotional stress
[normal]. The 
[normal]professional 
[normal]homeopath 
[normal]will always ask 
[normal]a
[normal] patient what was 
[normal]happening
[normal] 
[normal]in their lives 
[normal]when the symptoms
[normal] start
[normal]ed
[normal] or worsen
[normal]ed
[normal]. In this way, homeopathic philosophy places an equal
[normal] 
[normal]importance on 
[normal]both 
[normal]emotional 
[normal]and physical wellbeing.
[normal] 
[normal]For example
[normal],
[normal] a patient who developed hypertension following a 
[normal]significant 
[normal]grief would receive a homeopathic remedy 
[normal]that aimed to support resolution of this grief to 
[normal]first 
[normal]reduce emotional stress, 
[normal]then 
[normal]reducing physiological stress and ultimately reducing the hypertension. This would be done alongside conventional medical care and any other adjunctive treatment required, 
[normal]ensuring
[normal] that each patient is appropriately supported on all fronts. 
[normal]Patients’ experience of successful homeopathic treatment is 
[normal]often that they
[normal] first feel better 
[normal]‘
[normal]in themselves
[normal]’
[normal] and then 
[normal]that 
[normal]their 
[normal]physical symptoms 
[normal]start to improve
[normal], or become more manageable
[normal]. 
[normal]5[bold]. [bold]The therapeutic encounter[bold]P
[normal]atients
[normal] 
[normal]often 
[normal]find the experience of telling their 
[normal]unique 
[normal]story to 
[normal]a sympathetic and supportive professional to 
[normal]be therapeutic
[normal] (
[normal]Eyles
[normal] et al.
[normal], 2012)
[normal]. T
[normal]here is some evidence 
[normal]to suggest 
[normal]that this 
[normal]aspect of the encounter with a professional homeopath 
[normal]may explain homeopath
[normal]y’s therapeutic 
[normal]effectiveness (Jacobs
[normal] et al.
[normal],
[normal] 2005; 
[normal]Brien et al.,
[normal] 
[normal]2010
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] Indeed, t
[normal]his
[normal] can be considered as 
[normal]the 
[normal]most 
[normal]parsimonious explanation 
[normal]for patient responses to homeopathic treatment while
[normal] 
[normal]we lack 
[normal]a definitive explanation for 
[normal]the 
[normal]mechanism of
[normal] 
[normal]action of homeopathic remedies
[normal]. However
[normal], 
[normal]there is also evidence of the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in the absence of the consultation (
[normal]Frei
[normal] et al., 2005
[normal]) 
[normal]suggesting
[normal] that patient benefit cannot simply be reduced to a therapeutic encounter
[normal].
[normal]6[bold]. [bold]Why patients choose homeopathy[bold]: [bold]qualitative evidence[bold] from UK studies[bold]A pre-audit study explor
[normal]ing the 
[normal]motivation for patients 
[normal]to attend
[normal] the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital 
[normal]for homeopathic treatment 
[normal]found that p
[normal]atient’s emphasised ‘treating the whole person’ and a ‘desire to look at illness in a more complex way’
[normal](Thompson et al., 2007
[normal]). Additionally, a
[normal] qualitative study 
[normal]of 
[normal]patients 
[normal]choosing 
[normal]complementary therapies for asthma (Shaw et al., 2006) found that it ‘empowered them to take greater personal control over their condition rather than feel dependant on medication’ and ‘enabled exploration of a broader range of possible causes of their asthma than commonly discussed within NHS settings’. 
[normal]H
[normal]omeopathy offers an approach to understanding illness that patients with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions appreciate
[normal] and appear to be paying for in the absence of access to NHS provision (Perry, 2013)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A 2013 audit of 100 
[normal]randomly selected patients at a privately run
[normal] integ
[normal]rated medicine clinic (
[normal]www.wellforce.co.uk
[normal]) found that 
[normal]many 
[normal]patients 
[normal]with
[normal] 
[normal]chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis and multiple sclerosis
[normal] 
[normal]were attending
[normal]:
[normal] pain
[normal], 
[normal]fatigue
[normal],
[normal] anxiety and depression 
[normal]represent
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal]ir
[normal] most common 
[normal]symptoms
[normal]. 
[normal]A survey 
[normal]by 
[normal]Thomas
[normal] et al.
[normal] (
[normal]200
[normal]3
[normal]) 
[normal]also 
[normal]found that 90% of 
[normal]complementary and alternative medicine (
[normal]CAM
[normal])
[normal] provision is purchased privately
[normal] with total expenditure est
[normal]imated at £450 million for
[normal] 
[normal]1998
[normal], 
[normal]with
[normal] 10% of the adult population contact
[normal]ing
[normal] a CAM practitioner that year
[normal]. 
[normal]In addition to the 
[normal]clear
[normal] 
[normal]demand
[normal] for CAM healthcare in supporting patients with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions
[normal], a
[normal] study carried out at the University of Sheffield on behalf of the Department of Health explored patient satisfaction with complementary therapies in the NHS and found them to be 
[normal]“overwhelmingly positive” 
[normal](Luff 
[normal]and
[normal] Thomas
[normal],
[normal] 2000). 
[normal]Specific aspects valued by patients included the development of a therapeutic relationship with their practitioner
[normal],
[normal] the caring nature of the practitioner
[normal],
[normal] being involved in the process of care
[normal] and
[normal] a significant improvement in the quality of their lives. 
[normal]7[bold]. [bold]Where patients access homeopathic treatment[bold]Patients 
[normal]currently access 
[normal]homeopathic tre
[normal]atment from a variety of source
[normal]s
[normal] within the NHS
[normal] including:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However
[normal],
[normal] the majority of patients 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]access
[normal] 
[normal]homeopathic treatment
[normal] 
[normal]privately
[normal].
[normal] Less than 10% of GPs report using homeopathy (Perry et al., 2013)
[normal] and homeopathic prescribing in the NHS appears to have fallen sharply between 2000 and 2010 (
[normal]Beckford, 2011).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8[bold]. [bold]How patients with chronic conditions fare using homeopathy.[bold] [bold]An observational study at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital monitored treatment 
[normal]of &gt;
[normal]6500 patients with 
[normal]chronic disease during a 6 year period
[normal] (Spence at al., 2005)
[normal]. 
[normal]The aims of 
[normal]homeopathic 
[normal]treatment were to enhance general health and well-being, to improve symptom control and to reduce the 
[normal]impact 
[normal]of exacerbations 
[normal]in 
[normal]patients’ 
[normal]chronic 
[normal]conditions
[normal]: j
[normal]ust over 50% of patients 
[normal]self-
[normal]rated their health as ‘better’ or ‘much better’ and over 70% expressed a degree of improvement. 
[normal]These results concur with studies from other homeopathic hospitals: in Tunbridge Wells improvement was seen in 74% of 1372 patients (Clover, 
[normal]2000); and in Liverpool
[normal] improvement was seen 
[normal]in 76.6
[normal]% of 1100 patients (Richardson, 2001).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An 8 year longitudinal cohort study of over 3500 adults and 
[normal]children 
[normal](97% of whom were diagnosed with a chronic complaint) also 
[normal]found that patients
[normal] 
[normal]receiving 
[normal]h
[normal]omeopathic treatment improve
[normal]d
[normal] considerably
[normal] (Witt
[normal],
[normal] 2008)
[normal]. 
[normal]That is, 
[normal]67% of adults and 80% of children achieved significa
[normal]nt health improvements 
[normal]at 2 
[normal]year
[normal]s after baseline, 
[normal]and 
[normal]this improvement was 
[normal]sustained 
[normal]for the following 6 
[normal]years 
[normal]of the study
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9[bold]. [bold]How children with c[bold]hronic conditions [bold]fare using [bold]homeopathy.[bold]Children with chronic conditions appear to respond particularly well to homeopathic treatment. In addition to the evidence above, 66% of children in the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital study 
[normal]described rating
[normal] their health as ‘better’ or ‘much better’ and 80% stated a degree of improvement. 68% of the children with eczema reported that it was ‘better’ or ‘much better’ (Spence at al., 2005). Parents appear to be turning to homeopathic treatment for their children: 
[normal]24% of c
[normal]hildren with chronic conditions in an outpatient setting in south-west England 
[normal]were found to be using some form of CAM, 
[normal]homeopath
[normal]y being one of the most common (Simpson and Roman, 2001). 
[normal]The Avon longitudinal study
[normal] found that children were using homeopathy for chronic conditions such as asthma, eczema, hay fever, epilepsy, and
[normal] migraine (Thompson et al., 2010
[normal]). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]0[bold]. [bold]Evidence for specific chronic conditions [bold]It is fair to say that c
[normal]linical trial evidence for the eff
[normal]ectiveness 
[normal]of homeopathic treatment
[normal] for specific conditions
[normal] 
[normal]overall 
[normal]is 
[normal]sparse
[normal], although t
[normal]rials of 
[normal]homeopathy in 
[normal]chronic condi
[normal]tions such as
[normal] 
[normal]fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, eczema, asthma, depression, ADHD and chronic fatigue
[normal] do exist
[normal]. 
[normal]However
[normal],
[normal] most trials 
[normal]done to date focus 
[normal]on 
[normal]assessing 
[normal]the efficacy of 
[normal]specific 
[normal]homeopathic remedies
[normal] compared to placebo
[normal] and
[normal] these trials provide
[normal] little
[normal] useful information about the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for patients
[normal] in a real-world context
[normal]. For example
[normal],
[normal] two of 
[normal]four studies on 
[normal]homeopathic treatment of 
[normal]fibromyalgia 
[normal]focus on the efficacy of specific homeopathic remedies
[normal] (Fisher
[normal],
[normal] 1986
[normal]; Fisher
[normal],
[normal] 1989)
[normal] while 
[normal]two 
[normal]other 
[normal]studies 
[normal]are
[normal] closer to 
[normal]real-
[normal]world homeopathic practice in 
[normal]allowing free
[normal] choice of homeopathic 
[normal]remedies
[normal] (Bell
[normal] et al.
[normal], 2004; 
[normal]Relton
[normal], 2009)
[normal]: i
[normal]nterestingly, p
[normal]ositive results were recorded in both 
[normal]trial types
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]1[bold]. [bold]Adverse effects[bold]Homeopathy is generally considered to be a safe therapy, relatively free of adverse events
[normal] when compared to the rate of side effects from conventional medications
[normal]. 
[normal]The highly-diluted nature of homeopathic medicines means that they a
[normal]re unlikely to lead to toxicity-
[normal]related adverse drug reactions (Kirby, 2002). 
[normal]Several studies have reviewed the evidence for 
[normal]homeopathic 
[normal]adverse events
[normal] and together the conclusion is that as long as homeopathy is correctly administered by a professional, qualified, registered homeopath (such as those registered with the Society) it is safe
[normal] (
[normal]Bornhöft
[normal] et al. 2006
[normal]; 
[normal]Dantas
[normal] and 
[normal]Rampes
[normal] 2000;
[normal] 
[normal]Endrizzi
[normal] 
[normal]et al., 
[normal]200
[normal]5
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]Monk, 1986; 
[normal]Thompson et al.
[normal],
[normal] 2004
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]1[bold]2[bold]. [bold]Cost effectiveness[bold]Cost effectiveness studies indicate 
[normal]that
[normal] the use 
[normal]of homeopathy as a treatment option can reduce financial burden on patients and healthcare providers alike. 
[normal]In Europe, a Health Technology Assessment of homeopathy commissioned by the Swiss government recently concluded that homeopathy is “clinically effective, cost effective and safe” (
[normal]Bornhöft
[normal] et al.
[normal], 2006). 
[normal]Additionally
[normal], a comparison of homeopathic and conventional treatment of 493 patients with chronic conditions in Germany found that homeopathy achieved better outcomes for similar costs (Witt 
[normal]et al., 
[normal]2005) and 
[normal]a study involving 499 ch
[normal]ildren 
[normal]with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections showed that 
[normal]homeopathic treatment was more clinically effective 
[normal](fewer episodes of illness) 
[normal]and 
[normal]more 
[normal]cost
[normal]-effective than antibiotics (
[normal]Tri
[normal]chard
[normal] et al.
[normal], 2005).
[normal] 
[normal]Other studies 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]suggest that 
[normal]homeopathy can save money 
[normal]by reduc
[normal]ing the 
[normal]use of
[normal] conventional drugs, both in a 
[normal]hospital and 
[normal]a 
[normal]GP setting.
[normal] Specifically,
[normal] a
[normal] 500-patient survey at the Royal London Ho
[normal]meopathic Hospital showed that 
[normal]many patients were able to reduce or stop conventional medication fo
[normal]llowing homeopathic treatment (
[normal]Sharples
[normal] et al., 2003) 
[normal]and a
[normal] study examin
[normal]ing
[normal] prescription costs of 22 GPs in the UK found
[normal] that practices which included 
[normal]a GP using homeopathy prescribed 12% fewer items of medicati
[normal]on per patient (including both 
[normal]conventional drugs and homeopathic medicines) compared with other l
[normal]ocal practices
[normal] (Swayne, 1992)
[normal].
[normal] Since 
[normal]long-term
[normal] conditions often require 
[normal]long-term
[normal] medication regimes, homeopathy has the potential to make a significantly positive impact on the NHS drug budget. 
[normal]13[bold]. [bold]Summary[bold]A
[normal]s
[normal] described in this paper there is a compelling argument to be made that 
[normal]homeopathic treatment is a clinical
[normal]ly
[normal] and cost effective 
[normal]option to support patients with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] 
[normal]conditions
[normal]. Importantly, 
[normal]patients who receive homeopathic treatment are 
[normal]also 
[normal]overwhelmingly
[normal] positive about the experience. 
[normal]Offering homeopathic treatment to patients with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] health conditions addresses many of the concerns described by the Health Committee as it
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]The use of homeopathy in healthcare 
[normal]is increasing in other countries (
[normal]e.g. 
[normal]India, Brazil and Japan
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]and from 1985 to 2001 CAM use in the UK also increased (Thomas and Coleman, 2003). However, 
[normal]UK 
[normal]support for homeopathy has recently seen an unfortunate decrease such that NHS-
[normal]commissioned services
[normal], like the Sheffield menopause clinic and the Manor Clinic (
[normal]http://www.shsc.nhs.uk
[normal]) and the Liverpool hospital
[normal] have 
[normal]been closed
[normal] despite 
[normal]offering 
[normal]award winning 
[normal]services and fulfilling unmet needs. This may be due to NHS budget constraints
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]minimal
[normal] education of doctors about CAM; 
[normal]and 
[normal]a decrease in GPs opinions about the effectiveness of homeopathy (48.7-21.9% in t
[normal]he last 10 years (Perry, 2013). A change in GP opinions may 
[normal]be a consequence of 
[normal]the 
[normal]unprecedented attempts 
[normal]by the biomedical community 
[normal]to discredit homeopathy in recent years (
[normal]Anonymous, 2005; 
[normal]Bewley
[normal], 2011
[normal]). 
[normal]As outlined, h
[normal]omeopathy has an emerging evidence base of clinical effectiveness for specific 
[normal]named 
[normal]conditions, but 
[normal]it is important to appreciate that 
[normal]this 
[normal]remains 
[normal]in its infancy
[normal] as most studies have focused on the efficacy of remedies in isolation: remedy efficacy is not 
[normal]relevant to
[normal] patients with complex 
[normal]long-term
[normal] health conditions
[normal], 
[normal]who need information about
[normal] what homeopathy as a therapeutic intervention can do for them as individuals
[normal]. 
[normal]As such, we would argue that t
[normal]here 
[normal]is a 
[normal]disconnect
[normal]ion
[normal] between 
[normal]patient 
[normal]perception and appreciation 
[normal]of
[normal] homeopath
[normal]y compared to medical, scientific and commissioner decision making. 
[normal]The NHS is 
[normal]currently not 
[normal]providing 
[normal]adequate homeopathic 
[normal]service
[normal]s
[normal] that are 
[normal]clearly appreciated and needed by the public
[normal], especially those with 
[normal]long-term
[normal] health conditions
[normal]. We 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]suggest 
[normal]that the NHS could benefit from
[normal] support
[normal]ing
[normal] the 
[normal]cheap homeopathic treatment
[normal]s
[normal] already available at private homeopathy clinics across the country 
[normal]as well as commissioning specialist clinics to offer an integrated approach to health and wellbeing in order to benefit the 
[normal]long-term
[normal] management of 
[normal]hard to treat chronic conditions.
