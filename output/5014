default.
default              
defaultThe LGA has also funded a programme of support, through the Centre for 
defaultP
defaultublic Scrutiny
default,
default and 
defaulthas provided a 
defaultK
defaultnowledge 
defaultH
defaultub network for practitioners which has enabled a transfer of experience and learning. 
default Together with the research commissioned into the first year of the Panels, this engagement has given the LGA a good degree of insight into the experience and challenges of the first year.
default&#xa0;

default.
default              
defaultT
defaulthe first year has
default been a learning experience for Panels
default; they have und
defaulte
defaultrtaken scrutiny on hastily developed police and crime plans and budgets and have gone through a range of confirmation hearings and are now looking forward to a more planned and meaningful engagement in the next cycle.

default.
default              
defaultThe findings of the research commissioned by the LGA ha
defaultve
default indicated that the success or failure of 
defaultPanels 
defaultis dependent on the relationship between PCCs, their offices and Panels. In many cases these relationships are good and provide a sound basis for effective scrutiny. Where relationships have been more difficult if appears to stem from mutual misunderstandings about the Panel’s role.

defaultSuspensions and dismissalsdefault&#xa0;

default5
default.
default              
defaultFor some
default,
default the first year has been challenging
default, particularly where Commissioners chose to suspend or dismiss a Chief Constable. 
defaultThe 
defaultexperience
default 
defaultof Lincolnshire
default, where the Chief Constable was suspended
default will be very instructive for Panels and PCCs alike.
default 
defaultThe Lincolnshire case 
defaulthighlight
defaults
default the 
defaultrelatively
default limited powers that Panels have in such circumstances. 
defaultPanels must be notified of a suspension, but no specific action is prescribed in the legislation. In this first year
default,
default Panels have been on their own in determining what action to take
default in these cases
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default6
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultGwent example where, as the HASC report states
default,
default “
defaultMrs Napier was persuaded to retire voluntarily before the [scrutiny] process was initiated
default,
default”
default highlights the relative ease with which PCCs are able to circumvent what are already limited
default formal
default powers of scrutiny.
default&#xa0;
default1
default7
default.
default              
defaultThroughout this first year
default,
default Panels have come to realise that the formal powers, such as they are, have at best been of little use and in some 
defaultcases have hindered 
defaultthe function of scrutiny to question and expose and to engage the public in these processes. 
default&#xa0;
default1
default8
default.
default              
defaultThe Panel in Lincolnshire has now undertaken a substantial review of the circumstances surrounding the suspension of Chief Constable Rhodes by the PCC and its own actions in response to the suspension. The findings will be very instructive for both Panels and PCCs.
default&#xa0;
defaultInformation sharingdefault&#xa0;default19
default.
default              
defaultIn any executive/scrutiny model the flow of information between the two is crucial to effe
defaultctive accountability. 
defaultMany 
defaultP
defaultanels 
defaulthave developed good relationships with their PCCs and the office of the Police and Crime Commissioners and this has led to 
defaulteffective 
defaultinformation sharing.
default&#xa0;
default2
default0
default.
default              
defaultHowever, in a number of cases
default,
default 
defaultP
defaultanels have faced difficulties in getting information. The research by CfPS has indicated that
default,
default for some
default,
default information has only been forthcoming after repeated requests and has then been incomplete. CfPS suggests that this is 
defaultoften because of disagreements relating to the kind of information about Commissioners’ activities which
default [Panels]
default are entitled to see
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default2
default1
default.
default              
defaultSome Panels
default 
defaulthave found it difficult to get hold of even basic information about 
defaultdecisions that 
defaultPCC
default’s are
default plann
defaulting to take.
default This has not been helped in some cases by the lack of a forward plan of decisions and in some cases an unwillingness on the part of the Commissioner, or the Commissioner’s office, to engage the Panel in policy development
default.
default&#xa0;
default2
default2
default.
default 
defaultA number of panels have worked with PCC
defaults
default and their offices to agree protocols on working arrangements
default,
default including the sharing of information, but more is needed.
default&#xa0;
default2
default3
default.
default              
defaultPCCs are statutorily obliged to publish a record of each decision of significant public interest that they make. However
default,
default a ‘decision of significant public interest’ is not defined in regulations. Further, there is no requirement on a PCC to publish a forward plan of key decisions, a process which has aided public scrutiny in local government. PCPs could benefit from:
default&#xa0;
default2
default3
default.1
default              
defaultThe i
defaultntroduction of a requirement into the Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specific Information) Regulations 2011 for PCCs to produce a forward plan of key decisions; and
default&#xa0;
default23
default.2
default              
defaultInserting a definition about what constitutes a decision of significant public interest into the regulations governing what information PCCs have to publish.
default&#xa0;
default2
default4
default.
default              
defaultPanels recognise that updated Police and Crime Strategies and budgets for 2014/15 provide the first real opportunity for PCCs to really influence policing in their areas. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default5
default.
default              
defaultScrutiny of budget setting will be an important element of the work of Panels over the next two months. In order for scrutiny to be meaningful
default,
default Panels will need to see relevant information on options, budget outlines and priorities as early as possible. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default6
default.
default              
defaultSome Panels fear that this information will not be available until 
defaultJanuary 2014, which will give very little time for scrutiny. We would urge
default the HASC to call on
default PCCs to share budget setting information with Panels at the earliest opportunity.
default&#xa0;defaultResourcesdefault&#xa0;default2
default7
default.
default              
defaultIn the 2013/14 financial year the Home Office made available £53,000 for each Police and Crime Panel. This funding has been used to provide secretariat support for the Panels. There are very few examples where this basic funding has been supplemented by local authority contributions
default,
default although in many cases non-financial resources are being provided in kind. 
default&#xa0;
default2
default8
default.
default              
defaultFuture funding from the Home Office has not yet been confirmed and this needs to happen in order to give the Panels some financial stability. Future Funding should also be predicated on a clearly articulated understanding of what the Panels are expected to do.
default&#xa0;
default29
default.
default              
defaultPanels have taken the role of scrutinising PCPs seriously, but there is a risk that the good will and commitment of Panel members will be undermined by low levels of funding and limited government ambitions for their role.
