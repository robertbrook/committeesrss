defaultMEASURES CURRENTLY IN PLACE IN THE UK TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF TRANSMITTINGdefaultVARIANT CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE VIA BLOODdefault&#xa0;
defaultSince 1996, when the theoretical risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) through blood was first identified, a series of precautionary measures approved and endorsed by independent scientific Advisory Committees have been implemented to reduce the risk to the blood supply and to products made by fractionating plasma.
default&#xa0;
defaultAll these measures have been reviewed and endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), and SaBTO publishes this document on its website for ease of reference.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe measures are summarised below.  They are applicable to all blood / blood components and blood products.  Where SaBTO has recently reviewed a measure, detailed information can be found in the published meeting papers.
default&#xa0;
defaultWithdrawal of blooddefault&#xa0;
defaultSince December 1997, all blood components, plasma products or tissues obtained from any individual who later develops clinical vCJD have been withdrawn/recalled to prevent their use.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues, supported by the effective application of the 
defaultTransfusion Medicine Epidemiology Review (TMER) collaborative project between the UK National CJD Research and Surveillance Unit and the UK Blood Services.  TMER investigates any evidence that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) may have been transmitted via the blood supply.  Further information on TMER can be found at:
defaulthttp://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/TMER/TMER.htm
default&#xa0;
defaultLeucoreductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultSince October 1999, white blood cells (which may carry a risk of transmitting vCJD) have been reduced in all blood used for transfusion, by a process known as leucodepletion or leucoreduction.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues; it not only provides a measure of vCJD risk reduction but additionally is crucial in supporting SaBTO’s recommendations with regard to cytomegalovirus risk reduction.
defaultDonor deferraldefault&#xa0;
defaultSince April 2004, following the report of the first presumed case of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion, individuals who had themselves received a transfusion of blood components since January 1980 were excluded from donating blood.  In July 2004, this exclusion criterion for blood donation was extended to include two other groups who had received transfusions of blood components since 1980:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis measure applies to donors who have been transfused anywhere in the world.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues.  Given the potential for transmission of vCJD via blood and continued uncertainties as to the implications of the prevalence of abnormal prion protein, this measure is considered important to restrict potential spread.  Each recipient acts as an end stage in any potential transmission.
default&#xa0;defaultClotting factors and immunoglobulindefault&#xa0;
defaultSince 1999, plasma for the manufacture of fractionated plasma products, such as clotting factors and immunoglobulins, has been obtained from non-UK sources.  Since 1998, synthetic (recombinant) clotting factor for the treatment of haemophilia has been provided to the under-16s, and since 2005 this measure has been extended to all patients for whom it is suitable.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues as a means to reduce the potential risk of transmitting vCJD (and other blood borne infections) to those with bleeding disorders and other conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlasma sourcingdefault&#xa0;
defaultSince 2004, fresh frozen plasma for treating those born on or after 1 January 1996 has been obtained from abroad (the USA or Austria).
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues, as confirmed by SaBTO in March 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NHS has been instructed to purchase imported solvent detergent-treated pooled plasma for adult patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues, as confirmed by SaBTO in March 2012.
default&#xa0;
defaultPlateletsdefault&#xa0;defaultIn September 2013, SaBTO removed the requirement to produce at least 80% of platelets by apheresis, and recommended that platelet additive solution (PAS) should be used for the suspension of platelets.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – This measure continues, as reducing apheresis and using platelet additive solution provides additional, cost-effective risk reduction.
default&#xa0;
defaultCryoprecipitatedefault&#xa0;defaultFrom 2005, cryoprecipitate produced from methylene blue treated plasma imported from the USA is being used for children up to the age of 16.
default&#xa0;
defaultCommentdefault – this measure continues, and may be reviewed by SaBTO if new information about alternative products becomes available.

defaultSummary results of the second national survey of abnormal prion prevalence in archived appendix specimens
default&#xa0;
defaultIn April 2008, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered available prevalence data for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the British population and advised that a second appendix survey, using the same approach as a previous appendix tissue survey [1] on samples from the 1941 to 1985 birth cohort, be undertaken to further refine the estimate for the prevalence of subclinical infection [2]. The second unlinked anonymous survey of the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in archived appendix tissues has now been completed and this summary provides an update to the interim results published in September 2011 [3,4].
default&#xa0;
defaultThe survey examined appendices by immunohistochemistry from operations conducted between 2000 and 2012 and collected from 41 hospitals throughout England. Abnormal prion accumulation was detected within the follicular dendritic cells of 16 appendices out of 32,441 suitable samples examined. None of the positive appendices have come from the 176 known vCJD cases in the UK. In line with the interim findings, the final overall prevalence estimate, 493 per million (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 282 to 801 per million), remained statistically consistent with results from the earlier appendix survey (237 per million, 95%CI 49 to 692 per million) which examined samples from operations performed between 1995 and 1999 [1]. The prevalence estimates by birth cohort were 733 per million (95% CI: 269 to 1596 per million) in those born between 1941 and 1960 and 412 per million (95% CI: 198 to 758 per million) in those born between 1961 and 1985: these results were also in line with the interim findings [3,4].
default&#xa0;
defaultThe survey was conducted by a collaboration of the HPA, the Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases at the UCL Institute of Neurology, the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Research and Surveillance Unit, the Histopathology Department of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, and the MRC Prion Unit.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe final survey results have been considered by the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Risk Assessment Sub-Group of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, the successor to SEAC [5]. In summary, the estimated prevalence range largely overlaps that from the first survey, but 
defaultHealth Protection Report 
defaultVol 6 No. 32 - 10 August 2012 is narrower with a higher central estimate (around 1 in 2000 compared with around 1 in 4000). The new survey also demonstrates the presence of prion protein across a wider birth cohort than previously.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe hypothesis that the prevalence of abnormal prions found in both appendix surveys to date is linked to the epidemic of BSE in cattle in Britain can be tested directly by studying further appendix samples archived prior to the BSE outbreak and samples from those born in 1996 or later by which time measures had been put in place to protect the food chain [5].

defaultAdvisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) TSE Risk Assessment Subgroupdefault&#xa0;defaultPosition Statement on occurrence of vCJD and prevalence of infection in the UK populationdefault&#xa0;defaultPrefacedefault&#xa0;defaultVariant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is a fatal human Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE).  This is a type of neurological disorder associated with the presence of an abnormal, ‘misfolded’ form of prion protein, making vCJD one of a small number of ‘prion diseases’.  It almost certainly first spread to humans via cattle infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or ‘Mad Cow’ disease.  To date, 176 patients in the UK have died from vCJD.  They have typically been young, with a median age of about 28 years at onset of symptoms.
default&#xa0;
defaultEarlier fears of large numbers of vCJD deaths have fortunately not been realised, and the number of new cases each year has been in decline for several years.  However, there is evidence that many more people might be infected, while not showing any symptoms.  If these people are 
defaultinfective
default, the risk of ‘secondary’ (person-to-person) transmission could be greater than implied by the small number of cases seen so far.  In particular, there have been concerns about the risks of vCJD being spread via blood transfusion, and possibly through the re-use of surgical instruments.  A number of precautionary steps are in place to reduce these risks
default, though it appears impossible to eliminate them entirely.
default&#xa0;
defaultMeanwhile, there remain great scientific uncertainties around the disease and its behaviour.  A key question is how the evidence on prevalence of infection in the population is to be reconciled with the small number of symptomatic, clinical cases diagnosed.  Scientific advice to the Department of Health on risk assessment is provided by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) TSE Risk Assessment Subgroup.  Prompted in part by the emergence of new evidence on the prevalence of infection, the Department requested the Subgroup to set out a brief, high-level summary of what is known – and not known – about the incidence and prevalence of vCJD within the UK population.  The result is the following Position Statement, discussed at the Subgroup’s meeting on July13th 2012 and finalised through subsequent correspondence.  Its aim is to make available a summary of current thinking on some key scientific issues, aimed primarily at professional audiences.  The intention is that this statement should be revisited and updated as appropriate as new evidence becomes available.  The Subgroup will continue to provide scientific advice on the effectiveness of further precautions.
defaultACDP Position Statementdefault&#xa0;
defaultOccurrence of vCJD
default&#xa0;
defaultAs of July 2012, 176 patients in the UK have been found to have definite or probable
default clinical vCJD, and over 220 cases have been reported world-wide.  As with other prion diseases, development of disease is influenced by genetic factors, in particular at position (“codon”) 129 of the prion protein gene.  At this position, healthy individuals have the amino-acid methionine (termed methionine homozygous, or MM), valine (valine homozygous, or VV) or both amino-acids (methionine-valine heterozygous, or MV).  These groups comprise approximately 40%, 10% and 50% of the UK population respectively.  All those probable and definite vCJD patients who have been genetically tested, have been MM homozygous at codon 129.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK vCJD patients comprise a single wave of clinical cases: numbers of known onsets peaked in 1999 and deaths and diagnoses both peaked in 2000.  The most recent onset of symptoms in a UK patient was in October 2010, and there are currently no living vCJD patients in the UK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is strong evidence that three of the 176 UK patients were infected through red cell transfusions from donors who themselves went on to develop vCJD.  No other secondary cases have been identified to date, but the possibility of some of the other 173 patients having been infected though person-to-person transmission cannot be ruled out.  In addition, abnormal prion protein was found in spleen samples from two further patients who died of unrelated causes, one having had a red cell transfusion from a donor who developed vCJD, and another having received fractionated plasma products partly sourced from such a donor.  Though neither patient showed any symptoms of vCJD, these may well represent further transmission of infection.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is evidence of disease amongst the other codon 129 genotypes, making it plausible that further clinical cases may appear in the remaining 60% of the population.  One MV heterozygote patient has been classified as a 
defaultpossible
default clinical case, though the diagnosis of vCJD could not be designated as “probable” or “definite” due to insufficient evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultCase ascertainment can never be regarded as perfect, and some clinical cases may have been missed or misdiagnosed (perhaps amongst elderly patients).  However, there is no indication of large-scale under-reporting of clinical vCJD.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrevalence of infection
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most recent study of prevalence of abnormal prion protein tested 32,441 appendix samples, collected during surgery on patients born between 1941 and 1985.  Of these, 16 samples were judged to be “positive”
default.  This indicates a central prevalence estimate very close to 1 in 2,000 in the age cohort covered, with a 95% Confidence Interval running from approximately 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 1,250.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe previous 
defaultHilton et al
default study published in 2004 tested appendix samples from a narrower cohort of patients, almost all born between 1961 and 1985.  This found three positive samples from 11,247 tested, suggesting a central prevalence estimate of approximately 1 in 4,000 with 95% Confidence Interval running from roughly 1 in 1,400 to 1 in 20,000.  Although the confidence intervals of the two studies overlap, the new study thus narrows the range considerably, as well as providing a higher central estimate.

defaultpreviously been found in tissue samples taken from all codon 129 genotypes, rather than being confined to MM homozygotes.  Two of the “positive” appendices from the Hilton 
defaultet al
default survey were from VV homozygotes, while the two asymptomatic recipients of blood products referred to earlier were both MV heterozygotes.  The new findings confirm that all genotypes are susceptible to vCJD infection.
default&#xa0;
defaultInterpretation
default&#xa0;
defaultThe “positive” samples found in these prevalence surveys have been compared with samples taken from vCJD patients and from individuals with known exposure to vCJD.  Unless and until there is any evidence to the contrary, positivity in these tests should be seen as indicative of vCJD infection.  
defaultThe recent appendix survey therefore provides the most reliable available indication of the prevalence of asymptomatic vCJD infection within the UK populationdefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is thus an increasingly marked divergence between the estimated prevalence of vCJD infection and the observed number of clinical cases.  This divergence would be even greater, were the test procedure used in the survey considered to have a sensitivity significantly below 100%.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe observation that clinical cases have so far been confined to MM homozygotes is insufficient to explain this divergence.  For example, if exposure to BSE had infected 1 person in 2,000 in the 1941-85 birth cohort, and if all infected MMs had had incubation periods similar to those seen so far, some thousands of MM cases would already have appeared
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe working assumption is that the bulk of the infections identified by the appendix survey would have been caused by dietary exposure to BSE in cattle
default.  The fundamental linkage to BSE can be tested by examining samples collected prior to the BSE outbreak.
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the assumed significance of exposure to BSE, prevalence of vCJD infection should be much lower amongst those born from 1996 onward, given the measures by then in place to protect the food chain.  This proposition can also be tested directly, by studying tissue samples from this post-1996 birth cohort.
default&#xa0;
defaultTaken together, the evidence on prevalence of infection and clinical case numbers implies that even amongst MMs, only a minority of those infected develop clinical symptoms within about 20 years of primary infection.  The remainder go into a long-term, asymptomatic state.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere may be many reasons for differences in individual response to vCJD infection, and these have yet to be fully understood.  One suggestion is that cross-species transmission (as when vCJD originated from BSE), generates 
defaultmultiple strains of the infectious agent with different characteristics.  In any case, the development of disease following infection is likely to depend on a complex interaction between the infective agent and the individual.  Key factors may include the dose and route of infection, while individual characteristics affecting susceptibility to clinical disease include codon 129 genotype and possibly other genetic factors.  Onset of prion disease may also be triggered, or inhibited, by other conditions.  The understanding needed to disentangle the possible causal factors does not yet exist.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhatever the reasons for infected individuals entering a long term asymptomatic state, much depends on whether this could be expected to last indefinitely, or eventually lead to clinical symptoms.  This is presently an open question, given the single wave of MM cases observed.  The precautionary assumption is that 
defaultfurther clinical cases may appear after much longer incubation periods than those seen so fardefault, though their number could be significantly reduced by intervening deaths from other causes.
default&#xa0;
defaultSecondary transmission
default&#xa0;
defaultMoving onto the risks of secondary (person-to-person) transmission, the precautionary assumption is that 
defaultpresence of abnormal prion protein is indicative of vCJD infectivitydefault - that positivity of an appendix sample implies that blood and other peripheral tissues would be infective.  Those with long-term asymptomatic vCJD infection would thus be potential sources of secondary infection – in particular though donation of blood or tissues and via the re-use of surgical instruments.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also reasonable to assume that all those exposed to the vCJD agent by such routes would be susceptible to infection, given the detection of abnormal prion protein in all codon 129 genotypes (though the degree of susceptibility to infection, and to the onset of clinical disease, may well vary markedly between individuals).
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the available evidence on key factors such as the infectivity of blood and tissues, and on the efficacy of instrument decontamination and measures such as leucodepletion of blood, one would expect some hundreds of secondary infections to have occurred every year, from the mid-1990s onward.  As already noted, 
defaultthree of the 176 known vCJD patients are believed to have arisen from blood-borne infection (all through transfusion of non-leucodepleted red cells prior to1999), whilst no clinical cases have been linked to surgery.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt remains possible that a few further vCJD patients could have been infected by secondary transmission, whist the expected 
defaultnumbers of secondary clinical cases would be significantly reduced by the limited survival and life expectancy of patients undergoing blood transfusion or neurosurgery.
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless, the contrast between predicted numbers of infections and the appearance of clinical cases that might be attributed to secondary transmission is again striking.  A number of explanations are possible, perhaps in combination.  For example, infectivity in tissues may be lower than currently assumed, or appear at these levels only close to the onset of clinical symptoms.  Surgery may turn out to be a relatively inefficient route of infection.  Leucodepletion may have had a substantial impact on blood-borne transmission risks.  Nevertheless, it remains plausible that secondary infections are occurring in significant numbers and that (as with primary infection) many
default defaultinfected individuals enter a long-term asymptomatic state.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs before, it is an open question as to whether or not these individuals would eventually develop symptoms, or are non-susceptible to development of clinical vCJD.  In either case, the precautionary assumption is that while asymptomatic, they would represent possible sources of further onward infection.
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusions
default&#xa0;
defaultClearly, many scientific uncertainties remain, and it is challenging to interpret case numbers and prevalence estimates when so much remains to be known about the course of the disease and the factors that affect it.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile fundamental research into prion diseases continues, it is essential to ensure that consistent, long-term surveillance of the population continues.  This should include development of methods to characterise the disease and if appropriate differentiate between strains.
default&#xa0;
defaultDespite the welcome fall in vCJD diagnoses, the indication of relatively widespread, albeit “silent”, vCJD infection necessitates continued attention to the risks of secondary, person-to-person transmission, and for applied research to support the development and implementation of risk management strategies.
default&#xa0;
defaultGaining further information on prevalence of infection also remains a key area, especially through the investigation of tissues from groups unexposed to BSE and of the feasibility of surveying the prevalence of abnormal prion protein in blood.

default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe MHRA is responsible for regulating all medicines and medical devices in the UK by ensuring they work and are acceptably safe. The MHRA is a centre of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency which also includes the 
defaultNational Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)
default, and the 
defaultClinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)
default. The MHRA is an executive agency of the Department of Health.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Regulatory Status of Blood and Blood Componentsdefault2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe definition of the term ‘medicinal product’ contained in Directive 2001/83/EC excludes 
defaultwhole blood, plasma or blood cells of human origin, except for plasma which is prepared by a method involving an industrial process. Instead, the European requirements for controlling human blood and blood components are contained in Directive 2002/98/EC and associated Directives 2004/33/EC, 2005/61/EC and 2005/62/EC. The provisions of these Directives have been transposed into UK national legislation through the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005 [SI 2005/50].
default&#xa0;
defaultMedicinal Productsdefault3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the UK medicinal products are regulated by the Medicines Act 1968 
defaultas amended 
defaultand the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 
defaultas amended. 
defaultThese Regulations reflect the provisions and requirements of the Pharmaceutical Directive 2001/83/EC. In general terms a medicinal product must have a marketing authorisation or certificate of registration before it can be sold or supplied lawfully in the UK. In order to obtain a marketing authorisation an applicant must show that the product meets the requirements of safety, quality and efficacy.
default&#xa0;
default4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition the product must be manufactured by the holder of a manufacturing authorisation and distributed by the holder of a wholesale distribution authorisation. Authorisation holders are subject to a scheme of checks and inspections to assure their compliance with regulatory requirements.
default&#xa0;
default5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultManufacturers and Distributors of medicinal products are required to follow the European Community Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The UK produces a comprehensive guide to these known as the “Orange Guide”. In addition to all the regular controls of GMP there is a specific annex for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma.

default7)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Unlicensed Medicinal Products for Human Use (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies)(Safety) Regulations 2003 require that any unlicensed medicinal product complies with the ‘Note for guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products’ as published by the European Commission in the ‘Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultBlood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005 set standards of quality and safety for the collection and testing of human blood and blood components, whatever their intended purpose, and their processing, storage and distribution for transfusion. The Regulations also cover the collection and testing of blood and blood components for autologous use. In effect therefore, they cover the whole process from donor to patient. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Regulations are attached for more information. The Regulations themselves can be found at

default10)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn general terms the Regulations require that a Blood Establishment must be authorised for the collection and testing of blood and blood components, and the processing, storage and distribution of blood and blood components when they are untended to be used for transfusion.  An authorisation is not required for the storage, distribution and compatibility tests on blood and blood components exclusively for use within hospital facilities. Similarly an authorisation is not required for a person carrying out the collection and testing of blood and blood components or the processing, storage and distribution of blood and blood components when they are untended to be used for transfusion if that person is doing so under a contractual arrangement with an authorisation holder or a person responsible for the management of a hospital blood bank.

defaultThe authorisation may be refused, suspended or varied if it appears that the Establishment is not capable of meeting the necessary standards or is no longer doing so. 
defaultThere are currently (as at 13 December 2013) 12 UK Blood Establishments authorised which cover some thirty sites. These are inspected every two years. However, a
defaultn authorisation holder is required to alert the MHRA should their own internal processes reveal an issue with the required standards.
default&#xa0;
default12)
default&#xa0; 
default The Regulations require that each unit of blood or blood component is 
defaultlabeled to
default contain the official name of the component, the amount of cells in the component, a unique donation indication, the name of the producing blood establishment, the blood group (unless the plasma is intended for fractionation), the Rh D Group (unless the plasma is intended for fractionation), the date or time of expiry, the temperature of storage, details of any anticoagulation or additive solution. The records of this information have to be kept for 30 years together with any other records necessary to identify each single blood donation and/or unit and to enable full traceability to the point of delivery to a hospital.

The commonest human TSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, occurs in both sporadic (sCJD) and acquired (vCJD) forms. The transmissible agent (or prion) is composed principally of a misfolded host protein, the prion protein, that accumulat
defaultes at high levels in the brain.
default&#xa0;
default9.33 Over past decades, sCJD has been transmitted from one patient to another through medical or surgical procedures involving neurosurgical instruments, brain electrodes, tissue (human cornea and dura mater grafts) and tissue extracts (human pituitary hormones). There have been no known transmissions of vCJD via surgery or use of tissues or organs to date; however there has been transmission of vCJD infection via transfusion of red blood cells (4 cases) and UK plasma used t
defaulto produce Factor VIII (1 case).
default&#xa0;
default9.34 Donor deferral issues centre around the potential for transmitting TSEs during organ and tissue transplantation. Deferral of donors is complex. An effective screening test for the detection of misfolded prions in donor blood is not available at present, and the prevalence of asymptomatic infected 
defaultpersons in the UK is uncertain.
default&#xa0;
default9.35 However, there are a number of risk factors for human TSEs that have been identified, including prior exposure to human blood, dura mater grafts, pituitary-derived hormones and contaminated surgical instruments. In addition, a number of individuals have been notified that they are at increased risk of CJD/vCJD for public health purposes, due to their exposure to one or more risk factors. Guidance from the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens’ TSE Working Group is available from their website and information on notifications is on t
defaulthe CJD Incidents Panel website.
default&#xa0;
default9.36 Individuals with a confirmed or suspected TSE, a neurological disease of unknown aetiology or those who are blood relatives of persons with familial CJD cannot be accepted as donors of organs or tissues. However, if a donor has had two or more blood relatives develop a prion-associated disease and, following genetic counselling, they have been informed they are not at risk, the
defaulty may be accepted for donation.
default&#xa0;
default9.37 Pre-exposure to human dura mater grafts, human pituitary-derived growth hormone and/or gonadotrophin excludes the donation of tissues, and should be taken into account when assessing any donor for their suitability for organ donation. There is no good evidence of transmission by organs or tissues other than by those
default of the central nervous system.
default&#xa0;
default9.38 For lifesaving organ and bone marrow transplantation only, donor exposure to risk factors for CJD and vCJD should be taken into account in the risk assessment, but does not
default necessarily preclude donation.

default This can be illustrated by a rough calculation considering infections solely in the 1941-85 cohort.  At the height of exposure to BSE, circa 1990, this cohort comprised about 30m people, 40% (12m) of them MM homozygotes.  A prevalence of 1 in 2,000 (if due to primary infection) implies that 6,000 of these individuals would have been infected through BSE exposure.  Collectively, they would have had life-expectancy normal for their age, so there would have been only a small number of deaths due to other causes.  Had the incubation periods seen in the actual MM cases been typical of this larger MM group, most of these 6,000 infections would already have appeared as clinical cases.  This takes no account of additional infections in other genotypes or in other age cohorts.
