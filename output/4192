defaultWritten Evidence submitted Anonymously [PHS0047]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultI understand you will not look into individual complaints but welcome the opportunity to provide evidence for your 
default“inquiry, entitled,
default 
defaultPdefaultarliaments defaultOmbudsmandefault Servicedefault”
default. I have concerns that some people in authority start with the assumption that complainants who did not have their cases investigated do not have a justified grievance and are simply unhappy they did not get the outcome they wanted. This attitude as justif
defaultication of why the 
defaultOmbudsman
default investigates so few complaints and on review very rarely finds they made a wrong decision means there will continue to be missed opportunities to improv
defaulte patient safety. I believe patient safety
default sh
defaultould be a priority
default of everyone
default involved
default in the Inquiry
default and this basic principle must be addressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt took the hospital 10
default months to conduct a review and respond to my complaint. It took the 
defaultPHSO
default a further 13 months to give me their decision not to investigate. I asked the 
defaultPHSO
default to rev
defaultiew how they made their decision and they
default have
default agreed to take a look. I am now waiting for their response which can take up to 16 weeks. I have given copies and evidence of my complaint to my MP Mr George 
defaultHollingbery
default.

default 
defaultThere is clear evidence from the notes and response 
defaultletters that a critical blood re
defaultsult that the hospital stated 
default‘defaultaltered the clinical context and prompted the response to arrange urgent brain imaging’default was either not reported from the laboratory or 
defaultnot acted upon
default by a clinician. Failure to provide a safety
default system for reporting critical results in
defaultevitably leads to potentially serious delays in management. The 
defaultOmbudsman
default,
default without evidence made assumptions on timings to justify delays which I find very worrying and only highlighted more concerns of patient safe
defaultty. They did express concern the hospital made no mention of reporting procedures and said they would share this 
defaultinformation with them. However 
defaultwithout an investigation to find exactly where in the 
defaultsystem the failure happened and provide remedial action
default or
default education
default to
default prevent it happening again
default it
default 
defaultcould easily happen to many other patients.

default  
defaultI would like my points considered with regard to recommendations made in the Baroness 
defaultFritchie
default report regarding benefits to wider public safety which stated that the 
defaultOmbudsman
default should 
default‘ensure caseworkers consider the relevance of any defaultindications of service failure not just to the complainant, but to odefaultther patients.’default I also
default feel it w
defaultould be helpful to consider the points
default alongside the evidence given by Dame Julie Mell
defaultor to your first Inquiry on 11
defaultth
default June 2013
default. M
defaulty letter from the 
defaultOmbudsm
defaultan
default declining to investigate
default was dated 10
defaultth
default June 2013
default, the day before the Inquiry
default and is therefore 
defaultproof of their working practice at that time
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultOmbudsman
default accepted the recommenda
defaulttions made by Baroness 
defaultFritchie
default and used them to introduce their new 
defaultstrategy in November 2012. H
defaultowever following
default the 
defaultOmbudsman’s
default response to
default my complaint I would question how
default effective this
default review and the new strategy have
default been.
default Who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations and how is the true
default va
defaultlue of this or any other review
default measured?
default 
defaultI would be grateful if the P
defaultASC could give serious consideration to these questions during the inquiry.
