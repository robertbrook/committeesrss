[normal]Written Evidence submitted Anonymously [PHS0047][bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I understand you will not look into individual complaints but welcome the opportunity to provide evidence for your 
[normal]“inquiry, entitled,
[normal] 
[normal]P[bold]arliaments [bold]Ombudsman[bold] Service[bold]”
[normal]. I have concerns that some people in authority start with the assumption that complainants who did not have their cases investigated do not have a justified grievance and are simply unhappy they did not get the outcome they wanted. This attitude as justif
[normal]ication of why the 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] investigates so few complaints and on review very rarely finds they made a wrong decision means there will continue to be missed opportunities to improv
[normal]e patient safety. I believe patient safety
[normal] sh
[normal]ould be a priority
[normal] of everyone
[normal] involved
[normal] in the Inquiry
[normal] and this basic principle must be addressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It took the hospital 10
[normal] months to conduct a review and respond to my complaint. It took the 
[normal]PHSO
[normal] a further 13 months to give me their decision not to investigate. I asked the 
[normal]PHSO
[normal] to rev
[normal]iew how they made their decision and they
[normal] have
[normal] agreed to take a look. I am now waiting for their response which can take up to 16 weeks. I have given copies and evidence of my complaint to my MP Mr George 
[normal]Hollingbery
[normal].

[normal] 
[normal]There is clear evidence from the notes and response 
[normal]letters that a critical blood re
[normal]sult that the hospital stated 
[normal]‘[bold]altered the clinical context and prompted the response to arrange urgent brain imaging’[bold] was either not reported from the laboratory or 
[normal]not acted upon
[normal] by a clinician. Failure to provide a safety
[normal] system for reporting critical results in
[normal]evitably leads to potentially serious delays in management. The 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal],
[normal] without evidence made assumptions on timings to justify delays which I find very worrying and only highlighted more concerns of patient safe
[normal]ty. They did express concern the hospital made no mention of reporting procedures and said they would share this 
[normal]information with them. However 
[normal]without an investigation to find exactly where in the 
[normal]system the failure happened and provide remedial action
[normal] or
[normal] education
[normal] to
[normal] prevent it happening again
[normal] it
[normal] 
[normal]could easily happen to many other patients.

[normal]I would like my points considered with regard to recommendations made in the Baroness 
[normal]Fritchie
[normal] report regarding benefits to wider public safety which stated that the 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] should 
[normal]‘ensure caseworkers consider the relevance of any [bold]indications of service failure not just to the complainant, but to o[bold]ther patients.’[bold] I also
[normal] feel it w
[normal]ould be helpful to consider the points
[normal] alongside the evidence given by Dame Julie Mell
[normal]or to your first Inquiry on 11
[normal]th
[normal] June 2013
[normal]. M
[normal]y letter from the 
[normal]Ombudsm
[normal]an
[normal] declining to investigate
[normal] was dated 10
[normal]th
[normal] June 2013
[normal], the day before the Inquiry
[normal] and is therefore 
[normal]proof of their working practice at that time
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Ombudsman
[normal] accepted the recommenda
[normal]tions made by Baroness 
[normal]Fritchie
[normal] and used them to introduce their new 
[normal]strategy in November 2012. H
[normal]owever following
[normal] the 
[normal]Ombudsman’s
[normal] response to
[normal] my complaint I would question how
[normal] effective this
[normal] review and the new strategy have
[normal] been.
[normal] Who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the recommendations and how is the true
[normal] va
[normal]lue of this or any other review
[normal] measured?
[normal] 
[normal]I would be grateful if the P
[normal]ASC could give serious consideration to these questions during the inquiry.
