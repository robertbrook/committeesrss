"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAbout us&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Centre for Crime and Justice Studies \n(hereafter ‘the Centre’) \nwas founded in 1931. We advance public understanding of crime, criminal justice and social harm. We are independent and non-partisan, though motivated by our values. We stand with those most vulnerable to social harm. We believe that the United Kingdom’s over reliance on policing, prosecution and punishment is socially harmful, economically wasteful, and prevents us from tackling the complex problems our society faces in a sustainable, socially just manner.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nThrough our various events we bring people together to share ideas and develop solutions. In partnership with Oxford University Press and an independent international editorial board we publish the \nBritish Journal of Criminology\n, one of the world’s top criminology journals. In partnership with Taylor and Francis and an \nindependent \neditorial advisory board we publish \nCriminal Justice Matters\n, a \nquarterly magazine covering contemporary developments relating to political debate, policy and research. \nOur annual publication\n \nUK Justice Policy Review\n \nreviews criminal justice and welfare policy across the four nations of the United Kingdom.\n \nWe also produce a range of other \nreports draw\ning\n on our own research as well as research by our partners and collaborators.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nIn July \n2013 the Centre launched \nJustice Matters: \na three year initiative \npromoting\n fresh thinking on downsizing the United Kingdom\n’s\n criminal justice systems and \nthe development of\n \nalternative policies and practices \nthat are \nproportionate response\ns\n to the harms people experience.\n&#xa0;\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSummary&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0; \nThis submission addresses two areas of interest the Committee highlighted in its call for evidence: the impact of recent spending reductions and the contribution of existing criminal justice policies to crime reduction.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nOn the first of these, the Centre believes that there is considerable scope for a reduction in criminal justice spending, if this reduction is complemented by a comparable reduction in the size and scope of the criminal justice agencies affected.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nOn the second of these, there is significant research evidence indicating that levels of victimisation are related to underlying social arrangements, rather than to the interventions of criminal justice agencies.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nIn essence, the question of the rates of harm and victimisation in society and the question of the size,\n scope, \nreach \nand operation \nof \nthe different parts of the \ncriminal justice system \nneed to be separated.\n&#xa0;\n3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImpact of recent spending reductions&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nThere is considerable scope to reduce criminal justice spending if complemented by reductions in the size and scope of criminal justice agencies.\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nCurrent criminal justice spending reductions are being implemented following previous, and generous, real terms spending increases\n, as the Centre’s \nthree reviews of government spending on the police (5); the prison and probation services (6); and the Crown Court and magistrates’ courts (4) between 1999\n and 2009\n make \nclear\n. Spending on the police in England and Wales gr\new\n in real terms by 50 percent \nbetween 1999 and 2009\n. In the case of the Prison and Probation Services \nthere was\n a real terms \nspending \ngrowth of 36 percent between 2004 and 2009. Expenditure on magistrates’ courts \ngrew in\n \nreal terms by 17 per cent from 1998/1999 to 2003/2004 and by 31 per cent from 2005/2006 to 2008/2009. Expenditure on the Crown Court Crown Court increased by 10 per cent in real terms from 2005/2006 to 2008.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe\nse\n generous spending \nincreases\n financed growth in these services, though \nthis \ngrowth was uneven. Police numbers grew significantly\n while their caseload as measured by police recorded crime rates stabilised\n. Prison numbers and probation caseloads grew more quickly than budget growth\n, putting significant strain on both services\n. Per prisoner expenditure declined in real terms from 2006. Frontline probation staff numbers declined after 2006 while caseloads grew. Magistrates’ courts’ caseloads and staffing declined from 2006 while Crown C\nourt caseloads grew from 2005.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe current squeeze on public spending presents an opportunity to resize the various criminal justice agencies in a manner that delivers real social benefit and leaves those services in better shape. This would involve \na \ngeneral \ndownsizing of the criminal justice system: \nfewer arrests; fewer prosecutions; fewer prisoners; fewer probationers\n;\n fewer criminal justice workers, whether police officers, judges and magistrates, prison and probation officers or others.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0; \nThere is little evidence of the government embracing this challenge. It appears to favour maintaining the current size of the justice system, or even to expand it in the case of prisons, on shrinking budgets, while chipping away at legal aid in particular as a means of finding savings. The long-term effects of this on staff morale, system effectiveness and justice are difficult to predict, but are likely to be significant.\n&#xa0;\n4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContribution of existing sentencing, prison and probation policies to the reduction of crime&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Centre’s starting point is that \nthe main influences on \nlevels of harm and victimisation are social arrangements – for example \nrates of\n wealth and poverty, \nlevels of \nemployment and unemployment, unequal power relations – rather than the criminal justice system and its individual agencies. \nOne of\n the clearest demonstration\ns\n of this comes from an assessment of homicide rates. A 2011 article by William Pridemore in the \nBritish Journal of Criminology\n found that higher levels of homicide were associated with higher rates of poverty\n (8)\n. \nThis is but one contribution to significant research evidence on the links between violence victimisation and social arrangements. Research by Danny Dorling and published by the Centre as part of a collection of articles entitled \nCriminal \nObsessions\n, examined the increase in homicides in Britain between 1979 and 1999 (1). Dorling found that the rising trend in the number of homicides during this twenty year period was very unfairly distributed. Those living in the richest neighbourhoods saw their risk of being a victim of homicide fall. Those living in the poorest neighbourhoods saw their risk of being a victim of homicide go up sixfold.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nIn co\nntrast, evidence for the effect\n of criminal justice interventions on official crime rates is poor. A review of international evidence explaining falls in official crime rates by Graham Farrell and colleagues was published in 2010\n (3)\n. They found no evidence that rates of imprisonment, police numbers or policing strategies could explain falls in crime, apart from some parti\nal effects in the United States. To achieve this, the United States has relied on policies of hyperincarceration and \naggressive policing strategies disproportionately targeting black people and the most economically disadvantaged. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe lack of evidence for the impact of criminal justice interventions is corroborated by the \nNational Audit Office (NAO) briefing for the Justice Committee, \nComparing International Criminal Justice Systems\n, published in February 2011\n. The NAO\n noted that official crime rates have fallen over recent years across a number of countries. However, it found ‘no \nconsistent correlations’ between official crime rates and the numbers in prison across a range of countries. Prison, it noted ‘is very expensive’ and it questioned ‘aspects of its cost-effectiveness’. \nThe Centre endorses these conclusions and supports the NAO’s position on the ‘\nbenefit of conducting more research into prison population trends in other countries in order to learn lessons from those with declining prison populations’.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0; \nThis does not mean it is not possible to make meaningful intervention\ns in response to\n victimisation. They do, however, need to be the right one\ns. For instance, o\nur comprehensive review of gun and knife crime strategies \nfor the Children’s Commissioner for England \ncast doubt on the effectiveness of police-led approaches and found that effective strategies typically were \nholistic, engaging with the big questions of disadvantage and social exclusion, as well as addressing individual, familial and neighbourhood problems\n (9)\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe Centre’s 2012 report, \nReducing the numbers in custody: looking beyond criminal justice solutions\n, compared a number of countries\n’\n social and economic arrangements and their levels of imprisonment \nand victimisation \n(7). Countries with lower rates of poverty and inequality and more generous social safety nets were typically safer, had lower rates of violence and lower rates of imprisonment.\n \nIn 2007 the Centre published research by Professor David Downes and Dr Kirsten Hansen on the underlying drivers of prison populations (2). They found a strong correlation between welfare spending and rates of imprisonment. Countries with \nmore \ngenerous welfare provision typically had low\ner\n rates of imprisonment. Those with less generous welfare provision typically had higher rates of impris\nonment.\n&#xa0;\n5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCrime reduction policies: a co-ordinated approach&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Centre \nis in favour of a criminal justice system that is responsive to the needs of victims and witness and treats suspects, defendants and convictees with respect and dignity.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe criminal justice system is good at punishing certain individuals and groups. It fails to prevent social problems from arising, or to resolve those that occur. It is possible to deliver lower levels of victimisation and a smaller criminal justice system at the same time. Our current over reliance as a country on criminal justice interventions crowds out more innovative, just and effective policy and practice solutions to the problems our society faces. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;\n1.
