[[[The experiences of panels]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]11.              The LGA has taken a keen interest in the progress of Panels over the last year. We have provided a range of guides on the implications of the reforms for those participating in Panels and also for others forming the local delivery, governance and scrutiny landscape. &#xa0;12.              The LGA has also funded a programme of support, through the Centre for Public Scrutiny, and has provided a Knowledge Hub network for practitioners which has enabled a transfer of experience and learning.  Together with the research commissioned into the first year of the Panels, this engagement has given the LGA a good degree of insight into the experience and challenges of the first year.&#xa0;13.              The first year has been a learning experience for Panels; they have undertaken scrutiny on hastily developed police and crime plans and budgets and have gone through a range of confirmation hearings and are now looking forward to a more planned and meaningful engagement in the next cycle. &#xa0;

[[[and Panels]]]&#xa0;14.              The findings of the research commissioned by the LGA have indicated that the success or failure of Panels is dependent on the relationship between PCCs, their offices and Panels. In many cases these relationships are good and provide a sound basis for effective scrutiny. Where relationships have been more difficult if appears to stem from mutual misunderstandings about the Panel’s role. &#xa0;

[[[Suspensions and dismissals]]]&#xa0;15.              For some, the first year has been challenging, particularly where Commissioners chose to suspend or dismiss a Chief Constable. The experience of Lincolnshire, where the Chief Constable was suspended will be very instructive for Panels and PCCs alike. The Lincolnshire case highlights the relatively limited powers that Panels have in such circumstances. Panels must be notified of a suspension, but no specific action is prescribed in the legislation. In this first year, Panels have been on their own in determining what action to take in these cases. &#xa0;16.              The Gwent example where, as the HASC report states, “Mrs Napier was persuaded to retire voluntarily before the [scrutiny] process was initiated,” highlights the relative ease with which PCCs are able to circumvent what are already limited formal powers of scrutiny.&#xa0;17.              Throughout this first year, Panels have come to realise that the formal powers, such as they are, have at best been of little use and in some cases have hindered the function of scrutiny to question and expose and to engage the public in these processes. &#xa0;18.              The Panel in Lincolnshire has now undertaken a substantial review of the circumstances surrounding the suspension of Chief Constable Rhodes by the PCC and its own actions in response to the suspension. The findings will be very instructive for both Panels and PCCs.&#xa0;

[[[Information sharing]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]19.              In any executive/scrutiny model the flow of information between the two is crucial to effective accountability. Many Panels have developed good relationships with their PCCs and the office of the Police and Crime Commissioners and this has led to effective information sharing.&#xa0;20.              However, in a number of cases, Panels have faced difficulties in getting information. The research by CfPS has indicated that, for some, information has only been forthcoming after repeated requests and has then been incomplete. CfPS suggests that this is often because of disagreements relating to the kind of information about Commissioners’ activities which [Panels] are entitled to see.  &#xa0;21.              Some Panels have found it difficult to get hold of even basic information about decisions that PCC’s are planning to take. This has not been helped in some cases by the lack of a forward plan of decisions and in some cases an unwillingness on the part of the Commissioner, or the Commissioner’s office, to engage the Panel in policy development.&#xa0;22. A number of panels have worked with PCCs and their offices to agree protocols on working arrangements, including the sharing of information, but more is needed.&#xa0;23.              PCCs are statutorily obliged to publish a record of each decision of significant public interest that they make. However, a ‘decision of significant public interest’ is not defined in regulations. Further, there is no requirement on a PCC to publish a forward plan of key decisions, a process which has aided public scrutiny in local government. PCPs could benefit from:&#xa0;23.1              The introduction of a requirement into the Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specific Information) Regulations 2011 for PCCs to produce a forward plan of key decisions; and&#xa0;23.2              Inserting a definition about what constitutes a decision of significant public interest into the regulations governing what information PCCs have to publish.&#xa0;24.              Panels recognise that updated Police and Crime Strategies and budgets for 2014/15 provide the first real opportunity for PCCs to really influence policing in their areas. &#xa0;25.              Scrutiny of budget setting will be an important element of the work of Panels over the next two months. In order for scrutiny to be meaningful, Panels will need to see relevant information on options, budget outlines and priorities as early as possible. &#xa0;26.              Some Panels fear that this information will not be available until January 2014, which will give very little time for scrutiny. We would urge the HASC to call on PCCs to share budget setting information with Panels at the earliest opportunity.

[[[Resources]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]27.              In the 2013/14 financial year the Home Office made available £53,000 for each Police and Crime Panel. This funding has been used to provide secretariat support for the Panels. There are very few examples where this basic funding has been supplemented by local authority contributions, although in many cases non-financial resources are being provided in kind. &#xa0;28.              Future funding from the Home Office has not yet been confirmed and this needs to happen in order to give the Panels some financial stability. Future Funding should also be predicated on a clearly articulated understanding of what the Panels are expected to do.&#xa0;29.              Panels have taken the role of scrutinising PCPs seriously, but there is a risk that the good will and commitment of Panel members will be undermined by low levels of funding and limited government ambitions for their role.  &#xa0;Local Government AssociationDecember 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Home Affairs Committee - Sixth Report Police and Crime Commissioners: power to remove Chief Constables, July 2013, paragraph 5
