defaultYoung people are put off accessing services for a variety of reasons, but the chief reason is the stigma associated with mental health.
default Other reasons include long waiting lists, difficult referral systems, not being taken seriously etc.
default 
defaultYoung people have reported in numerous consultations that they want holistic services that meet their mental health needs, but also provide access to a range of help and support; and they want the opportunity to take part in activities that are fun and creative, and help them build a range of softer skills such as building friendships.
default 
defaultThis range of services, especially the opportunity to develop the softer skills is especially important for young people with long-term mental health problems as their illness can significantly impact on their school and personal life. 
default5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is important that young people have easy access to
default services that are flexible and tailored to individual needs e.g. not ‘9 to 5’ or ‘wait until Monday’; and they want to be seen in the environment that works best for them – this may be at home, or in the clinic, but it may also be in a coffee shop They want services to use the web, mobiles, text, email to improve communication; and services should outreach into schools and other agencies. 
default5.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInvolving young people in decisions about what services should look like and how they should operate will help engage them with their own care and improve the quality of long-term health care.
defaultHome Treatmentdefault6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn South Wales, there is the Community Intensive Therapy Team (CITT), which is aimed at young people who need more support than that usually provided in outpatient settings.
default This service reduced the need to admit young people to inpatien
defaultt units, and between 2001-2006 
defaultthere were n

defaultservices (
defaultinpatient services and other highly specialist provision) outside of the region. http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/31/community-intensive-therapy-team
default 
defaultThere is also the Fife Intensive Therapy Team, which uses a similar service model, which sees young people in their homes or in a suitable community facility. This service has also been shown to be effective in improving young people’s menta
defaultl health.
default6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany young people prefer to access 
defaultvoluntary sector
default services as they are often on the high street
default and are less stigmatising
default.
default 
defaultFor instance, 
defaultYouth, Information, Advice and Counselling Services (YIACS) offer a range of different
default services under one roof. Research has found that the young people accessing these services have very high levels of mental illness (Youth
default 
defaultAccess, 2012).
default YIACs have different configurations including counselling services, sexual health, drugs advice etc, but
default The Zone 
defaultin Plymouth - http://www.thezoneplymouth.co.uk/ offers a range of services including access to an early
default intervention psychosis service
default, and a service for young people with emerging personality disorders.
default 
defaultIntegrated servicesdefault7.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are many reasons why local agencies have difficulties with integrated working. For instance, d
defaultifferent agencies often use different terminology and this can hinder integrated working. There needs to be a shared understanding of mental health and wellbeing, and of the range of services that are required, and what the responsibilities are for each agency. 
default7.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRelevant services in a given area need to work in genuine partnership to plan, commission and deliver the full range of mental health services including those for long-term conditions. The different agencies need to have a mandate and incentives to encourage them to work in partnership. There also needs to be good leadership within these agencies to drive forward partnership working. Partnership working relies on trust, and this needs to be nurtured and developed through good working relationships between staff in different agencies. 
default7.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHealth and Wellbeing Boards are in a good position to improve integrated working. In order for these new bodies to achieve this, they must have representation from voluntary sector organisations, the justice system, and education, as well as the members stipulated in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. This will enable 
defaulta 
defaultwide range of agencies to come together and feed in to the
defaultir 
defaultlocal 
defaultjoint strategic n
defaulteeds 
defaultassessment (JSNA) and their joint health and wellbeing strategy.
default7.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHea
defaultlth and Wellbeing Boards must 
defaultensure that their JSNAs 
defaulttake account of the 
defaultmental health 
defaultneeds of children and young people
default. This needs analysis data must be 
defaultreflected in their joint health and wellbeing strategies and ultimately in the local commissioning plans
default of the clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and the local authority.
default 
defaultTransitionsdefault8.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultProblems 
defaultassociated with this transition 
defaultcan result in vulnerable young adults being left with no support at a critical point in their lives, when they most need help.
default 
defaultIn particular, t
defaulthere is
default particula
defaultr a lack of continuity of care 
defaultand service provision 
defaultfor young adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and personality disorders
default (ref Singh)
default.
default 
defaultAll of these conditions are long-term conditions, often with negative outcomes. For instance, the consequences of not providing adequate support can result in people not accessing help until they come into contact with the justice system. 
defaultConclusiondefault9.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMany people with mental health problems have multiple morbidities, but we know that most will not receive a holistic service that addresses the full range of their needs. Therefore, long-term care needs to be more holistic to address these people’s needs. 
default9.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMental health services for young people need to be accessible and they need to have a choice about where they are seen, whether that is at home, a cafe, or other appropriate locations. This is because clinics can be stigmatising and put young people off accessing help when they need it. 
default9.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTransitions between CAMHS and AMHS is a perennial problem
default, and not addressing this problem can result in young people dropping out of services until their problems become more chronic and enduring.
