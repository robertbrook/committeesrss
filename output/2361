[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from[bold] the Association of Train Operating Companies[bold] (ATOC)[bold] (SLC 024)[bold]Introduction[bold] [bold]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]ATOC's mission
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] to champion the interests of passenger rail operators in serving customers and supporting a safe, reliable, attractive and prosperous railway
[normal]. Set up after privatisation in 1993, we bring together all train companies to preserve and enhance the benefits f
[normal]or passengers of Britain’s national rail network. We also run joint industry services, including National Rail Enquiries, the Rail Settlement Plan and the discount Railcard schemes
[normal] and the provision of expert services in 
[normal]p
[normal]olicy, operations, engineering and
[normal] project management
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We welcome the chance to submit evidence to the Committee’s inquiry
[normal]. 
[normal]In general, it is
[normal] road users
[normal] who are most likely to be injured or killed by accidents at level crossings.  However
[normal],
[normal] there are cases where a collision between a train
[normal] and a road vehicle has resulted in a derailment and subsequent multiple fatalities and serious injuries to a train’s passengers and crew, Ufton Nervet in 2004 being the most recent UK example. In addition, a number of train drivers have been killed in col
[normal]lisions where there were no passenger fatalities due to their location at the very front of the train. Train drivers and others can also suffer serious psychological or psychiatric injury after witnessing an accident at a level crossing
[normal].
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]According to the 
[normal]Office of Rail Regulation
[normal] (ORR)
[normal], the independent safety and economic regulator for Britain's railways, there are approximately 9
[normal],
[normal]000 level crossings in Great Britain.
[normal] Network Rail manages just over 6
[normal],
[normal]500 active, open crossings.
[normal] The rest are located on he
[normal]ritage railways, metro systems and industrial railways.
[normal]Are current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved? [bold]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The
[normal] evidence suggests that 
[normal]Britain’s mainline railway is the best in the EU at managing risks at level crossings.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his is a conclusion reached by the ORR and their 
[normal]Health and Safety Report 2013
[normal] 
[normal]records that there has been a long-term trend of decreasing risk at level crossings and that Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% reduction in level crossing risk over Co
[normal]ntrol Period 4 (CP4) 2009-14, as measured by its own model.
[normal] 
[normal]This view
[normal] is echoed by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch who 
[normal]find 
[normal]that the UK’s mainline railway has a good overall level crossing safety record relative to the other European Union Member 
[normal]States.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]here should be no complacency
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Britain’s level crossings still account for nearly half of the catastrophic train accident risk on the railway
[normal] and 
[normal] there were nine level cros
[normal]sing user fatalities in 2012/13 
[normal]- four pedestrians users and five road 
[normal]vehicle users.
[normal] 
[normal] There were also seven major 
[normal]injuries, 53 reported minor injuries and 17 reports of shock or trauma. There were ten collisions between trains and road vehicles. The total amount of harm at level crossings in 2012/13 showed an increase compa
[normal]red with the last two years, but was below the ten-year average. There were no passenger or workforce fatalities and the last level crossing accident resulting in train occupant fatalities occurred in 2004.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further improvements
[normal] 
[normal]could be made by
[normal] new equip
[normal]ment, better management,
[normal] closer working and a clearer division of responsibilities between Network Rail and those responsible for roads
[normal],
[normal] and a general simplification of legal processes governing the closure of level crossings. 
[normal]The challenge is to deliver i
[normal]mprovement at an affordable cost.
[normal] 
[normal]Network Rail is spending £130m to improve level crossing safety during Control Period 4 (1 April 2009 - 31 March 2014).
[normal]In addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace[bold] or improve safety at level crossings?[bold]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Every level crossing 
[normal]has
[normal] specific risks associated with it
[normal], determined
[normal] by crossing type, location,
[normal] amount and type of use,
[normal] 
[normal]and other local factors. 
[normal]Safety risk can 
[normal]sometimes 
[normal]be reduced by 
[normal]changing
[normal] the crossing type 
[normal]us
[normal]ed in a particular location, but doing so 
[normal]can be expensive
[normal] and not 
[normal]proportionate to the reduction
[normal] in risk
[normal] achieved. 
[normal]In some locations more modest changes, such as removing obstructions from sight lines, improving the visibility of road traffic signals and 
[normal]increas
[normal]ing the audibility of train horns,
[normal] 
[normal]may be more appropriate and cost effective. The rail industry, through 
[normal]Network Rail
[normal],
[normal] is taking a number of steps to achieve further safety improvements, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Accidents are not just caused by technical or physical problems at the location, but also by user b
[normal]ehaviour which the rail industry has sometimes little or no ability to influence. 
[normal] Pedestrians and car users take risks and make misjudgements. 
[normal]We look forward to the publication of research into user behaviour by the Rail Safety and Standards Board next y
[normal]ear. We hope any cost-effective recommendations will be implemented without unnecessary delay. 
[normal]How should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?[bold]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The rail industry uses s
[normal]ophisticated models 
[normal](e.g. the 
[normal]RSSB’s
[normal] Precursor Indicator Model) 
[normal]to understand the risks it manages and to prioritise risk reduction.
[normal] 
[normal]Further improving safety at level crossings should 
[normal]remain 
[normal]a priority given they 
[normal]remain a significant
[normal] train accident risk on
[normal] 
[normal]the railway
[normal]. The 
[normal]Government’s 2012 High Level Output Statement 
[normal]ma
[normal]de
[normal] a
[normal] welcome
[normal] ring-fenced provision of £65m over Control Period 5 i
[normal]n accordance with advice from
[normal] the
[normal] ORR
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The benefits resulting 
[normal]from improvements to level crossings are not limited to 
[normal]increased safety and reduced risk. For the railway, improvements can lead to quicker journey times through fewer speed restrictions and lower maintenance and staffing costs (depending on the improvement made). At the same time there are often
[normal] benefits to r
[normal]oad users, in the form of reduced delays and a better flow of traffic. Given the benefits of improvements are shared between rail and road and that 
[normal]l
[normal]evel crossing accidents tend to 
[normal]involve road users and 
[normal]pedestrians rather than rail passengers
[normal], 
[normal]there 
[normal]is 
[normal]a 
[normal]strong 
[normal]case for 
[normal]using the
[normal] roads budget 
[normal]to supplement the existing commitment from
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]rail budget
[normal] to fund further improvements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?[bold]11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Yes. 
[normal]Network Rail has 
[normal]demonstrably
[normal] increased the focus it places on improving safety at level crossings.  As noted above,
[normal] [bold]Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% reduction in level crossing risk over Control Period 4 (CP4) 2009-14
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]committed to achieve 
[normal]a 
[normal]further 25% reduction in l
[normal]evel crossing risk 
[normal]by 2019. We welcome this continued commitment and focus
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Is Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ORR makes conclusions and recommendations about the performance of Network Rail in its 
[normal]a
[normal]nnual Health and Safety Report, but does not provide enough detailed information to judge whether their activity is ‘adequate’. The fact that Britain compares favou
[normal]rably to European comparators and Network Rail is delivering against 
[normal]its
[normal] targets 
[normal]does 
[normal]suggest that UK arrangements are working
[normal] well.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ORR 
[normal]has set out its policy on level crossings and has produced 
[normal]detailed helpful 
[normal]guidance on the safe management, 
[normal]operation, modification and use level crossings for managers, designers and operators.
[normal] We agree with the ORR that
[normal] impro
[normal]ving safety at level crossings
[normal] should not be a solely rail industry responsibility
[normal],
[normal] but needs to involve traffic authorities and other relevant organisations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ORR does occasionally use its formal powers to ensure compliance with the law or deal with immediate risk. For example, they completed a 
[normal]successful 
[normal]prosecution of Network Rail
[normal] for a 
[normal]f
[normal]ailure to address concerns about sighting at a level crossing, resulting in the death of pedestrian using a footpath
[normal],
[normal] for which Network Rail were fined £356
[normal],
[normal]250.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s 2012 High Level Output Statement stated that: 
[normal]‘the Secretary of Sta
[normal]te wishes the industry to reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings and is making a ring-fenced funding provision for this purpose.’
[normal] 
[normal]We welcome the ring-fencing of £6
[normal]5
[normal]m between 2014 and 2019  for this purpose. 
[normal]How should the legislation governing [bold]level crossings be updated?[bold]16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission are 
[normal]reviewing the law relating to level crossings, which they describe as 
[normal]‘complex, outdated and difficult to access, creating problems for regulators, owners and operators and incr
[normal]easing the safety risk for users.
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal] consultation paper
[normal] 
[normal]was published in July 2010, followed by a four month consultation period. T
[normal]he Law Commission’s website
[normal] states that 
[normal]Parliamentary counsel have drafted a Bill and Regulations to give effect to their reco
[normal]mmendations and a report containing the recommendations will published in the autumn.
[normal] [bold]We expect the Law Commission will 
[normal]recommend
[normal] a consolidation and simplification of existing 
[normal]legislation
[normal] and 
[normal]hope that 
[normal]the new legislative framework will encourage 
[normal]greater 
[normal]collaboration between rail and road authorities in managing level crossing risk. 
[normal]It is frustrating that progress has not been quicker.
[normal]How should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?[bold]17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Network Rail 
[normal]undertakes national and local p
[normal]ublic 
[normal]awareness activity
[normal], including at level crossing sites
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We believe there is scope for 
[normal]joint
[normal] work
[normal]ing and campaigns
[normal] with bodies 
[normal]with experience of road safety public awareness
[normal] (e.g. local authorities, Think!,
[normal] and
[normal] the police) 
[normal]because Netw
[normal]o
[normal]rk Rail does not have
[normal] sole responsibility for safety at level crossings.
[normal] Campaigns should be targeted at the most vulnerable users
[normal] – irregular 
[normal]and
[normal] irregular users -
[normal] based on the evidence.
