default. 
defaultIn general, it is
default road users
default who are most likely to be injured or killed by accidents at level crossings.  However
default,
default there are cases where a collision between a train
default and a road vehicle has resulted in a derailment and subsequent multiple fatalities and serious injuries to a train’s passengers and crew, Ufton Nervet in 2004 being the most recent UK example. In addition, a number of train drivers have been killed in col
defaultlisions where there were no passenger fatalities due to their location at the very front of the train. Train drivers and others can also suffer serious psychological or psychiatric injury after witnessing an accident at a level crossing
default.

defaultAccording to the 
defaultOffice of Rail Regulation
default (ORR)
default, the independent safety and economic regulator for Britain's railways, there are approximately 9
default,
default000 level crossings in Great Britain.
default Network Rail manages just over 6
default,
default500 active, open crossings.
default The rest are located on he
defaultritage railways, metro systems and industrial railways.
defaultAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate? How should they be improved? default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default evidence suggests that 
defaultBritain’s mainline railway is the best in the EU at managing risks at level crossings.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis is a conclusion reached by the ORR and their 
defaultHealth and Safety Report 2013
default 
defaultrecords that there has been a long-term trend of decreasing risk at level crossings and that Network Rail is on-target to meet its 25% reduction in level crossing risk over Co
defaultntrol Period 4 (CP4) 2009-14, as measured by its own model.
default 
defaultThis view
default is echoed by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch who 
defaultfind 
defaultthat the UK’s mainline railway has a good overall level crossing safety record relative to the other European Union Member 
defaultStates.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthere should be no complacency
default.
default 
defaultBritain’s level crossings still account for nearly half of the catastrophic train accident risk on the railway
default and 
default there were nine level cros
defaultsing user fatalities in 2012/13 
default- four pedestrians users and five road 
defaultvehicle users.
default 
default There were also seven major 
defaultinjuries, 53 reported minor injuries and 17 reports of shock or trauma. There were ten collisions between trains and road vehicles. The total amount of harm at level crossings in 2012/13 showed an increase compa
defaultred with the last two years, but was below the ten-year average. There were no passenger or workforce fatalities and the last level crossing accident resulting in train occupant fatalities occurred in 2004.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurther improvements
default 
defaultcould be made by
default new equip
defaultment, better management,
default closer working and a clearer division of responsibilities between Network Rail and those responsible for roads
default,
default and a general simplification of legal processes governing the closure of level crossings. 
defaultThe challenge is to deliver i
defaultmprovement at an affordable cost.
default 
defaultNetwork Rail is spending £130m to improve level crossing safety during Control Period 4 (1 April 2009 - 31 March 2014).
defaultIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replacedefault or improve safety at level crossings?default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEvery level crossing 
defaulthas
default specific risks associated with it
default, determined
default by crossing type, location,
default amount and type of use,
default 
defaultand other local factors. 
defaultSafety risk can 
defaultsometimes 
defaultbe reduced by 
defaultchanging
default the crossing type 
defaultus
defaulted in a particular location, but doing so 
defaultcan be expensive
default and not 
defaultproportionate to the reduction
default in risk
default achieved. 
defaultIn some locations more modest changes, such as removing obstructions from sight lines, improving the visibility of road traffic signals and 
defaultincreas
defaulting the audibility of train horns,
default 
defaultmay be more appropriate and cost effective. The rail industry, through 
defaultNetwork Rail
default,
default is taking a number of steps to achieve further safety improvements, including:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAccidents are not just caused by technical or physical problems at the location, but also by user b
defaultehaviour which the rail industry has sometimes little or no ability to influence. 
default Pedestrians and car users take risks and make misjudgements. 
defaultWe look forward to the publication of research into user behaviour by the Rail Safety and Standards Board next y
defaultear. We hope any cost-effective recommendations will be implemented without unnecessary delay. 
defaultHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe rail industry uses s
defaultophisticated models 
default(e.g. the 
defaultRSSB’s
default Precursor Indicator Model) 
defaultto understand the risks it manages and to prioritise risk reduction.
default 
defaultFurther improving safety at level crossings should 
defaultremain 
defaulta priority given they 
defaultremain a significant
default train accident risk on
default 
defaultthe railway
default. The 
defaultGovernment’s 2012 High Level Output Statement 
defaultma
defaultde
default a
default welcome
default ring-fenced provision of £65m over Control Period 5 i
defaultn accordance with advice from
default the
default ORR
default.
default 
default10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe benefits resulting 
defaultfrom improvements to level crossings are not limited to 
defaultincreased safety and reduced risk. For the railway, improvements can lead to quicker journey times through fewer speed restrictions and lower maintenance and staffing costs (depending on the improvement made). At the same time there are often
default benefits to r
defaultoad users, in the form of reduced delays and a better flow of traffic. Given the benefits of improvements are shared between rail and road and that 
defaultl
defaultevel crossing accidents tend to 
defaultinvolve road users and 
defaultpedestrians rather than rail passengers
default, 
defaultthere 
defaultis 
defaulta 
defaultstrong 
defaultcase for 
defaultusing the
default roads budget 
defaultto supplement the existing commitment from
default 
defaultthe 
defaultrail budget
default to fund further improvements.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?default11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultYes. 
defaultNetwork Rail has 
defaultdemonstrably
default increased the focus it places on improving safety at level crossings.  As noted above,
default defaultNetwork Rail is on-target to meet its 25% reduction in level crossing risk over Control Period 4 (CP4) 2009-14
default and
default 
defaulthas 
defaultcommitted to achieve 
defaulta 
defaultfurther 25% reduction in l
defaultevel crossing risk 
defaultby 2019. We welcome this continued commitment and focus
default.
default&#xa0;defaultIs Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?default&#xa0;default12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ORR makes conclusions and recommendations about the performance of Network Rail in its 
defaulta
defaultnnual Health and Safety Report, but does not provide enough detailed information to judge whether their activity is ‘adequate’. The fact that Britain compares favou
defaultrably to European comparators and Network Rail is delivering against 
defaultits
default targets 
defaultdoes 
defaultsuggest that UK arrangements are working
default well.
default 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ORR 
defaulthas set out its policy on level crossings and has produced 
defaultdetailed helpful 
defaultguidance on the safe management, 
defaultoperation, modification and use level crossings for managers, designers and operators.
default We agree with the ORR that
default impro
defaultving safety at level crossings
default should not be a solely rail industry responsibility
default,
default but needs to involve traffic authorities and other relevant organisations.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe ORR does occasionally use its formal powers to ensure compliance with the law or deal with immediate risk. For example, they completed a 
defaultsuccessful 
defaultprosecution of Network Rail
default for a 
defaultf
defaultailure to address concerns about sighting at a level crossing, resulting in the death of pedestrian using a footpath
default,
default for which Network Rail were fined £356
default,
default250.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s 2012 High Level Output Statement stated that: 
default‘the Secretary of Sta
defaultte wishes the industry to reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings and is making a ring-fenced funding provision for this purpose.’
default 
defaultWe welcome the ring-fencing of £6
default5
defaultm between 2014 and 2019  for this purpose. 
defaultHow should the legislation governing defaultlevel crossings be updated?default16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission are 
defaultreviewing the law relating to level crossings, which they describe as 
default‘complex, outdated and difficult to access, creating problems for regulators, owners and operators and incr
defaulteasing the safety risk for users.
default 
defaultA
default consultation paper
default 
defaultwas published in July 2010, followed by a four month consultation period. T
defaulthe Law Commission’s website
default states that 
defaultParliamentary counsel have drafted a Bill and Regulations to give effect to their reco
defaultmmendations and a report containing the recommendations will published in the autumn.
default defaultWe expect the Law Commission will 
defaultrecommend
default a consolidation and simplification of existing 
defaultlegislation
default and 
defaulthope that 
defaultthe new legislative framework will encourage 
defaultgreater 
defaultcollaboration between rail and road authorities in managing level crossing risk. 
defaultIt is frustrating that progress has not been quicker.
defaultHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?default17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNetwork Rail 
defaultundertakes national and local p
defaultublic 
defaultawareness activity
default, including at level crossing sites
default.
default 
defaultWe believe there is scope for 
defaultjoint
default work
defaulting and campaigns
default with bodies 
defaultwith experience of road safety public awareness
default (e.g. local authorities, Think!,
default and
default the police) 
defaultbecause Netw
defaulto
defaultrk Rail does not have
default sole responsibility for safety at level crossings.
default Campaigns should be targeted at the most vulnerable users
default – irregular 
defaultand
default irregular users -
default based on the evidence.
