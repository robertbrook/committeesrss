"&#xa0;\nOAR0016Written evidence submitted by the Prisoner Education Trust (PET)/Prisoner Learning Alliance (PLA) IntroductionOfsted’s findings relating to prisons -\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nraining and education \nis not\n enough \nof a \npriority\n for prison governors and other senior staff. Accoun\ntability for the quality \nof\n provision is weak and must be addressed urgently\n(p.6).\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe quality of learning and skills work in \nprisons\n was poor. It had the largest proportion of inadequate provision across the whole of the FE and skills sector. \nIn prisons, \n‘leadership and managemen\nt of learning and skills and work’\n was judged\n to be inadequate or as requires improvement in 22 (58%) of the 38 prison reports published by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (p.10).\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrison r\negimes often disrupted learning and work \nrelated activities, r\nesulting in poor attendance and punctuality.\n Furthermore, t\nake-up of pro\nvision in English and math\ns was often very low compared with the leve\nl of need assessed at induction\n. \nOverall, far too few prisons were preparing prisoners adequately for resettlement \nand employment with good quality education and training.\n (p.11). \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite Ofsted’s negative findings, they also saw \npockets of excellent pra\nctice in prisons (p.11)\n. The most effective provision was vocational training where the prison worked in close partn\nership with employers.\nPLA evidence in response to Ofsted’s findingsOfsted’s\n finding\ns\n \nmust\n be seen within the context of\n unprecedented change and\n reforms \nwithin the Criminal Justice System.
