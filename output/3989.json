"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Nicholas Lewis (IPC0017) I am an independent, self-funded climate \nscience \nresearcher. In recent years I have specialised in the key area of climate \nsensitivity. My work has been published in the peer reviewed literature and is cited and discussed in the IPCC\n’\ns Fifth Assessment Report\n (AR5)\n.\n I was an expert reviewer of AR5.\nare unreliable\n and/or unable to provide usefully well-constrained estimates\n. I \nagree with\n this conclusion.\n That\n leaves in essence only\n estimates based on \nobservations of warming over \nmulti-decadal periods\n. Useful surface temperature records extend back approximately 150 years (the \n‘\ninstrumental period\n’\n). However, \nglobal warming ‘in the pipeline’\n is predominantly reflected in ocean heat uptake, calculated from changes in sub-surface temperatures, records of\n which extend back only 50 years.\nThis last \napproach \nrepresents poor design\n. It is impossible to estimate aerosol forcing \n– which largely affects the northern hemisphere –\nwith any accuracy without separate \ntemperature \ndata for, at a minimum, \nthe \nnorth\nern\n and south\nern\n hemispheres. \nare eliminated from the assessment,\n the average ECS for those that remain\n is, at 1.8°C, \nconsiderably\n lower than the GCM average of 3.2°C, but close to the energy-budget \nbest \nestimate of 1.7°C that was outlined in the last paragraph. \nis unscientific.\nDecember\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nObservationally-based methods\n involve some limited use of models.\n In the form of a weight given to each possible value for it.\n The posterior takes the form of a probability distrib\nution for the property of interest rather than a point estimate.\n \nSuch a prior is not a representation of an understanding of the likely value of \nwhat is being estimated\n, but is simply a prior calculated to give an objective answer.\n Incorrectly in two c\nases.\n \nWhen, as is very much the case for ECS, the parameter involved does not have a straight line relationship with the observational data from which it is being estimated, a uniform prior generally prevents the estimate fairly reflecting the data.\n \nht\ntp://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2013/1/25/uniform-priors-and-the-ipcc.html\n \nUsing a mathematical, \nnoninformative\n,\n prior\n.\n T\nhe top of the 5-95% range for the study\n’\ns ECS estimate\n as given in Table 9.3 of AR4-WG1.\n WG1 report, \nFigure 10.20.b)\n.\n Forster and Gregory 2006 used standard non-Bayesian statistics, which are intrinsically objective and (as often the case) gave the same results as using an objective Bayesian method.\nA critical analysis \nthat I wrote \nof Instrumental and Combination ECS es\ntimates shown in Figure 10.20.b) of AR5-WG1 is available at: http://niclewis.wordpress.com/ipcc-ar5-climate-sensitivity-and-other-issues/ar5_ecs_estimates/. \nLikewise an\n analysis of TCR estimates shown in Figure 10.20.a) of AR5-WG1 is available at http://ni\nclewis.wordpress.com/ipcc-ar5-climate-sensitivity-and-other-issues/ar5_tcr_estimates/\n 17–83% probability\n In other words, the average of the GCM estimates and their range (which was interpreted conservatively).\n In principle, studies that used observat\nional data to form their own estimate of the aerosol effect would be unaffected by a revision in the consensus estimate of it. However, in practice all such climate sensitivity studies featured in AR4 were badly flawed in other ways. \n The method involves comparing changes in the average levels of three key variables between two multi-year periods, normally one early in the instrumental period and one at the end of it.\n \nBased on \n(a) \nthe AR5 best estimates of the \ncombined \nwarming/coolin\ng strength (forcing) of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other agents over the instrumental period, and of ocean heat uptake\n; (b)\n using the longest principal global surface temperature dataset\n; and (c)\n \nmeasuring \nchanges between multi-year periods early in an\nd at the end of the instrumental period with similar volcanic activity\n.\n \n.\n \nReferences herein to best estimates are to medians (50% probability points) unless otherwise stated.\n \nAldrin\n et al. (2012) (the estimate of which was, exceptionally, not significa\nntly affected by the subjective Bayesian method used); Ring et al. (2012) (average of four estimates); Otto et al. (2013) (averaging the 2000-2009 and 1970-2009 period estimates); and Lewis (2013) (preferred main results estimate). \n Taking median estimat\nes from Schwartz (2012), Gillett et al. (2013) and (averaging the 2000-2009 and 1970-2009 period estimates) Otto et al. (2013). \nAldrin\n et al. (2012) and Lewis (2013) did not provide ranges for TCR, but their ECS estimates imply TCR best estimates below 1.4\n°C. \n \n2016–2035 relative to 1986-2005\n \nTol\n, R. 2009.
