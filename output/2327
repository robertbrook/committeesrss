[normal]Sky welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Committee’s inquiry on 
[normal]Women and Sport
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As the Committee highlights t
[normal]here are 
[normal]a 
[normal]number
[normal] of 
[normal]factors that 
[normal]influence
[normal] levels of participation in women’
[normal]s
[normal] sport 
[normal]ranging from awareness to

[normal]. F
[normal]or the pu
[normal]rposes of this response we 
[normal]have

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a subscription
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]broadcaster in over 11 million UK home
[normal]s we understand the importance
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]of
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]providing a service that caters for
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]all our customers’ interests. In
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]depth and comp
[normal]rehensive
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]coverage of all sport
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]has been a key part of that
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]offering for over 20 years and
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]women’s
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]sport is an integral part of our sports
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]offering.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We also understand that c
[normal]overage 
[normal]of female 
[normal]sport
[normal]ing events
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]a 
[normal]valuable 
[normal]role to p
[normal]lay in 
[normal]raising 
[normal]awareness and 
[normal]framing perceptions of women in 
[normal]sport
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Sky’s
[normal] 
[normal]6 
[normal]Sports and Sports News channels
[normal] are watched by 6 million women per month and provide
[normal] an effective platf
[normal]orm for women’s sport, creating
[normal] 
[normal]opportunities to showcase sports 
[normal]and reach 
[normal]new 
[normal]fans and 
[normal]participants
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]a
[normal]lso
[normal] 
[normal]believe that 
[normal]we can 
[normal]inspir
[normal]e engagement by women by
[normal] showing all sport (
[normal]men’s, women’s and mixed) in 
[normal]exciting and relev
[normal]ant format
[normal]s
[normal] that 
[normal]are
[normal] inclusive and appealing
[normal] to all
[normal].
[normal] This includes 
[normal]having women presenters, reporters and athletes 
[normal]telling the story
[normal],
[normal] re
[normal]inforcing the perception of 
[normal]sport
[normal] 
[normal]as
[normal] a
[normal] mainstream interest for women as well as
[normal] men
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ability of s
[normal]ports 
[normal]bodies 
[normal]to invest 
[normal]in their sport 
[normal]and 
[normal]opportunities for women to access sport
[normal], both
[normal] at elite and grass-root level 
[normal]also a play
[normal] role in influencing levels of 
[normal]female participation
[normal]. 
[normal]Sky has been one of the leading investors in sport
[normal] for over two decades
[normal] 
[normal]not only through 
[normal]the 
[normal]inve
[normal]stment 
[normal]we make in acquiring 
[normal]rights
[normal] and airtime
[normal] every year
[normal] but through 
[normal]promotion 
[normal]and 
[normal]partnership
[normal] with 
[normal]sports 
[normal]governing bodies
[normal], 
[normal]as well 
[normal]as 
[normal]the creation of
[normal] our own initiatives to encourage
[normal] 
[normal]participation
[normal] and support athletes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To that end 
[normal]our approach 
[normal]to women and sport 
[normal]encompasses not just 
[normal]show
[normal]ing
[normal] women’s sport but 
[normal]showing all 
[normal]sport 
[normal]in a
[normal] 
[normal]universally appealing way
[normal], as well as supporting women in sport, investing in the future of women’s sport and encouraging more women an
[normal]d girls to get involved.

[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Television
[normal] 
[normal]provides
[normal] a
[normal] powerful
[normal] 
[normal]means of showcasing and 
[normal]stimulating 
[normal]interest in sport. 
[normal]B
[normal]eyond 
[normal]coverage of the sport itself
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]sports programming
[normal] is able to
[normal] 
[normal]provide a wealth of 
[normal]in
[normal]-
[normal]depth 
[normal]analysis and commentary that draws the viewer 
[normal]in and grows
[normal] their understanding and connection
[normal] with a sport
[normal]. 
[normal]This in turn can 
[normal]become
[normal] 
[normal]a catalyst 
[normal]for participation, 
[normal]inspiring
[normal] 
[normal]ambitions
[normal] 
[normal]to emulate 
[normal]sporting heroes
[normal] or 
[normal]simply 
[normal]encouraging

[normal] in for fun

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of our wide-ranging sports offering 
[normal]Sky Sports 
[normal]show
[normal]s
[normal] an extensive amount and variety 
[normal]of women’s sports programming
[normal],
[normal] c
[normal]onsisting
[normal] of
[normal] a rich mixt
[normal]ure
[normal] of
[normal] 
[normal]live sport
[normal], 
[normal]highlights, support shows
[normal] and news
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]As part of our schedule we show women’s sport every month
[normal], so
[normal] far this year that has included
[normal] 
[normal]coverage across 
[normal]more than 
[normal]200 days
[normal]. T
[normal]his 
[normal]airtime 
[normal]provides a valuable 
[normal]showcas
[normal]e for 
[normal]a wide variety of 
[normal]women’s 
[normal]sport
[normal]  and has included
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This is in addition to the news and results reports we carry on a regular basis. As Europe’s leading 24 hour sports news service, Sky Sports News will as a matter of course carry results of women’s matches. Where editorially appropriate the Sky News team a
[normal]lso cover news stories around women’s sport and sportspeople. For example, following on from their 
[normal]victory
[normal] in the Ashes
[normal],
[normal] Sky Sports News intervie
[normal]wed members of the team on set
[normal] about how their success can be built on at a grass roots level. Similarly in the
[normal] last year Sky Sports News’ half hour documentary series, Special Report, has included profiles of 
[normal]Caroline Wozniacki
[normal], Petra Kvitova, Katie Taylor, Chemmy Alcott, Jess Ennis-Hill, Perri Shakes-Drayton, Christine Ohuruogu, Equality Games, Paula Radcliffe an
[normal]d the marathon. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]  As part of International Women’s Day Sky Sports News also committed to a week of coverage on women’s sport. Programming included a live debate with Judy Murray and Laura Trott, an extensive number of interviews with sportswomen includin
[normal]g Gail Emms and Karen Brown 
[normal]as well as the 
[normal]Chair of 
[normal]the Youth Sport Trust, 
[normal]Baroness Sue Campbell.
[normal] 
[normal]Sky Sports News 
[normal]will 
[normal]also 
[normal]shortly be launching 
[normal]Sportswomen,
[normal] 
[normal]a new
[normal] weekly half hour magazine programme dedicated to 
[normal]coverage of women in the sporting arena
[normal]. It 
[normal]will 
[normal]provide a round-up of the latest news and results, 
[normal]explore key
[normal] sporting issues from a female perspective and include inspirational sporting women as studio guests.
[normal] The first show will feature former England football manager, Hope Powell and as pa
[normal]rt of ‘My Life in Sport’,
[normal] a regular
[normal] 
[normal]feature 
[normal]profiling women wo
[normal]rking 
[normal]in sport, 
[normal] viewers will be able to 
[normal]go
[normal] 
[normal]behind the scenes
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] the 
[normal]England netball team as they prepare for their International Test Series against South Africa
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, 
[normal]whilst it
[normal] i
[normal]s important that women’s sport is 
[normal]appropriately 
[normal]represented in 
[normal]programming
[normal], sports coverage
[normal] does
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t have 
[normal]exclusively 
[normal]to 
[normal]involve
[normal] women to engage and inspire
[normal] them
[normal]. We know this because o
[normal]ur female viewers also enjoy coverage of m
[normal]en’s sports
[normal], for example the 
[normal]Manch
[normal]ester United v Chelsea Premier L
[normal]eague match
[normal] on 26
[normal]th
[normal] August
[normal] saw an average audien
[normal]ce of roughly 2.6m of which 800,000
[normal] were female.

[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Having 
[normal]female presenters and sportswomen 
[normal]as part of the team 
[normal]tell
[normal]ing
[normal] the story is an important aspect in making all sport relevant and more engaging to 
[normal]female 
[normal]viewers.
[normal] Seeing 
[normal]knowledgeable 
[normal]women presenting and commenting on all types of sport sends a positive message that sport is very much a 
[normal]mainstream 
[normal]interest and pursuit for women. 
[normal] 
[normal]As a broadcaster, i
[normal]t also makes sense to 
[normal]use the best talent
[normal] a
[normal]ble to talk expertly and passionately about sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Female reporters, presenters and production staff have been 
[normal]key 
[normal]members of the Sky Sports team
[normal] for
[normal] over 
[normal]20 year
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]R
[normal]e
[normal]porters and presenters such as Vicky Gomersall, Natalie Sawyer, Alex Hammond, Anna Woolhouse and Orla Chen
[normal]naoui 
[normal]cover 
[normal]a range of 
[normal]female and male
[normal] sport
[normal]s
[normal] and 
[normal]provide 
[normal]in-
[normal]depth knowledge and expertise
[normal].
[normal] For example
[normal] 
[normal]Orla Chennaoui 
[normal]presented our male and female Olympics coverage last year and 
[normal]will be heading up our coverage of
[normal] 
[normal]the men’s and 
[normal]women’s cycling 
[normal]World Road Racing Championships 
[normal]later this month
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This approach is also reflected 
[normal]on 
[normal]Sky Sports 
[normal]where 
[normal]Natalie Pinkham 
[normal]is a 
[normal]central
[normal] member of the F1 team,
[normal] whilst
[normal] Sarah
[normal]-
[normal]Jane Mee 
[normal]appears on 
[normal]Cricket AM
[normal], 
[normal]Saturday Night Football
[normal] and Sky News,
[normal] and
[normal] Hayley McQueen is part of the C
[normal]hampions League
[normal] team
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]omen 
[normal]also 
[normal]occupy 
[normal]several 
[normal]senior production roles 
[normal]at Sky Sports News
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]Karen Will
[normal]mington
[normal], 
[normal]is head of studio output and has been studio director for 
[normal]Soccer Saturday
[normal] for more than 15 years, 
[normal]Mel
[normal]issa
[normal] Bartlett, 
[normal]is a Senior 
[normal]Director
[normal],
[normal] and Helen Kemp, is the Resources and Facilities M
[normal]anager, in charge of camera crews, satellite 
[normal]trucks and regional bureaus.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sky Sports coverage also includes contributions from female experts, 
[normal]on both women and men’s sports, 
[normal]for example 
[normal]w
[normal]omen rugby players are frequently invited to disc
[normal]uss women’s rugby matches and 
[normal]Maggie Alphonsie
[normal] has been a guest on The Rugby Club discussing the Game. 
[normal] 
[normal]Charlotte Edwards 
[normal]also 
[normal]recently 
[normal]appeared as a guest expert with David Gower during the third men’s Ashes Test in August 2013.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sports 
[normal]bodies’ 
[normal]ability 
[normal]to 
[normal]foster 
[normal]talent
[normal], develop training infrastructure, 
[normal]pro
[normal]vide
[normal] opportunities to participate 
[normal]and promote themselves 
[normal]is also essential to attracting more women
[normal] into sport. 
[normal]W
[normal]e believe that 
[normal]partnerships between broadcasters and sporting bodies 
[normal]provide
[normal] 
[normal]the opportunity for a much deeper 
[normal]supportive 
[normal]relationship
[normal] 
[normal]affording
[normal] 
[normal]not just 
[normal]the 
[normal]opportunity to grow sports
[normal] using 
[normal]funding derived
[normal] from sports rights, bu
[normal]t working together to promote 
[normal]a 
[normal]sport
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst it is up to the governing bodies how they invest in their
[normal] sports we believe that our commitment and support has resulted in 
[normal]real benefits
[normal] for 
[normal]both 
[normal]women’s 
[normal]and men’s 
[normal]sport.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For example our support for women’s 
[normal]cricket spans 16 years 
[normal]and 
[normal]encompasses
[normal] more coverage than any
[normal] other broadcaster
[normal]. 
[normal]The quality and volume of coverage 
[normal]has given the sport a platform that had not previously existed, 
[normal]bringing it to 
[normal]the attention 
[normal]of 
[normal]the next generation of 
[normal]female cricketers
[normal]. Our commitment to the sport 
[normal]means more than just 
[normal]broadcasting the live sport. We al
[normal]so spend time and effort 
[normal]working to promote it
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]f
[normal]or example in the 
[normal]build-up
[normal] to the 
[normal]ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup
[normal],
[normal] Sky held a media day for the women’s team which resulted in a large amount of news coverage in both the front and back pages of the 
[normal]national 
[normal]press. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sky’s commitment also 
[normal]encompass
[normal]es
[normal] support through partnership. 
[normal]In October 2006, Sky Sports and the ECB teamed up to launch the Sky Sports ECB Coach Education Programme, a scheme building on the successes of the ECB’s previous coaching initiatives
[normal] and designed to equip coaches with the necessary skills to deliver high quality coaching programmes at all levels of the game. Since the scheme began over 50,000 coaching certificates have been awarded and a large number of these have been awarded to fema
[normal]le coaches, helping to create and inspire younger generations of female cricketers and coaches to take up the game.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly, o
[normal]ur 
[normal]partnership with British Cycling supports female
[normal] as well as male elite cyclists
[normal] and w
[normal]e are immensely proud of 
[normal]the exceptional progress made by 
[normal]the Great Britain team and particularly the 
[normal]elite female riders, who since 2008 have won 10 medals across two 
[normal]Olympic 
[normal]Games
[normal], inspiring women across the UK to ride their bikes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We also work closely with women’s golf and 
[normal]so f
[normal]ar this year 
[normal]we have 
[normal]work
[normal]ed
[normal] with 
[normal]a number of 
[normal]women golfers to build their profile and 
[normal]promote 
[normal]major tournaments
[normal] such as the
[normal] Kraft Nabisco Championship, the Solheim Cup and the Evian Championships
[normal], 
[normal]providing greater 
[normal]exposure
[normal] to the game
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]More directly, 
[normal]our S
[normal]ky Sports Scholarships scheme 
[normal]helps
[normal] 
[normal]young athletes
[normal] realise their potential in competition and beyond. It
[normal] offers assistance through financial support, media training and mentoring in order to help with the day to day realities 
[normal]of life
[normal] as a professional 
[normal]athlete
[normal] and will hopefully create sporting role models of the future.
[normal]  
[normal]In August 2013 we announced the latest 12 scholarships which included 7 
[normal]female athletes encompassing
[normal] a diverse range of women’s sports
[normal] and 
[normal]backgrounds
[normal] 
[normal]including
[normal] 
[normal]Savan
[normal]nah Marshall, 
[normal]a boxer from Hartlepool, 
[normal]Holly Bleasdale, 
[normal]a pole vaulter from Preston and 
[normal]Elise Christie, a short-course 
[normal]ice-sk
[normal]ater from Livingston
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sky 
[normal]Sports 
[normal]has also
[normal] announced its commitment to
[normal] the celebration of women
[normal] in
[normal] sport
[normal] through our sponsorship of
[normal] the Sunday Times Sportswomen o
[normal]f the Year 
[normal]Awards.
[normal] 
[normal]The awards showcase
[normal] 
[normal]the outstanding contributions to sport 
[normal]made 
[normal]by 
[normal]female 
[normal]athletes, coaches, administrators and community volunteers
[normal]. O
[normal]ver the next few months
[normal] Sky will 
[normal]be h
[normal]ighlighting their achievements
[normal] as 
[normal]well as 
[normal]host
[normal]ing
[normal] and broadcast
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] awards ceremony in December
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our 
[normal]position as a broadcaster enables
[normal] us to inspire our customers
[normal] 
[normal]to get involved
[normal] in sport
[normal]. 
[normal]While we do support 
[normal]some
[normal] initiatives 
[normal]spec
[normal]ifically fo
[normal]cused 
[normal]on women
[normal],
[normal] our 
[normal]primary 
[normal]focus is 
[normal]gender neutral as we be
[normal]lieve that exciting and appealing opportunities to participate
[normal] or 
[normal]be 
[normal]inspirational 
[normal]mentors have universal appeal
[normal] and can be effective in encouraging more women 
[normal]and girls 
[normal]to participate in sport.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]Sky Sports Living for Sport is a free UK secondary schools initiative that uses life-changing stories and expertise of athlete mentors to motivate and inspire young people. 
[normal]37
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 74 
[normal]mentors in the scheme are women
[normal], 
[normal]with
[normal] 
[normal]sportswomen 
[normal]such as
[normal] Jess Ennis
[normal]-
[normal]H
[normal]ill
[normal] 
[normal]and Katie Taylor 
[normal]representing strong
[normal] female role 
[normal]models
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Nevertheless, we are 
[normal]also 
[normal]conscious that all the 
[normal]inspirational 
[normal]sportspeople
[normal] 
[normal]we work with have the ability to encourage 
[normal]girls to take up sport
[normal], David Beckham being a case in point.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our partnership with British Cycling began in 2008 and included an ambition to inspire one million people to cycle more regularly. This objective was achieved in October 2012 of which 345,000 women have been inspired to cycle. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Through Sky Ride, our grassr
[normal]oots programme, we are creating routes and rides to attract more families into cycling through free mass participation cycling events and weekend rides. Our high profile Sky Ride ambassadors like Lorraine Kelly and Edith Bowman have helped us raise awarene
[normal]ss of the benefits for cycling for fun, fitness and health. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus our support and promotion of the British Cycling stars like Laura Trott and Shanaze Reade has provided a catalyst for growth in cycling participation with 40% more women commuting since 2008
[normal] and over 35% of the young people on our Go Ride Club partnership being girls. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We 
[normal]are proud to 
[normal]support Breeze, 
[normal]which is 
[normal]British Cycling’s volunteer-organised, led-ride programme that addresses the key barriers women face when considering cycling. Over 16
[normal],000 women have joined this network, reaching 200 local authorities across England. 
[normal]W
[normal]e will continue to support British Cycling with their ambition to inspire one million more women to ride by 2020, improving cycling for women at every level, whether as a 
[normal]sport or recreational activity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Sky also carries programming which is aimed at encouraging 
[normal]women and girls’
[normal] grassroots participation in sport. Two noteworthy examples include:
