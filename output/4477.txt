&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Plan UK &#xa0;1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This submission provides evidence of the need to focus on children with disabilities in development, especially those facing triple discrimination due to their age, gender and disability. It provides evidence from Plan’s research and programmes in developing countries around disability, education and health in order to make recommendations for future action. This submission calls for the UK government to:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Develop a disability strategy -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure all children with disabilities have access to a quality education -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure all children with disabilities are protected from violence-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Ensure all children with disabilities can meaningfully participate in the decisions that affect them -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Promote and lead on developing better data and information about the lives of children with disabilities&#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Plan is a global children’s charity. We work with children in 48 of the world’s poorest countries across three continents to help them build a better future. For 76 years we’ve been taking action and standing up for every child’s right to fulfil their potential by giving children a healthy start in life, including access to safe drinking water. Alongside securing the education of girls and boys, working with communities to prepare for and survive disasters and protecting children from abuse and exploitation. We are also inspiring children to take a lead in decisions that affect their lives and enabling families to earn a living and plan for their children’s future. &#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Plan UK is a rights-based organisation and believes it is every child’s right to have a quality education. This belief reflects the statements articulated in Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which states that persons with disabilities should not be excluded from the general education system on the basis of disability, and persons with disabilities have the right to access an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the communities in which they live. Article 32 of the 

[[[Convention on the Rights of Pe]]]

[[[ople with disabilities ]]]calls for states to ensure that international cooperation, including international development programmes, are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities. This highlights the need for DFID to ensure a disability strategy is in place across their programmes. &#xa0;2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Children with disabilities are often at a double disadvantage, being marginalised and discriminated against because of both their age and their disability. Children are more vulnerable as they are not yet fully developed physically or cognitively. Girls and women with disabilities in particular are at risk when factors such as gender and poverty increase their vulnerability and marginalisation. There is therefore a need for a specific focus on both girls and boys within a disability-inclusive development agenda. Note that experiences of disadvantage are not homogeneous across all girls and boys with disabilities, but are strongly mediated by the type of disability. For example, Plan research in Sierra Leone showed that children with mobility impairments incurred due to war injuries suffered less discrimination than children with epilepsy or mental impairments. &#xa0;2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Plan receives DFID funding through a Programme Partnership Arrangement (PPA) and for a Girls Education Challenge (GEC) fund project in Sierra Leone. The evidence and recommendations on disability integration within DFID will be framed in relation the Girls Education Challenge Fund. Wider research from Plan programmes contributes towards the evidence used to support the recommendations. Plan’s DFID funded GEC programme in Sierra Leone focusses on reaching the most marginalised groups, including children with disabilities. The need to reach out to these groups is clear. We will work with 2,052 children with disabilities through partnering with Handicap International (HI), over the three years of the project. It is the largest programme HI have been involved in for children with disabilities in Sierra Leone. DFID has said repeatedly that they class the project as innovative due to this element on disability, which reflects the lack of other projects either specifically targeting or mainstreaming disabled groups in this way. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Globally, children with disabilities are more likely to experience violence and abuse than children without disabilities. Research conducted in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia by the African Child Policy Forum, found that the almost 1,000 young people with disabilities had universally experienced, at a minimum, sexual harassment and emotional violence during their childhood. The perpetrators of violence were often members of their extended family or their peers, making the home and school often unsafe spaces for children with disabilities. The African Child Policy Forum research found that across the entire sexual violence category, girls and boys with disabilities were equally likely to suffer sexual violence once or twice (28% of all cases), but girls were far more likely to suffer sexual violence more than 10 times (28%) than boys (16%).&#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Children with disabilities are less likely to attend school, Plan’s new report Include Us!, which conducted research using data from Plan’s sponsored children, concluded the following about the realities faced by children with disabilities in comparison to those without:  they are substantially less likely to attend school, will experience a poorer education when in school, and are much more likely to have had a serious illness in the last 12 months, including malnutrition. Children with disabilities who do attend school are generally more likely to be overage for their grade than their non disabled peers;  research shows that this is often a precursor to drop out.  Within most countries, inclusion levels for children with disabilities in schooling were highest for those with vision or hearing impairments and lowest for those with learning, physical or communication impairments. This indicates that the level of exclusion can be linked to the type of impairment. More research is required to better determine and understand the relationships between type of impairment and school access. 3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; Plan’s baseline research for the Girls Education Challenge Fund programme in five districts in Sierra Leone (to be published) found that girls with disabilities experience poorer educational outcomes, school attendance, and retention, than those without disabilities, further legitimizing the need to focus on girls with disabilities  in and outside of education.&#xa0;3.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; A study from Plan Nepal showed that children with disabilities face specific challenges in accessing health and education services, due to structural, physical and attitudinal barriers. A Plan study from West Africa in Togo, Sierra Leone, Niger and Guinea, found that stigma and discrimination against children with disabilities from parents, teachers, community members and policy-makers hinders their access to education and protection services. Similar findings were made through research in Guatemala.&#xa0;3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; It is also crucial to note that children with disabilities are more vulnerable in disaster situations, and in these contexts are at increased risk of violations of their rights to protection, education and participation.   &#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Access to sexual and reproductive health services can be restricted for persons with disabilities. Disabled people are often assumed not to be sexually active, are not believed if they report sexual violence, and are often not appropriately involved in decisions about their sexual and reproductive health. People with learning disabilities and difficulties can face additional or heightened risks: such as, higher risks of sexual abuse, assault and rape, lower access to services, support, or redress, and forced sterilisation. Disabled children are also much more likely to suffer sexual violence and girls with disabilities are even more vulnerable.  Furthermore lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services has greater impact upon girls and women.&#xa0;4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; For every woman who dies as a result of pregnancy related complications, some twenty others face serious or long-lasting consequences. Harmful practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM), early and forced marriage, as well as poor sexual and reproductive health including high and frequent fertility can result in disabilities including obstetric fistula and uterine prolapse.  Currently an estimated 2 million women in Asia and Sub Saharan Africa live with untreated fistula. According to a WHO multi-country study of 30,000 women on the obstetric effects of FGM, the relative risk of adverse maternal outcomes increased for women with FGM I, II or II as compared to women without FGM. Risks seem to be greater with more extensive FGM.&#xa0;4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Sexual Violence]]]: The risk of depression and anxiety is three to four times higher for those who have experienced gender-based violence, and around a third of all survivors of rape experience Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.  Sexual violence can result in acute and chronic physical disabilities, for example severe pain during menstruation or prolonged menstrual bleeding, as well as long term genital-anal trauma and sexually transmitted infections.&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; Plan UK recognises the work DFID has done on disability in the last 10 years, DFID’s work has placed the issue on the global development agenda. This would be strengthened by a strategy for the integration of disability issues across all its projects. DFID’s recent commitments on disability are welcomed by Plan UK as they are an important signal to developing country partners and other donors to prioritise disabled people. Plan has seen this commitment through its GEC programme funding. &#xa0;5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Plan’s GEC programme interventions focus on poor rural girls, within this group, girls with disabilities are more marginalised with 76% estimated to be out of school due to discrimination, stigma and a lack of inclusive education opportunities, adequately trained teachers or accessible facilities. &#xa0;5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; The Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) approach involves the whole community to foster educational inclusion. Disability will be mainstreamed through all interventions and accessibility needs addressed in terms of materials, communication and venue selection where relevant. It is assumed that children with disabilities are even less likely to reach the end of primary School and make the transition to junior secondary school, and therefore most of the direct support for disabled children with focus on their enrolling/re-enrolling in Primary.  &#xa0;5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; We are early on in the programme but we have some lessons learnt already, including that working with children with disabilities in a rural setting is a more resource intensive exercise than anticipated. Children with disabilities are often hidden by families, and to ensure their specific needs are met requires specialist expertise and raising community awareness of  the rights of children with disabilities. &#xa0;5.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Case Study:]]] 

[[[Children with disabilities]]]

[[[ pushed out of school]]]. One child with disability in Kailahun, Sierra Leone was a girl with albinism who had a visual impairment. She was no longer in school. She had hoped to pass junior secondary school three, and was determined to make it as far as the disability would allow. Then, she got pregnant. She told her interviewer, “Yes I have been mistreated sexually and physically and also insulted by my teachers and colleagues in school. When I decided to leave school it was because I was impregnated by some guys I didn't know. Because of my poor eyesight I can’t remember them, so they denied responsibility.” After she became pregnant the school refused to let her continue.

[[[&#xa0;]]]5.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Data: ]]]The number of girls with disabilities reported in Plan’s baseline household survey are likely to be much lower than in reality. This reflects the lack of data available on children with disabilities, due to their exclusion and the underreporting by community members due to stigma and lack of awareness. &#xa0;5.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Attitudes]]]

[[[:]]]

[[[ ]]]Plan’s baseline survey for the GEC was also revealing around non disabled school age girls’ attitudes on the education of children with disabilities. A majority of girls believe it is okay for children who have disabilities not to go to school. 23% of girls who have physical disabilities believe that it is okay for girls like themselves not to get an education. This might indicate the way children with disabilities  are treated in school, if their colleagues do not believe it is important for them to be there, and more than that, are contributing to  perception of themselves as not worthy of being at school. This also illustrates the wider community’s perceptions of the value and capabilities of children with disabilities, much of the internalisation of these perceptions will start at a young age. And demonstrates the importance of home and family education and thee need for parents to accept disabled children and changing attitudes and stigma of parents is the first step to inclusion.

[[[ discrimination and abuse in school ]]]Nearly every single child with disability  interviewed in each district identified verbal and physical harassment as  the main reason for leaving school. Many also said that they (or their parents) had brought the abuse to their teachers’ attention, but intervention (if any) had been ineffective. A girl with disability  in Moyamba noted “only my colleagues would disturb and mock me. I do report to the teachers so the teacher in return will flog the people. My colleagues laugh at me because I am unable to talk, so that made me drop out of school.” Some children with disabilities even described abuse from the teachers themselves.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Overall recommendation: ]]]Plan UK is calling for DFID to develop an overarching disability inclusive development strategy, with focus areas including access to quality education, protection from violence and meaningful participation in decisions and across its work with children with disabilities to focus on those most vulnerable as a result of intersecting inequalities including gender and poverty.&#xa0;6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Disability strategy ]]]Plan UK supports the recommendations made by the Global Campaign for Education and the Bond Disability and Development group for DFID to implement a twin-track approach to disability which would involve: Development of such a strategy must be done through a process of consultation with persons with disabilities, including children. 6.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[education. ]]]A quality education is one that is grounded in respect for human rights and gender equity, that is accessible to all children without discrimination, and one in which all children are encouraged to fulfil their capabilities.  It includes a learning environment that is learner-friendly, safe and healthy for all children with mechanisms to prevent and respond to violence.  A quality education is accountable to children through the participation of children, families and communities in school governance and decision –making. &#xa0;6.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Activities required to ensure this include training for all teachers to ensure they can support the education of children with disabilities. Curriculum adaptation and improved accessibility are also required, alongside raising public awareness on the rights to quality education for all children and initiatives to challenge discrimination against children with disabilities within the school community. Children with disabilities should also have access to 

[[[early childhood care and development ]]](ECCD), which has been shown to provide immense benefits for children throughout life and to help them reach their full potential. Inclusive ECCD is also a critical pathway to education alongside the resources, both material and capacity building needed to integrate inclusive education into all teacher training.&#xa0;6.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[data]]]

[[[ collection]]]

[[[ - ]]]DFID’s focus on the data revolution can be used to address the paucity of data on children with disabilities. Plan supports the recommendation made by UNICEF in its report The State of the World’s Children: Children with Disabilities that for children with disabilities, ‘many of their deprivations stem from and are perpetuated by their invisibility… there is a need for research to render more children visible by improving data collection and analysis’. Research on people with disabilities should be disaggregated by age, gender, location, wealth quintile and type of impairment. This data should be used to track the progress of disadvantaged and marginalised groups across all goals, targets and indicators within the post-2015 framework. The negotiations around the post-2015 development framework are a key moment for the UK government, DFID and FCO to push for this change to data collection within the framework.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Ortoleva, S and Lewis, H.(2012), Forgotten Sisters - A Report on Violence Against Women withDisabilities: An Overview of its Nature, Scope, Causes and Consequences.

Note though that children are selected for sponsorship in various ways, not as a proportionate representation of the wider child population. The data of the research therefore cannot be extrapolated to national populations but does give a solid insight into the different experiences of children with and without disabilities and highlights important areas for future research.
