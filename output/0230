Written evidence submitted by [bold]Metropolitan Police Service[bold] (FSS039)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Declaration[bold]1 This evidence is provided to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee inquiry into the 
[normal]aftermath of the closure of the 
[normal]Forensic Science Service (FSS) by Gary Pugh 
[normal]Director of Forensic Services in 
[normal]the 
[normal]Metropolitan Police Service (MPS)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The MPS employs around 
[normal]950
[normal] forensic staff who undertake over one hundred thousand crime scene examinations a year and produce expert evidence in over 
[normal]5
[normal]0
[normal],
[normal]000 cases across a range 
[normal]of 
[normal]acquisitive, violent and sexually motivated crime. The MPS also hosts the Counter Terrorism forensic databases and 
[normal]contributes 
[normal]to counter terrorist investigations nationally and internationally. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Gary Pugh 
[normal]has over thirty years experience in forensic science
[normal], he
[normal] was part of the team that set up the FSS as an Executive Agency in 1990-91
[normal]. I
[normal]n 1999 he was appointed a Director on the Executive and Main Boards of the FSS. He joined the MPS in May 2001 as Director of Forensic Services. He currently sits as the MPS representative on the Home Office Forensic Policy Group. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Response to the Questions Posed in the Terms of Reference[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the [bold]UK[bold] and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?[bold]3. 
[normal]The simple answer is n
[normal]o
[normal], the forensic landscape in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] is
[normal] fragmented and does 
[normal]not
[normal] have 
[normal]a corporate or strategic 
[normal]approach
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] the development of regulation, innovation or commercialisation of forensic science. 
[normal]A more 
[normal]pertinent
[normal] question 
[normal]might
[normal] be 
[normal]could 
[normal]or 
[normal]should 
[normal]the 
[normal]Government
[normal] have an effective str
[normal]ate
[normal]gy for forensic science in the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]Any 
[normal]strategy
[normal] would need to 
[normal]recognise
[normal] t
[normal]he 
[normal]three very 
[normal]different
[normal] 
[normal]governance
[normal], 
[normal]policy and operational models for forensic 
[normal]science
[normal] 
[normal]delivery
[normal] and dev
[normal]e
[normal]lop
[normal]me
[normal]nt 
[normal]within
[normal] the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]In England and Wales there is
[normal] a
[normal] mixed state and commercial model with 
[normal]limited central coordination
[normal], in Scotland there is a central model 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]state run forensic science service independent of the police and criminal justice agencies incorporating all forensic resources from crime sc
[normal]e
[normal]ne examination 
[normal]through 
[normal]laboratory analysis 
[normal]to 
[normal]expert 
[normal]court 
[normal]evidence, and in Northern Ireland there is a state run forensic science laboratory 
[normal]separate from the
[normal] police service 
[normal]who undertake crime scene a
[normal]nd fingerprint examination. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]. The development of a strategy for forensic science in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] would suggest
[normal] 
[normal]a need to set direction and ensure that forensic science develops to i
[normal]ncrease 
[normal]the 
[normal]offenders brought to 
[normal]justice
[normal] and eliminate the innocent 
[normal]while recognising the constraints on the public finances. 
[normal]There is no doubt that forensic 
[normal]science
[normal] can have a massive impact in comparison to the very small proportion 
[normal]of 
[normal]public 
[normal]funding
[normal] 
[normal]that
[normal] is required to del
[normal]i
[normal]ver 
[normal]this 
[normal]front
[normal] line
[normal] oper
[normal]a
[normal]ti
[normal]on
[normal]al 
[normal]service
[normal].
[normal] In 
[normal]the
[normal] MPS the three 
[normal]sadly
[normal] 
[normal]iconic
[normal] murders of 
[normal]Damilola
[normal] Taylor, Rachel Nickell and Stephen 
[normal]Lawrence
[normal] wer
[normal]e
[normal] all 
[normal]ultimately
[normal] 
[normal]and exclusively 
[normal]solved by forensic 
[normal]science
[normal]. 
[normal]The consequences of not using forensic science effectively or the human and financial cost of failure would argue for some means of ensuring that forensic science provision is stable but innovative, and that the public can have confidence in the results and opinions of forensic practitioners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]The MPS has 
[normal]identified
[normal] 
[normal]four 
[normal]areas for 
[normal]strategic
[normal] 
[normal]capability
[normal] building;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]. These 
[normal]capabilities
[normal] 
[normal]could not only revolutionise the forensic science process but change the operating model for 
[normal]policing
[normal], for example the rapid identification of an offender and making this information available to police re
[normal]s
[normal]po
[normal]n
[normal]se units in the vicinity would increase the 
[normal]chances
[normal] of apprehension, recover
[normal]y of
[normal] stolen property and give rapid access to justice. 
[normal]S
[normal]ecuring 
[normal]t
[normal]he funding and capability to implement such transformational change is a major 
[normal]challenge
[normal] as there is no mean
[normal]s
[normal] to do this within the current Home Office structures and the private sector is unlikely to invest as the returns and scale are low compared to other science and technology based industries. 
[normal]A
[normal] step change in forensic science provision to the “real time forensics” operating model 
[normal]could mean that fingerprint bureau and forensic science laboratories are obsolete and forensic science providers will need to fundamental
[normal]ly
[normal] re-engineer their businesses. However, the harsh 
[normal]reality 
[normal]is 
[normal]that with the current fragile state of forensic science in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] and significant funding pressures the emphasis for strategic management will be on identifying and mitigating risk to 
[normal]continuity of 
[normal]operational delivery and reduced public confidence. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?[bold]8
[normal]. The MPS set out in its submission to the Committee’s inquiry in 2011 that it would implement an operating model where the recovery, interpretation and reporting of forensic evidence w
[normal]ould
[normal] be undertaken by the MPS and the DNA profiling and 
[normal]a
[normal]nalytical 
[normal]services
[normal] continue to be undertaken by the commercial sector. 
[normal]This model has been implemented at the MPS Lambeth site. 
[normal]T
[normal]he MPS agreed a transfer of the accommodation 
[normal]leased
[normal] to the FSS at 
[normal]Lambeth
[normal] back 
[normal]into
[normal] the MPS 
[normal]estate
[normal] an
[normal]d
[normal] the transfer of around 100 staff from the FSS to the MPS under the TUPE 
[normal]legislation
[normal]. 
[normal]There were some FSS staff who were 
[normal]understandabl
[normal]y
[normal] reluctant to transfer given the highly 
[normal]advantageous
[normal] 
[normal]redundancy
[normal] 
[normal]terms
[normal] offered by 
[normal]the
[normal] FSS Board that were twice what the public sector 
[normal]currently
[normal] compensates staff 
[normal]who
[normal] leave on voluntary or compulsory departure. 
[normal]The
[normal] MPS 
[normal]referr
[normal]ed a number of 
[normal]legacy 
[normal]issues
[normal] to the 
[normal]Forensic Science Regulator during the course of establishing forensic science services in the MPS at Lambeth
[normal].
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]The MPS 
[normal]is not aware of the
[normal] Home 
[normal]Office
[normal] 
[normal]budget for the 
[normal]closure
[normal] of the FSS or the final costs of 
[normal]closure
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples[bold])[bold]1
[normal]0
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]e are not aware of a
[normal] 
[normal]significant
[normal] adverse 
[normal]e
[normal]ffect
[normal] of the 
[normal]closure
[normal] of the FSS on any MPS 
[normal]criminal
[normal] investigation
[normal]s
[normal]. 
[normal]There were
[normal] some increases 
[normal]in
[normal] the time 
[normal]taken
[normal] to 
[normal]complete
[normal] 
[normal]forensic
[normal] 
[normal]examinations
[normal] and in some 
[normal]niche
[normal] areas 
[normal]such as forensic toxicology 
[normal]analysis
[normal] and 
[normal]gunshot
[normal] 
[normal]residue
[normal] 
[normal]analysis
[normal] there was 
[normal]limited
[normal] 
[normal]capacity
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] a period. The MPS 
[normal]worked
[normal] 
[normal]closely
[normal] with its commercial 
[normal]providers
[normal] in 
[normal]these areas
[normal] and the 
[normal]capacity
[normal] and 
[normal]capability
[normal] 
[normal]issues
[normal] have 
[normal]been
[normal] 
[normal]resolved
[normal]. 
[normal]Throughout the process of transition the MPS prioriti
[normal]se
[normal]d
[normal] and managed case
[normal]s
[normal] through it
[normal]s
[normal] case management u
[normal]nit to ensure there was continuity
[normal] of forensic science evidence to the courts and that changing priorities and requirements for urgent investigative or trial dates were met. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]MPS suspended its 
[normal]accreditation
[normal] on physically moving re
[normal]s
[normal]ources 
[normal]to Lambeth 
[normal]and making a 
[normal]major
[normal] 
[normal]service
[normal] 
[normal]change
[normal],
[normal] and was 
[normal]subject
[normal] to re-
[normal]instatement
[normal] 
[normal]visit
[normal] in May
[normal] 2012. 
[normal]In 
[normal]October 2012
[normal] UKAS confirmed that the MPS had achieved accreditation for its operating model and service provision at the Lambeth site. Throughout the period of the transfer and establishing forensic science services at Lambeth the MPS 
[normal]continued
[normal] to work to 
[normal]establish
[normal] 
[normal]operating
[normal] 
[normal]procedures
[normal] 
[normal]within
[normal] its Quality 
[normal]Management
[normal] 
[normal]System
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]2
[normal]. With 
[normal]regard
[normal] to 
[normal]research
[normal] the MPS has an 
[normal]established
[normal] relationship 
[normal]with
[normal] Kings College London 
[normal]formalised
[normal] through a 
[normal]Memorandum
[normal] of 
[normal]Understanding
[normal] in 
[normal]2005
[normal]. This has 
[normal]involved
[normal] the MPS taking 6-10 MSc students each year to 
[normal]undertake
[normal] short 
[normal]projects
[normal] in area of mutual interest, to date we have 
[normal]completed
[normal] 
[normal]over one hundred 
[normal]projects
[normal] which have 
[normal]resulted
[normal] in twelve
[normal] 
[normal]published
[normal] 
[normal]scientific
[normal] papers. The MPS also collaborate
[normal]s
[normal] with other 
[normal]universities
[normal] and we are 
[normal]currently
[normal] jointly bi
[normal]d
[normal]ding for 
[normal]research
[normal] funding in the areas of 
[normal]improved
[normal] body 
[normal]fluid
[normal] and DNA 
[normal]detection
[normal], 
[normal]gunshot
[normal] 
[normal]residue
[normal] 
[normal]analysis
[normal] and digital forensics. 
[normal]In recognition of the increased involvement in scientific activity the MPS has 
[normal]established
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]Senior
[normal] Forensic 
[normal]Scientist
[normal] post to 
[normal]coordinate
[normal] its 
[normal]involvement
[normal] in academic 
[normal]research
[normal] and 
[normal]we 
[normal]will 
[normal]strengthen our 
[normal]strategic
[normal] partnership with Kings 
[normal]College
[normal] London. We are 
[normal]also
[normal] 
[normal]currently
[normal] working with two US 
[normal]companies
[normal] to 
[normal]evaluate
[normal] the first 
[normal]prototypes
[normal] of DNA 
[normal]analysis
[normal] that can be 
[normal]conducted
[normal] on-site 
[normal]the so called 
[normal]“DNA in a box”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]e cannot 
[normal]identify
[normal] a 
[normal]product of the FSS 
[normal]research 
[normal]programme in 
[normal]the 
[normal]years 
[normal]prior to closure 
[normal]that has 
[normal]made a significant
[normal] 
[normal]imp
[normal]act on
[normal] the use of forensic 
[normal]science
[normal] in the MPS
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator?[bold]1
[normal]4
[normal]. The role of the Forensic Science Regulator as set out on the Home Office website is to provide independent advice on quality standards to the government and the criminal justice system, i.e. he has no statutory powers to set standards or deal with quality failures. 
[normal]This 
[normal]reflects
[normal] the ori
[normal]gina
[normal]l remit of the 
[normal]Regulator
[normal] on 
[normal]establishing
[normal] this role in 2008. 
[normal]Since then the European 
[normal]Union
[normal] have mandated standards for fingerprint recovery and DNA profiling and in December 2011 the Regulator published the 
[normal]Codes of Practice and Conduct 
[normal]for forensic science providers and practitioners in the Criminal Justice System. Central to these codes are validation of techniques, the demonstration of organisational competence and impartiality. In response to the establishment of the role of the Forensic Science Regulator the Commissioner and MPS Management Board formally endorsed the role of Director of Forensic Services to act as Head of Profession a
[normal]nd to be t
[normal]he senior accountable person 
[normal]to
[normal] ensure that the MPS me
[normal]e
[normal]t
[normal]s
[normal] the standards set by the Regulator. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal]. The or
[normal]i
[normal]g
[normal]i
[normal]nal adv
[normal]i
[normal]sory remit 
[normal]of the 
[normal]Regulator
[normal] 
[normal]now seem
[normal]s
[normal] to be out of step with the 
[normal]development
[normal] of mandated 
[normal]European Union
[normal] standards for 
[normal]forensic
[normal] sci
[normal]ence
[normal], and the expectation that 
[normal]organisations
[normal], 
[normal]including
[normal] 
[normal]police
[normal] forces, are 
[normal]accountable
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] ensuring that 
[normal]accurate
[normal] and 
[normal]reliable
[normal] forensic 
[normal]evidence
[normal] is put before the courts. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Criminal
[normal] 
[normal]Procedure
[normal] Rules, 
[normal]particularly
[normal] Rule 33, are quite 
[normal]cl
[normal]ear on the 
[normal]responsibilities
[normal] of 
[normal]individual
[normal] forensic practi
[normal]tioners
[normal] who act as 
[normal]expert
[normal] witnesses to give unbiased 
[normal]evidence
[normal] 
[normal]within
[normal] their area of expertise. 
[normal]The responsibilities and accountabilities of organisations are less clear, not just forensic science providers but accreditation bodies and criminal justice agencies with no clear primacy or oversight of standard 
[normal]setting, ensuring compliance and referral of individuals or organisations who do not meet the standards. 
[normal]The role of the 
[normal]Regulator
[normal] and by implication other 
[normal]agencies
[normal] needs to be clarified and 
[normal]strengthened
[normal] to ensure that there is clear 
[normal]accountability
[normal] and that 
[normal]standards
[normal] are not only set but maintained. We 
[normal]suggest
[normal] a number of 
[normal]changes
[normal] or 
[normal]improvements
[normal] to the 
[normal]regulatory
[normal] 
[normal]framework
[normal] for forensic 
[normal]science
[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. We are aware that the Regulator has on occasion be
[normal]en
[normal] directly involved in criminal trials and Inquir
[normal]i
[normal]es where there is disputed expert forensic evidence and a need for an independent source of expertise/advice as to what is the current state of knowledge or the accepted consensus within a particular area of expert forensic evidence. In highly complex areas the jury may be overwhelmed by the complexity of expert evidence and we see merit in the Regulator having a role in providing or facil
[normal]itating a balanced view within 
[normal]our adversarial criminal justice system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?[bold]1
[normal]7
[normal]. We can only comment o
[normal]n
[normal] the size of the MPS spend on external forensic science provision which has reduced from c£30 million to an estimated £14 million in 2012-13 following the closure of the FSS and the MPS implementing a differ
[normal]ent
[normal] operating model for forensic science delivery. 
[normal]1
[normal]8
[normal]. We have always work
[normal]ed
[normal] closely 
[normal]with
[normal] our providers
[normal] of 
[normal]forensic
[normal] 
[normal]science
[normal] services at an 
[normal]operational
[normal] and Board 
[normal]level
[normal] 
[normal]seeking
[normal] to 
[normal]understand
[normal] the drivers and risks 
[normal]inherent
[normal] in forensic 
[normal]science
[normal] provision. The closure of the FSS created 
[normal]significant
[normal] 
[normal]uncertainty
[normal] in the 
[normal]market
[normal] and from our discussion
[normal]s
[normal] it is clear that a key driver for the 
[normal]commercial
[normal] 
[normal]sector
[normal] is 
[normal]clarity
[normal] 
[normal]about
[normal] 
[normal]future
[normal] le
[normal]vels
[normal] of 
[normal]spend
[normal], retu
[normal]r
[normal]n on investment and effective 
[normal]business
[normal] 
[normal]processes
[normal]. 
[normal]We deal with procurement below but more 
[normal]m
[normal]ature commercial relationships are required between customers and suppliers to manage risk, meet the requirements of regulation, ensure viable businesses and maintain public confidence.
[normal]How are forensic science services procured by police forces and could[bold]procurement processes be improved?[bold]1
[normal]9
[normal]. 
[normal]Prior
[normal] to the closure of the FSS the MPS had formally withdrawn f
[normal]r
[normal]om the
[normal] National Forensic Framework Agreement (NFFA)
[normal] and 
[normal]did 
[normal]not use it for 
[normal]digital
[normal] 
[normal]forensic
[normal] work, in
[normal]s
[normal]tead 
[normal]setting
[normal] up its own framework. Out of necessity the MPS 
[normal]modified
[normal] the NFFA 
[normal]products
[normal] and used it 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]secur
[normal]e
[normal] DNA and 
[normal]a
[normal]nalytical
[normal] 
[normal]s
[normal]ervices
[normal] in the extremely short 
[normal]timescales
[normal] that were allowed for the FSS closure transition. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20
[normal]. The MPS and police force regions run tender processes at different times involving different operating models leading to a constant state of flux in the market. There is a heavy focus on price as the main determinant of contract award, assuming that quality standards have been met. The move to shorter term contract awards of two years with optional extensions may not allow for investment in major capital equipment as the period of return is to
[normal]o
[normal] short. Also the NFFA is based on buying products (e.g. a DNA analysis of a body fluid) and this has become increasing
[normal]ly
[normal] complex with multiple products on the framework and many pricing points within each product
[normal];
[normal] one of 
[normal]the 
[normal]forensic science providers reports that in the latest framework one product has over twenty nine pricing points.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]1
[normal].  
[normal]While our immediate priority was securing continuity of forensic science provision we will 
[normal]l
[normal]ook to improve our procurement processes 
[normal]at 
[normal]the end of the current contract recognising the need to build a more mature commercial relationship, streamline business processes and support stability in
[normal] the market
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the [bold]UK[bold]? (please provide evidence/examples)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]2
[normal]. We are not aware of any 
[normal]significant
[normal] 
[normal]loss of intellectual wealth through 
[normal]FSS 
[normal]scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. 
[normal]Having canvassed the views of MPS forensic staff including those who have joined the MPS there are mixed views but their primary concern is security of employment for forensic staff both in the private and commercial sector and that forensic science will not be an attractive career choice for the most able scientists. Also
[normal] in niche or 
[normal]specialist
[normal] areas 
[normal]we
[normal] are 
[normal]seeing
[normal] a decline in demand 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]fibre
[normal] and 
[normal]contact
[normal] trace 
[normal]examinations
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]there are 
[normal]reducing
[normal] 
[normal]numbers
[normal] of 
[normal]experienced
[normal] 
[normal]scientists
[normal] who have 
[normal]expertise
[normal] in these disciplines
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could [bold]arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the [bold]UK[bold] be [bold]improved?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]3
[normal]. 
[normal]The MPS took the 
[normal]precaution
[normal] of 
[normal]securing
[normal] all the
[normal] case 
[normal]files
[normal] from 2009 onwards at its Lambeth site and this enabled 
[normal]us
[normal] to deal 
[normal]efficiently
[normal] with requests for court attenda
[normal]n
[normal]ce and 
[normal]casework
[normal] reviews. 
[normal]We have always seen the forensic archive as a temporary issue, once the majority of live cases have been through the courts then there will be little demand on the archive and it will have little relevance to 
[normal]current 
[normal]forensic delivery. 
[normal]We have 
[normal]experienced
[normal] some 
[normal]problems
[normal] as all t
[normal]h
[normal]e records seem to be paper 
[normal]based
[normal] and it has been 
[normal]difficult
[normal] and time 
[normal]consuming
[normal] to 
[normal]retrieve
[normal] FSS 
[normal]procedures
[normal] and MPS 
[normal]retained
[normal] material. 
[normal]One 
[normal]improvement
[normal] would be to 
[normal]ensure
[normal] that forensic 
[normal]organisations
[normal] have an 
[normal]auditable
[normal] and 
[normal]robust
[normal] means 
[normal]for
[normal] 
[normal]securing
[normal] and 
[normal]providing
[normal] 
[normal]electronic
[normal] data and 
[normal]information
[normal] that IT systems can be also 
[normal]retained
[normal] as well as paper record
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]4
[normal]. The MPS has established a cold case team of 
[normal]five
[normal] forensic scientists to continue the work of reviewing unsolved forensic cases and looking for new opportunities. 
[normal]The 
[normal]Cold Case Team report that i
[normal]n general the
[normal] arrangements and protocols with the FSS Archive are working well. The
[normal] time taken
[normal] for 
[normal]retrieving 
[normal]samples/materials has improved in recent months
[normal] to
[normal] a service level of 95% completed within contractual times.
