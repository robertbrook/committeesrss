"&#xa0;\nThis memorandum is submitted by \nthe British Vehicle\n Rental and Leasing Association \non behalf of its members \nand their customers\n. T\nhe BVRLA represents the interests of more than two million business car drivers and the millions of people who use a rental vehicle each year. \nThe cost of \nmotor insurance for the vehicle rental industry has rapidly escalated to a crisis, as the costs associated with motor accident claims and related motor insurance costs reach unsustainable levels. The increasing cost of compulsory motor insurance currently \ncreates the greatest risk for the profitability and sustainability of our industry and the vehicle rental industry is calling on the Government to take urgent, decisive action that will bring relief in the short and long term.\n \nFigures which we have collat\ned show that over the last six years the number of personal injury claims which our members receive has increased from 17% of accidents to 25% of accidents. In addition, the average cost of each claim has more than doubled over the last four years.\nWe woul\nd recommend that the Government should take the follow\ning\n steps which we believe will help further\n r\neduce the costs associated with whiplash claims\n:\n \n&#xa0;\nThe BVRLA is the trade body for companies engaged in the leasing and rental of cars and commercial vehicles. Its \nm\nem\nbers provide rental, leasing and fleet management services to corporate users and consumers. They operate a combined fleet of 2.\n75\n million cars, vans and trucks, buying \nnearly half \nof all new vehicles sold in the UK. \nAs well as \ncampaigning on \nkey issues \naffecting the sector, the BVRLA regulates the industry through a mandatory code of conduct.\n \nwww.bvrla.co.uk\n  \nRecovery of DamagesWe would suggest the Transport Committee considers recommending further reforms to help reduce the costs associated with whiplash claims. This could, for example, be achieved by ensuring that a claimant is not able to recover damages greater than 2.5% of t\nhe Judicial Studies Guidelines for the most serious personal injury, unless a permanent and serious impairment has been sustained and can be proven. This approach would provide certainty and clarity for all parties involved. If there is a dispute then the \nsmall claims court provides a solution to bring claims to a resolution at a proportionate cost. \nThe committee may be aware that a similar approach has been taken in other common law jurisdictions which have been affected by rising insurance costs. We beli\neve that lessons can be learnt from experiences in other jurisdictions which share the similar origins of our legal systems. Australia, Canada, and Ireland have, for example, all responded decisively to manage the spiralling cost of motor insurance given t\nhe detrimental effect to the wider economy. Each country mentioned recognised that unfettered access to the courts, regardless of severity of damage or costs of delivering compensation, was unsustainable and appropriate measures were implemented. \nA key st\nrategy for maintaining affordable motor insurance adopted in the Canadian and Australian jurisdictions was to limit recovery for non-serious personal injuries. A number of methods, including caps, deductibles, and financial thresholds have been introduced \nas a means of identifying non-serious injury. \nFor example, in Alberta, Canada a cap on pay\n \nouts was set at $4000 (around £2\n,\n500), while in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island it was set at $2\n,\n500 (around £1\n,\n600). In the years between 2003 \nand 2011, average premiums fell in all of these provinces. The cap was a success in terms of reducing the severity of injury claims experience, reducing the frequency of minor injury claims, and stabilising premiums. Another reform implemented in Ontario w\nas a requirement that an injury had to be a “permanent and serious impairment of an important function” to seek recovery through the civil justice system.\nThe common experience has been that objective tests create \nand deliver \ngreater certainty. By introduc\ning the approach adopted by other jurisdictions, which largely looked at the process of identifying a genuine claim, had the desired outcome. This was introduced without the need to impose arbitrary factors which were difficult to prove, such as the speed \nof impact as applied by the German judiciary.\n&#xa0;\nFraudulent claimsWe would recommend that the committee considers putting forward a recommendation for a change in the law where a court finds that a claim has been fraudulently exaggerated\n. In this event \nth\nen we strongly recommend that the entire claim, which includes any genuine element, should be struck out.\nCurrently a claimant can submit an exaggerated claim with the peace of mind that if the fraud is discovered, the genuine element of the claim made wil\nl not be struck out. In contrast, the law on exaggerated first party insurance claims, the policyholder forfeits the whole insurance claim where the fraud is identified. \nIn a recent court case of Summers -v- Fairclough Homes [2012] UKSC 26 the court held \na claim could be struck out under Civil Procedure Rules 3.4(2) or under a court’s inherent jurisdiction at any stage, but only in ‘very exceptional circumstances ’ at the end of a trial.  \nIn this particular case, the genuine value of the claim was found t\no be £88,716. This had been exaggerated by approximately tenfold. The court, nevertheless, still concluded that the claim fell short of ‘very exceptional circumstances’ and allowed the claimant to still receive a payment of £88,716.\nThis court case heighte\nns our concern that there will be little or no disincentives for claimants to submit an exaggerated personal injury claim in the future. If our concern was to become more  widespread then we believe fraudulently exaggerated claims will directly impact acce\nss to justice for honest claimants, especially as the limited resource\n of the courts\n become\ns\n clogged up in dealing with such claims.  We also believe that this will have a disproportionate impact on the costs associated with defending and challenging such \nspurious claims. \nThis approach has already been adopted successfully in the Republic of Ireland and would go some way to help reduce the cost of motor insurance in the UK.\nHead restraintsThere is research from Euro NCAP which shows whiplash injuries are \ncommon in rear impacts. While the mechanisms by which the injuries are caused are not fully understood, it is known that seat and head restraint design can influence the risk of injury. Euro NCAP assesses the geometry of the restraint in relation to the he\nad and tests the seats in three severities of impact – high, medium and low – using a dummy specially designed for rear impacts. Further information is available \nhere\n.\nGiven this research we would \nsuggest that the committee should recommend that only head restraints with a Euro NCAP rating of 3 or above are fitted to newly manufactured vehicles. This could help reduce the occurrence of whiplash injuries especially in rear impacts.\n This could be mand\nated through the type approval process for newly registered vehicles.\n&#xa0;\nWe trust our comments will help to add value to the debate\n on how to reduce the number and costs of whiplash claims. \nShould you require any additional information or c\nlarification then please do not hesitate to contact us.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
