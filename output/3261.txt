[[[Executive Summary:]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Our organisation’s submission to the 2012 CLG Select Committee noted several areas in which we believed there were systemic weaknesses affecting the work and viability of the LGO service, at that time.  Broadly speaking, the most significant areas that we referred to can be categorised as follows:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Since the CLG Select Committee’s inquiry and its report and recommendations for the LGO addressed all these areas (between April and July 2012), it is only fair to acknowledge, from the outset, that the Committee’s and hence the Government’s response to public concerns, was both timely and comprehensive. &#xa0;More importantly, the operational and strategic recommendations provided by the Committee, offered viable remedies for the systemic weaknesses that our organisation (and others) had drawn attention to and so again,  it is only fair to acknowledge that the CLG Committee’s and hence the Government’s response to public concerns, was, in this case, highly effective in delivering operational solutions - in real time – for the systemic problems that had been identified, in relation to the work of the LGO.&#xa0;Similarly, it is important, especially for those who have raised extensive criticisms of a system or a public body in the past, to acknowledge good faith when that public body appears to be doing its best to work with Parliamentary guidance and to play its part in resolving systemic problems. &#xa0;It is clear from our experience, since July 2012, that the LGO is open to Parliamentary guidance and that, going forward, it will therefore always process reasonable public or democratically voiced criticisms or concerns. Clearly, such a positive and constructive response from a Public Body has to be perceived as a positive result for the organisation itself – certainly in terms of its reputation and credibility – and for the general public.&#xa0;This document therefore addresses the CLG Select Committee Inquiry terms of reference as follows:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of the general areas of concern we raised at the 2012 Inquiry, these have for the most part been addressed through the Select Committee’s Report and its 14 recommendations together with the LGO’s agreement of those recommendations, as set out in the LGO’s letter to the CLG Select Committee on the 1st October 2013.&#xa0;1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Briefly then, the areas we alluded to that have been addressed and improved can be summarised as follows:&#xa0;1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The democratic accountability of the LGO service – the constructive engagement with Parliamentary accountability has demonstrated that there are clear lines of accountability for the service which are accepted.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The perceived objectivity of the LGO service and system – in particular, the independent review of LGO work and new protocols for LGO Staff appointments have been agreed which will clearly diminish the perceptions of institutional bias in favour of respondents (Local Authorities).&#xa0;1.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The transparency of LGO investigations – significantly, new protocols for the publication of all complaints are now in place. That said, we would suggest that there is a compelling case for publishing the complaints and evidence submissions in the words of those submitting the evidence, i.e. the complainant – as Parliament does. We do have some concerns here that no valid argument has been made to support the LGO’s ongoing practice of rewording complaints. This approach seems inconsistent with other judicial or quasi judicial practices and certainly with the practices of Select Committees. However, on balance this service improvement is both enlightened and clearly democratic in nature and represents a significant benefit for systemic integrity and for the general public. Again, the LGO and the Select Committee must be commended for delivering this public benefit and systemic upgrade.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LGO’s handling and treatment of evidence. There is a new approach signalled by the LGO for the handling of evidence which involves the full disclosure of any evidence that the LGO uses and takes into account, during investigations and this clearly represents a significant step change in terms of procedural balance and the complainant’s reasonable right to understand what evidence has been considered. Moreover, complainants will be far better placed to bring a legal challenge when they believe that erroneous or misleading evidence has been presented to the LGO, by a Council.&#xa0;1.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The duration of investigations. Whilst there is still no specific time limit in place for investigations, it is to be hoped that the rationalisation of the services, along with the independent oversight of the service’s case load and performance, will in future reduce the occurrence of delays in cases such as we have raised with the LGO, which took over 2 years to resolve.&#xa0;1.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As we have noted above, the LGO’s response to the Committee’s report does provide reassurance for the public that, in future, wherever or whenever there are systemic problems affecting the service’s work, there is an institutional willingness to work in the public interest to address any such, wherever it is possible to do so.&#xa0;1.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;  Equally, the LGO service’s readiness to make itself accountable to Parliament and to work with constructive Parliamentary guidance obviously provides reassurance to the Public and the service’s critics, that the LGO service is doing all that is expected of it by Parliament and the Public, in respect of the evolution and improvement of the services it provides.&#xa0;1.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As I have noted above, there are however, some fundamental systemic issues which still affect the LGO’s future work and which act as limitations to the scope and reach of the LGO’s investigations and remedies. Some of these issues are significant and I have addressed these in point 3 below.&#xa0;1.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summary however, the LGO is to be commended for the service’s constructive engagement with the Select Committee’s recommendations and, on the whole, the actions that have been taken clearly represent significant service improvements that will in the long run benefit both the operations and reputation of the LGO and the complainants who use the service.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Again, as we have stated at the start of this document, it is only fair for those who have been critical of systems or Public Bodies, to acknowledge when their concerns have been addressed. Consequently, our organisation is happy to acknowledge that in the case of the concerns we raised and put before Parliament, the government and in particular the Select Committee have, for the most part, addressed our concerns and have provided recommendations for viable operational and systemic solutions to fix the perceived problems that were identified.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Crucially, the most important issues for our organisation – the democratic accountability of the LGO service, its sense of operational transparency and its handling of evidence - were fully addressed by the Select Committee. In addition, a number of other operational improvements have been provided by the Committee and these have significantly improved the landscape for future users of the LGO’s services and the LGO alike.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Clearly, the handling of complaints at the Local Authority level affects everyone in the country who uses or receives services from a Local Authority. That being the case, parents seeking schools for their children, old people seeking care, vulnerable adults and children requiring protection services and people receiving support in their own homes, all depend on an effective, transparent and timely system to resort to if things go wrong. &#xa0;2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Regrettably, for some local authorities, the provision of a complaints system is at most only a tokenistic gesture, where certain concerns are not only unwelcome, they are actively punished and discouraged. Consequently, anything that can be done to strengthen the hand of the regulator, in dealing with such Councils, is to be welcomed.&#xa0;2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In respect of the 2012 Select Committee’s recommendations and the LGO’s responses then, we are taking the time to commend the work that was done and to note that where the remit of the 2012 Inquiry allowed for the provision of remedies for perceived problems, the Committee and the LGO have managed to set out viable improvements and solutions.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The Statutory Framework for LA Complaints and the LGO]]]. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At a fundamental level, the work of the LGO concerns the handling of formal complaints that are raised by individuals and organisations in respect of the public work of local authorities/Councils. &#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, currently, both the LGO and complainants are disadvantaged, in a legal sense, by the lack of comprehensive and clear statutory regulation for the handling of complaints by local authorities – that is, in relation to all their public and contractual work. &#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Clearly, there is a limit to the scope of any criticism that can be levelled at a Council, even if it fails to respond to serious operational concerns, if there is no statutory duty to process and record all complaints, in the first place. &#xa0;3.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The only rationale for Councils to resist such a statutory requirement, that we can see, is that some Councils at present do not respond to all formal complaints as they claim and so the statutory compulsion would represent a significant added burden. Were that the case, it is a significant issue since it would signal that Councils are routinely ignoring formal complaints.&#xa0;3.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Alternatively, if Councils are, as they no doubt claim, processing all formal complaints according to best practice already, there can be no objection or claim of an added burden if the statutory regulation of all local complaints were to be put in place. &#xa0;3.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We still believe that there is an overwhelming case for the urgent creation of binding, comprehensive and universal statutory governance, requiring Councils to investigate, process and record all formal 2nd and 3rd stage complaints. The current unjustifiable ability to legally avoid doing this enables Councils to legally withhold a full and honest account of their performance from the voting public. &#xa0;3.8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Complainants and the public already pay through their hard pressed taxes for Local Authority complaints departments and the already overly long-winded three stage 16 week process, of the LA complaints system. If these were being universally applied, as most Councils claim they are, there should be no resistance from Councils to accept a statutory compulsion to do what they claim they are already doing. &#xa0;3.9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our organisation raised many of these points in 2012 and it is still the case that they are relevant to the Select Committee’s work and the LGO. In short, no action could serve to reassure the public that critical concerns put to Councils will always be addressed as the implementation of statutory regulation of all Local Authority complaints. &#xa0;3.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Additionally, as an organisation that has raised whistleblowing concerns, we must submit to the Committee that there have been catastrophic failures to process whistleblowing complaints across many areas of public service provision, in recent years. We hope the Committee will acknowledge the growing number of voices that are calling for concrete and decisive action, to eradicate this systemic failure, in all areas of Public work. &#xa0;3.11&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We can only state what is well known here. Too many high profile cases have surely driven home the lesson that where there is a way to ignore negative feedback, some Public Bodies and Corporations will still ignore critical warnings, as others have in the past, that might have averted further suffering, to the extent the Public is endangered and vulnerable people are left unprotected from real and immediate risks. &#xa0;3.12&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Where Councils have duties in mental health work, education, services for the elderly and adult and child protection, and contractual decisions, it is not acceptable that there should be any gaps in the systems or the legislation, where critical concerns can disappear. Regrettably, at present although there are a few very narrow areas where there is legislation in place, such as Adult Social Care, it can usually be side stepped by re-designating complaints into areas or in ways, where there is no cover, i.e. as contractual or employment grievances. &#xa0;3.13&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summary, we believe it is self evident that over the last 20 or so years the problem of Public Bodies ignoring critical concerns - with tragic results - has not gone away and persists in Public works, wherever there is an absence of positive law. &#xa0;3.14&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of Local Authority concerns and complaints then and a vast area of Public work, the practice could be stopped in its tracks tomorrow, with a clear and consistent statutory requirement to process, address and record all formal complaints.&#xa0;3.15&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We believe it would be helpful, for the Public to understand why there would be any resistance to the one over-arching action that would, at a stroke, empower the public, the LGO and courts to demand of Councils what the Public interest requires of them: the transparent, objective and effective handling of all Local Authority concerns and complaints.&#xa0;3.16&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; At the very least, we cannot see why Councils should not be required by statute, to follow the LGO’s practice and henceforth publish all the formal complaints that are registered with them. However, once again without statutory backing, the forfeit for hiding or ignoring some complaints or serious concerns, will continue to be less of a worry to Councils than the Public dissemination of some types of concern or failure, that are reported. &#xa0;3.17&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; With statutory backing however, even this one innovation would help to diminish the risk of any Local Authority failing to address critical concerns in future and that would surely be a significant area of Public works made safe or, at least, safer.&#xa0;3.18&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Financial Realities and Disincentives for the LGO]]]. &#xa0;3.19&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Obviously, a very critical public report from the Ombudsman might have repercussions for the executive wing of a Council, and if peoples’ jobs are at stake the Council’s executive can and will likely choose to challenge such a report. &#xa0;3.20&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The LGO will carry out an estimated 4500 formal investigations during the 2014/2015 period and has a Budget of £11.5 million. Allowing for a very conservative estimate of Judicial Review costs at £50,000 pounds per case, including preparation, additional internal costs and court time, the LGO could risk a Judicial challenge, for:&#xa0;1 % of all formal investigation or 45 cases a year at a cost of £2.25 million2% of all formal investigations or 90 cases a year at a cost of £4.5 million. 4% of all formal investigations or 180 cases a year at a cost of £9 million.&#xa0;3.21&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, it is fair to say that taking on a determined Local Authority would usually be more costly for the LGO than facing a small local charity and even two or three judicial cases with Local Authorities every year, could run into millions. &#xa0;3.22&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Consequently, we would recommend that some analysis of LGO Public Reports and compensation remedies in particular, be undertaken to address the concern that budgets may ultimately be dictating the reach and force of regulatory outcomes. &#xa0;

[[[3.23]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Mediation and Remedies:]]]&#xa0;3.24&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mediation was discussed in the Committee’s 2012 report and both our organisation and the LGO engaged professional mediation services thereafter to resolve a dispute we had. The option was very effective and offered a great deal of promise for complainants, as far as we (CCL) were concerned and, we believe, for easing the LGO case load in future. &#xa0;3.25&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, we acknowledge that ultimately, as in our own experience, a Council that has maladministrated can still decline any informal LGO recommendation to engage in mediation with an individual or organisation because there is no statutory or legal requirement for them to take such a recommendation or approach. &#xa0;3.26&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We would have hoped that most Councils would always follow any reasonable recommendation from the LGO to engage in mediated dispute resolution, at any stage in the LGO processes, including as the result of any challenge to any ruling, without requiring a formal Public Report, a court order or any statutory compulsion to do so.&#xa0;3.27&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Despite this, we would still suggest that the concept of mediation is worth pursuing. It offers a timely option and one in which costs for disputes could be shared by those in dispute rather than the regulator. The wider utilisation of professional and independent mediation to process and resolve disputes between complainants and Councils could, however, be better supported by a statutory framework regulating LA complaints.&#xa0;&#xa0;              October 2013&#xa0;
