defaultIn response to your call for evidence I am submitting a paper on what, if anything, we can learn from the experience of the 2010 leaders debates. I do this on an individual basis.  In preparation for this submission I received the assistance from a media agency (Mindshare) to help me with the audience analysis.  I would like to thank the team for their help.

defaultBackground to debatesdefault&#xa0;
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn my role as director of political strategy in Number 10, I was tasked to lead the negotiations with support from Justin Forsyth (the then Director of Strategic Communications in Number 10).
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI was minded to support the TV debates for three reasons:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirst, you can not underestimate the damage done to our democracy by the disgraceful expenses crisis of 2009.  At a time when our country was in acute pain from the global financial crisis, the British public looked on with disgust as they saw, in their opinion, a political class living a life far removed from theirs.  It was therefore imperative that we found a way to re-engage voters in the forthcoming election;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, all elections matter, but this one mattered more than most.  In 2010 the economy was recovering robustly
default and there were two very clear choices the public faced:  the Labour Party argued that the deficit was best reduced by fostering growth now, and once that growth took hold finances should be tightened; the Conservative Party argued that the only way to reduce the deficit was with cuts now.  These were finely balanced arguments, and in my view best made without the mediation of partisan press; and
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThird, after 13 years in office The Labour Party could not afford to run campaigns in the way that they had done in the past.  Resources were tight and we faced a press that was uniformly hostile to the party.  It therefore made sense to make our case directly to the British people.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOnce we had made the decision to start the negotiations I decided to meet privately with David Cameron’s director of communications, Andy Coulson.  Mr. Coulson was a trusted aide of Prime Minister Cameron’s and could speak to his interests.  In my discussions with Mr. Coulson it became clear to me that there was enough common ground to start a formal process of negotiation with the broadcasters.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGoing into these formal negotiations as a team we agreed a set of basic principles to guide our negotiating strategy.  They were as follows:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore not fewer:
default  By this we meant that we favoured a series of debates rather than a one-off.  This we believed would allow for the public to make a considered choice on a finely balanced election;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLonger than shorter
default: We always favoured a longer format.  Prime Minister Cameron was a formidable communicator, but did not stand-up to sustained examination.  We as a result favoured a longer programme length; and
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnmediated not mediated:  
defaultThere is a glut of political programming with high profile TV presenters, but all record low-TV ratings.  We wanted a format that put the leaders directly in front of the public to take questions and cross-examine each other.  We did not want the debate to be dominated by a puffed-up presenter luxuriating in his or her day in the sun.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe TV debates were a success on a number of measures:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirst, electoral turnout was noticeably higher than in 2001 and 2005.  In 2005 turnout was 61.4%, in 2010 it had risen to 65.4%.  The TV debates caused debate in homes and offices throughout the country and played a significant role in increasing turnout;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, the TV debates generated large audiences which have not been seen for an election in modern times.  They were noticeably higher than the average rating for political TV programmes like Question Time and Newsnight.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThird, due to these higher viewing figures the programmes were particularly successful in engaging voters who were undecided.  The TV debates were particularly successful with women, who make up a large proportion of undecided voters;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFourth, these debates held the audience’s attention.   We knew from qualitative research work and from British Audience Research Bureau (BARB) data that the British public found them engrossing.  Unlike most TV programmes, there was little in the way of viewing attrition; and in the case of Sky audience actually built over the broadcast

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a number of lessons learned from this experience:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirst, the format by which these debates were negotiated was thorough, business-like, and delivered an outcome that was beneficial to our democracy.  I therefore see no need to change that;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, there should be more than one debate.  As the audience data shows, these debates delivered significant audiences that engaged the public.  There is a clear public appetite for more debates, not fewer;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThird, the 90 minute format held the viewers attention and should be continued;
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFourth, the debates took place across the country and this created real local pride.  This should continue, as too much of our political debate is already focused on London SW1;
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFifth, the broadcasters approached negotiation and production with great professionalism and impartiality.  Sky should get particular credit for delivering a young audience.  That said, I believe that Channel Four/ ITN’s pursuit of mannered iconoclasm resulted in them not hosting a debate.  Something I regret – a feeling I believe they share;
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSixth, from the start it was clear that the Lib Dems should be included although their leader could never be the next Prime Minister.  The Lib Dems since the 1980s had registered a significant and steadily growing vote share, it was therefore right that they should be included.  Going forward I believe that there should be an established vote share threshold for participation in the debate.
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSeventh, based upon my experience from the UK and recent experience in the US I am fundamentally un-persuaded for the need for the creation of a “Debates Commission”.  Unlike in the US, our broadcasters are governed by the commitments of the “Representation of the People Act” and hence have a statutory obligation to make sure that political programmes, like the debates are fair and impartial.  Moreover, I fear that a Debates Commission which does not have the buy-in of parties or broadcasters makes it more likely that debates will not happen.
