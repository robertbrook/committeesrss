[[[Letter from Peter Schofield, DCLG dated 26 November 2013]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 20 November asking me to provide some further information about the calculations behind our estimate that there has been a 10-20% increase in demand as a result of the Help to Buy: Equity Loans scheme. In particular you wanted me to set out how we have measured deadweight, displacement, leakage and substitution in our assessment of the net additional impact of the scheme.&#xa0;As I mentioned in my oral evidence, there was a wider pick-up in the market in the period immediately preceding the introduction of Help to Buy. This makes it more difficult to assess the pure "additionality" of the policy at this stage. The numbers I provided were intended to give some guidance to the Committee of the likely impact. The Department will be keeping this under review as more data becomes available.&#xa0;Our assessment is that demand for new homes has risen by between 20 and 30%, but there was already an annual increase in demand of about 8% before the scheme was introduced. Hence our assessment that the scheme itself increased demand by between 10 and 20%.&#xa0;There are other aspects of the data that indicate the additionality of the scheme. In particular, there is good evidence to suggest that Help to Buy is helping to stimulate the number of new build reservations by first time buyers and deposit constrained groups:&#xa0;• 94% of Help to Buy transactions to date have been First Time Buyers, with three- quarters of transactions with a 5% deposit - hitting a core target of "deposit constrained" new purchases; and&#xa0;•  half  of  purchasers  would  otherwise  have  struggled  to  obtain  conventional mortgage finance based on their registered income and mortgage-able amount. I hope this is helpful.&#xa0;26 November 2013&#xa0;
