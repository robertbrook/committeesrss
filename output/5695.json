"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor David Heald (FTF 13)&#xa0;the implications for public spending of fixed-term parliaments&#xa0;a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe vast information advantage possessed by the Executive\n;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe \nwell-established practice\n of leaking and planting that precede\ns\n most Budget, Autumn Statement and Spending Review announcements, \nwhich\n function as distracters\n;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe gaming of rules, such as treating Private Finance \nInitiative (PFI) \nprojects as off-balance sheet\n, arbitraging boundaries between general government and public sector and between public sector and private sector, and redefining the length of the economic cycle in order to satisfy a fiscal rule\n;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe degeneration of formal Parliamentary financial procedures into mechanical processes that are largely treated as irrelevant\n; and\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe over-stretched remit of the Treasury Committee \nhaving the result that \nit does not function as a \n‘Spending and Tax\n Committee\n’\n, \nwhich would be \nexplicitly and continuously focused on \nspending and \ntax\n.\nThere are some connections to other questions, particularly the interaction between fixed-term Parliaments and coalit\nion government. Moreover, this M\nemorandum shows how the present conjuncture might lead to improved scrutiny by Parliament of the public finances.\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe question of how many years a Spending Review will cover and the extent to which it projects forward into the following Parliament\n; and\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe \nquestion of how frequently Spending Reviews are held: the initial practice of every two years (1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004) chan\nged to every three (2007, 2010 and \n2013), but there must be one in 2015\n.\nWith the probable length\n of the Parliament known to all, the dynamics \nof frequency and duration \nare likely to change. \nFor example, a Government elected in 2015 might opt in 2015 for a Spending \nReview covering four years (\n2016-17, 2017-18\n,\n 2018-19\n and 2019-20\n), planning \nto hold\n a further Spending Review in 2019 in advance of the 2020 election. Whether there \nis a\n majority or coalition government after 2015 seems likely to be an important factor. \na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAfter 1997, the Labour Government re\n-\nlaunched the \nPFI\n as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), vastly expanding the scale\n \nand – thro\nugh arbitraging FRS 5A (ASB, 1998\n) \nby \nTreasury Technical Note 1 (Revised)\n \n(Treasury Taskforce, 1999)\n –\n kept the capital costs and borrowing out of the spending and borrowing numbers (Heald and Georgiou, 2011a)\n;\n \nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe status of Network Rail was design-engineered to ensure that, whatever the financial reporting treatment, its borrowing would be outside the national accounts numbers\n;\n \nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 1997-2010 \nLabour \nGovernment kept its election promises not to increase the basic or higher rate of income tax, instead increasing National Insurance Contributions\n, thereby exploiting the low level of public understanding of the UK tax system\n;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 1997-2010 Labour Government redefined the economic cycle in order that it notionally complied with \nthe\n 1998 fiscal rules\n; \ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Coalition Government has committed to buying electricity output from the EDF-\nplanned \nHinkley Point \nC \nnuclear power station at \na strike price \nroughly double the\n current market price\n; and\nf)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently suggested an above-inflation rise in the minimum wage (\nParker et al, 2014\n).\n \nAnswers to this question are necessarily speculative because the fixed-term is new and this is the first coalition since 19\n45\n. \nT\nhe divergent electoral interests of the Coalition parties suggests that little \nplanning \nwill be done publicly, though the Treasury is likely to be doing its own preparations. An ‘End of Parliament Fiscal Report’ on the New Zealand model would \nbe a valuable innovation, though political parties expecting to gain an overall majority might lack enthusiasm. Such a document would improve understanding of the fiscal problems likely to confront an incoming government. \nA practical question is whether the preparation of this document would be the responsibility of the Treasury or the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), or divided between them. In New Zealand, where there is no OBR or Fiscal Council, the Treasury prepares the document which is published in the name of the Minister of Finance\n (English, 2011\n; Parliamentary Counsel Office, 2005\n)\n.\nIf there were currently a majority Government, my hunch is that the 2013 Spending Revie\nw would have \ncovered more years than 2015-16.\n Again, providing that there were a majority Government, a 2015 Spending Review would then cover the four years to the 2020 election.  It is possible that the Treasury wanted the 2010 Spending Review to cover four years, though \nit is \nunderstandable that, in the novel circumstances of a coalition, three years was the maximum thought achievable.\n \nAccordingly, the answer to the direct question is that there is scope for the year coverage to be linked to the Parliamentary term. Whether this would happen depends on political calculations: a majority Government would feel obliged to go into an election with costed forward plans (a huge institutional advantage over opposition\n parties\n) whereas a minority coalition \nparty \nand the O\npposition would be wary of being locked into numbers after the election.\n3 February\n 2014\nREFERENCESAccounting Standards Board (1998) \nAmendment to FRS 5: Reporting the Substance of Transactions – Private Finance Initiative and Similar Contracts\n, London, Accounting Standards Board.\nEnglish, Hon Bill (Minister of Finance) (2011) \nPre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2011\n, Wellington, New Zealand Treasury, available at: \nhttp://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/forecasts/prefu2011\n.\nErnst &amp; Young (2012) \nOverview and Comparison of Public Accounting and Auditing Practices in the 27 EU Member States\n, Prepared for Eurostat: Final Report, \nBrussels\n, Ernst &amp; Young.\nEuropean Commission (2013) \nR\neport from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament –\n \nTowards Implementing Harmonised Public Sector Accounting S\ntandards in Member States: \nThe S\nuitability of IPSAS for the Member States\n, \nCOM(2013) 114 final, SWD(2013) 57 final, \nBrussels, \nEuropean Commission. \nForte, F.

A Spending Review every two years has had three years of plans, with the third year of one becoming the first year of the next. There must be a Spending Review in 2015 because the existing plans stop at 2015-16.\n This is ‘probable’ because Oppositions, which repeatedly challenge governments to call an election, would find it \ndifficult to deny a dissolution\n to the Prime Minister\n.\n Until November 2008, the then Conservative Opposition \nhad \naccepted the public expenditure plans of the then Labour Government\n (Lea, 2008)\n.\n Such arbitrage bred a huge ‘advice industry’, in reality providing cover for off-balance sheet treatment.\n  Under European System of Accounts 2010\n,\n operational from \n1 September \n2014, Network Rail \nwill be re\nclassified to the public sector. \n  \nWhatever the merits of particular values for the minimum wage, it should be recognised that this is an example of using law and regulation instead of tax and spending.\n \nLienert (2013) examined how constraints on legislators are essential in order to counter ‘deficit bias’. The specification of what legislators cannot do (eg increase total spending or reduce total taxes) \nand can do \nraises important issues\n of institutional design\n. Nevertheless, their scrutiny role is fundamental to the legitimacy of the budgetary process\n in a democracy\n.\n    \n There will be circumstances in which tax expenditures and coerced private expenditures are the most effective policy instrument. The concern here is that they will be over-used and used inappropriately, either because they are not monitored or are difficult to \nmeasure\n.\n A specific issue is that the United Kingdom has aligned itself to private sector IFRS, with \ninterpretations and \nadaptations to meet specific public sector circumstances. Paradoxically, though the United Kingdom does not directly follow International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs), the research study commissioned by Eurostat \nshowed that the\n United Kingdom\n has\n the highest rate of IPSAS compliance among the \nthen EU27\n (Ernst &amp; Young, 2012)\n. This reflects the fact that IPSASs are themselves derived from IFRS. An open question is the extent to which the proposed EPSASs will derive from\n IPSAS or start from a different point. Unless the situation is carefully monitored, the United Kingdom could find itself non-compliant with EPSASs, or have to adopt accounting practices it believes inferior to its present practices, or engage in complicated reconciliations. \n Possible other names would be ‘Budget Committee’ or ‘Finance Committee’ but I prefer the explicit ‘Spending and Tax Committee’, a name that would clearly communicate its role.\n Its remit should include \nsurrogates\n for public expenditure such as\n off-\nbudget expenditures, \ntax expenditures\n, \ncoerced private expenditures, and unrecorded future liabilities \n(Heald, 2012\n, pp. 43-4\n).\n"
