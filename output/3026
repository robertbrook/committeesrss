defaultAt present the majority of local planning a
defaultuthorities have no system in place to secure off-site compensation with long-term management commitments and this has proved in some instances to be detrimental to biodiversity and a barrier to achieving meaningful mitigation 
defaultand compensation. Biodiversity o
defaultffsetting could provide a positive alternative to the existing approaches, providing:

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe development of such a system needs to be informed by resilient evidence. It is 
defaulttherefore disappointing that the
default Green Paper has been issued before the completion of the 
defaultoffsetting pilots in April 2014. It will be vital to consider the findings of the
defaultse
default pilots and assess whether they achieved the required outcomes. Failure to do so, 
defaultwill risk 
defaultmissing important opportunities and lessons that should inform the potential for, an
defaultd design of, a future approach.
default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultBiodiversity offsetting needs to have a clear purpose, set within a framework for delivering ecological networks. 
defaultThe Wildlife Trusts 
defaultsuggest
default that Government needs to set out a vision to create a National Ecological Network for
default England, which should be informed by 
defaultecological network strategies 
defaultproduced by
default Local 
defaultNature Partnerships (LNPs)
default. Within these strat
defaultegies, ecological network maps w
defaultould show the existin
defaultg natural assets (our statutory and non-statutory sites and
default priority h
defaultabitats
default) and important areas for re-establishing s
defaulttrategic footholds for nature 
defaulte
defaultg
default. buffers around protected sites and Nature Improvement Areas across the length and breadth of England.
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn order to make this vision a reality, the Natural Environment White Paper, Forestry Panel Report and 
defaultBiodiversity 
defaultOffsetting Green Paper could all be followed through and joined up by a land-mark piece of nature legislation. All this could connect to the Natural Capital agenda to create a substantive new framework Bill.  Specifically, for example, the Bill would set the context for biodiversity offsetting which would then have the purpose of helping achieve a coherent ecological network and the restoration of ecosystems.  In this way it could make a positive contribution towards meeting the need to rebuild our natural capital, resulting in a positive change in the country’s natural asset balance sheet.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Wildlife Trusts welcome 
defaultGovernment’s intentions that a biodiversity offsetting system should achieve a 
defaultnet gain for biodiversity
default and that it 
defaultwill not be appropriate 
defaultto use 
defaultin all 
defaultcircumstances 
default‘
defaultin view of the importance of the biodiversity that will be affected or the difficulty of creating similar habitat’
default. 
default We have significant 
defaultdoubt
defaults
default 
defaulthowever, about the delivery of these objectives in practice, if the objective is to make provision for biodiversity impacts
default ‘
defaultquicker
default and 
defaultcheaper for developers
default’
default.
default 
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultT
defaulthe assertion that biodiversity o
defaultffsetting will be ‘cheaper’ and ‘quicker’ does not appear to be underpinned by any evidence. Evidence gathered 
defaultfrom local Wildlife 
defaultTrusts 
default about the biodiversity offsetting pilots shows that there has been a
default lack of uptake 
defaultby developers This 
defaultcould indicate that the potential schemes were too expensive and therefore not signed up to by developers.  
defaultFor developers which already deliver with regards to biodiversity, then offsetting may not introduce additional costs, but 
defaulti
defaultf the system is to achieve net gains for biodiversity (as it should do in line with the NPPF), some developers are likely to have to pay more than they do currently.
default In addition, the assumption that compensatory habitat can be provided on less-expensive land may not always be the case, particularly as offsetting could push the price of some land up.
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently, the tone of the 
defaultGreen Paper
default is weighted and focused 
defaultmore 
defaultin
default 
defaultfavour
default of the benefits of biodiversity o
defaultffsetting to the developer 
defaultrather than the natural environment
default. It also fails to adequately 
defaultrecognise
default the importanc
defaulte of biodiversity and ecosystem services to society. biodiversity o
defaultffsetting is a complex issue and it is therefore vital that the development of a new system is not rushed or simplified at the expense of delivering positive outcomes for the natural environment and society as a whole. 
defaultMitigation hierarchy
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBiodiversity offsetting should 
defaultonly
default be used as a mechanism for compensating residual harm and should 
defaultonly
default be applied if there is evidence that the significant impacts of a development cannot be avoided, reduced or mitigated.  The system needs to be mindful of assumptions in 
defaultapplying or interpreting the mitigation hierarchy – it has to be 
defaultclear, that the application of biodiversity o
defaultffsetting must not weaken existing protection for important sites, habitats and the population status of species of conservation concern. 
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCurrently
default,
default the planning system fails the natural environment, with most developments resulting in a net loss of biodiversity. There is an opportunity to design a system that addresses this, but if this is to work properly
default,
default there needs to be appropriate constraints and clear guidance
default,
default along with standards for avoiding and mitigating loss which should be applied rigorously.
defaultNet Gain/ Net Loss
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe objective 
defaultof a biodiversity o
defaultffsetting system should be to achi
defaulteve no net loss, and a net gain
default for biodiversity through the planning system. While we support the objective to enhance ecological networks and improve connectivity, this should not be at the expense of those species and habitats that need to be conserved in situ. If in-situ conservation is the best option to prevent a long term negative impact on a protected habitat or species
default,
default then biodiversity offsetting will not ensure compliance with legislation. 
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe concept that achieving a ‘
defaultnet gain
default’
default for biodiversity by rel
defaultocation of biodiversity assets ‘
defaultin a way that enhances ecological networks
default’
default might be true of some habitats, but is inherently dangerous to apply to others. For example, offsetting a small isolated ancient woodland by planting a larger new woodland in a strategic biodiversity area to achieve the same credit scoring, will not create a net gain in biodiversity, particularly as the current methodology doesn’t include any calculation for loss of connectivity in generating the credits. 
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFurthermore, for high value and distinctive habitats in particular, finding and agreeing an appropriate offset project may not be that easy
default.
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA net biodiversity gain is only achieved if a proj
defaultect goes above and beyond the 'n
defaulto net loss' threshold.   It is also unclear
default,
default at what geographical scale ‘no net loss’ is being considered in the Green Paper, or how this is being measured. Our view is that both ‘no net loss’ and ‘net gain’ s
defaulthould be judged at a sub-regional
default/county scale and to avoid biodiversity in one part of the country being lost in exchange for gains in another.
defaultMandatory

default3.10
default 
defaultIf b
defaultiodiv
defaultersity o
defaultffsetting is to be introduced, it should be plan-led and mandatory across the board
default for 
defaultall developments with new land take
default,
default regardless of size
default. Feedback from Wildlife Trusts in the pilot areas has already indicated that a voluntary scheme does not work.  A mandatory and well regulated scheme will:
default3.11
default 
defaultHabitats and species of importance may occur at any scale, for example, bat roosts and the only known breeding site for Jennings’ Proboscis-worm (which has no statutory protection) occur at very small scale. The number of houses is not necessarily related or comparable to the ecological impact, because a well located major development may have few impacts
default yet a
default small speculative development on a wildlife rich site could be disastrous for wildlife but below the threshold. 
defaultIf developers are not required
default to
default offset residual loss of biodiversity, 
defaulton developments below a certain threshold, adequate 
defaultcompensation for small developments and the cumulati
defaultve impacts of these developments will be lost
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe pilot metric appears to be based on some good principles and could provide a starting point from which to develop a robust metric.  It will be important to evaluate the experience and lessons of the pilots in considering revisions to the metric and its broader application. These findings could usefully be considered alongside:
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the complexities
default 
defaultof ecosystems
default 
defaultit will be vital that any future metric addresses a range of issues
default to ensure 
defaultbiodiversity offsetting
default does
default no
defaultt result in lots of land of mediocre value, colonised only by a relatively small number of general
defaultist species that cannot support 
defaultthe diversity of species and habitats that have been lost.
default 
defaultThere are many
default issues 
defaultthat must 
defaultbe considered and addressed 
defaultwhen developing and applying a biodiversity offsetting metric. Some of TWTs key concerns and risks are set out 
defaultin paragraphs 
default4
default.3 – 
default4
default.8
default.
default4.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAvailability of like-for-like physical conditions for compensation
default The value of many existing sites is in their long-term stability, history and physical characteristics
default,
default enabling them to support specialist species. The metric and associated cost of delivery of compensation land need to take into account the full biodiversity of a site. The quality and functionality of ecosystems depend on the interaction dynamics of diversity and fragile species. An offsetting approach will fail to deliver if it ultimately results in land of a generalised and species-impoverished nature, in relation to land lost.
default4.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTemporary Ecological deficit
default There will be a temporary ecological deficit during the establishment of the offsetting site (which nationally could be substantial). This will persist 
defaultunless and until offset habitats have reached equivalent quality, quantity and functionality locally and within the wider national ecological network.
default 
defaultIn some cases, because of the highly fragmented state of our countryside, the site to be damaged/destroyed can be the only local reservoir of many specialist species. If local compensation is proposed and it hasn’t been put in place (and matured enough to support specialist species) before the existing site is destroyed, there will be a complete local extinction of those species. The compensation land will then never support the same full range of species because there will be nowhere for them to colonise from. The only way to resolve this issue is to ensure that habitats are created before they are required as compensation. This needs exploring and taking into account in a completed metric approach. In relation to this it will also be vital that investment is made upfront into a secure fund before the development takes place.
default4.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTime required to recreate
default 
defaulthabitat and re-establish ecosystems
default Consideration should be given to the issue that while it may be possible to quickly and successfully 
defaulttranslocate
default individuals of some species (
defaulte.g.
default Great Crested Newts) and some assemblages of species, to suitable newly established habitat, it is nearly impossible to accurately recreate the detail, much of which, may not be well known. Re-establishment of microbial ecosystems, relationships between micro-fauna and flora of meadow soils, peat-based wetland communities and others will need a lot of time (decades to centuries) and/or a lot of very detailed research and management to deliver. There is little published and accessible casework on how quickly, or slowly, such complexity re-establishes itself in various habitats and habitat mosaics, over long timescales.
default4.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCharacter of the receptor site
default It is not clear from Government proposals how risks are taken into account in terms of the character of a receptor site. Further consideration will need to be given to this in developing the metric. For example, it would be considered lower risk to restore a humid heath from a conifer plantation on 
defaultheathland
default than from a maize field. The first is quite straight forward and could be achieved within a reasonable time scale, the second is much riskier with less certainty as to what habitats will emerge. While after m
defaultany
default decades
default,
default the ex-maize field may be the most interesting, this does not really help planning with certainty.
default4.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSurvey of impacts
default We are concerned that a standard framework to assess impacts, may limit the level of survey and/or analysis of individual impacts and in-combination effects occurring with other developments
default,
default in the surrounding area.  All sites are different and survey and evaluation needs to consider distinctiveness and quality of habitat if there are to be true gains for biodiversity. If biodiversity offsetting becomes a permit to undertake a twenty minute survey, the biodiversity value of the site is unlikely to be assessed appropriately, with habitats and species missed
default,
default either due to the time of year or the lack of survey time and effort. The value of grassland and woodland cannot be assessed in twenty minutes.
default5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal Variation default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile 
defaulta national framework of common standards could usefully provide consist
defaultency of approach, a system for b
defaultiodiversi
defaultty o
defaultffsetting must provide scope for local variation and flexibility which should be set out within local plans. Local variation is important because habitat which is valuable or distinctive in one area may not be considered valuable or distinctive elsewhere. Unless the metric and offsetting system are sufficiently rigorous to cover all eventualities and retain ecological functionality, it is unlikely that one size will fit all.  Without local flexibility, the calculation may end up locally meaningless and won’t result in 
defaultan equal or fair trade. It could also lead to the loss of small areas of semi-natural habitat, of relatively low ecological value, but highly valued by the local community.
default5.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultSignificant harm is also an issue which needs to be placed in the context of the local area, the identified impacts and the feature to be lost. What is considered significant harm in one area might be considered less so in another. The balance to be placed on this is an integral part of the planning officer’s role when considering and applying local and national planning policy and should, as with other planning issues be informed by local ecological expertise.
default6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStrategic ldefaultocation of offsetsdefault6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor offsetting to be reasonable, there must be a meaningful ecological and social relationship between the development site and the compensatory scheme. This should be as close to the development as possible, ideally within the same district or county, but at the very least within the same sub regional level. 
defaultThe Wildlife Trusts 
defaultdo not accept 
defaultthat offsetting should be evenly distributed across the country - where development pressures are lower, the requirement for offsets will also be lower.
default Nor 
defaultwould 
defaultwe 
defaultsupport offsets on land:
default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultLocation is a big consideration in addressing risk, for example, provision of new ‘quite interesting’ habitats adjacent to a matrix of ‘very interesting’ habitats may have greater ecological advantage than an equivalent area of isolated but ’very interesting’ habitat.
default 
defaultThe offset system and planning generally, should 
defaulttake a strategic approach to
default establish connective and permeable biodiversity networks everywhere, based on the principles set out in 
defaultMaking Space for Nature
default of bigger, better and more joined up. Guided by this, 
defaultLNP
defaults 
default(in collaboration with other partnerships such as 
defaultNature Improvement Area groups and Catchment Initiative Groups
default)
default should develop ecological network and NIA visions and maps. These should be based on up to date data and information on statutory and non-statutory sites, priority habitats, geology, Natural Character Areas and opportunity areas
default and will require 
defaultLPAs 
defaultto
default cooperate across boundaries at a county/sub-regional level to inform 
defaultthe
default strategy 
defaultand agree the 
defaultoffsetting
default approach
default.
default6.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThese visions and maps should be embedded within local policy and the opportunities identified within them should be used to inform location priorities for targeting offsets.  
defaultIdentification of land for biodiversity offsetting would enable the quantum of habitat required to be assessed at a strategic level, taking into account: direct habitat loss; and the in-
defaultcombination and indirect pressures. It would also ensure that the offset is in a geographical area that will enable 
defaultcolonisation
default by populations displaced by development
default,
default or expansion by populations within an existing habitat adjacent to the offset. 
default6.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultA further consideration that will need to be 
defaulttaken into account
default when locating offsets is the degree of local community interest in the site that will be partially or wholly destroyed by the development.
default6.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultOver the last decade, much work has been achieved through habitat opportunity mapping. These maps have provided local authorities and partners with vital information to support a robust, climate-proof, long-term landscape-scale vision for the benefit of the natural environment, society and the economy. This work has taken place in partnership across most English regions, where maps have been produced to identify biodiversity opportunity areas critical for restoration, based on agreed methodology. The opportunity maps provide clear and consistent information on sites of known value, they capture most or all of the resource which meet the agreed criteria, and take a landscape scale approach. As a result, they can provide a clear spatial framework for a local ecological network and support the effective targeting of local biodiversity offsets.
default&#xa0;
default Some of the Biodiversity Opportunity Areas identified through this process have been used to identify Nature Improvement Areas. 
defaultWe believe that all areas should be covered by a robust evidence base and informed by identifying and mapping such areas.
default7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultConstraints defaultand restrictionsdefault7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultBiodiversity offsetting should not provide a mechanism to develop protected sites. 
defaultThere are
default very few projects that would justify direct harm to the 
defaultnational and international sites. A
default housing development or local infrastructure should not be considered to outweigh the need to protect these sites. In relation to a project of national importance there may be certain circumstances in which damage cannot be avoided. In these cases
default,
default we would advocate th
defaultat offsetting sh

defaultRamsar

default,
default or for the species for which the 
defaultNatura

default sites are designated.
default default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultOffsetting needs to be controlled. 
defaultThere
default 
defaultshould be no ‘down trading’ on habitats or 
defaultbias towards habitats which are cheaper to create
default. S
defaulto a high distinctiveness habitat should be offset with a high distinctiveness habitat.
default Where there are 
defaultspecific connectivity requirements within an area which require certain habit
defaultat types in certain locations, changes of habitat type (from like-for-like), should be 
defaultclearly justified 
defaultand locally negotiated
default to meet the broader objectives of local biodiversity strategies and strategically defined requirements set by LNPs.
default7.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe would be concerned 
defaultwith 
defaultany approach that permitted an environmental gain 
default(
defaultthat might otherwise be lost
default)
default to

defaultOdefaultffset defaultassessments default8.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultNecessary judgements on using the metric 
defaultand making
default assessments 
defaultshould be made by experienced ecologists
default,
default 
defaultbased on up to date survey data and information. 
defaultPlanning authorities will therefore need to have access to ecological expertise
default (either in-house or provided under contract/service level agreement
default).
default 
defaultMany local authorities are choosing to cut their ecological expertise and support for data p
defaultroviders - currently
default only a third of local authorities have an in-

default 
defaultand local re
defaultcord centres are severely under
default–resourced. This must be addressed along with the inevitable increase in burden on already, overstretched local authorities as they 
defaultset up, operate and learn about the new system. 
default8.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultAssessments should be guided by the expertise of a number of local organisations/partnerships. For example: the 
defaultLNP
default; Local Records Centre; Biodiversity Partnerships; and nature conservation organisations such as The Wildlife Trusts. Collectively, with the LPA and Natural England, they can offer a range of ecological and planning expertise
default,
default grounded in local knowledge and an understanding of the strategically defined requirements for protecting and restoring the natural environment. 
default8.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Core Strategy should clearly set out for developers whether and where o
defaultffsetting is appropriate in the
default local area, so that it is clearly and democratically defined in local policy. This should explain the local context to the metric, the broad scope of what the LPA will require in terms of offset habitat decisions and offset placement areas of the authority

default based on the vision and strategy for ecological networks within the area.

defaultLong term managementdefault default9.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe loss of area and quality of habitat to development will remain as an overall impact for a considerable time
default,
default if not in real perpetuity. Therefore we need to replace as much as we can for as long as possible. 
defaultIn order to secure no net loss to biodiversity, offsets should 
defaultrecreate/restore an area of habitat which is larger than is lost, 
defaultbe secured in perpetuity and agreed within conservation covenants
default,
default so the land doesn’t become neglected or damaged.
default9.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultLong term management is absolutely key to the success of offsetting projects and there should be a requirement for an agreed management plan to be produced and implemented. 
defaultWe would expect all agreements to include a monitoring and review 
defaultprogramme
default, to ensure that the regime continues to be effective and meet the objectives set.  It has to be 
defaultrecognised
default that habitats (and species composition) may change naturally over time, including in response to climate change.  Some flexibility, or requirement to review manageme
defaultnt objectives will be important. 
defaultIt will also be vital that the partners responsible have: clear protocols and resources to certify and enforce management agreements; secure, long term financial support for management of the offset site
default, secured in advance of the development commencing
default; and adequate ecological skills and expertise.
