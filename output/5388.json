"&#xa0;\nEvidence submitted by Terry Manwaring\n&#xa0;\nBreeding, Buying and Selling – Monkeys&#xa0;I am sure the enclosed article\n has been brought to your attention.    In the article it confirms your committee has \n‘launched an inquiry earlier\n \nthis month\n (December 2013) \nto \nconsider these very issues.   It will report next year’.\n&#xa0;\nThis sort of practice should not be happening in 2014.    Our country is regressing to the middle ages.  What will be next?   Bears dancing in the streets?\n&#xa0;\nWe already have people breeding cats and \ndogs as if they were going out of fashion and for very high prices.   Many of the dog cross breeds being produced may be dangerous and may produce unknown medical problems.   Most of the breeders do not appear to be registered.  The animal sanctuaries are \nat breaking point taking in unwanted cats, dogs, horses etc.  The monkeys will live short, unhappy lives unless they are lucky enough to end up in a monkey sanctuary where they will be cared for in a happier environment. \n&#xa0;\nFor goodness sake ban this cruel \npractice of breeding wild animals.  It is fuelling the import of exotic animals from Africa, Asia and South America and for no other reason than to line the pockets of unscrupulous people who care little about the lives of these poor unfortunate creatures.\n&#xa0;\nPlease would your committee act extremely swiftly to end this barbaric business, ban all imports of exotic animals and make it illegal to breed any further monkeys.   What right have people to cause such misery?\n&#xa0;\n15 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2530146/Thanks-stars-like-Justin-Bieber-\npet-monkeys-rage-fad-cruelty.html\n"
