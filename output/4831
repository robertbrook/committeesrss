[normal]Written evidence submitted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust on behalf of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project,[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1[bold]              [bold]Brief introduction and reason for submitting evidence[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]This submission has been prepared by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife 
[normal]              
[normal]Trust on behalf of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust is a registered charity (number 
[normal]              
[normal]201081) and a Company limited by guarantee and registered in England 
[normal]              
[normal](number 676313). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project commenced in 2009 to stop the 
[normal]              
[normal]spread of invasive non-native plants in the New Forest area, particularly along 
[normal]              
[normal]rivers and in wetland habitats. It is hosted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight 
[normal]              
[normal]Wildlife Trust and is supported by a partnership of organisations including the 
[normal]              
[normal]Forestry Commission, Environment Agency, Natural England and the New 
[normal]              
[normal]Forest National Park Authority. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust welcomes the opportunity to submit 
[normal]              
[normal]written evidence to the Inquiry. The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project 
[normal]              
[normal]contributes to the implementation of The Invasive Non-Native Species 
[normal]              
[normal]Framework 
[normal]              
[normal]Strategy for Great Britain (DEFRA, 2008) through a) control and 
[normal]              
[normal]eradication of invasive non-native plants, b) building awareness and 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]understanding of the problems caused by invasive non-native species and c) 
[normal]              
[normal]commissioning research into the impact of invasive non-native plants and 
[normal]              
[normal]novel methods of control. As recognised by the Framework Strategy, 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]successful implementation relies on a ‘strong partnership approach’ with 
[normal]              
[normal]landowners; the New Forest Non-Native Plants Project has established strong 
[normal]              
[normal]links with landowners but progress towards eradication of invasive non-native 
[normal]              
[normal]plants at the catchment scale is being hampered by the inability to ascertain 
[normal]              
[normal]the ownership of certain areas of land. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust wishes to draw the Inquiry’s 
[normal]              
[normal]attention to the Law Commission’s review of Wildlife Law, in particular the 
[normal]              
[normal]proposal to introduce powers to make species control orders. We consider 
[normal]              
[normal]that the introduction of species control orders, in particular in situations where 
[normal]              
[normal]the name and address of the land owner can not be ascertained, would be of 
[normal]              
[normal]significant benefit to the control and eradication of invasive non-native 
[normal]              
[normal]species.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2[bold]              [bold]Evidence submitted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]We note that the Inquiry will examine ‘the case for any change in the law 
[normal]              
[normal]regarding invasive species’ and ‘any lessons for England and Wales from the 
[normal]              
[normal]experience of Scotland’s invasive species legislation and controls’. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust considers that changes in 
[normal]              
[normal]legislation are required to enable invasive non-native species to be 
[normal]              
[normal]successfully controlled and eradicated at the catchment scale. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is an offence under Section 14(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to 
[normal]              
[normal]‘plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild’ any plant listed in Part II of 
[normal]              
[normal]Schedule 9 of this Act. Although Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust 
[normal]              
[normal]recognises that responsibility therefore rests with riparian landowners to stop 
[normal]              
[normal]the spread of plants listed in Schedule 9, we consider that landowners need 
[normal]              
[normal]advice, encouragement and practical help to enable invasive non-native plants 
[normal]              
[normal]to be successfully eradicated at the catchment scale.  The New Forest Non-
[normal]              
[normal]Native Plants Project was therefore set up to liaise with landowners and offer 
[normal]              
[normal]advice and practical help to control relevant invasive non-native species along 
[normal]              
[normal]river valleys and in wetland habitats in the New Forest area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Since the start of The New Forest Non-Native Plants Project in 2009, the 
[normal]              
[normal]Project Officer has identified riparian owners along relevant watercourses to 
[normal]              
[normal]offer advice and help with the control of invasive non-native species, for 
[normal]              
[normal]example giant hogweed and Himalayan balsam. The vast majority of 
[normal]              
[normal]landowners have co-operated with the Project Officer, recognised the need 
[normal]              
[normal]for the control of invasive non-native species on their land and have 
[normal]              
[normal]understood the importance of a ‘joined-up’ approach with neighbouring 
[normal]              
[normal]landowners to tackle the spread of invasive non-native plants at the catchment 
[normal]              
[normal]scale. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]However, in a minority of cases, the Project Officer has been unable to identify 
[normal]              
[normal]the owner(s) of the land, despite extensive research. The inability to identify 
[normal]              
[normal]the current landowner of even a single parcel of land presents a challenge to 
[normal]              
[normal]successful eradication at the catchment scale, as seed from plants growing on 
[normal]              
[normal]this land can fall into the adjacent watercourse and be carried downstream to 
[normal]              
[normal]re-infest areas where landowners, contractors and volunteers have worked 
[normal]              
[normal]hard to control the invasive species. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]During 2012 the Law Commission undertook a consultation exercise in 
[normal]              
[normal]relation to its review of wildlife law. Chapter 8 of the consultation document 
[normal]              
[normal](Law Commission Consultation Paper No 206) considered the control of 
[normal]              
[normal]invasive non-native species and included Provisional Proposal 8-7 for ‘the 
[normal]              
[normal]power to make species control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife 
[normal]              
[normal]and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust fully supported this Provisional 
[normal]              
[normal]Proposal in our response to the Law Commission dated 8 November 2012. 
[normal]              
[normal]We welcomed the proposal for species control orders to require a person to 
[normal]              
[normal]destroy invasive non-native species on their property. We welcomed the 
[normal]              
[normal]introduction of species control orders which can permit a person to enter land 
[normal]              
[normal]without the need for permission from the owner or occupier (normally with 14 
[normal]              
[normal]days notice) to carry out operations required by the order. We welcomed the 
[normal]              
[normal]proposal for emergency species control orders which would permit a person to 
[normal]              
[normal]enter land to undertake work without the need to give the owner or occupier 
[normal]              
[normal]14 days notice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]In our response to the Law Commission’s consultation, we pointed out that 
[normal]              
[normal]one of the major problems currently facing the New Forest Non-Native Plants 
[normal]              
[normal]Project is how to deal with invasive non-native species on land where the 
[normal]              
[normal]owner can not be traced. We cited the example of the Cadnam River where 
[normal]              
[normal]we are helping landowners to eradicate the Schedule 9 plant called Himalayan 
[normal]              
[normal]balsam but where the owner of one parcel of land can not be identified, 
[normal]              
[normal]despite extensive research involving 
[normal]inter alia
[normal] Land Registry searches, 
[normal]              
[normal]interviews with neighbouring landowners, correspondence with the son of a 
[normal]              
[normal]previous owner, correspondence with the Highways Agency who once owned 
[normal]              
[normal]the land and discussions with local residents. We have therefore been unable 
[normal]              
[normal]to tackle the Himalayan balsam on this parcel of land and are acutely 
[normal]              
[normal]conscious that all the effort/time/resources being expended further 
[normal]              
[normal]downstream is being jeopardised by the seeds being shed from plants growing 
[normal]              
[normal]on this particular parcel of land. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.9 
[normal]              
[normal]We were therefore very encouraged to note that (in paragraph 8.76 of the Law 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission Consultation Paper No 206) ‘a species control order can be 
[normal]              
[normal]made by statutory notice if the relevant body is unable to ascertain the name 
[normal]              
[normal]and address of any owner or occupier’. We would strongly welcome the 
[normal]              
[normal]introduction of species control orders which can be imposed on land where the 
[normal]              
[normal]ownership can not be ascertained. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3[bold]              [bold]Recommendations for action[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Following the Law Commission’s consultation exercise during 2012 (Law 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission Consultation Paper No 206), a Wildlife Law Interim Statement (15 
[normal]              
[normal]October 2013) has been published which sets out the Law Commission’s 
[normal]              
[normal]conclusions in advance of it drafting legislation. The Interim Statement 
[normal]              
[normal]recommends (paragraph 1.83) the introduction of species control orders in 
[normal]              
[normal]England and Wales. 
[normal]/Con
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust asks the Environmental Audit 
[normal]              
[normal]Committee to consider endorsing the Law Commission’s recommendation for 
[normal]              
[normal]the introduction of species control orders in England and Wales. The 
[normal]              
[normal]introduction of species control orders would allow entry onto land in order to 
[normal]              
[normal]control an invasive non-native species and would be of particular benefit 
[normal]              
[normal]where the relevant body is unable to ascertain the name and address of any 
[normal]              
[normal]owner or occupier.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]We consider the introduction of species control orders would significantly 
[normal]              
[normal]contribute to the successful control and eradication of invasive non-native 
[normal]              
[normal]plants at the catchment scale, thereby furthering the implementation of the 
[normal]              
[normal]Invasive Non-Native 
[normal]Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain.
