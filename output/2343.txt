[[[ Parish Council – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Bradwell Parish Council – Consultation on Deregulation Bill]]]&#xa0;This matter was considered by this council at the last Parish Council meeting.&#xa0;The council was unanimous in the view that it should support any and all initiatives that are designed to prevent damage to unsealed roads and lanes by motorised vehicles.&#xa0;Bradwell lies in the Derbyshire Dales and Peak District National Park.  It is an area of beauty and attracts large numbers of visitors each year.  Unfortunately some of these visitors come, not to enjoy the countryside, but rather to damage the lanes.&#xa0;The Peak District National Park Authority, Derbyshire County Council and Derbyshire Constabulary have been working to address this problem, but progress has been slow, repairs have not been carried out, the weather further damages the surfaces and motorised vehicles still continue to damage the lanes.&#xa0;The inclusion of additional clauses in the Bill to stop further damage to lanes in National Parks by off-roaders should be considered.  The council strongly supports this view and respectfully urges you to act accordingly.&#xa0;Steve LawlessClerk to Bradwell Parish Council&#xa0;5 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
