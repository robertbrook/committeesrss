"Written evidence from Fresh, Tobacco Free Futures and Smokefree South West [TOB09]&#xa0;\nDeclaration of interests&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTobacco is a lethal childhood addiction&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTobacco use is a huge drain on the economy&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0; \nNHS costs of £2.7 billion\n(b)\n&#xa0; \nLoss of productivity from smoking breaks of £2.9 billion\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased absenteeism of £2.5 billion\n(d)\n&#xa0; \nThe cost of clearing up cigarette butts of £342 million\n(e)\n&#xa0; \nThe cost of smoking-related house fires of £507 million\n(f)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLoss in economic output from the deaths of\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Illicit tobacco, along with all tobacco, is a concern&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0; \nPrice is the most effective policy lever to reduce tobacco consumption,\n with increased prices incentivising smokers to cut down or quit\n.\n  \nI\nllicit tobacco is \navailable at half the price of licit products\n, \nencouraging \nsmokers \nto smoke \nmore than if they were paying full price\n, keeping them hooked on a lethal addiction\n.\n  And while tobacco companies \nblame \nHM Treasury for increasing tobacco prices through taxation, latest research \nshows \nthat tobacco companies themselves are responsible for half of all price increases\n.\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0; \nIllicit tobacco is available from a range of accessible sources – pubs, shops, private houses (\nsometimes \nknown ‘tab houses’\n or ‘fag houses’\n), street markets and \nice cream vans.  \nThrough this, n\not only are adult smokers presented with increased opportunities to buy, but children can \nalso \naccess it without \nthe protection of \nregulatory measures including age of sale legislation and mandated graphic pictorial warnings, \nallowing illicit tobacco sellers to hook children onto a lethal addiction.\n&#xa0;\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is also known, as noted by the scope of the inquiry, that the illicit tobacco trade is linked \nto crime, from low-level offending in communities to organised crime regionally, nationally and internationally.\n&#xa0;\n(d)\n&#xa0; \nThe tobacco industry have also historically been involved in the illicit tobacco trade and have been forced to sign legally binding and enforceable agreements with the European Union to compensate for this involvement and to prevent their products from falling into the hands of criminals\n.  Japan Tobacco International \nis \ncurrently being investigated by OLAF, the EU anti-fraud office, over alleged \ntobacco smuggling \nlinks\n \nto the Assad regime in Syria\n.\n&#xa0;\n(e)\n&#xa0; \nThe illicit tobacco trade costs the UK tax payer around £1.8 billion in lost revenue\n every year\n, which could be spent on hospitals, schools and other vital public services. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe illicit tobacco market is declining&#xa0;\nThe North East\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0; \nThe proportion of smokers buying illicit tobacco has red\nuced from 24% to 17% since 2009\n(b)\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe overall volume of illicit tobacco is down by 39%, to represent 9% of the region’s estimated total tobacco consumption\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe South West\n(a)\n&#xa0; \nthe proportion of smokers buying illicit tobacco reduced fr\nom 20% in 2010 to 16% in 2013\n(b)\n&#xa0; \nThe illicit market share as a percentage of all tobacco consumed reduced from 11% in 2010 to 7% in 2013\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe North West\n(a)\n&#xa0; \nA reduction in the number of young people who have bought cigarettes from sellers such as neighbours, car boots and ice-cream vans \nfrom 42% in 2011 to 27% in 2013\n(b)\n&#xa0; \nA reduction in the number of young people who have \nbought fake cigarettes\n down from 28% in 2011 to 22%\n in 2013\n(c)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA drop in figures were also seen in the number of single cigarettes bought\n \nfrom 67% in 2011 to 49% in 2013.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The partnership is a case study of good practice&#xa0;\n“The programme has had a measurable effect on the problem [of illicit tobacco] in the North of England.  It was the first programme to develop a comprehensive approach to tackling the demand for and the supply of illicit tobacco… The scheme is an exemplar of partnership working and should now be widely disseminated.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTougher sanctions and penalties are needed for tobacco smuggling&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPenalties and sanctions must be directed higher up the supply chain&#xa0;\n“Large quantities of UK hand rolling tobacco brands, which far outweigh legitimate demand, are being sold abroad. This is despite legislation introduced 7 years ago to crack down on tobacco manufacturers facilitating smuggling.”\n&#xa0;\n“One comes to the conclusion that you are either crooks or you are stupid, and you do not look very stupid.  How can you possibly have sold cigarettes \nto Latvia, Kaliningrad, Afghanistan and Moldova in the expectation that those were just going to be used by the indigenous population… and not in the expectation they would be smuggled?” \n&#xa0;\nThere is no evidence that standardised packaging will increase the size of the illicit tobacco market&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n“As a retailer, I know that introducing plain, standardised tobacco packs into my shop will be very straightforward to implement and will have no impact on my existing customers or trade.\n“There are already very low profit margins on a packet of cigarettes compared to other products within a store.  If a customer decides that today is the day they will quit smoking and, instead of paying nearly £6 for 20 cigarettes, opts to buy a packet of chewing gum for 49p – it’ll mean I’ll make 1p less profit and have a customer with £5.50 spare to spend on other products.”\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0; \ninadequate enforcement capability, rather than high tobacco prices, allow\ns\n the il\nlicit tobacco trade to flourish\n(b)&#xa0; \nthe tobacco industry \nitself is \nresponsible for half of the price increases on tobacco products, the other half resulting from increased taxation\n.\n \n&#xa0;Standardised packaging will not affect the economy&#xa0;\n“While the health impact of smoking is significant and too often tragic, there is also a considerable burden on the economy and local businesses.  For every pound spent on tobacco less than 10p stays in the local economy.  What is left is poor health, smaller incomes and greater dependency on the state.”\n \n&#xa0;\nTobacco smuggling in the UK and Ireland&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQuestions for the committee to consider&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Tackling Illicit Tobacco for Better Health partnership is happy to provide any further information and evidence as needed by the inquiry.\n&#xa0;\n29 August 2013\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.who.int/fctc/text_download/en/index.html\n \n \nhttp://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/cough-up-balancing-tobacco-income-and-costs-in-society\n \n \nGilmore AB, Reed H.  \nThe truth about cigarette\n \nprice increases in Britain\n.  \nTob Control \nPublished, Online First: 12 August 2013 as doi:10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051048\n \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/investigations/eu-revenue/cigarette_smuggling_en.htm\n \n \nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WQ&amp;reference=E-2012-009948&amp;language=EN\n \n \nhttp://www.illicittobacconorth.org/FileUploads/NE_Illicit_Tobacco_Report_key_findings.pdf\n \n Illicit tobacco survey South West, NEMS, 2013\n Trading Standards North West Young Persons’ Alcohol and Tobacco Survey 2013\n \nhttp://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/crime/one-in-five-packs-of-s-tyne-cigs-illegal-1-3665947\n \n \nStoklosa\n M, Ross H. \nTob Control \nPublished Online First: 13 August 2013 doi:10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051099\n \n \nhttp://www.ukctcs.org/ukctcs/research/featuredprojects/illicittobacco.aspx\n \n \nhttp://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2013/08/28/tobaccocontrol-2013-050957.abstract.html?papetoc\n \n \nhttp://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_MiscellaneousReports&amp;propertyType=document&amp;columns=1&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_031246\n \n \nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/10120-001-Tobacco-smuggling-Full-report.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/south-shields-pensioner-caught-running-4037062\n \n \nhttp://get-some-answers.co.uk/\n \n \nhttp://www.keep-it-out.co.uk/\n \n \nhttp://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/tobacco-smuggling-statement/\n \n \nhttp://www.smokefreeaction.org.uk/files/docs/SFACbriefSP13.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.ash.org.uk/APPGillicit2013\n \n \nhttp://www.freshne.com/News-and-Events/Press/Article/tyneside-shopkeeper-and-trading-standards-support-calls-for-tobacco-plain-packaging\n \n \nGilmore AB, Reed H.  \nThe truth about cigarette\n \nprice increases in Britain\n.  \nTob Control \nPublished, Online First: 12 August 2013 as doi:10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051048\n \n \nhttp://www.ash.org.uk/localtoolkit/docs/cllr-briefings/TopofAgenda.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.irishtimes.com/news/revenue-rejects-cigarette-survey-1.1354560\n \n"
