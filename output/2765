[normal]Reform of the EU sugar regime[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent agreement on reform of the CAP states that sugar production quotas will expire on 30 September 2017 – two years later than agreed in 2006.  Quota expiry is an integral part of the reform of the EU sugar regime agreed by the EU institutions and legally enacted in 2006.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since the 2006 reform, sugar farmers have been fully integrated into the CAP income payments system and €6.2 billion was made available for the restructuring of the sugar sector.  This has delivered improved efficiencies and increased beet yields in the EU, but 
[normal]the fundamental EU objectives of fair competition, security of supply and reasonable prices were not met and cannot be met until both market-distorting production quotas are abolished and the EU’s protectionist controls on imports of raw and white sugar are adjusted in parallel.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Until 30 September 2017, production quotas will continue to restrict EU sugar production to only 80% of EU demand.  Quotas have driven EU sugar prices up dramatically – the EU white sugar price is now over 50% higher than world market and EU reference prices, even though EU production costs have decreased since the 2006 reform.  This has put EU food and drink producers – Europe’s largest manufacturing sector, more than 90% of which are SMEs – at a co
[normal]mpetitive disadvantage in price-
[normal]sensitive global markets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the European sugar market to be balanced and competitive, it is vital to ensure that it is not distorted by imports or by restrictions on imports.  Europe cannot afford to hamper its own competitiveness and lose ground in growing global markets.  Yet this is precisely what Europe risks doing if the CAP reform fails to deliver security of supply for end users.

[normal]The chart illustrates the impact of the 2006 EU sugar reform on prices.  Initially the reform delivered the intended results.  Both volumes and prices reduced in line with quota cuts and the staged reduction of the reference price.  EU dumping of surplus production onto global 
[normal]markets was contained as required by the WTO and world market prices increased.  Farmers and sugar processors were compensated through income payments and restructuring funds.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]But EU stocks eroded faster than anticipated because duty and quota free import volumes from LDC and ACP countries did not increase sufficiently to fill the gap between tight EU sugar production quotas set at 13 million metric tonnes and EU sugar needs which are about 16.5 million metric tonnes.  As import tariffs on sugar from other sources are mostly prohibitive, and alternative sweeteners such as isoglucose are also subject to restrictive quotas, buyers were faced with supply problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In 2011, prices on the EU market shot up by more than 40%, in spite of the fact that production costs had decreased.  Prices have remained high ever since.  As history has proven, centralised market management does not work.  The quotas are contributing to food price inflation in the EU.  The increase in the cost of EU sugar has caused divergence rather than convergence between EU and world market prices, thus putting EU producers, particularly SMEs, of sugar containing food and drink products at a competitive disadvantage.
