[[[Introduction:]]]&#xa0;1.1              Passenger transport is a service to people, to facilitate fulfilled lives when no other means of mobility is available.1.2              Passengers do not live and work within neat administrative boundaries.1.3              Services in major transport modes have to be compatible with life needs - to and from work, reaching shops, markets, civic duties, leisure activities etc.1.4              Not everyone has online facilities, or if they do may not use them effectively.  Not everyone has credit / debit facilities to make online purchases.1.5              Integration of different service modes is vital to enable complex journeys.&#xa0;

[[[TSSA]]]2.1              The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association is a recognised independent trade union, with 21,000 members in the 

[[[UK and the Republic of Ireland]]]; our history goes back continuously to the formation of the 

[[[Railway Clerks’ Association]]] in Sheffield in 

[[[1897]]].  2.2              We have 

[[[bus industry]]] members (mostly in London, but also in the Irish Republic, mostly clerical, administrative, Control and management roles), 

[[[railways]]] (national and in both Irelands, in clerical, admin’, Control and management roles), 

[[[maritime offices]]], 

[[[travel trade]]] (agencies and some holiday suppliers), 

[[[railway infrastructure]]] (Network Rail and contractors, component suppliers), transport-related 

[[[call centres]]], and transport-related 

[[[software developers / suppliers]]].  2.3              TSSA also has members in 

[[[Road Haulage]]] and other transport sectors.

[[[Statements]]]4              ‘

[[[Bigger picture]]]’: 4.1              Transport cannot be viewed in isolation; it is an enabling mechanism, or in neo-classical economics, 

[[[derived demand]]], ie determined by other than the consumption of that utility.  Transport links goods, events and services between supplier and consumer.  While any country is divided into administrative regions and territories, its populations do not conform to those boundaries.  4.2              The inhabitants of Kings Lynn in Norfolk may have employment and leisure needs in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire rather than their own county, while the hinterland of Chester goes over the border into Wales.  Major employment centres such as Swindon have a catchment area across four other regional authorities – Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Gloucestershire; Stoke-on-Trent’s workforces come from Staffordshire and Cheshire; Darlington’s regional importance serves the neighbouring areas of North Yorks, Durham and the City of Stockton.  These patterns of work and other travel crossing administrative boundaries are replicated throughout the UK.4.3              Car ownership is highest outside of urban centres, due to a lack of suitable passenger transport; ‘suitable’ being to reach work at times compatible with workplaces, travelling via routes which link home and workplace, travelling in reasonably direct routes, and fares being affordable.  4.4              Public transport provision keeps the rural carbon footprint down, reducing noise pollution and cutting the likelihood of accidents.  A secondary benefit is the lessened need for road maintenance with fewer vehicles using them, freeing up scarce funding authority resource for other commitments.4.5              Planning and supply of transport has to account for demand across administrative boundaries, as well as differing population densities, and timings of public transport need.

[[[This creates an absolute need to unify ticketing and travel passes conditions of use across boundaries.]]]4.7              The biggest anomaly is with the 

[[[NBP]]] - National Bus Pass – issued to all who age-qualify but often (‘rurally’) no, few or unsuitable services to use.  This is not an argument against the NBP. 4.8              Some bus operators are dependent upon the revenue from National Bus Passes to stay viable.  Bus operator Trent Barton in Nottinghamshire claims that NBP generates 25% of their revenue (statement to National Pensioners’ Convention Transport Working Party, August 2013), and without that income, the company would not be viable.  NBP users spend money in their destinations, bringing a wider benefit to the economy.  Some of that money would be spent anyway, but supplementary spend, on refreshment and other leisure, puts extra money into circulation.  While in the major centres, mobility is effectively taken for granted, and the circulation of money on the broader regional economy is a given, this is less so in thinner-densities of population.

[[[This is an argument for suitable and sufficient public passenger transport, with unified terms and conditions between neighbouring issuing authorities.]]]5              ‘

[[[Inside information]]]’: 5.1              TSSA’s unique combination of roles and grades throughout the transport industries gives us access to planning principles, operating criteria, service management and assessment of efficacy.  5.2              The principle of passenger transport planning, when I joined most of my industries, was to consider the passenger first, to build services and route structures around their needs.  This ended as transport became private, where service was determined by financial reward and appropriate local, regional or national authorities had to finance any shortfall arising from this mutation.  5.3              Transport is rarely purely urban, nor purely ‘rural’ – the best means of utilising transport vehicles (road or rail) is to integrate schedules, making best use of buses and trains.  Types of service and ways to link locations may vary for time of day and day of week – the difference between compelled travel and discretionary travel.  That definition gap often blurs – is someone travelling to pay a Council Tax bill once a month at the Town Hall, a discretionary or compelled journey?5.4              Passengers having to cross administrative boundaries often found their bus services in particular reducing in frequency (from, for example, daily to market days at the regional centre determined by the bus operator, not necessarily the centre used by the community), capacity (double-deck buses replaced by single-deck vehicles), and service (going from hourly or better on days operated to just one or two buses per day).  5.5              Lack of a commercial traffic from a Hertfordshire village, 

[[[Sarratt]]], just outside Watford, resulted in the hourly daily except Sunday double-deck route 318 bus service provided by London Transport (which handed over ‘country area’ operations to the National Bus Company in 1970) steadily reducing in all aspects – trips per day, days of operation, replacement by smaller and single-deck buses until toward the end of the 20th century, the village had lost all of its scheduled services and became reliant on a community facility staffed by volunteers.  That service had imperfect operational certainty as driver volunteers could not be guaranteed for all the scheduled trips.5.6              Computer scheduling has allowed ‘integrated schedules’ to a far greater degree than manual compilation which preceded it.  More sophisticated systems allowed efficient linking up of different routes’ journeys.  Simpler ‘hub and spoke’ route patterns have been transformed, especially outside of major cities, into integrated operating patterns5.6.1              Eg - a bus travelling route ‘A’ from a centre to an outlying point, then to form the next trip on route ‘B’ to a different location, then to a route ‘C’ which might serve yet more places.  Other vehicles on those routes could be drawn from different routes, which would be invisible to users except when a double- or single-deck bus appeared for no visible reason instead of the usual type.  5.7              When a capacity increase occurred, no-one was inconvenienced, but where a scheduling efficiency reduced carrying capacity (linking two other operations, bringing a single-deck vehicle vice a previously-operated double-decker), people could be left behind, possibly with no later bus to catch.  This leaves funding authorities with a dilemma – ensuring by subsidy that a route is of sufficient capacity might mean paying excessively, as either scheduling efficiencies would be lost (raising operating costs) or paying for a double-decker to cover irrelevant workings on an integrated operating roster, giving a bus operator money for nothing.  5.8              The same applies for rail beyond major centres – 

[[[TOC]]] (Train Operating Company) franchises determine service (timings, frequencies and capacity) but do not impose requirements to serve the community beyond the rail station.  Trains will run from very early to very late, often seven days a week, but buses may not.  Invariably a bus operator is called upon to fill in the gap, which may create a subsidy burden for the authorities, reflected in ‘opportunity cost’ of the diverted resource.5.9              Outside major centres, less-dense populations and the spread of routes from transport interchange points creates inefficient bus use and poor interchange between modes.  ‘Rural’ populations always take a bigger hit on service quality than urban dwellers who have strength in numbers to determine bus service standards.

[[[(]]]

[[[former]]]

[[[) route 265 between Sheffield and Chesterfield]]], serving South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, for which evidence cannot be obtained as the information is ‘commercially confidential’.  It was widely 

[[[‘known’]]], again 

[[[without evidence]]] that the operator had subsidy from both authorities to provide a frequent daily operation along a 

[[[seemingly]]] viable route without subsidy.  These 

[[[rumours persisted]]] until the route was re-numbered.  It was impossible to confirm/refute, and public money vanished unaccountably.5.12              In the 

[[[west country]]], buses always ran late along one urban corridor, highlighted in a 

[[[BBC Radio Four programme,]]]

[[[ File on Four]]], on Tuesday 09 August 2005; BBC researchers and presenter(s) lacked inside knowledge to see what was really going on, nor to see how the local authority had been duped into premature and un-necessary spend on road improvements.  No matter what the Local Authority was persuaded to do, and did, buses continually ran late, even with bus priority measures.  

[[[I have the programme’s transcript.]]]  File on Four is a recorded programme and did not have an imminent editorial deadline to meet.  5.12.1              The truth was simpler: the bus operator was running the service with one vehicle LESS than the service frequency and RTRT - 

[[[round trip running time]]] - demanded.  The maximum number of buses a route requires is called the PVR – 

[[[Peak Vehicle Requirement]]] – determined from the time taken at the busiest period for a single vehicle to start from its origin point, ready to pick up its first passengers, reach its destination and alight all its passengers, take a ‘turnround time’ break and make the return service journey and be ready for its next journey.  Dividing the RTRT by the 

[[[headway]]] (frequency of service to be provided) gives the number of vehicles required.  Thus a 40 minute RTRT and a 10 minute headway requires FOUR buses; a sixty seven minute RTRT on a five minute headway requires 13.4 buses…  ‘Point four’ of a bus is impossible, therefore fourteen vehicles are needed to run the route, by extending the standing time at one or both ends of the route.  5.12.2              However, if a bus operator cannot or will not provide the missing ‘point six’, the route might still run with thirteen buses, despite submitting a full schedule to the Traffic Commissioners and/or Local Authority.  The service runs increasingly late as the day progresses; the operator has to cancel at least one round trip later to avoid paying drivers overtime rates for late running.  5.12.3               ‘Inside information’ would have told the BBC this – it opted not to question, not to ask for an external verification of the operator’s claims and to broadcast material as it was given.  The lack of inside information, the skills and knowledge of transport workers, will continue to allow distortion of facts, and keep false impressions vibrant.  

[[[Transport operators deliberately suppress knowledge]]].5.13              This accepted level of deceit has to change; we have to re-impose principles of planning for passengers first.  We have to recognise and act on the ‘bigger picture’, to integrate people and Society.  This also means that the technical skills used to plan, deliver and administer transport must become more transparent and more accountable.

[[[Laws covering Companies, taxation, finance, and the guidelines on accountancy practice must change to show where and how public money is being used, not just in transport.]]]6              ‘

[[[Scheduling and operating constraints]]]’: 6.1              An operator only has so many buses and trains.  On the railways, train operations are determined by the franchise; on the roads, vehicles are numbered by the likelihood of a profit from fares along the route network or subsidy from a relevant authority.  In both cases, scheduling efficiency determines advantageous uses of equipment.  In both modern cases, the transport supplier’s operating desires come ahead of passengers’ needs.6.2              In major centres, bus route patterns and service levels may be determined (London in particular, Newcastle is set to follow) by a route contracts regime.  Beyond these centres, bus operators since national ‘deregulation’ (except London) in 1986 may operate where and when they wish.  Before 1986, regional Traffic Commissioners control bus service levels.  The emphasis switched from serving a passenger need to operating only where positive net revenues might be found.6.3              An operation can be scheduled so that for any subsidised segment, the paying authority is under-writing an extra vehicle on that route by a sole operator.  Service planners work for an employer, not passengers, apart from remaining municipal bus operators.  This gives the bus company an opportunity for a new bus for nothing or very little, as the funding authority will end up paying for crewing the extra vehicle – a bus on the road for most of a ‘traffic day’ (early morning to evening Monday-Friday, possibly plus earlier/later services for commuting workers) requires two drivers.  Limitation of work hours (on the road) prohibit a single driver from working throughout.  An operator may ‘discover’ a new (or nearly-new) bus available at little or no extra cost, to also be used elsewhere, outside of the ‘PVR’ (above) and at weekends, on other revenue-earning operations.6.4              The paying authority’s other choice is open the missing journeys to tender.  It will then be paying a third party to inefficiently use a bus to fill those gaps.  ‘Missing journeys’ tend not to occur in urban settings, placing extra financial burdens on outlying funding authorities.  This is an excess cost in either scenario, and lacking skills to decode this will always mean those paying authorities may line the pockets of unscrupulous operators.

[[[ ring-fenced transport ‘professionals’ to analyse their passenger operation subsidy to suppliers.]]]6.6              One urban example of an over-generous schedule was an East London trunk route, which on the successful TfL tender required ‘X’ vehicles.  Investigations later revealed that the route was run with ‘X-minus-1’ buses.  The route at one end terminated inside its home garage; as a given bus arrived ex-passenger service, it would be left ready for the next departure, having been fully fuelled at the start of the day.  Garage staff removed the arriving ‘running number’ (the identity of that day’s combination of trips) and installed the next available number in the route sequence.  On paper, this was the full ‘X’ allocation of buses; the turn-round time inside the garage hid the identity swap and enabled the true ‘X-minus-1’ operation.  6.6.1              In London the density of population and generous location of intelligent eyes uncovered this, but in outlying areas, where fewer people exist to detect this, public purse costs will accumulate.  6.7              A major issue with rural bus operations is 

[[[bus]]]

[[[ standardisation]]]; European Union rules govern width and length maxima, which most manufacturers adopt as default, charging extra for variations.  The EU-wide maximum permitted width of passenger service vehicles is 2m55, but this is often excessive for country lanes and narrow roads in ‘traditional’ centres.  This leaves undesirable options:(1) purchase dearer, non-standard (ie narrower) vehicles, which may reduce carrying capacity;(2) schedule less efficiently so that buses do not pass each other in restricted areas;(3) use minibuses, which have limited capacity, and may not satisfy travel demand.

[[[ smaller vehicles of suitable and sufficient capacity.  This may mean centralised manufacturing support, either to bus builders or operators or to Local Authorities procuring routes and services.]]]6.9              Rural rail operations are constrained by two key factors – trains which are too small (particularly ‘Class 15x’ types of trains – series 150, 156, 158 notably) and single-tracked route sections.  The former restriction leads to dangerous overcrowding – eg the route linking Birmingham and Norwich, where two-carriage class 158 trains are used, with excessive standing and crush-loading over segments serving bigger intermediate and terminal locations.  The latter restriction prevents a ‘clock-face’ service from being operated (ie so many minutes past each hour), as ‘passing loops’ act as hindrances to increased or regular operations.

[[[; double-tracking and use of former routes needs attention; where track doubling cannot be achieved, opportunities for more ‘passing loops’ should be examined.]]]6.12              Extreme loadings on small trains often arise from poor or nil alternative – a bus may run parallel or close for some or all of those segments, but the elapsed time on the roads and possibly infrequency of operation deters these options, and ‘forces’ those who must use public transport on to trains, or if they are capable, to use private cars.

[[[Knowing the deceits]]]’: 7.1              

[[[ATOC]]] (Association of Train Operating Companies) is dependent on no-one questioning it.  In 

[[[December 2011]]], ATOC released a ‘breakdown’ of how each penny per £ of the rail fare was divided up.  This was a technical deceit, too complex for media to challenge – it went beyond the time-slot a radio or tv programme could allocate, and would not productively fill column inches of printed media.  I asked ATOC if I could speak to the analysis compiler; the instant reply was ‘he’s left the industry’.  I asked for a means to contact him; the instant reply was ‘we have no means to reach him’.  My enquiry was two days after the press release.7.2              A typical ATOC deceit in this analysis was that N% of each fare went in staff costs; so, imagine two passengers are in the queue at Waterloo ticket office…  The first passenger asks for a day return to Surbiton (a London south western suburb, served by local trains), which for the sake of argument costs £6, out of which N% is for staff overheads.  The second passenger wants an open First Class return to Exeter, which for the sake of argument costs £200.  The booking clerk will only have pressed a different combination of computer buttons.  Is the same N% really applicable for both transactions?  ATOC’s analysis ignored internet bookings, companies such as 

[[[Trainline]]], and purchases from a station ticket vending machine [TVM].  Assuming a TVM is working (and both passengers understand how to use it, and are able to), each passenger has only pressed different buttons on the same machine.  Both transactions take the same time and resource, both cost the same for the train operator to deliver.  Is the argument that staff overheads are averaged per transaction?  If so, over which period, and what is the basis of the calculation by ATOC, given that each TOC pays different wages to their staff, has different (Commercially Confidential!) contracts for their ticket machines, and pays different rentals to the freeholder, Network Rail?  ATOC is also very good at selectively deriving misleading positive data from quarterly 

[[[Passenger Focus]]] satisfaction reports.

[[[vital]]]

[[[.]]]7.4              Change is needed in recording deduction of service charges on operators published accounts; these are paid to external providers (usually a parent company’s subsidiary for centralised HR, IT, payroll, uniform etc), taken from the profit and loss statement.  These inflated ‘service charges’ are consolidated on Corporate accounts making it impossible to see how this money is disbursed.  7.5              External cash flows from the subsidiary reduce operating profit and tax liability without harming the company’s viability.  UK train franchise rules limit profit margins to 3%, but ‘profit’ is whatever an accountant determines, as long as accountancy guidelines permit that latitude.7.6              The other unaddressed issue in public accounting of transport companies is that ‘profit’ is deceitful – the key value is ‘return on capital’.  Profit only arises from the day-to-day running of the operation; return on capital, which is unconstrained by neither law nor contracts, is what the operator takes back for its investment.  The Financial Times has pointed out that in the transport sector, ‘return on capital’ is effectively a licence to print money, and makes ‘profit’ irrelevant.  

[[[“In some cases you can make between 50 per cent and 70 per cent return on capital employed”]]] said Mark Manduca, Bank of America Merrill Lynch transport analyst in London, but 

[[[“profit margins are low – typically in single digits...  Franchising does not require train operators to tie up large amounts of capital, which can ensure strong returns”]]] (Financial Times, WED02JAN13).  8              ‘

[[[Professional workers]]]’: 8.1              Trained and competent staff are the backbone of any transport operation, especially where the internet is not suitable to determine a means to travel.  8.2              Machines do not answer questions; 

[[[TVMs]]] display highest fares first, imposing a silent, un-notified duty to interrogate the machine for alternatives.  In the case of 

[[[South West Trains at Waterloo]]], all requests to a TVM for a journey to Basingstoke will first offer the routeing via Reading which is infrequent, longer than the through service would take and requires a change of trains via non-adjacent platforms.  This ticket is also valid for the cheaper, direct services, which run up to four times each hour and will take up to an hour less than the ‘via Reading’ option.  It is not possible to see from this enquiry at a machine that this is a less-desirable option, let alone why.8.3              

[[[Abellio]]]

[[[ Greater Anglia TVMs within Greater London]]] do not offer holders of the London ‘Freedom Pass’ the opportunity to buy a ticket onward from the ‘Zone 6’ boundary – this leaves the passenger with the option of queuing at the booking office window or paying twice for that segment of the trip.  This facility is available on the 

[[[Southern]]] franchise, so it can be done.8.4              There is no requirement for TVMs to be consistent in the facilities offered, nor for them to have the same layout, all of which forms a disincentive to use.

[[[.  This would best be served ]]]

[[[by a national ownership, whose single management structure could enforce this.]]]8.6              This extortion is replicated across the UK, regardless of TOC or location.  At unstaffed ‘rural’ stations, or outer suburban stations where there is no continuous staffing, the only means of legitimate travel is a ticket from the TVM, assuming it is working and the passenger can use it.  Longer journeys (those across franchise boundaries) cannot be bought from most TVMs.  8.7              Despite the size and programming capacity of TVMs, TOCs rarely put the national fares network into them.  However, revenue staff on trains (guards or travelling ticket inspectors) have portable machines which have all national fares, so TOCs can put this facility on their TVMs.8.8              Professional workers, trained and certifiably competent to national standard, assist actual or intending users, issue tickets from booking offices which machines can’t, assist those for whom the internet is a nightmare.  Some transactions can only be at ticket offices – Senior Citizen or other railcards are not accepted by every TVM; refunds can only be at a ticket office or by post; using compensation vouchers issued for late or cancelled trains can only be at a face-to-face site.  UK booking offices access Eurostar ticketing, hardly any TVMs can.8.9              Professional workers oversee transport schedules.  The more a computer does, less individual skill is needed for corporate outputs.  This reduces operational sustainability, de-skilling those who would be tasked with recovering a degraded situation.  In urban regions, the availability of vehicles and people may bring about a fast resolution, but degraded ‘rural’ service is critical to livelihoods and safety.  Resource is sparser; reliance on professional Controllers to understand and react is vital.  8.10              My year on the 

[[[Underground’s ‘Graffiti Task Force’]]] revealed that social issues transcend transport – there is no definable boundary.  Keeping ‘transport’ separate from ‘Society’ is self-defeating.  Those who know that only technology stands between them and committing an anti-social event are aware that the chances of successful escape rise exponentially.  To catch unwanted behaviour, technology has to be working, accurate and monitored; someone has to become aware that something untoward is happening.  The critical issue, we discovered on the Underground is ‘reaction time’ – how fast can an adverse incident be recognised and resource arrive at the scene?  8.11              Rural distances compound issues, risking more deterioration before resource arrives; 

[[[Network Rail]]] some years ago cut their 

[[[Mobile Operations Managers]]] (MOMs) locations.  In 

[[[Wessex]]] region, MOMs serving Weymouth (Dorset) were based at Eastleigh (Hampshire), over seventy miles away.  If a railway incident needed attention, the only fast means of getting west of Poole was rail, the means most likely disrupted.  Professional workers are more effective than a phone, radio or a CCTV unit.8.12              The UK has no shortage of people willing to become transport professionals – the reluctance is in the employers who service the corporate need first.  A cultural and commercial shift is essential to improve the transport quality in all areas, not just the lesser-populated regions.

[[[A railway needs operating and maintenance staff within reasonable distances, suitably and sufficiently equipped to travel and work on the ‘permanent way’.  A risk analysis may show low likelihood of an event but the other aspect, the severity indicator has been ignored.  A railway is a safety-critical facility: lives cannot be reduced to half of a risk analysis.]]]9              ‘

[[[Dangers]]]’: 9.1              Community railway experiments exist with volunteers at stations.  While this gives human presence, training cannot cover all outcomes.  Risk Assessment matrices rank adverse event likelihood against impact.  Volunteers in safety critical environments may not know the worst a railway can deliver, but are unlikely to safely manage such events, and may even worsen them.  9.2              Volunteers must be competent to the same standard as paid staff.  A volunteer alone in an otherwise unstaffed station is equally at risk in the dull period as in peak hours.  Station duties are a mix of clerical, routine and critical; to sub-divide these aspects is to raise the risk profile.  9.3              Volunteers (from bitter experience elsewhere) are most likely to be absent in adverse weather, to take time off at short notice leaving no cover, to take short-cuts because no-one is looking and rarely see actual, only perceived risk.  The 

[[[first rule of the railway]]] is ‘everything affects everything else’; that was my first lesson when I joined the main line railway in 2000.9.4              Volunteers may be useful to keep quieter railways viable, but mercenary interpretation by the TOC determines that.  Paid staff contribute to the local economy, increasing money circulation; volunteers have just an uplift (valuable but not the same).
