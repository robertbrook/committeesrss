"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence \nsubmitted by Plan UK\n \n&#xa0;\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis submission provides evidence of the \nneed to focus on \nchildren with \ndisabilities\n in development\n, especially those facing triple discrimination due to their age, gender and disability. \nIt provides evidence from Plan’s research and programmes in developing countries around disability, education and health in order to make recommendations for future ac\ntion. This submission calls for the UK government \nto\n:\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDevelop\n \na disability strategy \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure all children with disabilities have access to a quality education \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure all children with disabilities are protected from violence\n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure all children with disabi\nlities can meaningfully participate in the decisions that affect them \n-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPromote and lead on developing better data and information about the lives of children with disabilities\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlan is a global children’s charity. We work with children \nin 48 of \nthe world’s poorest countries \nacross three continents \nto help them build a better future. For 76 years we’ve been taking action and standing up for every child’s righ\nt to fulfil their pote\nntial by \ngiving children a healthy start in life, includin\ng access to safe drinking water. Alongside\n securing the education of girls and boys, working with communities to pr\nepare for and survive disasters and \nprotect\ning\n child\nren from abuse and exploitation\n. We are also inspiring \nchildren to take a lead in decisions that affect their lives and enabling families to earn a living and plan for their children’s future.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlan UK is a rights-based organisation and believes it is every child’s right to have a qual\nity education. This belief \nreflects \nthe statements articulated in Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which states that p\nersons with disabilities \nshould not be \nexcluded from the general education system on the basis of d\nisabi\nlity\n,\n and p\nersons with disabilities \nhave the right to \naccess an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an equal basis with others in the\n communities in which they live. \nArticle 32 of the \nConvention on the Rights of People with disabilities calls for \nstates to ensure \nthat international cooperation, including international development programmes, \nare\n inclusive of and accessib\nle to persons with disabilities. This highlights the need for DFID to ensure a disability strategy is in place across their programmes. \n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChildren with disabilities are often at a double disadvantage, being marginali\ns\ned and discriminated against because of\n both\n their age and their disability.\n Children are more vulnerable as they are not yet fully developed physically or cognitively. \nGirls \nand women \nwith disabilities \nin particular are at risk when \nfactors such as gender and poverty \nincrease \ntheir\n vulnerabili\nty and marginali\ns\nation.\n \nThere is therefore a\n need for a specific focus on \nboth \ngirls and boys\n within a disability-inclusive development agenda.\n \nNote that experiences of disadvantage are not homogeneous across all girls and boys with disabilities, but are \nstrongly mediated by the type of disability\n. F\nor example, Plan research in Sierra Leone showed th\nat\n children with mobility impairments incurred due to war injuries suffered less discrimination than children\n with epilepsy or mental impairments.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlan receives DFID funding through a \nProgramme Partnership Arrangement (\nPPA\n)\n and for \na \nGirls Education Challenge (GEC) fund project in Sierra Leone. \nThe evidence and recommendations \non disability integration within DFID will be framed in relation the Girls\n Education Challenge Fund. Wider research from Plan programmes contributes towards the evidence used to support the recommendations. \nPlan’s DFID funded \nGEC\n programme in Sierra Leone focusses on reaching the most marginalised groups, including \nchildren with\n disabilities\n. The need to reach out to these groups is clear. W\ne will work with 2,052 children with disabilities through partnering with Handicap International (HI), over the three years of the project. It is the largest programme HI have been involved in\n for children with disabilities in Sierra Leone. DFID has said repeatedly that they class the project as innovative due to this element on disability, which reflects the lack of other projects \neither \nspecifically targeting \nor mainstreaming \ndisabled groups \nin this way. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGlobally, \nchildren with disabilities are\n more likely to experience violence and abuse\n than children without disabilities\n.\n \nResearch conducted in \nCameroon, Ethiopia, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia \nby the African Child Policy Forum, found that the almost 1\n,\n000 young people with disabilities had universally experienced, at a minimum, sexual harassment and emotional violence during their childhood. \nThe per\npetrators of violence were often members of their extended family or their peers, making the home and school often unsafe spaces for children with disabilities\n.\n \nThe \nAfrican Child Policy Forum research found that \nacross the entire sexual violence category,\n girls and boys with disabilities were equally likely to suffer\n sexual violence once or twice (28% of all cases), but girls were far more likely to suffer sexual violence more than 10 times (28%) than boys (16%).\n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nhildren with disabilities are less \nlikely to attend school\n,\n \nPlan’s new \nreport \nInclude Us!\n, which \nconducted research using data from Plan’s sponsored children, \nc\noncluded \nthe following\n about the realities faced by children with disabilities in comparison to those without:\n  \nthey are \nsubstant\nially less likely to attend school\n, will experience a poorer education when in school, and are \nmuch more likely to have had a serious illness in the last 12 months, including malnutrit\nion. C\nhildren with disabilities who do attend school are generally \nmore \nlikely to be overage for their grade than their non disabled \npeers;\n \n \nresearch shows that this is often a precursor to drop out.\n \n \nWithin most countries, inclusion levels for children with disabilities in schooling were highest for those with vision or hearing impairments and lowest for those with learning, physical or communication impairments. This indicates that the level of exclus\nion can be linked to the type of impairment. \nM\nore research\n is required to better determine and understand the relationships between type of impairment and school access.\n \n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlan’s baseline\n research\n for the Girls Education Challenge Fund programme in \nfive d\nistricts in \nSierra Leone (to be published) found that\n girls with disabilities experience poorer\n educational outcomes\n, school attendance, and retention, than \nthose without disabilities, further legitimizing the need to focus on \ngirls \nwith disabilities \n in \nand outside of \neducation.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA s\ntudy from Plan Nepal showed that children with disabilities face specific challenges in accessing health and education services, due to structural, physical and attitudinal barriers\n.\n \nA Plan study from West Africa \nin Togo, Sierra Leone, Niger and Guinea, \nfound that stigma and discrimination against children with disabilities from parents, teachers, community members and policy-makers hinders their access to ed\nucation and protection services\n.\n \nS\nimilar \nfindings were m\nade through \nresearch in Guatemala\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nt is also crucial to note that children with disabilities are more vulnerable in disaster\n \nsituations\n, \nand in these contexts are at increased risk of violations of their rights to\n \nprotection, education and \nparticipation.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess\n to sexual and reproductive health services can be restricted for persons with disabilities. Disabled people are often assumed not to be sexually active\n,\n are not believed if they report sexual violence, and are often not appropriately involved in decisions about their sexual and reproductive health\n.\n \nPeople with learning disabilities and difficulties can face additional or heightened risks: \nsuch as\n, higher\n risks of sexual abuse, assault and rape\n,\n lower access to services, support, or redress, and forced sterilisation\n.\n D\nisabled children are also much more likely to suffer sexual violence and girls with disabilities are even more vulnerable.\n  Furthermore l\nack of access to sexual and \nreproductive health\n services has greater impact upon girls and women.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor every woman who dies as a result of pregnancy related complications, some twenty others face serious or long-lasting consequences.\n Harmful practices such\n as \nfemale genital mutilation (FGM), early and forced marriage\n, as well as poor sexual and reproductive health including high \nand frequent fertility can result\n in disabilities including obstetric fistula and uterine prolapse.  \nCurrently an estimated 2 \nmillion women in Asia and Sub Saharan Africa live with untreated fistula.\n \nA\nccording to a WHO multi-country study of 30,000 women on the obstetric effects of FGM, the relative risk of adverse maternal outcomes increased for women with FGM I, II or II as co\nmpared to women without FGM. Risks seem to be greater with more extensive FGM.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSexual Violence: \nThe risk of depression and anxiety\n is three to four times higher for those who have experienced \ngender-based violence\n, and around a third of all survivors of \nrape experience \nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n.\n  Sexual violence can result in acute and chronic physical disabilities, for example \nsevere pain during menstruation \nor prolonged menstrual bleeding, as well as long term \ngenital-anal trauma\n and\n sexually trans\nmitted infections\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlan UK recognises the work DFID has done on disability in the last 10 years, DFID’s work has placed the issue on the global development agenda. \nThis would be strengthened by a strategy \nfor \nthe integration of \ndisability \nissues \nacross all its projects.\n DFID’s\n recent commitments on disability are welcomed by Plan UK as they are an important signal to developing country partners and other donors to pr\nioritise disabled people. Plan has seen this commitment through its GEC programme funding. \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPlan’s GEC programme interventions focus on poor rural girls, within this group, girls with disabilities are more marginalised with 76% estimated to be out of scho\nol\n due to discrimination, stigma and a lack of inclusive education opportunities, adequately trained teachers or accessible facilities. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) approach involves the whole community to foster educational inclusion. Disab\nility will be mainstreamed through all interventions and accessibility needs addressed in terms of materials, communication and venue selection where relevant. It is assumed that \nchildren with disabilities\n are even l\ness likely to reach the end of p\nrimary S\nchool and make the transition to \njunior secondary school\n, and therefore most of the direct support for disabled children with focus on their enrolling/re-enrolling in Primary.  \n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are early on in the programme but we have some lessons learnt already, including that working with children with disabilities in a rural setting is \na more \nresource intensive exercise\n than anticipated\n. \nChildren with disabilities\n are often \nhidden by famil\nies, and to ensu\nre their specific needs are met requires specialist expertise and raising community awareness of  \nthe \nrights\n of children with disabilities\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCase Study: \nChildren with disabilities pushed out of school. One \nchild with disability \nin Kailahun\n,\n Sierra Leone\n was a girl \nwith albinism \nwho had \na visual impairment\n. She was no longer in school. She had hoped to \npass junior secondary school three\n, and was determined to make it as far as the disability would allow. Then, she got pregnant. She told her \ninterviewer, “Yes I have been mistreated sexually and physically and also insulted by my teachers and colleagues in school. When I decided to leave school it was because I was impregnated by some guys I didn't know. Because of my poor eyesight I can’t reme\nmber them, so they denied responsibility.” After she became pregnant the school refused to let her continue.\n&#xa0;5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nData: The \nnumber \nof \ngirls with disabilities \nreported in Plan’s baseline household survey \nare \nlikely to be much lower than \nin reality\n. T\nhis reflect\ns the lack of \ndata available on \nchildren with disabilities\n, due to their exclusion\n and the underreporting by community members due to stigma and lack of awareness. \n&#xa0;\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAttitudes: Plan’s \nbaseline survey\n for the GEC\n \nwas a\nlso revealing \naround \nnon disabled schoo\nl age \ngirls’ \nattitudes\n \non\n \nthe\n education\n of children with disabilities\n. \nA\n majority of girls believe it \nis okay for children who have d\nisabilities \nnot \nto \ngo to school\n. 23\n% of \ngirls who have physical disabilities believe that it is okay for \ngirls like themsel\nves \nnot\n to\n get an education\n. This might indicate the way \nchildren with disabilities \n are treated in school,\n \nif their colleagues do not believe it is important for them to be there, and more than that, are contributing to  perception of themselves as not worthy of \nbeing at \nschool.\n This also illustrates the wider community’s perceptions of the value and capabiliti\nes \nof children with disabilities,\n much of the internalisation of these perceptions will start at a young age\n. And \ndemonstrates the importance of home and family \neducation\n and thee need for parents to accept disabled children\n and \nc\nhang\ning\n attitudes and stig\nma \nof parents i\ns the first step to inclusion. \n&#xa0;5.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChildren with disabilities face discrimination and abuse in school Nearly every single child with disability  interviewed in each district \nidentified \nverbal and physical harassment as  the main reason for lea\nving school. Many also said that they (or their parents) had brought the abuse to their teachers’ attention, but intervention (if any) had been ineffective. A \ngirl with disability \n in Moyamba noted “only my colleagues would disturb and mock me. I do report\n to the teachers so the teacher \nin return will flog the people. M\ny colleagues laugh at me because I am unable to talk, so that made me drop out of school.” Some\n children with disabilities\n even described abuse from the teachers themselves\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOverall recommendation: Plan \nUK \nis calling for DFID \nto \ndevelop an overarching disability inclusive development strategy\n, with focus areas including access to quality education, protection from violence and meaningful participation in decisions and \nacross its work\n \nwith \nchildren with disabilities \nto focus on \nthose most vulnerable \nas a result of \nintersecting inequalities incl\nuding gender and poverty.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability strategy Plan UK supports the recommendations made by the Global Campaign for Education and the Bond Disability and Development group for DFID to implement a twin-track approach to disability which would involve: \nDevelopment of such a strategy must be done through a process of consultation with persons with disabilities, including children. \n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEnsure children with disabilities have access to a quality education. A quality education is one that is grounded in respect for human rights and gender equity, that is accessible to all children without discrimination, and one in which all children are encouraged to fulfil their \ncapabilities.  It includes a learning environ\nment that is learner-friendly, safe and healthy for all children with mechanisms to prevent and respond to violence.  A quality education is accountable to children through the participation of children, families and communities in school governance and de\ncision –making. \n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nActivities required to ensure this include \ntraining\n for\n all\n teachers to ensure they can support the education of children with disabilities. \nC\nurriculum adaptation and improved accessibility\n are also required\n, alongside raising public awar\neness on the rights to quality education for all children\n and initiatives to challenge discrimination against children with disabilities within the school community\n.\n Children with disabilities should also have access to\n \nearly childhood care and development (ECCD), which \nhas been \nshown to provide immense benefits for children throughout life\n and to \nhelp them \nreach their full potential\n. Inclusive ECCD is also a critical pathway to education\n alongside the resources, both mat\nerial and capacity building needed to integrate inclusive education into all teacher training\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll children with disabilities are protected from violence: both within a\nnd outside of school contexts, \nr\nights \nof \nc\nhildren with disabilities \nto protection from violence \nm\nust be secured. P\nrotection \nsystems\n \nneed to be\n resourced to focus on \nand be accessible to \nthe most vulnerable\n. \n&#xa0;\n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll children with disabilities can meaningfully participate in decisions that affect them - \nunless girls and boys w\nith disabilities are consulted and involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of interventions across all sectors then \nthe interventions\n \nwill not meet their needs and \nchildren with disabilities \nwill be left behind.  \n&#xa0;\n6.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImprove data collection - DFID’s focus on the data revolution can be used to address the paucity of data on children with disabilities. \nPlan supports the recommendation made by \nUNICEF in \nits report \nT\nhe\n \nState of the World’s Children: Children with Disabilities\n that for children with\n disabilities\n, ‘\nmany of their deprivations stem from and are perpetuated by their invisibility\n… \nthere is a need for research to render more children visible by improvi\nng data collection and analysis’\n.\n \nResearch \non people with disabilities \nshould be disaggr\negated \nby \nage, \ngender\n, location, wealth quintile and type of impairment. This data \nshould be used to track the progress of disadvantaged and marginalised groups across all goals, targets and indicators\n within the post-2015 framework\n. T\nhe negotiations \naround the post-\n2015 development framework are a key moment for the UK government, DFID and FCO to push for this change to data collection within the framework.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nOrtoleva, S and Lewis, H.(2012), Forgotten Sisters - A Report on Violence Against Women with\nDisabilities: An Overview of its Nature, Scope, Causes and Consequences.\n Njelesani,\n \nD, Njelesani, J, Hashemi, G, Cameron, C, Cameron, D and Parnes,P\n.
