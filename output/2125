[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Localised and simplified regulation linked to a clearly defined vision for the community and place. Local regulators work with businesses across the country on a daily basis to cut red tape and help them comply with the law. This creates an environment where businesses have the confidence to invest, grow and create new jobs. Our
[normal] ambition is for local government to be able to work with businesses in a local area to understand risks and determine what level of regulation is appropriate. Local trading standards, environmental health and licensing services are well placed to free up businesses from unnecessary regulation and can design and operate a scheme which is right for business and right for local communities, without central direction and prescription.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A ‘local treasury’ and place based budgets to provide the incentive for a local budget for growth and choice, rather than individual budgets to fund individual services. A ‘local treasury’ could have the ability to flex business rates, and other taxes including, for example, tourist or sales taxes to support local economies. This model would also offer democratic empowerment by establishing an agreement between councils and taxpayers on the level of local taxation and their choices on spending decisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A changed relationship between universities and cities and counties to link education more strongly to local economies. Despite the ground-breaking work of many university vice-chancellors who are playing an important role in driving a LEP or helping to attract inward investment into their locality, there are few financial incentives for the higher education sector to support their local economy. A ‘local treasury’ could provide such incentives to universities, to link innovation and education to the local economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The development of clearer employer involvement in schools’ work on education outcomes, and the local leadership of skills and jobs initiatives, orchestrated through local government and linked to the needs of the local economic sub-region. These reforms are essential to tackle the 20% youth unemployment rate and the shocking skills mismatch we face. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The following comments have been tested against the principles outlined in “Rewiring Public Services”
[normal] 
[normal]and are in order of the clauses as they appear in the draft of the Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Apprenticeships (Clause 3)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Target sectors are currently set by the National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) centrally without consideration to variations in local economic conditions. As a result, apprenticeship priority areas make little sense to businesses in a number of places. For example, none of the current priority NAS sectors have resonated with Wolverhampton’s local economy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]National statistics have cast doubt on the mixed performance of the apprenticeship system over successive administrations. In 2011 almost 70 per cent of new apprenticeship opportunities were taken by over 25s, one fifth of all apprenticeships lasted less than 6 months, and 84 per cent of the growth was in just 10 narrow occupations (source: National Audit Office, Adult Apprenticeships, 2012).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is a positive step that employers themselves will help to determine apprenticeship sectors nationally, but it will be important to ensure smaller employers, or those in more unique and growing sectors, do not lose out. Local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships know their businesses best and can play a critical role in supporting them to grow and benefit from opportunities to take on apprentices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local models are succeeding. Apprenticeship Hubs, Apprenticeship Training Associations and other efforts prove the added value of local leverage over provision. Essex County Council’s apprenticeship drive focused on key local growth sectors like marine technology, aviation, ports and logistics. It exceeded its target by 10 per cent, working with employers to help over 1,250 individuals into 
[normal]apprenticeships of which 80 per cent successfully completed, much higher that 64 per cent average for national apprenticeship schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are various options to build in local leverage with minimum bureaucracy, for example giving Local Enterprise Partnerships a role in setting the priority investment sectors for their area with the National Apprenticeship Service. This could include a ring-fenced amount of funding, targeted at growth sectors in each area, and continuing to support the development of apprenticeship hubs across all LEP areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are various options to build in local leverage with minimum bureaucracy, for example giving LEPs a role in setting the priority investment sectors for their area with the National Apprenticeship Service, as highlighted in paragraph 7.5.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important that employers drive a high quality apprenticeship system, but it is also important that people and communities are able to benefit from public investment. Local authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure more vulnerable group, such as young people leaving care, the homeless or disabled people, are supported towards employment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Despite having this responsibility, councils are side-lined from key provisions able to help more vulnerable groups towards work. The apprenticeships and new traineeships programmes aim to build a stronger relationship between providers and employers, which is important, but this should not be to the detriment of local authorities and the third sector groups looking out for the most vulnerable. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local authorities are already trying to this and are having some success, but this is in spite of the system rather than because of it. Newcastle City Council has developed an Apprenticeship Plus scheme, which helps young people to gain an apprenticeship. It supports young people in interview preparation and application, and for those not successful, it offers additional support to fill skills and pre-employment gaps.
[normal] 
[normal]Hertfordshire County Council has reduced youth disengagement by 20 per cent, including a number of ‘at risk’ groups, by embedding apprenticeships and skills support into a wider five stage offer including basic skills and family support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important that local authorities are able to influence the market of provision on the behalf of these vulnerable groups, ensuring providers are incentivised to help them and linking it to other support they may be receiving. Without it, harder to help groups will continue to miss out. There are a number of ways that this could be achieved, for example by devolving additional incentive funding to local partnerships that can target specific companies to help specific groups of people.

[normal]Eighty-four per cent of councils say there are more cost-effective ways to publish public notices, such as on websites and direct emails.

[normal]42 per cent of councils are charged more by local newspapers to publish public notices than for other general advertising and the costs are continuing to rise.

[normal]We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems. The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and 
[normal]accountable
[normal] part of the public sector.
