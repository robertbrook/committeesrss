[[[&#xa0;]]]Introduction

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research Councils UK (RCUK) is a strategic partnership set up to champion the research supported by the seven UK Research Councils. RCUK was established to enable the Councils to work together more effectively to enhance the overall impact and effectiveness of their research, training and innovation activities, and contributing to the delivery of the Government’s objectives for science and innovation. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This response is submitted by RCUK on behalf of the following research councils:

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Antimicrobial resistance has been of growing concern to RCUK for the past few years and we are encouraged that the profile has been raised at the highest levels.  We welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Committee and have focused on those questions that fall within our combined remit and expertise.&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The challenges raised by antimicrobial resistance require a broad approach. This approach should encompass new therapeutic agents, alternative strategies for controlling disease, diagnostics, surveillance, modelling, transmission dynamics as well as health systems, behaviour change and implementation -all built on strong underpinning biology of the organisms and the hosts.&#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The research councils’ broad remits allow support to address antimicrobial resistance across the whole of the research spectrum. However, the level of activity needed to address this issue can only be achieved through collaborative working, bringing together disciplines in a coordinated way.  This will require a coordinated response between the research councils, government departments, other research funders in the UK and industry.&#xa0;Response&#xa0;What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance? &#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Antimicrobial resistance has been of growing concern to RCUK for the past few years and the research councils have identified a number of gaps and areas of research need. Activities that have helped inform priorities include an MRC meeting in July 2013 to identify research needs in this area and joint research council work with the Wellcome Trust to investigate why there has been a lack of development in the pharma pipeline, and with EU partners to identify gaps and opportunities. Also, in February 2013 STFC and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) organised a workshop looking at gaps in research knowledge resulting in an RUSI Occasional Paper, “Tackling Antimicrobial Resistance: Identifying Future Research Themes”. &#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ESRC is monitoring closely the current NIHR themed call in antimicrobial resistance with a view to determining any future research needs in the social and behavioural sciences.&#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is clear that across the UK there is expertise in a range of disciplines that could be brought to bear on the following issues:&#xa0;&#xa0;This is not an exhaustive list - there are a range of research areas across the councils that could impact antimicrobial resistance.&#xa0;9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Antibacterial resistance is also an important issue for animal health – from an animal health, welfare and production perspective and also concerns around the potential risk to humans of antibiotic resistance in zoonotic organisms (although the EU has banned all non-therapeutic use of antibiotics). There is a gap in our understanding of the extent to which antimicrobial resistance arises from animal sources versus humans, and the extent to which antimicrobial resistance (specifically antibiotic resistance) has been transferred from animals (see, for example, recent studies on the origins of MRSA). Further work on how changes in farm business models impact use of antibiotics would also be helpful.&#xa0;10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In addition to antibacterial resistance, the issue of anthelminthic resistance is a major problem for the farming industry.  Anthelminthics are used to treat helminth parasites and protozoa infestation in ruminants, pigs and poultry and unlike antibiotics there are only three major families of anthelmintic drugs. Widespread resistance to these drugs has been reported in most UK sheep farms.&#xa0;11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Advances in disease surveillance and point-of-care diagnostics, and particularly the application of rapid whole genome sequencing, are likely to change the antimicrobial market over the next 10-15 years. Molecular diagnostic tools can also be used to track the spread of resistant organisms and identify if an organism has become resistant to a particular treatment.  &#xa0;12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Currently, however, development of reliable, high throughput and rapid diagnostic systems, ideally capable of operating successfully in a clinical rather than laboratory environment remains a significant gap. Research challenges here include data mining for biomarker discovery, advanced nanomaterials, microfluidics, sensor systems, microelectronics and telecommunications. For disease surveillance there are big data research challenges to be addressed such as innovative web-tracking technologies and mathematical modelling of epidemics.  &#xa0;13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The research councils, often in partnership with the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), are investing in a number of projects to develop and test novel diagnostics.  For example, EPSRC has recently established an £11 million interdisciplinary research centre in University College London to create a new generation of early-warning sensing systems for diagnosis, monitoring and prevention of the spread of infectious diseases.  The MRC has worked in partnership with TSB to fund research on the detection and identification of infectious agents.  Despite this investment, diagnostics remains priority area for the field.&#xa0;14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The MRC, on behalf of the UK research councils and biomedical research funders, has been working with colleagues from EU member and accession states on a Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance.  As part of this activity, a strategic research agenda is being developed and is due to be launched in March 2014.  This will highlight a range of gaps and opportunities to be addressed through international cooperation.  The research agenda will be broad encompassing scientific, societal and environmental challenges.&#xa0;Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified? &#xa0;15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In May 2013 BBSRC, MRC and the Wellcome Trust supported a one day symposium ‘Lessons to be learnt from Pharma about drug discovery and development of new antibacterial drugs’, organised by Antibiotic Action.  The report noted that: &#xa0;‘New antibiotic development has slowed alarmingly in recent decades, and the antibiotic development pipeline is poorly stocked. This lack of activity reflects ‘market failure’ – pharmaceutical companies have retreated from antibiotic development as the risk–reward ratio has been considered unattractive’.  &#xa0;16.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The supply pipeline of new therapeutic agents is seen by many as a commercial issue but directed R&amp;D in partnership with the research councils could increase the efficiency of the search for new therapeutic agents, identification of new ones and improved the development processes for getting to market.&#xa0;17.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, the major impediment to drug discovery is the current economic model which makes private sector investment by large pharmaceutical companies less attractive in this area than many others (e.g. chemotherapy and treatments for long term degenerative disorders). There are discussions around changing the business models to make discovery more attractive for industry partners and research into new business models could be taken forward by the ESRC and/or TSB.&#xa0;18.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The level of investment from the pharmaceutical industry will need to be addressed by that sector.  However, BBSRC, EPSRC and the MRC all invest significantly in research on basic microbiology and on antimicrobial resistance.  In 2011/2012 the MRC, BBSRC and EPSRC invested approximately £19.6m in antimicrobial resistance research. This excludes major investments into the underpinning basic biology of the organisms or the hosts. However, EPSRC’s investment includes developing epidemiological models of infectious diseases, techniques to diagnose and monitor infectious diseases and novel antimicrobial therapeutics/agents in response to drug resistance.   &#xa0;19.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of investment directly into developing new antibiotics or treatments, there has been major investment by the European Commission and European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). To date, the Commission and EFPIA have jointly committed €431m to five AMR consortia - approximately a quarter of all IMI research commitment.  The MRC is the BIS appointed UK representative on the State Representative Group for the IMI.&#xa0;20.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a broad recognition that the purely genomic approach used by some pharmaceutical companies to identify new targets over the past 10 years has not yielded results.  The research councils consider that a more holistic approach is needed to better understand cellular mechanisms, identify putative targets through genomics but couple this with whole-cell based assays and better animal models. &#xa0;21.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The research councils recognise that there is much they can do to support drug discovery and development at earlier stages.   Improved target identification and validation is needed with better screening to ensure that putative targets are “druggable” and that attacking the target will effectively kill the organism.  This should also include screening for resistance at the earliest stages.  Research should continue on proven targets as well as identifying new targets.  &#xa0;22.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; New approaches might include the application of novel chemistry to discover new targets, to manipulate current drugs to prevent resistance, and to potentially rescue old compounds which have not reached the clinic due to toxicity or lack of efficacy.  In addition to novel chemistry, synthetic biology can create novel advantageous analogues of known antibiotics and apply structure-informed de novo drug-design to overcome resistance mechanisms, toxicity issues and, importantly to ensure that drugs are able to enter the organisms.  &#xa0;23.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There also remains a large untapped resource of microbial, plant and animal sources and underexplored environmental niches that may yield novel molecules and scaffolds on which to base new antibiotics.  Exploration of these sources in a thorough and co-ordinated way may offer new treatments for infectious diseases.&#xa0;24.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Opportunities exist for disease control strategies that avoid the use of antimicrobial drugs/agents such as the developing novel vaccines, including veterinary vaccines, against bacterial infection or immunotherapies for the bacteria or the toxins they produce. &#xa0;25.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; More broadly the control and transmission of infection is effected via people, surfaces, interfaces and materials (including those within medical devices, dressings etc.) that come into contact with other humans, animals and the environment. Opportunities exist for frontier research at the interface between advanced materials, engineering sciences, modelling, pharmaceutical sciences, life sciences, behavioural and clinical science.&#xa0;26.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is the research councils’ view that development and front-line deployment of a viable and cost effective means of addressing the challenge requires a broad focus encompassing new therapeutic agents, alternative strategies for controlling disease, diagnostics, surveillance, modelling, transmission dynamics, health care systems and behaviour change all built on strong underpinning biology of the organisms and the hosts.&#xa0;27.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This level of activity can only be achieved through collaborative working, bringing together disciplines and sectors in a coordinated way.  This will require a coordinated response between the research councils and other funders in the UK as well as industry.&#xa0;28.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Research will also need to cross human/animal boundaries. Multidisciplinary collaborations between researchers working on AMR in organisms present in humans, animals and the environment under a ‘one health’ approach is important to the strategy for investment in AMR research.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?&#xa0;29.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Global coordination will be required for a number of activities.  For example, detection and monitoring, both nationally and internationally, of the emergence and spread of both new diseases and new antibiotic strains of existing disease-causing organisms. This could also cover surveillance of resistance strains and transmission dynamics of resistance.  The UK has been actively engaged, along with a number of other countries, in the International Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Consortium.  This has established a global network of networks to monitor respiratory infections globally and could serve as a model for antimicrobial resistance monitoring.&#xa0;30.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In terms of coordinating research, the UK, represented through the MRC, has on-going participation in the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance.  This aims to streamline the European research efforts in antimicrobial resistance by joint planning, implementation and evaluation of national research programmes.  This will lead to the launch of an interdisciplinary research agenda and other research councils will be invited to partner initiatives within their respective fields.&#xa0;31.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK has also worked with Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) to set up research collaborations across the two countries directly focussed on antimicrobial resistance. Two consortia are currently funded by the MRC and CIHR, totalling £4m.&#xa0;32.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; BBSRC is a partner in the Global Strategic Alliance for the Coordination of Research on the Major Infectious Diseases of Animals and Zoonoses. The Alliance is considering alternatives to antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance as a cross-cutting strategic theme.

[[[&#xa0;]]]What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?&#xa0;33.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government’s strategy has shown an inclusive approach and highlights a number of key areas for a range of stakeholders to engage with.  It provides a global perspective and promotes interdisciplinary research, with a call to address some challenging areas of research. &#xa0;34.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We recognise that the action plan is primarily focused on antibacterial resistance as this is the most significant problem for humans. The links with the Chief Veterinary Officer are strong and we welcome the recommendations made.  However, the strategy could have given more emphasis to disease prevention strategies such as vaccination, especially in animals, as this would reduce antibiotic use.&#xa0;35.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Potential weaknesses may include lack of mention of knowledge exchange, especially as research encouraged by the strategy will be highly interdisciplinary.  Also, the implementation will need to be addressed.  Plans for this are discussed in the strategy however the research councils would welcome involvement at all levels to help ensure a joined up approach.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0; Further details are available at www.rcuk.ac.uk  Cole, J (ed). 2013.
