"&#xa0;\nT W M Eccles – Written evidence&#xa0;\nI am writing to you as a countryside walker of over 30 years, who has seen many Green Lanes changed from beautiful grassy accesses to ugly, deeply-rutted \ndeadzones\n created by the use of recreational vehicles which have no place in such scenic rural areas.\n&#xa0;\nThese green lanes were created many, many years ago as access routes to be used on foot and by pac\nk animals for trade associated \npurposes, and they were never designed for use by motor cycles and 4x4s which have severely \ndefaced  them\n over recent years.\n&#xa0;\nThese vehicles create deep ruts which destroy vegetation and the soil structure, and when 4x4s can no longer traverse them, the drivers merely create adjacent new ruts, and the result is the creation  of ever-widening areas of dead ground carved through areas of outstanding natural beauty.\n&#xa0;\nI enclose several photographs of \nDeadman’s\n Hill, \nNidderdale\n, North Yorkshire, showing damage caused to this access by recreational traffic.  It is in far worse condition than the green lane I knew when I first walked this area many years ago, and if you were able to visit this area near Scar House and \nAngram\n reservoirs you would be able to experience the devastation caused by recreational vehicles.\n&#xa0;\nI support the following two proposals and trust that they may be incorporated in the current Deregulation Bill:\n&#xa0;\n1. All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should, be re-classified as Restricted Byways.\n&#xa0;\n2. When a Local Authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or a magistrate.\n&#xa0;\nI shall be glad if you will kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter and enclosed photographs.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
