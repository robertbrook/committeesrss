"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from William Thomson (HSR 013)\n&#xa0;\nIn assessing the regional economic appraisal of HS2 you may wish to review a recently-published report on the \nDfT\n website, “Assessment of Methods for Modelling and Appraisal of the Sub-National, Regional and Local Economy Impacts of \nTransport”:\n&#xa0;\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modelling-and-appraisal-of-the-sub-national-regional-\nand-local-economy-impacts-of-transport\n&#xa0;\nThe report, produced for the Department by MVA consultants, assesses a number of appraisal methods. It finds strengths and weakness in all of them but appears particularly negative about the KPMG method (a slightl\ny earlier version used for \nGreengauge\n 21 but producing similar results). The key points can be found on page 54, where KPMG's estimates of GDP are described as “\nimplausibly high\n”.\n&#xa0;\nThe report seems to attribute fewer strengths and more weaknesses to KPMG's\n method than to most others reviewed.\n&#xa0;\nMy own concern is not only with the estimates of overall GDP (in any case, any attempt to quantify such effects decades into the future inevitably leaves far too many hostages to fortune to be of much value). Of equal\n, perhaps even greater, concern is the more the likely spatial distribution of benefit: while there must also be much uncertainty about these most of the (impartial) evidence points towards a likely re-balancing towards, rather than away, from London. KPMG\n's attempt to 'prove' otherwise seems particularly implausible, and – in the absence of any other meaningful regional strategy for England – potentially damaging.\n&#xa0;\nLondon's economy is of great importance to the UK and should be supported. HS2 may indeed he\nlp by providing more rail capacity. However, if Government is also genuine in its intent to boost the economies of the Midlands and the North relative to the capital (and to provide some relief to its population, house price and infrastructure pressures) t\nhen HS2 seems at best a distraction, and at worst counter-productive.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
