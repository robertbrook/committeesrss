defaultSUBMISSION FOR THE INCLUSION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE EXISTING PROVISIONS FOR THE INSTALLATION OF CATTLE GRIDS (SECTIONS 82-89 AND SCHEDULE 10 HIGHWAYS ACT 1980
defaultPart 1 – Clause 16defaultSuggested Further Amendment Number One
defaultThis section applies to all highways other than a classified road or a special road.
default&#xa0;
default1. The inclusion of restricted byways and byways open to all traffic is welcomed.
default2. There are minor roads which are neither type of byway but which have, or could usefully have,
default gates for the same purposes.
default3. The exclusions are based on section 116 Highways Act 1980
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSuggested Further Amendment Number Two
defaultThe words
default “for enabling the footpath or bridleway to be used” aredefault added to subsection (2).
default&#xa0;
default4. In Kind
default v Northumberland County Council [2012] EWHC 603 (Admin) at defaulthttp://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2012/603.htmldefaultat
default paragraph 17 the Court suggested additional wording for section 147 (my emphasis):
default17. Although I have some sympathy for the argument that a broader approach should be taken to the interpretation of section 147(2), I am unable to accept it. Section 147(1) refers to a "footpath or bridleway that crosses the land", an expression that is apt to refer to the whole line of the route. By contrast section 147(2) refers to the exercise of "the right of way", an expression which naturally directs attention to the nature of that right. 
defaultIf in section 147(2) Parliament had intended to refer to the path or bridleway as a whole, I have little doubt that it would have used the expression "for enabling the footpath or bridleway to be used", or some similar wordsdefault. Moreover, I am 
defaultunable to accept Miss 
defaultStockley’s
default submission that the appellant’s interpretation of section 147 is unworkable in practice. What constitutes "undue inconvenience to the public" will vary from case to case, depending, no doubt on the nature and location of the footpath or bridleway in question. Each case has to be considered on its own facts and the highway authority must make its own judgment when deciding what conditions to impose. 
default5. Adoption of this phrase would provide greater flexibility for landowners, famers and highway authorities without practically detracting from the rights of the public to use a public highway.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSuggested Further Amendment Number Three
default&#xa0;
defaultA further subsection is added to section 147
default“Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, a highway authority may grant consent under this section for the installation of a cattle grid across the entire width of a highway on the condition that a bypass is provided at all times and for the purpose of this section “bypass” shall have the same meaning as in section 82(6) [of the Highways Act 1980].
default&#xa0;
default6. The issue in 
defaultKind v Northumberland (above) 
defaultrelated to the provision of a cattle grid across a three metre wide public bridleway. The bridleway was along a straight farm access at that point. The highway authority allowed the cattle grid on condition that a bypass was provided. The Court found against the highway authority.
default7. This provision would allow greater common sense to be used by highway authorities when balancing the interests of farmers and the highway users.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultPart 2 – New provisionsdefaultSuggested Further Provision
defaultIn sections 82-89 and Schedule 10 [Highways Act 1980] references to ministerial approval are deleted
default&#xa0;
default8. Sections 82-89 and Schedule 10 Highways Act 1980 provide an elaborate system for authorising the installation of cattle grids.
default9. The provisions are derived from the Highways (Provision of Cattle Grids) Act 1950. 
defaultHansard
default makes it clear 
defaultthat
default cattle grids were a new phenomenon at that time.
default10. In my experience, highway officers and landowners/farmers were put off from replacing gates with cattle grids because of the cost of the procedure.
default11. Is there now any need for ministerial consent? I suggest that cattle grids should be treated in the same way as other installations within the highway and left to the local highway authority.
