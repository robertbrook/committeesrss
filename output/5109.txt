[[[(BTO0012)]]]Declaration of interestProMetic BioSciences Ltd has developed products and technology for the capture of prion infectivity from human blood and plasma products and as a consequence has a financial interest in prion safety of blood products.Executive Summary-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ProMetic Biosciences, in collaboration with the American Red Cross, has developed a technology based upon selective adsorption of prion proteins which enables the capture of vCJD infectivity from human blood and blood-derived components and products.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ProMetic’s  technology, commonly referred to as prion filtration, has been incorporated into a medical device (P-Capt™) developed in conjunction with and commercialized by Macopharma SA which provides increased blood safety by removal of vCJD infectivity (if present) from Red Blood Cell Concentrates (RBC). -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The P-Capt device obtained CE Mark approval in 2006, and since this time has been under evaluation by the UK’s National Blood Service (NHSBT) but never implemented.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The same technology, in a different format, has been used successfully by Swiss company Octapharma AG to provide an increased level of prion safety for virally-inactivated (S/D-treated) plasma for transfusion.  Octaplas LG™ manufactured using ProMetic’s prion reduction technology has been approved for human administration in several countries including the UK. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the absence of a commercial blood test with sufficient sensitivity and robustness for use in routine blood donor screening, the adoption of prion filtration would provide increased protection against the transmission of vCJD via blood and blood-derived products.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Prion reduction technology constitutes a safe and proven approach to improving the safety of blood products independent of the availability of a vCJD blood screening test.
