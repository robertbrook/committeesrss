A level crossing is where a road crosses a railway or tramway line. Approach and cross it with care. Never drive onto a \ncrossing until the road is clear on the other side and do not get too close to the car in front. Never stop or park on, or near, a crossing.\n292. Overhead electric lines it is dangerous to touch overhead electric lines. You \nMUST obey the safe height warning road signs and you should not continue forward onto the railway if your vehicle touches any height barrier or bells. The clearance available is usually 5 metres (16 feet 6 inches) but may be lower. \nLaws RTA 1988 sect 36, TSRGD 2002 reg 17(5)293. Controlled Crossings. Most crossings have traffic light signals with a steady amber light, twin flashing red stop lights (\ndownload ‘Light signals controlling traffic’ (PDF, 82KB)\n and \n‘Traffic signs’ (PDF, 486KB)\n) and an audible alarm for pedestrians. They may have full, half or no barriers.\n294. Railway telephones. If you are driving a large or slow- moving vehicle, a long, low vehicle with a risk of grounding, or herding animals, a train could arrive before you are clear of the crossing. You \nMUST obey any sign instruct\ning you to use the railway telephone to obtain permission to cross. You \nMUST also telephone when clear of the \ncrossing if requested to do so: \nLaws RTA 1988 sect 36 &amp; TSRGD regs 10 &amp; 16(1)295. Crossings without traffic lights. Vehicles should stop and wait\n at the barrier or gate when it begins to close and not cross until the barrier or gate opens.\n296. User-operated gates or barriers. Some crossings have ‘Stop’ signs and small red and green lights. You \nMUST NOT cross when the red light is showing, only cro\nss if the green light is on. If crossing with a vehicle, you should\n297. If there are no lights, follow the procedure in Rule 295. Stop, look both ways and listen before you cross. If there is a railway telephone, always use it to contact the signal operator to make sure it is safe to \ncross. Inform the signal operator again when you are clear of the crossing.\n298. Open crossings. These have no gates, barriers, attendant or traffic lights but will have a ‘Give Way’ sign. You should look both ways, listen and make sure there is no train c\noming before you cross. \n299. Incidents and breakdowns. If your vehicle breaks down, or if you have an incident on a crossing you should\nAnnex BTransport Select CommitteeInquiry into Safety at Level Crossings&#xa0;iPhone app screenshot\n&#xa0;Annex CTransport Select CommitteeInquiry into Safety at Level Crossings&#xa0;Examples of recently \npublished\n updates \nabout\n level crossings\n&#xa0;Twitter:You MUST NOT \ncross or pass a stop line on a level crossing when the red lights show, an alarm is sounding or barriers are being lowered.\n16 August 2013. \n&#xa0;\nTake extra care when driving close to/crossing tram tracks, especially in the wet, and when crossing rails on bend\ns and at junctions. \n30 July 2013.\n&#xa0;\nAt level crossings with user-operated barriers, you MUST NOT cross when the red light is showing, only cross if the green light is on.\n14 May 2013.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;DSA Direct:All of rule 300 in an email alert about tramways.\n26 June \n2013.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Annex DTransport Select CommitteeInquiry into Safety at Level Crossings&#xa0;Theory test case study example\n&#xa0;\nYou are driving in the left-hand lane on a three-lane dual carriageway subject to the national speed limit.  It is a windy day \nand you are towing a small trailer which begins to snake. Ahead, in the centre lane, there is a slower moving motorcyclist that you intend to overtake.\nYou move into the center lane and the motorcyclist moves into the left-hand lane.  \nAfter leaving the du\nal carriageway you approach a half barrier level crossing. Flashing red lights are showing. Two trains pass before the barrier goes up. Further along the road you stop in heavy traffic. The car behind runs into the back of you. The driver is displaying a h\nelp pennant. You are carrying a red warning triangle.\n&#xa0;\nWhat should you do after seeing the first train pass?\n&#xa0;\nWait for the lights to go off and the barriers open\n&#xa0;\nLook left, right, left, and proceeds if clear\n&#xa0;\nLook right, left, right, and proceed if clear\n&#xa0;\nWait for the amber light and zigzag around the barriers\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Annex ETransport Select CommitteeInquiry into Safety at Level Crossings&#xa0;\nSection 3.1.3 of\n the National Standard\n&#xa0;Performance StandardsYou must be able to\n&#xa0;\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nKnowledge &amp; Understanding RequirementsYou must know and understand\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Annex FTransport Select CommitteeInquiry into Safety at Level Crossings&#xa0;DfT Report \nInvestigation into Traffic Delays at Level Crossings\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
