"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from pteg (LTD0031)\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npteg represents the six Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) which between them serve more than eleven million people in Tyne and Wear, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the West Midlands. Leicester and Nottingham City Counci\nls, \nBristol and the West of England, \nTransport for London and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport are associate members, though this response does not represent their views\n.\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe rationale is that making decisions locally about local transport \n(national transport networks and policy sh\nould remain the job of national government) \nwill be more effective than taking decisions by remote control from Whitehall\n,\n which lacks the local knowledge or the direct accountability for those decisions. The evidence that a devolved approach to local deci\nsion-making on transport is more effective is all around us. Transport in London has been transformed since powers over London's transport network were transferred from Whitehall to the Mayorality, with significant investment in giving London one of the be\nst bus services in the world, Oyster ticketing, overhaul of the London Underground, transformation of mainline terminals, the creation of the London Overground, and significant investment in cycling. Other real world examples of the benefits of devolution \ninclude the transformation of the performance and passenger satisfaction levels on the Merseyrail Electrics rail network since control was transferred from DfT to Mers\neytravel (Merseyside PTE) in 2003\n, and the significantly higher levels of investment in S\ncotland's rail network (including new trains, line re-openings and electrification) since responsibility for Scotrail was transferred to the Scottish Executive. \n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese transformations have occurred because devolved authorit\nies consistently give \nlocal trans\nport investment more priority than was the case with national government because locally accountable politicians see how important transport is to achieving wider economic, environmental and social goals.\n They are also held directly accountable to local el\nectorates for the quality and performance of local transport.\n \nThe positive experience of devolution is not restricted to the UK. Elsewhere in Europe cities and regions have far more influence over their local transport networks in terms of planning, managi\nng, developing and running those networks than is the case in England outside London. The ability of French Mayors to stand on a mandate of delivering a tram in their first five year term is one example of why so many more cities in France are benefitting \nfrom modern urban transit systems than is the case in Britain.\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe\n do not see any over-riding \ndisadvantages in moving arrangements in England to the next stage of\n devolution, especially given that city regions and LEP areas \nin some cases represent economies\n larger than Wales or Northern Ireland. \nOne of t\nhe key risks asso\nciated with this change that is most frequently cited is \nthe willingness of Government to devolve the necessary levels of funding to \nenable effective devolution. L\nocal bodies can only achieve\n the opportunities on offer -\n and be expected to bear the responsibili\nty for performance and outcomes -\n if funds are matched to powers. We believe that Government understands this in principle, through the advice it has received from Lord Heseltine in part\nicular. However, the level of funding that will be made available through \nmechanisms such as the Local \nG\nrowth \nF\nund\n is only a small proportion of that suggested in the Heseltine Review, and the Committee is encouraged to explore how this may be accelerated \nto maximise the future impact of devolution. \n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of other models\n,\n there is devolution or centralisation and various points between the two - there are no \nalternative models to being somewhere on the scale between the two.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResponsibilities for local tran\nsport planning are complicated, and getting more complex, \nin England outside London \n(\nwhich is one reason why we produced a short and concise guide \nto how transport works outside London\n)\n. \n \nHowever\n in the six largest urban conurbations outside London (Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear and West Midlands) for many years there have been Passenger Transport Executives\n.\n \nThese bodies have been respons\nible to Integrated Transport Authorities (and predecessor and successor bodies) made\n up\n of elected representatives. Their areas\n provide a generally good match with journey to work patterns\n,\n and the economic footprints of these conurbat\nions\n,\n which between t\nhem serve eleven\n million people. \n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernance is changing in the city regions with most areas adopting the Co\nmbined Authority model to which\n PTEs will become either part of, or responsible to (the arrangements will vary in different areas). However, the pri\nnciple holds that the strategic planning and oversight of transport in complex conurbations is best done at the city region level. PTEs (for simplicity we will describe PTEs and any successor bodies as PTEs) have the \nscale and capacity to assess and prioritise local transport schemes in a way that meets clear criteria as well as democratic oversight. A recent report for \npteg by JMP sets out how this is done in more detail\n.\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \noptimum body depends on local circumstances (especially given the complex politi\ncal, economic and transport geography of England outside London) however for strategic \ntransport decisions \n(though not necessarily for all local transport decisions) it should be a reasonable fit with journey to work patterns and with functional local \neconomies. It should have adequate capacity to be able to carry out its planning and oversight functions in an efficient and professional way and it should also have a clear element of democratic oversight. We believe that for the city regions\n,\n in the evol\nving role of the PTEs, these criteria have\n,\n and will be\n,\n met. \n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are challenges in two key areas. \nFirstly, \nPTEs lack sufficient powers and influence over the main forms of public transpo\nrt. Secondly,\n \nas with the rest of local government\n,\n resource spend\ning is being squeezed to such an extent that the capacity to plan and deliver capital schemes is being compromised. \n2.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn the former there\n is a need for responsibilities \nfor local rail networks to be devolved (as has already happened successfully in Scotland\n, on Merseyrail Electrics and on London Overground). \nBus services (the main form of public transport outside London and the South East) are deregulated outside London which means that PTEs can only provide services where commercial services have not been p\nrovided. PTEs (and local government elsewhere outside London) have t\nherefore very limited control over\n fares and service levels. There are powers in the Local Transport Act 2008 which strengthen the role of PTEs in a deregulated environment (and which are \nbeing deployed)\n,\n and also powers to introduce the franchising of bus services (the same system that is used to provide bus services in London) whic\nh Nexus (Tyne and Wear PTE) has\n triggered. Having limited abilities to plan public transport sets the PTEs ap\nart from TfL and counterparts for European cities. \n2.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, this could be changed if national government worked with the city regions in partnership and in a consistent way over a concerted period to devolve and enhance the powers that PTEs have o\nver publ\nic transport and \nto crack the obstacles that stand in the way of providing integrated public transport for the city regions. \n2.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn one area the DfT is doing thi\ns - through a joint programme of\n work on smart and integrated ticketing which is focussed primaril\ny on the six PTE areas and three next largest urban areas (Bristol, Nottingham and Leicester). However this approach is not r\neplicated for bus and rail where the DfT\n still \ntend\ns to operate in silos and is\n reluctant to either properly 'let go' of local publ\nic transport provision or to move beyond a \n‘\none size fits all\n’\n approach to devolution\n \nrather than \nmove towards \nadopt\ning\n different approaches which reflect the varied economic geography of England outside London and the capabilities and aspirations of the l\nocal transport authorities that serve it.\n \n2.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs set out above\n,\n one of the obstacles to devolution of transport decision maki\nng in England outside London is its complex economic and social geography. The best way of dealing with cross boundary schemes\n,\n or schemes with major\n cross-boundary\n impact\ns,\n is therefore to some extent determined by local circumstances\n,\n however there are some factors to consider. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ndifferent types of transport decisions may be best devolved to different tiers of sub-national governance. So for example decisions on local roads may be best dealt with at a relatively low level tier of local \ngovernment. Other decisions - for example in a city region - on local public transport netw\norks are best dealt with at the city region\n level. However\n,\n there are other issues that may best be dealt with at a higher tier - such as is proposed on a devolved N\northern Rail service. The principle is to devolve where possible to the most appropriate level of governance for the nature of the decision to be taken. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nwhatever arrangements are made for decision-making ther\ne\n will always \nbe boundary issues \nas boundaries \nhave to be drawn somewhere and there will still be journeys made across those boundaries. Although these boundary issues cannot be eliminated\n,\n they can be minimised if sensible and rational decisions \nare taken \nabout devolving the right decisions to the rig\nht level of governance\n. \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nif relatively low levels of local transport funding are devolved to small units of local government then there is a danger that no single area will have sufficient funding to build more expensive and significant schemes (where \nthey\n are justified). This \ncomes back to devolving to the appropriate tier of governance. Again the PTEs are an example of t\nhis as they are able to pool and prioritise expenditure across a meaningful area.\n2.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the city regions\n,\n the emerging model is for Combined Authorities (or District Leader-led bodies with similar characteristics) to determine the overall transport strategy; for them to del\negate more detailed oversight and po\nlicy development to successor \nbodies o\nf\n the Integrated Transport Authorities\n (made up of elected members)\n; and for \nstaff at the \nPTEs (or successor bodies) to implement these policies and deliver improvements on the groun\nd. This \nemerging model \nbuilds on the strengths of the existing model whilst providing strong\ner and more cohesive leadership at the top.\n \n2.14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe PTEs work effectively together through the \npteg network to \nshare good practice, co-procure and make a collective ca\nse for better transport for their areas. By doing things once\n,\n rather than six times\n,\n the savings for each PTE are considerable. \npteg is also now a wider professional network which brings\n together \nNott\ni\nngham, Leicester, Bristol and the West of England, Strathclyde and London. In terms of working with national government there is a good level of constructive contact between individual PTEs / \npteg and the\n DfT but\n:\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nprogress on devolution is fitful, slow and\n when it does come usually has many strings attached. This is true of both t\nhis\n,\n and the previous Government\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthere is still too much of a silo approach within DfT (on \nbus and rail in particular) \nwhich means the benefits of an integrated approach to the de\nvolution of local transport provision is not realised\n;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe significant cross-sectoral benefits of investment in transport are not sufficiently recognised. \nFor example buses get the workless to work, young people into education and training, older and disab\nled pe\nople out of isolation (with \nlong term health impacts), patients to ho\nspital appointments and provide\n links to new gr\nowth-promoting developments.\n Yet these hard benefits to othe\nr Government departments \nare\n not properly recogn\nised by those departments \nand are\n not reflected in the way that buses are funded (indeed funding is in decline). Although there has been some progress made recently on cross-departmental work (for example the £1m\nillion Department of Health contribution to national government’s cycl\ne ambition grants\n) there is a very long way to go. \n2.15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn terms of national agencies\n,\n there is good contact with key national bodies and agencies (like Network Rail, the Rail Delivery Group, Senior Traffic Commissioner) but again these bodies\n,\n perhaps unsurpr\nisingly\n,\n are strongly focussed on the dynamics of their own industries and become somewhat producer-led as a result. The benefits that devolution can bring in terms of ensuring these industries deliver the best outcomes on local transport can become an aft\nerthought as a result. \n2.16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npteg has been concerned that local transport spending outsi\nde London has fared poorly when compared with the three other major areas of DfT funding (London, National Rail and National Roads). Indeed in the 2010 Spending Review capital spend on local transport was the biggest loser of the four categories of spendin\ng\n with, for example, the main form of funding for local small to medium transport capital investment (the Integrated Transport Block) halved\n. \n \nFollowing concerted work by \npteg to improve and articulate the evidence b\nase\n,\n \nlocal transport spending outside \nLondon did much bet\nter in the 2013 Spending Review\n.  \n2.17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nH\nowever the DfT \n(relative to other Government departments) \nhas contributed a disproportionate amount of this \nenhanced funding to the\n Local Growth Fund\n. We do not therefore currently know how much of Df\nT\n's local transport capital budget wil\nl be spent on local transport because we do not know what the Local Growth Fund bids will be made up of, or the criteria for bidding. \nPlus given DfT made the largest contribution to the pot all other things being equal\n it’s unlikely that the relatively modest contributions from other Government departments will go to transport measures - more likely it will be the other way round. \n2.18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResource spending is \nalso \na major concern. For transport in the PTE areas the vast \nmajority of our resource budget (not including ring fenced rail funding\n from DfT\n) comes from constituent Districts, whose funding in turn comes from the CLG. The CLG cuts are also most severe in the areas we serve.\n \nFalling resource funding will have a maj\nor \nimpact in particular on a) bus service provision\n and b) the ability of local transport authorities to bid for, and deliver, capital schemes. We are already aware of cases where local transport authorities are not bidding for DfT capital funding competi\ntions due to no longer having the officers to do the work.\n2.19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also note that there remains a substantial funding gap with London with HMT figures showing that the total public spend per head on transport in London is 2.3 times greater than the spend per he\nad for the North of England \nand \nthe West Midlands combined\n. \n2.20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe further note that the Core Cities recent growth prospectus called for a dedicated funding stream for transport\n.\n \nGiven the scale of CLG resource \nfunding reductions, the current disparate capi\ntal DfT funding streams, and the disproportionate contribution of DfT local transport funding to the Local Growth Fund, \nthe case for a dedicated \ntransport funding stream is something the Committee may wish to consider.\n Especially if such \nfunding could give\n a \ndegree of medium to long term certainty - given the timescales for delivering transport capital programmes or achieving behaviour change (such as increasing cycling)\n.\n2.21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe deal with the impact of the Growth Fund in our response to Q\n5 above. Local Transport Bodies \nare one part of what is a complex environment for decision-making on local transport in the Metropolitan are\nas. Players include DfT, Highways Agency, the rail industry (in all its many post-privatisation manifestations), bus \noperators, local transport bodies\n, one or more mayors, PTEs, ITAs, Combined Authorities, one or more LEPs, District\n counc\nils.\n \nIn our areas \nit is the Combined Authority (and leader body with some similar characteristics in the West Midlands) that is the most significant development and will subsume the role\n of the Local Transport Bodies\n. The CA is significant on transport because unlike some o\nf the other new enti\nties (like Local Transport Bodie\ns) it has democratic accountability, legal status, resources (via its constituent Districts and PTEs), \nand \nis a good fit with the way economies and transport networks work in the city regions. \n2.22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is scope to realise both private and alternative\n funding streams\n,\n and indeed it is devolution that will make this more likely to happen because local decision-makers are better placed than Whitehall to identify potential private sector partners as well as any new local funding streams that have a chance\n of being politically and electorally viable given local circumstances. Examples include the workplace parki\nng levy in Nottingham \nand the Transport Funds in Greater Manchester and West York\nshire. \n2.23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, we note with concern that having made the West Yor\nkshire Transp\nort Fund a centrepiece of the Leeds City Region City Deal, \nthe CLG then went onto jeopardise the Fund through its proposals \nto include the council tax levy for the Fund within the wider 2% increase on council tax which would trigger a referend\num. A levy increase is\n a key element of the West Yorkshire Transport Fund and the possibility of a refer\nenda defeat effectively undermines\n what the Government had previously lauded. \n2.24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main way in which the Government could enhance the potential \nfor \nreal\nising new funding streams for local t\nransport is to \nrecognise the major challenges there are in raising new funding (particularly if it involves new forms of local taxation to pay for transport) and thus seek to maximise the funding freedoms available, so \nthat local government has a fighting chance of finding the particular form of funding that will work in their areas given local circumstances and politics. \n2.25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCu\nrrently PTE decision\n-making is highly accountable. \nIt is a\nccountable \nto ITAs (made of representatives of District Councils) and their successor bodies, and to current and emerging city region governance entities (most notably the Combined Authorities). The\n DfT also holds PTEs \nto account through its assessment and evaluation requirements and processes for capital spending funding streams.\n \nWe would argue that at present the DfT's organisational and technocratic hold over local transport decision-making in Eng\nland outside London is over-riding the accountability of local transport decision making to the local electorate to too great a degree. \n2.26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWinston Churchill \nsaid that democracy is the \nworst \nform of government\n,\n other than all the others that have been tried\n, \nand of course, as the least\n-\nworst system decisions are sometimes made that might be questi\nonable.\n But the overall record of the benefits of putting greater faith in local democratic accountability, over remote\n and technocratic\n control from the central stat\ne\n,\n is very strong as is demonstrated by\n:\n \nthe vitality and quality of transport provision in \ncities across Europe\n, and closer to home in \nLondon;\n and \nby \nthe rec\nord of rail devolution in Merseyside and Scotland.\n \nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nTransport Governance Outside \nLondon, pteg, May 2013\n \nDelivering successful Local Transport - the City Region Experience, JMP, October 2013\n \nTransport Number Crunch, pteg, February 2013\n \nHMT Spending Review Number Crunch,\n pteg, October 2013\n \nFair Future Growing Divide, SIGOMA, 2013\n \nBuses in Crisis, Campaign for Better Transport, December 2013\n \nFunding Gap report, pteg, December 2013\n \nGrowth Prospectus, Core Cities, November 2013\n"
