default1.  How best to protect minors from accessing adult contentdefaultFiltersdefaultThe vast majority of experts and childcare experts, including major children’s charities, agree that ISP level filters with a default of porn off, and an ‘opt-in’ for over 18s who wish to access all content, are currently the best way to protect minors.  What was announced by the 
defaultPrimer
default Minister in July was slightly different (all customers will be presented with an unavoidable choice to apply filters or not) but we applaud his work to have this introduced for all customers of the big 6 ISPs by the end of 2014.  However all ISPs should be included as soon as possible, and the system will only work properly if there is strict age verification.  Close monitoring is vital.  
defaultOfcom
default, given this task by the Prime Minister, must without 
defaultdelay develop
default clear standards, with which all ISPs should be required to comply.  Ongoing monitoring will also be 
defaultkey
default.
defaultRecent research from the magazine PC Pro (Sept 2013) shows that 80% of parental controls fail to filter explicit material, with only 3 out of 5 of the most popular website filters being 100% effective in blocking pornography.   This is an egregious situation for parents and carers and demonstrates clearly the need for automatic ISP level filters.
defaultISP level filters should apply to all internet-enabled devices including:

default phones.   All 3G networks offer content filtering and it works well enough.  However 
defaultVoda
default, EE and O2 all let VPNs and proxy servers through, so if you know how, you can bypass the filters.
defaultVodaphone
default and EE (tested by our technical adviser) do not enable Google safe search and so a simple search for obvious keywords and clicking on images yields lots of images. But usually if you click on one to go to the website, the content blocker will block it.   This is something Google really needs to do more work on

default.  Free public 
defaultWifi
default is used by many young people as it saves their own allocated usage and they can access content without their parents’ knowledge if they wish.  It was supposed

defaultthan half of free public Wi-Fi networks let users access porn, violence and drugs. Mobile security firm

default, tested the web filters on public networks across the country and discovered one in three UK cafes and restaurants have no filtering in place at all - leaving children in danger of accessing pornography.   
defaultThe Government will clearly have to work much more closely with the industry and all who offer public

default to ensure progress is made in line with the Prime Minister’s timetable.
defaultEducation defaultParents are the most important people to reach with education about computers: they need to learn how to set up safety measures; to have an understanding of what children can and are doing online; to know how best to communicate with their children about internet use, and measures to protect their children.  They must also be encouraged to talk a great deal more to their children about these issues and be helped with the skills needed
default.
defaultHere also the Prime Minister has promised to make much more use of government resources to raise awareness among parents and empower them, and we welcome that.
defaultChildren need education too, but it must be remembered that teens’ neural chemistry and reward signals means they are inclined towards risk taking and impulsive behaviour.   Their natural curiosity and desire for independence can make them forget education and warnings by parents and other adults.

defaultResearch showing serious harm from pornographydefaultFinally it is very important to remember exactly why we need to protect children from adult content.  The following examples give an idea of the large body of compelling international evidence showing serious damage to sexual development and behaviour from pornography:
defaultA.  The Sexual Trauma and Psychological Programme, University of Pennsylvania:
default&#xa0;
default‘
defaultOverall the body of research on pornography reveals … it functions as a teacher, permission–giver, and a trigger of … negative behaviours and attitudes.
default&#xa0;
default The damage is seen in men, women and children, and to both married and single adults ... pathological behaviours, illegal behaviours and some behaviours that are both illegal and pathological.’
default&#xa0;
defaultThis research forms part of ‘The Social Costs of Pornography: A Statement of Findings and Recommendations,’ the findings of an inquiry and consultation that ran from 2010 – 2012, sponsored by the Witherspoon Institute and the Institute for the Psychological Sciences.  Fifty four of the ablest professionals and academics in law, medicine, political theory, philosophy, religious studies, history and several other disciplines contributed.

defaultA meta-analysis of the published research on the effects of pornography," Elizabeth 
defaultOddone-Paolucci
default, Mark 
defaultGenuis
default and Claudio 
defaultViolato
default, University of Calgary. 
defaultMedicine, Mind and Adolescence, 1997.
default The 46 studies (from 1965 to 1995) included 12,323 people. "
defaultThe results are clear and consistent; exposure to pornographic material puts one at an increased risk for developing sexually deviant tendencies, committing sexual offences, experiencing difficulties in one's intimate relationships, and accepting the rape myth. In order to promote a healthy and stable society, it is time that we attend to the culmination of sound empirical research.  The rise in sexual crimes, sexual dysfunction and family breakdown may be linked to increased availability and use of porn."
default&#xa0;
defaultMay we point out that these are both extremely extensive pieces of work
default, the former being a multifaceted, multidisciplinary and scholarly exploration of the issue, and the latter a meta-analysis of previous research.

default&#xa0;
defaultD.  That so many children and young people are already manifesting serious effects from their easy access to pornography and other harmful content is reason enough for Government action to take on a sense of urgency (London Portman Clinic is one source).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.  Filtering out extremist material, including images of child abuse and material intended to promote terrorism or other acts of violence;defaultAdequate resources must be provided and used by search engines and ISPs to filter out harmful material which can be accessed via their platforms.   
defaultAdequate funding and resources provided by both the industry and Government to ensure those involved in investigating and removing such material 
defaultcould be very effective.  
default3.  Preventing abusive or threatening comments on social media.defaultSafermediadefault wants to see 
defaultFacebook
default and other social networking sites behaving responsibly and putting the well-being of 
defaultchildren and other vulnerable groups first.
default&#xa0;
default Currently underage children are able to access social media too easily; 7.5m children under 13 have a 
defaultFacebook
default page.    Sites such as 
defaultTumblr
default have plenty of pornography;
default 
defaultFacebook
default content can be pornographic;
default violently sexist and racist.  It can poke fun at victims of terrorism, disease, etc. Much of it is 
defaultinappropriate for 13 – 17s
default 
defaultlet alone under 13s.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Social media (including chat rooms popular with young teens, etc) is also used by sex traffickers and paedophiles to groom children, and by prostitutes to solicit.
defaultRecent decisions by Ask fm and Twitter following public outcry have led to some improvements in safety measures.   This is welcome and shows that the industry can and must do more.
default&#xa0;
default4. ConclusiondefaultSafermedia
default understands that
default immense benefits can be provided by unimpeded communication and free speech, and any attempts to mitigate harms have to be proportionate and, where 
defaultpossible, avoid disadvantageous consequences.  However in a civilised democratic society the protection of the vulnerable must be at the top of the Government’s agenda, and our children fall into that special category, which must be above ruthless and exploitative commercial interests.  There is not merely a moral but also a public health aspect to this – if the health, development and relationships of our youth are allowed to be undermined by harmful internet content, the whole of our society will pay: higher welfare and healthcare costs, more anti-social and criminal behaviour and ultimately higher taxes for all of us.  We trust that this Culture, Media and Sport Committee Inquiry will result in making the protection of our children and the stability of our whole society a top priority.
