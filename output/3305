[normal]The tribunal may—
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]make
[normal] a declaration as to the rights of the complainant and the respondent in relation to the matters to which the proceedings relate;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]order
[normal] the respondent to pay compensation to the complainant;
[normal](c) 
[normal]make
[normal] an 
[normal]appropriate recommendation
[normal](3) An 
[normal]appropriate recommendation
[normal] is a recommendation that within a specified period the respondent takes specified steps for the purpose of obviating or reducing the adverse effect of any matter to which the proceedings relate—
[normal](a) 
[normal]on
[normal] the complainant;
[normal](b)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]on
[normal] any other person
[normal] [emphasis added].

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a) There is a view that if these powers were repealed, then it could mean employers would not take action to tackle discriminatory 
[normal]practises
[normal] which may mean repeat cases being brought to the Tribunal. Is it fair to make the point that an employer which appears before a tribunal for a case where they had been found against before [is] at risk of a more severe sanction?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b) Are
[normal] the number of cases for discrimination against protected characteristics which are likely to be taken forward to an Employment Tribunal limited by pre-trial mediation such as ACAS’s early reconciliation services?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c) Is it necessary for cases where an employer is brought before a Tribunal for unlawful discrimination 
[normal][that the Claimant are] …
[normal] individuals who have been discriminated against. Is it plausible for indirect victims such as those unhappy about working in environments where discrimination is prevalent to also be heard by the 
[normal]Tribunal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d) The Government has indicated that the recommendations of the Tribunal are actually non-binding. Does that mean that there is no sanction for failing to implement the Tribunal’s recommendation in a timely manner? Is it likely to be the case that an employer may find it easier to take action to 
[normal]tackle
[normal]discrimination
[normal] if recommended by the Tribunal (e.g. the prod of external pressure) rather than act through their internal management chain?
