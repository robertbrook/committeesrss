How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report? Have the IPCC adequately addresses criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question the report’s conclusions?&#xa0;1. \nWe note that, \nat the time of the Select Committee’s inquiry, the IPCC has only published a version of\n working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report that has not been fully copy edited. Although the main findings of the report are unlikely to be different in the final version of the report, which is due for publication in January 2014, ther\ne may be some \nsmall but significant changes to the text, for instance with respect to carbon emissions budgets.\n&#xa0;\n2. Working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report\n is the most comprehens\nive \nreview\n of the \nevidence for the \nphysical \nscience basi\ns of climate change that has ever been written. It has been prepared \nby 259 scientific experts from \nuniversities and research institutes in 39 countries, who have\n reviewed all of the available \nevidence and research, including thousands of scientific papers\n. More tha\nn 9000 individual \nscientific pape\nrs are cited within the report. \nIt is also one of the most rigorously reviewed scientific docume\nnts in history, with more than \n50,000 comments made during a review process for earlier dr\nafts that was made open to \nall \nexperts around the world.\n \nThe report has been written for the 195 member governments of the IPCC, and represents the most authoritative assessment of the state of knowledge about\n the physical science basis of \nclimate change. It should also inform decis\nion-making at\n local, regional, national and \ninternational level.\n&#xa0;\n3. While working group I’s contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report shows increases in knowledge and understanding about the physical science basis for climate change since the publi\ncation in 2007 of the Fourth Assessment Report, the fundamental conclusions are the same: the Earth is \nwarming primarily due to human activities, and there is a high likelihood of a rise in global average \nsurface \ntemperature of much more than 2˚C, and othe\nr very significant changes in the global climate, by the end of this century if annual emissions of greenhouse gases are not sharply reduced.\n&#xa0;\n4. The contribution of working group I of the Fifth Assessment Report is the most authoritative report on the \nphysical science basis of climate change that has ever been published. However, in some minor respects, it is already out of date by virtue of the fact that no papers that were accepted after 15 March 2013 for publication have been considered. This is part\nicularly important, for instance, in relation to the so-called recent slowdown in the rise of global average surface temperature.\n&#xa0;\n5\n. It should also be noted that the contribution of working group I to previous IPCC assessment reports may have under-estimated the pace at which climate change is occurring. Brysse \net al.\n (2012) concluded \nthat \n“\nat least some of the key attributes of globa\nl warming from increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been under-predicted, particularly in IPCC assessments of the physical science, by Working Group I”\n.\n&#xa0;\n6. It is a matter of some concern that the contribution of working group I to the Fifth Assessm\nent Report intentionally omitted any explicit consideration of the overall consequences of a rise in global average surface temperature of more than 2˚C, which all governments have agreed s\nhould be avoided. This omission\n is perhaps the biggest shortcoming \nof working group I’s contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nFollowing the discovery in 2010 of a small but significant mistake in the contribution of working group II to the Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC invited the InterAcademy Council\n (IAC) to review its processes and procedures The report of the IAC’s review, published in 2010, did not make any specific criticisms of the contribution of working group I, but made a number of recommendations for improving the preparation of assessment r\neports. Many of these recommendations were implemented during the compilation of working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report.\n&#xa0;\n8\n. T\nhe IPCC sought to allow any interested individuals or organisations to participate in the review of early d\nrafts of working group I’s contribution, including a number of so-called climate change ‘sceptics’\n. \nOne of these ‘sceptics’, \nAlex Rawls, \npublished a draft of working group I’s contribution, in clear breach of the agreem\nent undertaken by all reviewers, and \nattempted to misrepresent its contents (see Ward, 2012). The other contributions to the Fifth Assessment Report have also suffered similar breaches in what appears to be a concerted effort by climate change ‘sceptics’ to subvert and undermine the IPCC proc\ness.\n&#xa0;\n9. \nThere was also a co-ordinated effort by the Global Warming Policy Foundation and its supporters to mislead the public and policy-makers through inaccurate articles \ncriticising\n the contribution of working group I after the Summary for Policymakers \nwas published on 27 September. Some of the most blatant efforts are described in Ward (2013a). We note that possibly the most egregious article was produced by Rt Hon Peter Lilley MP, who is a member of the Select Committee and Vice-Chairman of Tethys Petr\noleum, for ‘City A.M.’ (Ward 2013b). Mr Lilley not only misrepresented the content of the Summary for Policymakers, but also provided a false portrayal of the IPCC and its processes.\n&#xa0;Q2. To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?&#xa0;10\n. There is a clear scientific consensus that the Earth is warming due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. There are four main ways in which this consensus manifests itself\n (Ward &amp; Hicks, 2013)\n.\n First, t\nhe 259\n authors of \nthe contribution of\n \nIPCC \nworking group I \nto the Fifth Assessment Report \nhave assessed all of the available research and \n \nevidence and concluded that it is 95 per cent probable that most of the war\nming since 1950 is \ndue to human activities.\n Seco\nnd, a\nnalyses of peer-reviewed journal papers (e.g. Oreskes, 2004; Powell, 2012; Cook et al., 2013)\n \nshow that less than 1 per cent disagree that human activities are th\ne major contributor to climate \nchange.\n Third, s\nurveys (e.g. Doran &amp; Zimmerman, 2009) show\n that more than 97 per cent of climate researchers who are publishing scientific papers agree that human activity is a sig\nnificant contributor to rising \nglobal average temperature.\n Fourth, a\nll of the world’s major scientific organisations, including nation\nal academies of science such as the Royal Society, agree that human activities are the major contributor to recent climate change.\n&#xa0;Q4. How effective is AR5 and the summary for policymakers in conveying what is meant by uncertainty in scientific terms? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?&#xa0;11\n. \nThe \ncontribution of working group I to the Fifth Assessment Report\n, like \nits\n contribution\n to \nthe Fourth Assessment Report\n, \ncombines quantified levels of confidence \nwith\n probability levels\n,\n and \nqualifies\n scientific\n statements with a level of likelihood – \nranging from\n “virtually certain\n” to “exceptionally unlikely”\n - \nwith associated percentage values\n. \nYet, these expressions of likelihood, when cited without the associated percentage values, may no\nt be interpreted in \nthe same\n way by different individuals\n (\nsee \nBudescu \net al\n.\n, 2009).\n&#xa0;\n1\n2\n. \nFraming climate \nchange in terms of uncertainties\n rather than risk\ns\n \nmay \ncreate \nan obstacle to \ninformed \ndecision-making\n \nabout\n climate change\n mitigation\n, \nas it might \nlead to a misinterpretation that there is no disadvantage in delaying until further certainty is attained\n. \nPainter (2013\n) \ns\nuggested\n that\n \nan argument\n in favour of using the language of risk is that \n“\nit shifts public debate \naway from the idea that decisions \nshould be delayed until conclusive proof or absolute certainty is obtained (a criteri\non that may never be satisfied)\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n13. Smith and Stern (2011) discuss the importance of scientists providing information about uncertainty, particularly of possible future\n climate change, in a way that promotes a better understanding by policy-makers of the risks.\n&#xa0;Q6. Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?&#xa0;1\n4\n. \nThere has been a \ncampaign by clim\nate change ‘sceptics’ to mislead the public, journalists and policy-makers about the significance of the \nlower\n rate of increase in global average surface temperature since 1998 compared with the long-term warming rate since 19\n51\n. IPCC working group I was f\norced to respond to this campaign by addressing the issue explicitly in its contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report.\n It attributed\n the \nlower\n rate of warming \nsince 1998 \nmainly \nto\n the impact of \nshort-term natural factors that mask the warming effec\nt of greenhouse gases, such as \nan increase in the amount of heat absorbed by the deeper oce\nans compared with the surface, \nan increase in the amount of volcanic particles in the a\ntmosphere which block out some \nsunlight and cause cooling, and a cyclical redu\nction in the amount of radiation from the sun\n.\n&#xa0;\n15\n. The contribution of working group I only considered research papers that were accepted before 15 March 2013 for publication. Since that date, new papers have been published which have added to the knowledge and understanding of the apparent lower rate of\n warming since 1998. For instance, a paper by Cowtan and Way, published in November 2013, concluded that the \nMet Office’s \nHadCRUT4 record of global average surface temperature has significantly underestimated the rate of warming since 1997.\n&#xa0;\n16\n. It is impo\nrtant to consider the lower rate of warming since 1998 within the context of the longer record of global average temperature. T\nhere are many other such tempora\nry periods of higher and lower \nrates of warming, and even of cooling, within the temperature re\nco\nrd. For instance, the linear \ntrend in average annual temperature for the 43-year pe\nriod between 1970 and 2012, as \nrecorded in the Met Office’s HadCRUT4 dataset, is +0.165°C per\n decade, but there are shorter \n15-year periods of lower warming rates, such as 0\n.098°C per\n decade between 1979 and 1993, \nand 0.044°C per decade between 1998 and 2012 \n(Ward and Hicks, 2013).\n&#xa0;\nAnnual global average surface temperature 1970-2012Source: Met Office HadCrut4 dataset, \nas plotted in Ward and Hicks (2013)\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ7. Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change?&#xa0;17\n. \nWorking group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report does not offer an assessment of the economic impacts of cl\nimate change, which will be considered in the contribution of working group II, due for publication in 2014.\n However, working group I does indicate both that both atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and some of the phys\nical impacts of climate change, such as the reduction in the area of Arctic sea ice, have increased since the publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report in 2007.\n&#xa0;\n18\n. Stern (2013) warns that many analyses significantly under-estimate the potential ec\nonomic \nconsequences\n of unmanaged climate change because of their reliance on the outputs of models, inclu\nding those assessed in working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report, which omit some of the largest risks. Stern (2013) states: “\nScien\ntists describe the scale of the risks from unmanage\nd climate change as potentially \nimmense. However, the scientific models, because they\n omit key factors that are hard \nto capture precisely, appear to substantially underesti\nmate these risks. Many economic \nmodels add further gross underassessment of risk bec\nause the assumptions built into \nthe economic \nmodelling\n on growth, damages and risks, \ncome close to assuming directly \nthat the impacts and costs will be modest and close \nto excluding the possibility of \ncat\nastrophic outcomes. A new generation of models is\n needed in all three of climate \nscience, impact and economics with a still stronger \nfocus on lives and livelihoods, \nincluding the risks of large-scale migration and conflicts.\n”\n&#xa0;Q8. What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy-making both nationally and internationally? &#xa0;19\n. \nSince the publication of \nthe IPCC Fourth Assessment Report\n, governments have agreed that global emissions of greenhouse gases shou\nld be reduced urgently in\n order to hold the increase in \nglobal average temperature below 2°C\n, and perhaps below 1.5˚C,\n \nto\n limit the risks of dangerous climate change.\n \nIn addition, Parliament passed the Climate Change Act in 2008, \nrequiring the UK to reduce\n its \ngreenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 per cent by 2050, compared with 1990. The UK 205\n0 \nemissions target was set on the basis of interim advice fr\nom members of the Committee on \nClimate Change (Turner, 2008), who indicated that it would \nbe consistent\n with the task of \nreducing global annual emissions of greenhouse gases covered by the Kyot\no Protocol, to about \n20 billion tonnes of carbon-dioxide-equivalent by 2050, in line wi\nth the goal of limiting global \nwarming to no more than 2°C by 2100, and creatin\ng a low probability of warming of 4°C.\n&#xa0;\n20. Although working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report omits an explicit consideration of the scientific basis for the 2˚C threshold, it does point\n out\n, for instance,\n that during the last Ice Age interglacial period, which ended about 116,000 \nyears ago, global mean surface \ntemperature was at least 2°C warmer than its late 19th century\n level, global sea levels were \nabout 5 to 10 metres higher than today, and the Greenla\nnd and Antarctic Ice Sheets were \nmuch \nsmaller.\n This shows that there are significant risks of very serious changes in the climate, even from global warming of 2˚C, which would have severe social and economic consequences for human populations around the wo\nrld.\n&#xa0;\n2\n1\n. Working group I’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report\n, for the first time in the IPCC’s history, \nconcludes \nthat \nto have at least a 50 per cent \nchance of avoiding warming of more than 2°C above pre-industri\nal level, the total cumulative \nam\nount of carbon dioxide that is emitted into the atmosphere by\n human activities must be less \nthan about 4440 billion tonnes (equivalent to about 1210 billi\non tonnes of carbon), or about \n30\n1\n0 billion tonnes when other greenhouse gases and aerosol p\narticles f\nrom human activities \nare taken into account.\n \nThe amount of carbon dioxide that was emitted from the late 19th century up to 2011 was between 163\n0\n and 2\n150\n billion tonnes (equivalent to 44\n5\n to \n585\n billion ton\nnes of carbon), \nleaving a remaining budget of bet\nween about 8\n6\n0 and 1\n380\n billio\nn tonnes (equivalent to 2\n35\n to \n3\n75\n billion tonnes of carbon) for carbon dioxide and all othe\nc\nr emissions from human activities\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Q12. What relevance to the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget?&#xa0;\n22. \nThe Committee on Climate Change (2013) has \ncomprehensively assessed this issue\n. It stated: \n“\nAccounting for the latest evidence, our climate objective implies global emissions pathways similar to those we used previously to guide the UK’s 20\n50 target and fourth carbon budget”. However, it also added: “\nOur pathways have larger cumulative CO\n2\n emissions than the c\nap suggested by IPCC AR5 for a \n50% probability of remaining below 2°C. This underlines that\n our pathways should be viewed \nas a minimum\n level of effort.\n”\n&#xa0;REFERENCES&#xa0;\nBudescu, D. V., Por, H-H., &amp; Broomell, S. B.\n, 2012\n.
