[normal] provides immigration detainees with

[normal]From 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013, BID assisted 3367 people held in immigration detention.

[normal]Summary [bold]The Government’s proposals would place severe restrictions on immigration detainees’ access to judicial review, which is a crucial mechanism for safeguarding individual rights and preventing unlawful government conduct. 
[normal]Introduction [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Standing and third party interventions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“Public law is not at base about rights, even though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts 
[normal]have always been alive to the fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issue or the outcome may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public
[normal] power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for [permission to bring judicial review], the court’s only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive” (Sedley J in R v Somerset County Council, ex p Dixon 
[normal][1998] Env LR 111 at 117-121)

[normal]Third party interventions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Case study: child detention [bold]&#xa0;[bold]In January 2011, following judicial review proceedings in the ‘Suppiah’ case,
[normal] the Administrative Court found that two families had been detained unlawfully. Liberty 
[normal]intervened in this case, and BID provided detailed evidence to support their intervention. In his concluding remarks, Justice Wyn Williams found that: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]‘The Claimants 
[normal]were detained unlawfully from the time that they were taken into custody until their release. Their rights under Articles 5 and 8 ECHR were infringed in the manner described earlier in this judgment; their rights under Article 3 were not infringed. The Def
[normal]endant's current policy relating to detaining families with children is not unlawful. There is, nonetheless, a significant body of evidence which demonstrates that employees of UKBA have failed to apply that policy with the rigour it deserves. The cases of
[normal] the two families involved in this litigation provide good examples of the failure by UKBA to apply important aspects of the policy both when the decisions were taken to detain each family and when decisions were taken to maintain detention after removal d
[normal]irections had been cancelled.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At paragraph 111, 
[normal]Justice Wyn Williams stated: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘On the basis of the evidence adduced by the Claimants and Liberty, no one can seriously dispute that detention is capable of causing significant and, in some instances, long 
[normal]lasting harm to children. That emerges with clarity from the observations of HM Inspector of Prisons, the Children's Commissioner, Members of Parliament, the Independent Inspector of UKBA and the detailed evidence of Mr Makhlouf.’

[normal]“In total the [Legal Aid Agency] had received 213 applications for non-inq
[normal]uest cases.  Of these, 146 were in family law and 63 in immigration.  There had been only two grants of funding: one in an immigration case concerning EU law and one in a family case.  In the [one] immigration case, funding was only granted after a pre-act
[normal]ion protocol letter was sent”

[normal]Case study[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Faith was detained with her partner for 206 days after serving a prison sentence. Her four children were aged between one and eleven when she went to prison; the eldest child was a British Citizen. The children were extremely distressed, and some of them d
[normal]eveloped behavioural and health problems.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Three months into her detention, the Home Office wrote to Faith and her partner informing them that they intended to remove the parents and children together. The family had been separated for two years and five
[normal] months. The Home Office noted the need for the children to “re-establish their relationship with their parents before remova
[normal]l,”
[normal] and envisaged that this might happen at Heathrow Airport. It is extremely concerning to see that the Home Office thought it wou
[normal]ld be appropriate to reunite these extremely distressed children with their parents during the course of their forced removal. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This removal attempt was cancelled, and the Home Office arranged a new date for the family to be removed using the same method,
[normal] but this was prevented by a judicial review application. The parents were subsequently released from detention and granted leave to remain in the UK.

[normal]The Ministry of Justice has conceded that applications for release from detention on bail or temporary admission, and judicial reviews challenging the legality of detention would 
[normal]be
[normal] exempt from the residence test (Ministry of Justice September 2013 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps, Annex B: Response to consultation, 
[normal]Paragraph 125). 
[normal]However, civil claims for compensation 
[normal]and damages 
[normal]for periods of unlawful detention, made after re
[normal]lease, would be subject to the residence test. If the decision under challenge – in this case to maintain detention – is withdrawn by the Home Office before the decision of the court is handed down, or an injunction ordering release is sought and granted, 
[normal]then any public law elements of the unlawful detention judicial review become academic and must be determined as part of a separate civil claim for damages.
