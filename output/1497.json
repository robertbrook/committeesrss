"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by OFTEC (HOT05)&#xa0;1.\n              \nThe\n Oil Firing T\nechnical Association\n (OFTEC) represents companies involved in the oil fired heating sector. Also it operates a Competent Persons scheme for\n oil heating technicians licens\ned by the Department of Communities and Local Government and currently has some 8,700 persons on its regis\nter. For this function OFTEC is accredited by UKAS (No. 4371).\n&#xa0;\nBackground: \n&#xa0;\n2. \nSince 2008 OFTEC has been in discussions with DECC and its predecessor Departments about ways of reducing GHG emission from domestic oil boilers. It has promoted a new fuel kn\nown as B30K which is a blend of kerosene (70%) with FAME \nbiofuel\n (30%). \nThis fuel can be used in existing oil boilers after minor modifications to the boiler, and \noffers \na\n comparable \nheat output\n and boiler efficiency\n to that of kerosene.\n&#xa0;\nHowever B30K \nhas \nbeen excluded from the forthcoming domestic Renewable Heat Incentive\n (RHI) \nin England and Wales, although it has been recognized for the Northern Ireland \nversion of \nRHI. OFTEC believes that a bio-liquid such as B30K would make a significant contribution to\n GHG reductions for rural homes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDECC Heat Strategy (2013): \n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nThis strategy seeks to eliminate all fossil fuel usage for heat generation by 2050\n. It envisages extensive \nuse of de-carbonised electricity supplied through an enhanced \nelectricity \ngrid to\n homes and buildings as the way to achieve this. OFTEC suggests that this \npolicy \nis impractical \nin that it would require massive capital investment and therefore would impose \nhigh costs on energy consumers\n which would be unacceptable politically. \n&#xa0;\n \n4.\n              \nA \npolicy \nadvoc\nated by the \nHeati\nn\ng\n \nand \nHotwater\n Industry \nCouncil (HHIC) \n(\nand others\n) \npromotes a more “balanced transition” to low carbon heat. This should involve use of hybrid gas and oil condensing boilers working \nin tandem with h\neat pumps.\n OFTEC supports t\nhe arguments made within the HHIC report entitled “Pathways for Domestic Heat”.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHybrid Heat technologies \nusing oil: \n&#xa0;\n5. \n              \nThis\n HHIC report sees a continuing role for oil and gas fire\nd condensing boilers into the \nperiod 2025 -2030 because these technologies can work well with heat pumps in an \nauxiliary\n role. \nThe domestic RHI recogni\ns\nes this and allows payments for hybrid technologies providing that the renewable element of the heat is metered. \n&#xa0;\n6.\n              \nOFTEC \nmodelling\n \nsuggests that for an oil/Air \nSource\n Heat\n Pump (ASHP) hybrid boiler, (\nassuming the ASHP has \na Sea\nsonal Performance Factor\n - SPF -\n of 2.5) \nthe CO2 emissions for a 4 bed\nroom house would be 5.138 tonnes of \nC\nO2 p.a. This compares with 6.302 \ntonnes \nusing an \noil \ncondensing boiler, and 4.756 tonnes using only \nthe ASHP.  \n&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nWhilst the CO2 emission\ns\n for the ASHP are slightly lower than \nfor \nthe hybrid, \nindependent studies have shown that \nan \nASHP \nworking on its own \ncannot achieve high SPF in a sustained period of \ncold weather\n. T\nherefore \nit is \nun\nlikely that \nthis leve\nl of carbon output could \nbe exceeded \nin a particularly cold year. \n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHas the Government\n made\n the right ap\nproach to reducing heat demand? \n&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nThe Government’s flagship policy to reduce fossil fuel cons\numption in the domestic sector \n–\n \nthe \nRenewable Heat Incentive - is unlikely to achieve its stated objectives. \n \n \n&#xa0;\n9.\n              \nThe domestic RHI is \nan \ninnovative \npolicy \nand does provide significant tax-payers funds to incentivi\ns\ne the switch to renewable heat. \nWith an\n estimated cost of £5.09 billion\n and a net present value estimated at MINUS £1.836 billion \nover the policy Lifetime, \nthis is an expensive policy\n. \nThe DECC Impact assessment (IA) forecasts (Table 8) that 579,000 homes will switch to renewable heat technolog\nies between 2014 and 2020 due to the RHI. However \nThe Committee should\n be aware that the \nsame IA paper \nacknowledges that the uptake of the \ni\nncentive is unknown \n(due to possible consumer indifference?) \nand says (\npara\n 77):\n \n“however there is extreme uncertainty about how householders will make these investment decisions \nfor renewable heating products.  …” \n&#xa0;\n10.\n              \nOFTEC suggests that the likelihood of many existin\ng oil ho\nuseholds deciding to switch to \nrenewable tech\nnologies \nsuch\n as ASHP, Ground Source Heat Pumps and B\nio-mass (wood pellet) boilers is low. \nThe principle reason for this is that nearly all decisions relating to a new heating system are made in emergency situations when a boiler breaks down and cannot be replaced. The\n householder is desperate to have heating and hot water restored to their home and so makes a “distress purchase”. They do not have the time nor \nthe \nmoney to consider a new technology which may require home adaptations.\n&#xa0;\n11. \nThis fact\n may explain some of t\nhe findings \nof a \nreport c\nommissioned by DECC from \nIpsos\n/ \nMORI and the Energy Savings Trust en\ntitled \n“Homeowners’ Willingness \nTo Take Up More Efficient Heating Systems\n” (March \n2013)\n. \nThis surveyed 2,900 home owners and conducted a number of \nin-depth worksho\nps in the autumn of 2012. \nl\nt\n concluded: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWe suggest that the Committee requests DECC for sight of this Report - if they have not done so already. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nC\nost of conversion to renewable heat:\n \n&#xa0;\n12.\n              \nAn earlier \nImpact Assessment (\nIA\n)\n for the RHI \n(September 2012) \nstated\n that \n38% (or \n145,000\n) of the homes converting to renewable heat pre 2020 due to the RHI would be in \nrural \nareas. The latest IA puts the number converting to these new technologies at 579,000 which indicates that DECC\n now forecast that 220,000 rural homes now will convert due to the RHI. \n&#xa0;\n13.\n              \nOFTEC estim\nates that 80% \n(176,000) \nof these will be homes using oil heating at present. \n \nThe estimated capital costs of these conversions are shown in the table below, and the Co\nmmittee will note that substantial up-front capital costs are involved installing Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP), Ground Source Heat pumps (GSHP) and Wood Pellet Boilers (Pellet)\n. Th\nese costs compare with approx\n.\n £3,\n0\n00 \nto replace an existing oil boiler with\n a condensing oil boiler.\n \n              TABLE 1.  Estimated Capital Cost of Conversion (\n176\n,000 homes)\n \n&#xa0;\nTechnology (Proportion of homes)ASPH (65%)GSHP (17%)Pellet (17%)B30K (100%)Number of Homes114,400\n29,920\n29,920\n176,000\nInstallation/conversion Cost per Home(Note 1)\n£8,000\n£13,000\n£10,000\n£3,000\nTotal installation cost to home owners£915,200,000£388,960,000£299,200,000£528,000,000Total combined installation cost of Heat Pumpsand Pellet boilers£1,603,360,000&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNote 1‐ Energy Saving Trust ‐ \nhttp://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewableselector/start\nAssumptions:\n1. RHI \n \nIA (July 2013) predicts that 579\n,000 rural households will move to \nrenewable installations\n (Table 8) due to the RHI. Taking the assumption in the earlier IA (September 2012) that 38% of the homes switching will be in rural areas, this means that 220,000 are predicted to convert by 2020. \n2. The OFTEC model estimates\n that \n80% of these will currently\n be on oil, which equates to 176\n,000 homes\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14.\n              \nThe cost of replacing all these boilers with a modern condensing boiler is approximately £\n616m: the cost of converting a\nll the existing boilers \nin these homes to use B30K fuel is \nestimated at £528m. Both these figures are less than half the capital cost of installing the proposed the renewable technologies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConsumer r\nesistance to Heat Pumps\n:\n&#xa0;\n15.\n              \nAny heat strategy designed to reduce CO2 / GHG emissions from private homes must be\n capable of being “sold” to home-owners. For the reasons stated above we \nbelieve that the currently \nfavoured\n technologies will be a hard sell. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n              \nThe\n \nfavoured\n technology – Air Source Heat Pumps –\n should \nwork well in new homes built to “zero carbon” stan\ndards and with larger radiators and / or under\n-\nfloor heating. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n              \nHowever heat pumps \nwill not function effectively if they are fitted onto existing radiator systems and this has been acknowledged in the recent EST trials.\n \nThe full cost \nof installing an e\nffective heat pump \nin an exi\ns\nting property s\nhould include the cost of a new radiator \nor under-floor heating \nsystem. \nIn addition good functionality \nof heat pumps \nrequires \nproperties \nto be \nfully insulated\n. Many rural homes are older (pre-1914) and have solid\n walls. The option of cavity wall insulation is not open to these homes and the alternative - solid wall insulation- is expensive, unproven and can be unsightly. \n \n&#xa0;\n18.\n              \nA further factor which should b\ne noted regarding\n heat pumps \nis that they \ndo not provide \n“hot radiators” which can be used to \nwarm yourself on when cold or to \n“dry the clothes”. Consumers are used to \nradiators doing this and \nthere could be negative reaction to these perceived\n shortcomings of renewable heat from some people.\n \n&#xa0;\nRu\nnning costs of preferred Renewable Technologies (pre-RHI)\n:\n&#xa0;\n19.\n              \nThe RHI is designed to compensate home owners for the capital costs of installing renewable heat and to contribute to their running costs for seven years. \nWe note that \nwithin \nthe \nRHI document \nissued on 12\nth\n July 20\n13, the examples of what paymen\nt\ns\n might be expected are based upon a building heat requirement of 15,000 kWh p.a. Due to the design of many rural homes, we submit that the average building heat\n l\noss would be higher at aro\nund 24,000 to\n 28,000kWh p.a. Domestic \nRHI payments are based upon a deemed heat calculated from an energy performance \nassessment\n and not from metering actual renewable heat emitted. We suggest that customers could \nbe exposed to the risk of \nhaving \nhigh\ner than anticipate\nd\n electricity bills due to heat pumps cycling on and off to meet \nhigh \nheating demand. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n20.\n              \nT\nhe \nfuture \ncosts of electricity and wood pellets \nfor the favoured RHI technologies are un\nknown\n. Electricity prices are likely to rise to reflect \nthe \nincreased gene\nrating costs for nuclear and wind-power. \nThe Committee should note that the current average fuel costs \np.a. \nin GB for a three bedroom house in the period July 2012 – July 2013 are set out below: \n&#xa0;\nTABLE 2.  Heating Costs for a 3 bedroom home GREAT BRITAIN – Average Per Annum&#xa0;\nQ to 31st Jul-12Q to 31st Oct-12Q to 31st Jan-13Q to 30th Apr-13Q to 31st Jul-13Average May 12 – Jul 13 Oil (Condensing)1,270.40\n1,355.60\n1,373.00\n1,431.00\n1,293.60\n1,344.72\nWood Pellets1,385.20\n1,341.00\n1,250.60\n1,246.20\n1,251.80\n1,294.96\nAir Source Heat Pump (Radiators)N|A\n1,276.80\n1,345.80\n1,360.20\n1,360.40\n1,335.80\n&#xa0;\nNOTE\nS\n: Source Sutherland Tables\n. All price in £\n \nsterling. \n&#xa0;\n21.\n              \nFor a home wi\nth an ASHP it is only £8 less expensive \nper annum \n(or 0.66%\n) to run on \ncarbonized electricity than it is to use kerosene fu\nelling a condensing oil boiler. W\nood pellet\ns currently are approximately 3\n% less \nexpensive run than \noil. \n&#xa0;\n22.\n              \nThe RHI will only provide subsidy to homeowners for seven years so there is a danger tha\nt\n peo\nple will revert back to fossil fuel technologies if the\nir\n running costs are greatly in excess of fossil fuel heating. \n&#xa0;\nRural homes - CO2 Abatement and role of Bio-Liquids\n&#xa0;\n23.\n              \nGiven that DECC policy is set against Bio-liquids\n, \n it is interesting to note t\nhat our estimates show that \nthe CO2 abatement in the 176,000 \n homes that might convert from oil is LESS using the preferred technologies than it would be if these same homes converted to bio-liquid. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n              \nThis is demonstrated in the table below.\n  \nAlso it s\nhould be noted \nthat if\n these homes convert to B30K they will save 223,155 tonnes of CO2 p.a. more than if they “do nothing”. It is OFTEC’s contention that most of these homes target\ned by the RHI will “do nothing” because either the incentive is insufficien\nt or the installation of \nthe “\nrenewable technology” is too disruptive / impractical.\n&#xa0;\nTABLE 3.   Estimated CO2 Emissions - RHI preferred technologies v.B30K bio-liquid&#xa0;Technology (Proportion of homes)  ASPH (65%)GSHP (17%)Pellet (17%)B30K (100%)Kerosene(100%)Number of Homes114,400\n29,920\n29,920\n176,000\n176,000\nCO2 Factor (kgCO2/KWh) (Note 1)\n0.517\n0.517\n0.028\n0.193\n0.274\nEnergy for 4 bed home (kWh) (Note 2)\n23750\nTotal CO2 Emissions (Tonnes)1,404,689367,38019,897806,7401,145,320Total combined CO2 emissions for HP'sand pellet installations (Tonnes)1,791,966&#xa0;&#xa0;\nTotal CO2 saving gained by using B30K over Kerosene (Tonnes) (Note 3)\n&#xa0;338,580&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nNote 1 - Emission Factors taken from SAP 2009, Table 12\nNote 2 - Space \nHeating (Radiators) and DHW taken \nfom\n Sutherland Tables October 2012\nNote 3 - No. of Homes, multiplied by energy use, multiplied by an Emission Factor of 0.274 kg/kWh taken from SAP2009,\n                   less the emissions from B30k \n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n25.\n \n \n              \nConclusion:\n&#xa0;\nThis submission has sought to demonstrate that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n25.\n              \nOFTEC thanks the Committee for this opportunity to submit evidence and is prepared to appear before the committee to give\n oral evidence\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n"
