default&#xa0;
defaultArticle 46
default requires 
defaultContracting Parties to abide by final judgments against them by the Strasbourg Court
default. As the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern has confirmed
default in his evidence to the JCHR
default, it would be a clear violation of the UK’s international legal obligations were the Government and Parliament to refuse to comply with the Hirst judgment.
default See also the JCHR’s reports
default referred to in my written evidence
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is also important to have regard to the UK’s international obligations as party to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
default Article 25 of the ICCPR
default protects the right and opportunity of every citizen, subject to reasonable restrictions, to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic election by universal and equal suffrage. Article 2.2 obliges the parties to adopt necessary legislative measures to give effect to the IPPR protected rights.
default 
defaultThe UK ratified the ICCPR in 1976 without making any relevant declaration or reservation in relation to Article 25.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNo.
default . The obligation imposed by Article 46 (1) is an international legal obligation.
default State responsibility for complying 
defaultwith the Convention involves all
default three branches of government, executive, legislative and judicial and the other public authorities of the United Kingdom and its countries and regions
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is ir
defaultrelevant that Article 46 was not inco
defaultrporated. M
defaultost provisions of the Convention other than the Convention rights and freedoms
default were not incorporated because they are unnecessary to give effect to t
defaulth
defaultose rights and freedoms in domestic law.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Ministerial
default Code describes Ministers as having an overarching duty to comply with the law including international law and t
defaultreaty obligations. T
defaulthe Government confirmed in a Written Answer by Lord 
defaultMcNally on 
default27 June 2013 (WA 160) 
default that there are o current plans to amend paragraph 1.2
default in light of the HIrst case
default .
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMy
default reference to Greece
default’s withdrawal from the Council of Europe 
defaultunder the junta was
default intended
default to draw attention to the fact that if the UK were to refuse to compl
defaulty with it
defaults 
defaultduty to abide by the Court’s final judgments against the UK, 
defaultwe would 
defaulttoo 
defaultbe compelled 
defaultto withdraw from the Convention system rather than face expulsion.
default It was not of course intended to suggest that our political circumstances are similar to those in Greece under the junta.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK has had an unblemished record of complying with judgments of the Strasbourg Court until now a
defaultnd of upholding the European rul
defaulte of law. Other states have dragged their feet in complying with judgments, but I know of no example of a state refusing to comply with Article 46.
default The UK prides itself on being a rule of law country and it is reasonable that successive Governments have been strongly criticised for their failure to comply with Article 46.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe fact that other states violate Convention rights is irrelevant
default to the obligations of 
defaultthe 
default UK as a Contracting Party
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Human Rights Act gives effect to Parliamentary sovereignty by preventing our courts from striki
defaultng down Acts of Parliament. If 
defaultprimary legislation cannot be read and given effect compatibly with the Convention rights, the courts may grant a declaration of incompatibility leaving its to government and Parliament to decide whether to take remedial action.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe fact that Parliament 
defaulthas exclusiv
defaulte responsibility to make the law
default does not affect the State’s responsibility to comply with rulings of the European Court of Human Rights : eg., in the East African Asians case
default (1973) 3 EHRR 76
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever the Strasbourg Court and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in its
default supervisory capacity, recognise
default a wide area of discretionary judgment for the legislature in choosing the means of complying.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Human Rights Act would then have to be amended to remove protection of the Convention
default rights to private property, education and political freedom. It would be an odd decision for a Conservative government to take since it was a Conservative Government th
defaultat ratified the First Protocol.
default And it would undermine the basic c
defaultivil rights and libertie
defaults of our fellow citizens
default&#xa0;
defaultUnlike Switzerland and every other State party to the Convention, 
defaultthe UK does not have a written constitution protecting fundamental human rights.
default It was only in 1990, 
defaultafter Switze
defaultr
defaultla
defaultnd had ratified the Convention,
default 
defaultthat
default Swiss 
defaultwomen were given the right to vote in every canton. The Convention was the crucial lever
default for women’s enfranchisement.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultI do not agree. 
defaultThere were no such intention
default and it was 
defaultand is 
defaultobvious that the right to vote was inherent in Article 3.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Churchill
default Government signed and 
defaultratifi
defaulted Protocol No. 1 in 
default1952
default on behalf of the UK 
defaultwithout making any reservation or declaration in relation to Article 3.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt was unnecessary 
defaultfor
default the drafters of Article 3 
defaultto make explicit reference to the right to vote since it is inherent in the very concept of a modern democratic society in which the people choose their legislature in a secret ballot
default 
default.
defaultI do not understand how free elections could be held under conditions ensuring the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature without the right to vote.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Strasbourg Court’s
default interpretation of Article 3 was first explained 25 years ago in Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v Belgium (1987) 10 EHRR 1, paragraphs 46-54, and was not controversial or objected to by our government. 
default The British judge on the Court, Sir Vincent Evans, was former Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office. The Court agreed with the approach of 
defaultthe Euro
defaultpean Commission of Human Rights which 
defaultobserved in that case, “Universal suffrage, the central element of any 
defaultgenuinely democratic political system, must seek to ensure ‘the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.’”
default&#xa0;
default Suppose 
defaulthypothetically 
defaultthat only men or only white people were e
defaultntitled to vote in P
default elections
default 
defaultto the legislature, 
defaultor that Jews were excluded
default. It is 
defaultobvious that this would engage Article 3
default 
defaultof the First Protocol.
default For example in Aziz v Cyprus (2008) 46 EHRRv39, the Court found a violation of article 3 where members of the Turkish-Cypriot community living in the government-controlled area of Cyprus were refused permission to be included on the electoral r
defaultoll; or Sejdic and Finci v Bosnia and Herzeg
defaultovina (Grand Chamber 2009) 
defaultwhere Roma and Jews were excluded under the Constitution from being elected to the legislature
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties contains general principles for the interpretation of treaties.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultArticle 31.1 provides that 
default“A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”
default 
defaultUnder the heading “Supplementary means of interpretation, Article 32 provides that 
default&#xa0;
default“Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its
default conclusi
defaulton, in order to 
defaultconfirm the meaning
default resulting from the application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when the application of Article 31: 
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultleaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultleads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”
default&#xa0;
defaultPreparatory work does not have the same authentic character as Article 31 “ Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law (7
defaultth
default ed., 2005), 632.
default&#xa0;
defaultThat is the approach of our own courts in deciding whether to have recourse to parliamentary debates or other extrinsic material to interpret
default primary legislation
default 
default: Pepper v Hart
default[1992] UKHL 3
default . It is supplemental and exceptional
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOur courts also use an updating approach to statutory interpretation, rather than being tied to an inflexible approach that is tied to the original intention of the legislature.

default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe preparatory work 
defaultreferred to by Anthony Speaight QC and
default Dominic Raab MP is not relevan
defaultt
default to the intention
default of the drafters of Article 3. 
defaultMr Raab refers 
defaultto objections made by the Attlee Government to include in the Convention what became Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 
default.
default 
defaultIt was when the Churchill government came to power that Protocol. No. 1 was agreed, and there is nothing in the preparatory work on Protocol No. 1 to indicate any intention to exclude the right to vote in elections for the choice of legislature. Th
defaulte
default main UK concern was to protect
default the unelected nature of the House of Lords
default from being held to be contrary to Article 3
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would be within the wide area of discretionary judgment allowed to government and Parliament
default. Cyprus, Ireland and Hong Kong have n
defaultot found it necessary so to impose such rstrictions
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe test to be satisfied will remain the test of proportionality. The Court will continue to recognise a wide margin of appreciation in this area, especially if Parliament has carefully considered
default the options and come to a well-
defaultinformed conclusion
default that is not manifestly unreasonable
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultEuropean institution charged with supervising the execution of Hirst is the Committee of Ministers of the Council
default of Europe
default. The Committee will certainly have regard to the evidence given to your Committee and to the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and the debates on actual legislation in both Houses.
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultSo will the Court in deciding pending and future claims.
default 
default In its admissibility decision of 26 June 2013 in McLean and Cole v United Kingdom, the Court stated (paragraph 35) that “There is no doubt that for as long as the legislation remains unchanged, those who remain in post-conviction detention will continue potentially to be victims of a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. However, the effect of the voting prohibition will only be felt if a further election to a ‘legislature’ occurs before amending legislation has been enacted.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Court also noted
default 
defaultthat (paragraph 36) “a draft bill has been 
defaultpublished and a joint committee has been charged with carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny of the bill. The committee will report by 31 October 2013
default 
default …. Further, the Committee of Ministers is actively supervising the steps taken by the United Kingdom authorities to implement the Court’s rulings in Hirst and Greens and M.T. It will next assess the position in September 203.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Court 
defaultcontinued (paragraph 37) “In light of these developments and given that the Court has already delivered two rulings finding the respondent State to be in violation of Article 3 …, there is nothing to be gained from examining applications concerning future elections 
defaultat this time. If amending legis
defaultlation is not brought into force prior to any futures elections to the ‘legislature’, it will be open to applicants to lodge, within six months of the date of the election, a new application to the Court.” 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultClaims for compensation would be brought with strong prospects of success. If the UK were in persistent violation of Article 46, t
defaulthe UK would have to withdraw from the Council of Europe 
default(to avoid expulsion) 
defaultand would be in breach of its EU obligations. 
defaultSee Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultYes
default, because it would indicate 
defaultthe
default 
defaultUK
default Executive and Parliament were 
defaultunwilling to
default 
defaultrespect the rule o
defaultf international and European
default law.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is likely 
defaultthat damages would be awarded 
defaultand the UK would be obliged to pay 
defaultcompensation 
defaultby way of just satisfaction
default: s
defaultee McLean and Cole v United Kingdom.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would mean that the Court of Justice as well as the European Court of Human Rights and UK courts would 
defaultbe likely to 
defaultfind further breaches by the UK
default and to award compensation.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf disenfranchisement is intended to be p
defaultunitive the
defaultn the punishment must fit the crime in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The use of length of sentence is one way of seeking to do this; another way is to leave it to the judge’s discretion in the circumstances of the particular case as part of sentencing..
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThat would be complex and expensive
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would be cumbersome and add 
defaultunnecessary burdens
