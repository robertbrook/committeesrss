"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law (LAI 0062)&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law submits the following \nwritten evidence\n to the \nJoint Committee on Human Rights Inquiry into the implications for access to justice of the government’s proposed legal aid reforms. \n This \nevidence\n was prepared for the Bingham Centre by Dr Mark Elliott (Reader in Public Law, University of Cambridge and Fel\nlow, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law), Dr Lawrence McNamara (Deputy Director and Senior Research Fellow, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law) and Dr Tom Hickman (Barrister, Blackstone Chambers and Fellow, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law), with contrib\nutions from other members of the Centre.  \n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law was launched in December 2010 and is an independent research institute devoted to the study and promotion of the rule of law worldwide.  Its focus is on understanding and pro\nmoting the rule of law; considering the challenges it faces; providing an intellectual framework within which it can operate; and fashioning the practical tools to support it. The Centre is named after Lord Bingham of Cornhill KG, the pre-eminent judge of \nhis generation and a passionate advocate of the rule of law.  It is part of the British Institute for International and Comparative Law, a registered charity based in London.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur evidence \nto the JCHR \nis divided into two sections:\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur views in relation to t\nhe proposed legal aid reforms as they stood when the JCHR\n \ninquiry was announced on 18 July 2013\n (“the Transforming Legal Aid proposals – April 2013”)\n.  \n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur views in relation to the further proposals\n which have been outlined since the \nJ\nCHR inquiry was \nannounced on 18 July 2013\n.\n We refer specifically to the\n \nTransforming Legal Aid: Next Steps \nconsultation announced on 5 September 2013 (“the Next Steps proposals – September 2013”).  In this section we also make some limited observations in relation to the \nJudicial Review: Further proposals for reform \n(Cm 8703) consultation, again announced in September. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTHE TRANSFORMING LEGAL AID PROPOSALS – APRIL 20134.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Bingham Centre’s views \non the April 2013 proposals \nare contained in the response we made to the Ministry of Justice consultation on the legal aid reforms in Consultation Paper CP14/2013 \nTransforming Legal Aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system\n. That response\n was framed around access to justic\ne and rule of law concerns, and it\n directly addresses \nthree of the four specific \nmatters on which the JCHR is seeking evidence\n.  \nWe\n have attached \nthat response\n as an appendix\n to this document and it should be considered part of our written evidence to the \nJCHR.\n \n \n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe access to justice and rule of law framework issues are addressed in paragraphs 4-7 and 53-54.\n \n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOf the four points in which the JCHR has expressed particular interest (the residence test, legal aid for prisoners, judicial review, and ‘borderline\n’ cases) our consultation response addresses the first three of these:\n&#xa0;\nTHE “NEXT STEPS” PROPOSALS – SEPTEMBER 2013   \n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “next steps” consultation document indicates that some modifications will be made to the April\n 2013 proposals. However, regarding\n the three issues \nabove \nour view is that our concerns largely still remain\n as they were.\n   \nThe residence test 8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “next s\nteps” document \nat 2.11 – 2.17 \nindicates residence test modifications.  While we welcome these changes, they do not adequately address the substance and scope of the matters we raised in our response on this issue.\n \n \nLegal aid for prisoners9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “next steps”\n document \nat 2.5 – 2.7 \nindicates \nprison law\n modifications.  \nAlthough there are adjustments (2.5), the original proposals are to be pursued.  Again, the adjustments \ndo not adequately address the substance and scope of the matters we raised in our response o\nn this issue.\nJudicial review10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “next steps” document at 2.18 – 2.20 states that there will be some limited change to the proposals for legal aid for permission work for judicial review. It forecasts a separate consultation, which is the subject of the \nJudicial Review: Further proposals for reform \n(Cm 8703) consultation. Chapter seven, in particular, addresses these matters. \n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTime constraints prevent us from, at this point, offering \na\n detailed analysis though we make the following observations.\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst, the essence of the \noriginal rationale and the \noriginal proposals remains. \n As the \nJudicial Review: Further Proposals\n paper notes at paragraph 20, the proposals “are intended to act as a disincentive to those considering judicial review \nwhose\n cases h\nave no merit …”.  In this regard, we point to our consultation response at paragraphs 25-30 where we attempt to compare the progress and success of claims that are legally aided and those that are not.  As we stated there\n in summary\n (para 30), “\nthere is no\nthing to suggest legally aided judicial review claims are pursued in a reckless way that results in a relatively high number of “weak” cases. On the contrary, there is everything to suggest that legally aided cases appear to be handled far more cautiously \nthan those which are unfunded, and lawyers in legally-aided applications are far more likely only to pursue cases with merit\n.” \n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the more detailed data \nand analysis \nprovided in the Impact Assessment attached to the \nJudicial Review: Further Propos\nals\n \npaper\n at paras 15-40\n.\n  Having said this, \nwe note that there is substantial uncertainty about the impact and effects, including how claimants may choose to respond if legal aid is unavailable, and we note especially the issue of claimants possibly proce\neding as litigants in person (para 38 of the Impact Assessment). We also\n remain concerned that the data is not presented in a way that offers some comparison of how legally aided claims proceed as against non-legally aided claims. Our tentative view is tha\nt, even with the further data provided, the \nmethods used to achieve the projected \nsavings are likely to have significant \ndetrimental \nimpacts on access to justice and, in the absence of comparative data, it is unclear that the prop\nosed changes are the best \nand most appropriate pathway towards achieving the aim of acting as a disincentive to pursue unmeritorious cases.\n \n  The numerous other concerns we have raised in our original response to the consultation also remain.\n   \n  \n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn these matters, i\nf it would assi\nst the Committee, the Bingham Centre can provide further written evidence and/or oral evidence that addresses the \nJudicial Review: Further proposals \nin more detail\n, particularly with regard \nto: (a) the data and analysis in the Impact Assessment, and (b) \nth\ne position relating to the proposal at paragraphs 118 - 131 of the paper, including the proposal regarding discretionary payments\n.  \n \n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nShould we be able to assist the Committee further in these or any other matters related to its inquiry, please do not hesi\ntate to contact us.\n&#xa0;\nAppendix attached:  Bingham Centre response to Transforming Legal Aid Consultation Paper CP14&#xa0;\nAPPENDIX TO BINGHAM CENTRE WRITTEN EVIDENCE TO JCHR (27 SEP 2013)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Response to Ministry of Justice Consultation Paper CP 14/2013Transforming legal aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION:  LEGAL AID AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE&#xa0;\nA.  PRISON LAW &#xa0;\nB.  RESIDENCE TEST&#xa0;\nC.  JUDICIAL REVIEWIntroduction &#xa0;\nThe evidence presented in the Consultation Paper&#xa0;\nSome doubts and concerns about the evidence &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAll applications (Source: MoJ, 2011)\nLegally aided applications (Source: LAA, 2011-12)\nThus:Non-legally aided applicationsApplications lodged11,359 \ntotal\n4,074\n \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n7,285\nApplications terminated prior to permission4,828\n \n(43% of total)\n&#xa0;\n2,275\n(56% of legally aided applications)\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n2,553\n(35% of non-legally-aided applications)\nApplications where permission sought&#xa0;\n6,531\n(57% of total)\n1799\n(44% of \nlegally aided applications\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n4732\n(65% of non-legally- aided applications)\nApplications where permission granted (either at first stage or after oral renewal)&#xa0;&#xa0;1,268\n(19% of all applications where permission sought)\n(11% of total applications) \n864\n(48% of legally aided applications where permission is sought)\n(21% of all legally aided applications)\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n404\n(9% of non-legally aided applications where permission is sought)\n(6% of all non-legally aided applications)\nApplications where permission refused&#xa0;&#xa0;4,479\n(69% of applications where permission is sought)\n&#xa0;\n845\n(47% of legally aided applications where permission is sought)\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n&#xa0;\n3,634 \n(77% of non-legally aided applications where permission is sought)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nFurther concerns about the relationship of the evidence to the proposals &#xa0;\n Lack of appreciation of the practical aspects of judicial review work &#xa0;\nD.  CRIMINAL LEGAL AIDCONCLUDING REMARKS27 September 2013\nAppendix to Bingham Centre JCHR evidence: \nBingham Centre Response to \nTransforming Legal Aid \n \n(June 2013)  \n              \n              \n              \n16\n&#xa0;\n Ministry of Justice, \nTransforming legal aid: Delivering a more credible and efficient system\n (CP 14/2013), p 3 (\nhttps://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-legal-aid/supporting_documents/transforminglegalaid.p\ndf\n). \n \nSee Tom Bingham, \nThe Rule of Law \n(2010),\n \nespecially chapter 8.\n See, e.g., \nR v  Lord Chancellor, ex parte Witham \n[1998] QB 575. \n Article 6. \n E.g. by means of such devices as statutory ouster clauses. \n See, e.g., \nWitham\n, n 2 above, in which the court fees regime’s inadequate accommodation of impecunious prospective litigants was found to breach the common law right of access to justice. \n \nTransforming legal aid\n, n 1 above, paras 3.17-18.\n \nTransforming legal aid\n, n 1 ab\nove, para 3.17.\n \nTransforming legal aid\n, n 1 above, p 111. \n See, e.g., \nR v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison\n [1979] 1 QB 425; \nRaymond v Honey\n [1983] 1 AC 1. \n \nTransforming legal aid\n, n 1 above, para 3.15. \n \nR\n \nv\n \nSecretary of State for the Home Departmen\nt, ex parte Tarrant \n[1985] QB 251. \n \nTransforming legal aid\n, n 1 above, para 3.14. \n Question 1: “Do you agree that the proposed threshold is set an appropriate level?

The development of the public sector equality duties in administrative law” [2013] PL 325 at 333. \n [2012] EWHC 2144 \n(Admin). \n \nWe proceed cautiously here because of the paucity of data available. We would much prefer to see comprehensive data and analysis from the MoJ (and we have requested that). However, without that, we rely here on the best available data.  \nOur tab\nle is based on two sets of figures that have been made publicly available: (a) the statistics for 2011 -12 legally aided judicial review cases contained in the \nTransforming legal aid \nconsultation paper (“the LAA statistics”); (b) the statistics for 2011 ju\ndicial review cases published in April 2013 (“the MoJ statistics”) (see the tables accompanying \nJudicial Review Statistics, \nn \nError! Bookmark not defined. above). We have presumed that the statistics have been compiled in a comparable way, with the LAA figures being case progression in the same way the MoJ figures are, and it appears from para 3.65 of \nTransforming Legal Aid \nthat this is so. \nWe have \ntreated each of these sets of figures as a fair approximation of a single one-year period, primarily because there is not a great percentage change in applications terminated prior to permission from 2007 through to 2011 in table 1 of the judicial review s\ntatistics, and especially so in 2010 (41%) and 2011 (43%).  As we are concerned with the larger patterns, any difference between the judicial review statistics for 2011 and the legal aid statistics for 2011-12 is unlikely to be significant.  \nIn the absence\n of more comprehensive data these figures provide a guide. We also note that it is, in any event, dangerous to attempt to draw inferences from bald pre-permission termination figures, given the diversity of reasons for not applying for permission (e.g., a \ncase in which the defendant concedes following a grant of interim relief would fall into this category). \n MoJ JR statistics, \nTable 1: figure stated.\n \nTransforming Legal Aid\n, para 3.65: figure stated.\n \nMoJ\n JR statistics, Table 1: 11,359 total applications less 6,531 applications where permission sought  \n \nTransforming Legal Aid\n, para 3.65: figure stated.\n MoJ JR statistics, Table 1: 945 granted at first stage plus 5,586 refused at first stage = 6531 appli\ncations where permission sought. \n \nTransforming Legal Aid\n, para 3.66: figure stated.\n \nMoJ JR statistics, Table 1: figure stated.\n \nTransforming Legal Aid\n, para 3.66: Estimated. 1,799 sought permission, less 845 that received permission = 954 remaining.
