FBA0011/13-14&#xa0;&#xa0;In June 2010 the Government committed to improve the way in which tax policy is developed, communicated and legislated, and published a consultation document: Tax policy-making: a new approach. In December 2010 the Government published “The new approach to tax policy making: a response to the consultation”, which set out details of the new tax policy making process. &#xa0;During the Tax Policy Making consultation, officials met more than 40 tax practitioners to discuss the way we make tax policy: including lawyers, accountants, and tax managers and received over 40 written responses.&#xa0;Following consultation, the Government announced five major changes which have a substantial impact on the way tax policy is made and communicated: &#xa0;• Where the Government is embarking on major areas of tax reform, it will set out its policy objectives and rationale for reform, building on the approach taken in the Corporate Tax Road Map. • Tax policies will be developed over a longer policy cycle. The majority of tax measures will be announced at Budgets for inclusion in the Finance Bill the following year at the earliest. • The Government will use the period between the Budget and the following Finance Bill to consult on proposed policy changes and draft legislation. The Government published a Tax Consultation Framework

[[[ ]]]that outlines its approach to consultation on tax policy and legislation. In summary, the framework commits to:&#xa0;• The Government will take a more strategic approach

[[[ ]]]to tax avoidance, and its response to significant avoidance risks will be balanced with improving predictability and stability in the tax system. The Government published a Protocol

[[[ ]]]setting out the circumstances in which it will announce legislative changes with immediate effect outside fiscal events. &#xa0;• When announcing changes to tax law, the Government will ensure that it clearly sets out what the change is; why it is being proposed and what impact it will have. &#xa0;
