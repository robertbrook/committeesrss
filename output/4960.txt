&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by  Care for the Wild International&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; IntroductionCare for the Wild International submits this document for consideration at the inquiry into the keeping of primates as pets in the UK by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. Care for the Wild is an international wildlife charity based in the UK, which has worked for to the protection of wildlife in the UK and around the globe for 30 years. As a member of ENDCAP, Care for the Wild International was a key partner in producing the ENDCAP report, Wild Pets in the European Union, launched at the European Parliament on 3rd October 2012. 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Executive SummaryThe keeping of primates as pets presents many issues including the impact on the individual primate’s welfare, the conservation of wild populations and the prevention of the illegal trade, as well as the possible transmission of disease or injury to humans. &#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Overviewa)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Within the UK, it is estimated that there could be as many as 15,000-20,000 primates as pets. Much of the trade in primates within the UK is done privately and so it is hard to monitor exact numbers. Most trade appears to normally occur in private, making monitoring difficult. Breeders and private dealers are believed to be the main source of pet primates.b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a group, primates are recognised as being highly intelligent animals with complex emotional and physical needs and capabilities. As such, when kept in any form of captivity, they must be cared for by qualified individuals though evidence suggests many privately owned primates do not receive suitable care. Solitary housing, early separation from the mother and inappropriate housing are just some of the husbandry practices likely to cause welfare problems in pet primates.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the wild, many primate species are threatened by habitat degradation, bush meat hunting, and capture for the pet trade. Legal trade in wild species (or products deriving &#xa0;&#xa0;from them) can often lead to an illegal trade supplied through the poaching of wildlife – this has been notable especially in the ivory trade. Wide scale illegal poaching has been shown to fund other illegal activities such as terrorism, weapons trade and drug smuggling and poaching is driving many species to extinction. d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For each wild pet that does end up in someone’s home, numerous others may have died along the way. For every wild animal captured and sold as a wild pet, an estimated 50 may be killed or die in transit.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Wild in nature and often unpredictable, some primates are potentially very dangerous to people, and able to inflict severe physical injury or transmit unusual and harmful diseases such as hepatitis A, tuberculosis, monkey pox and herpesvirus simiae-B. If the animal escapes, it could present further danger to UK wildlife populations. f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Current legislation for primates offers protection by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) 2006 and some species require a licence to be kept as pets under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act (DWAA) 1976. International trade is controlled by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However, the current Code of Practice on the Welfare of privately owned primates cannot be legally enforced and the information therein only offers generic advice insufficient for the wide ranging species that make up the primate pet trade. A number of countries have now introduced legislation to ban, regulate or restrict the private keeping of pet primates, including Denmark, Bulgaria, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, the US, Australia, Israel, Mexico and Honduras.g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While the need for specific guidelines for the keeping of primates as pets has been recognised, we are concerned that there are no provisions for an auditable licensing system for keepers of these animals, which would enable oversight of adherence to current legislation. &#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recommendations&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Care for the Wild believes that it is extremely difficult to achieve the suitable provision of welfare standards for primates in private ownership, and that the keeping of primates by private collectors can have adverse consequences for their welfare, as well as their conservation status in the wild in some circumstances. b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Care for the Wild feels that the need for keeping primates should show clear purpose beyond that of simply being a companion animal or pastime. As a welfare and conservation charity, we recommend that the keeping of any primate should be solely for the conservation of the species or the welfare of an individual and not for private collections.c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We strongly support legislation being proposed in the United Kingdom to restrict the private ownership of primates to purposes other than pet ownership, namely species conservation or the care of animals, by sanctuaries and individuals to whom sanctuaries &#xa0;&#xa0;re-home animals, as a result of their abandonment, neglect, maltreatment or injury.  We would support a full ban in the keeping of primates as pets for private owners. d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In relation to private ownership for conservation, only species for which a genuine conservation need has been recognised should be able to be kept.  It is acknowledged that not all professionally recognised controlled breeding programmes admit private individuals.  Nevertheless, if private individuals were able to participate in such programmes, this could be a permitted purpose for private primate ownership.e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Care for the Wild believes that all those keeping primates for a permitted purpose should follow a government endorsed detailed, species-appropriate code of practice that promotes a high level of care, coupled with a licensing or registration scheme.
