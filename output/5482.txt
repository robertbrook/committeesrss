[[[&#xa0;]]]Summary of Main Points:-&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;The British Ports Association and its members have been involved in the process that led to the identification of 27 MCZs towards the end of last year.  This involvement included representation on the four regional groups, meetings with Defra and MMO officials and, in 2013, meetings with Defra Ministers.&#xa0;We appreciate that the Committee inquiry is quite rightly concerned with looking forward and the way in which the 27 sites and other sites will be managed and monitored.  However, we would like to reiterate a number of points about the process so far as we believe that they are still relevant.  Firstly, we still have concerns about the robustness of the data underpinning site selection.  This has equally been an issue for government and there was, for example, a six month delay in the selection of sites in late 2011 to revisit the data that was being used.  &#xa0;One of the points we made in the consultation at the beginning of 2013 was that designations were being made in advance of marine plans and that the process was back to front; the data derived from marine plans could be extremely useful, with the marine plan for the east coast on the verge of completion and work underway for the south coast.  &#xa0;There is also the ongoing issue of the treatment of the reference sites.  These were withdrawn from consideration within the first round as there were a number of examples where sites had been proposed to Defra by the regional groups at the last moment and without consultation with those groups.  We understand that the reference sites are being considered again.  It is crucial that if these sites are to provide a very high level of protection with consequences for current activity within these sites, then the justification for including them should be robust.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We are also concerned that it is possible to include new features for protection within a site without consultation, and that a change in a conservation objective from “maintain” to “recover” can also be introduced without consultation.  We are also puzzled that some MCZ sites are proposed within existing Natura 2000 sites which are already subject to a high level of control, management and protection; we see little point in this additional designation.  &#xa0;Although some of these concerns are reflected in the fact that just some of the 127 MCZ sites identified at the beginning of 2013 were designated, there is still the issue of how the remaining sites are treated and in particular the possibility of planning blight.  There are still possible sites either within or adjacent to port areas which could be a material consideration when applications are made for new developments.  This is particularly the case for offshore energy developments where promoters need speed and flexibility in achieving a marine licence.  &#xa0;Turning to the Committee’s specific questions, our responses are:-&#xa0;&#xa0;A feature of Defra’s 2013 consultation was a lack of information about the management measures that would apply, making it difficult to respond.  We did receive an assurance from the then Defra Minister that the designation of an MCZ “should have no material effect on port activity”.  We were told that the basis of a designation was that it needed to be consistent with current activity and that consultation on appropriate management measures would be based on the principle that port growth and investment were protected.  We do nevertheless have a co-operative and constructive relationship with both Defra and the MMO and we would hope to use this as the basis for developing management measures which take into account the ways in which sites are currently used.  &#xa0;However, we are at a very early stage and have little evidence either way as to how the regulators will go about devising full blown management plans.  Early indications are that skill in dealing with and accommodating a wide range of stakeholders will be crucial.  We hope that wherever possible the opportunity to build on existing arrangements will be taken rather than regulation.  We have an example where “voluntary MCZs” have been in operation for ten years.  Although these would not necessarily be compliant with the legislation, these could be used as the basis for future management and we would hope that in such circumstances, only a light tough is needed.  It is an example where regulators can take a flexible approach based on individual circumstances.  &#xa0;We have another example where the local IFCA has already implemented new byelaws to control fishing activities within a newly designated MCZ.  However, this was without any formal approach to the harbour authority by the MMO, IFCA or Natural England.  Harbour authorities will always be key players and need to be fully involved.  Bearing in mind the combination of national and local organizations involved, there is a risk that management measures are not effectively co-ordinated.  Lack of co-ordination was of course a feature of the four regional groups tasked with recommending the sites and any replication of this should be avoided at all costs.  Rather than byelaws, using voluntary measures which can be introduced more quickly and be more flexible should be a viable option; there should not be an automatic recourse to legislation.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Clearly these are crucial issues and we will be very interested to see Defra’s and the MMO‘s responses to these questions which go to the heart of our concerns about  the MCZ designations.  We would refer again to the Minister’s comments to us last September about making a designation consistent with port activity.  As part of our response to the 2013 consultation and as part of our discussion with Ministers last year, we did request that no MCZ should be located in or adjacent to port areas.&#xa0;&#xa0;Bearing in mind our comments on the adequacy of data in our opening remarks, we consider that it is very important that further evidence is commissioned.  The government will have primary responsibility for this, but ports which hold extensive data on their areas will also wish to co-operate.  They will also wish to submit data on socio-economic impacts.&#xa0;&#xa0;Again we have yet to see how socio-economic factors will be deployed across a full range of sites.  It might be significant that the majority of the sites included in the first round of designations were, on the whole, less contentious in terms of their socio-economic status.  Nevertheless, the decision to exclude the Stour and Orwell was welcome.  It was also based on the availability of an alternative site to protect the same features, so perhaps it is too early to gauge the impact of socio-economic factors per se.  Individual ports will of course present their own cases about existing and potential activity bearing in mind the major contribution that ports in England make to the economy.   The strong link between ports and development of the offshore wind industry is also, in our view, a key factor. The already challenging offshore energy market could be made even more challenging if planning consents are delayed or unsuccessful because of the influence of an MCZ.  This in itself will have a separate environmental impact on carbon targets.  &#xa0;&#xa0;This is largely for the government to answer in relation to its responsibilities under EU and national legislation.  From our perspective, we believe that there already exists a comprehensive network of sites delivered through Natura 2000, SSSIs and other initiatives and that these already achieve a high level of protection.&#xa0;&#xa0;24 January 2014&#xa0;
