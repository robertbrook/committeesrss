defaultSummarydefault1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch and Methodsdefault1.1default&#xa0; 
defaultThe following findings are based on a piece of on-going research on the impact of the Coalition’s Transparency Agenda since 2010. The research focuses on local government, particularly the publication of all spending over £500. It is based on a survey of local authorities, FOI requests 
defaultto 
defaultselected authorities, and interviews with practitioners, innovators and users.
default1.2default&#xa0; 
defaultAs of writing (
default28
defaultth
default 
defaultAugust 2013) the information is not compl
defaultete. The survey currently has 54 r
defaultesponses representing around 15
default% of local authorities
default.
default The FOI requests were made to 50 authorities
default.
default The data below needs to be read with these limitations in mind. 
default There is also some inconsistency among responses, between for example hits or visits.
default As it is 
defaulton-going
default, all findings are provisional. 
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy is Open Data important? default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultOpen Data offers an opportunity for a number of groups. For the 
defaultpublic
default, as well as
default journalists 
defaultand
default NGOs,
default Open Data offers the chance to make government
default more transparent and open. It 
defaultalso may work to increase levels of public trust or participation, 
defaultthough these are complex areas where information can have uncertain and unpredictable effects.
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt offers 
defaultinnovators
default the chance to re-use data for political, economic and social applications. These can go from the democratic (such as 
defaultOpenly Local
default) to the everyday (
defaultschool finder
default). Such innovations are likely to be vital bridges to wider public use and access. 
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor 
defaultpublic authorities
default themselves, it offers the chance to be more responsive by, for example, strengthening the evidence base of policy-making or targeting resources in a particular direction. To fully realise this would require joining up and sharing data, something many authorities appear keen on but at present feel they lack the resources to do.
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne important point to make is that Open Data is not Freedom of Information, though the two overlap. While FOI is about accessing information, Open Data is also about re-use, innovation and adaption. Seeing one as a replacement for the other risks obscuring these key differences. 
default2.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor Open Data, the mix of technology and political aims further confuses the meaning. One recent study spoke of how the definition itself is ‘deeply ambiguous’ as it ‘blurred the distinction between the technology of Open Data and the politics of Open Government’. 
default 
default3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy does the Government need an open data strategy? What should the Government’s aims be for the release of open data? Are the Government’s stated key outcomes in its Open Data Strategy the right ones? default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe core of Open Data
default reform concerns publishing ‘government data in a reusable form’.
defaultOne emerging issue is the lack of clarity over the exact aims of the government’s Transparency Agenda.
default A number of interviewees spoke of how government emphasis shifts between the ‘democratic’ aspects, using data to improve public understanding and participation, to the ‘economic’ objectives, creating re-use and economic growth. As the Shakespeare review pointed out, these aims may contradict each other and lead to 
defaultdifferent areas of government ‘pushing’ different aims.
default This is likely to be further complicated by the competing economic aims of the EU P
defaultublic 
defaultS
defaultector 
defaultI
defaultnformation
default agenda
default.
default 
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultSome of the aims are also hedged with uncertainty. The NAO felt that the economic aims were based on ‘highly uncertain assumptions’ and a number of interviewees felt similarly that, while the potential was clearly there, economic aims may be difficult to realise.
default Other ideas, such as the concept of the ‘Armchair Auditors’, may also not work in the manner hoped (see below). 
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis lack of clarity is reflected in confusion among public bodies. A 2012 survey of by the LGA found a lack of understanding
default at local level over 
defaultwho Open Data was intended for and concern that there was no clear strategy behind it.
default 
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIs open data presented well and of adequate quality? Are the formats of the data being published accessible, useable and understandable to the public? What metadata is needed to make releases useful? default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Public Accounts Committee (2012) highlighted concerns over how data was inconsistent, ‘raw’ and ‘very difficult to interpret’
default.
default This was for two reasons. First, information needed to be comparable across equivalent bodies. Current use of excel 
defaultfiles 
defaultwith short descriptors prevented any rigorous measurement between 
defaultthem
default. 
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultSecond, information needed to be contextualised and accompanied by some form of ‘narrative’. One concern is that presentation ‘frames’ interpretation. So, for example, publication of spending data lends itself to consideration of ‘waste’ and ‘spending’ rather than understanding the effect the money has.
default A fully ‘joined up’ approach could trace spending from central government down to local authority and then to the impact. 
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThird, the 
defaultspending
default information fits with the ‘granular’ and small-scale approach associated with successful online democracy experiments.
default However, to bring about 
defaultreal accountability and participation the data also needs to be linked to clear and functioning accountability mechanisms. 
default5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWho will use the Data?default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultFOI requests were made
default to selected authorities
default for the numbers of views of spending pages. There was variability in 
defaultthe 
defaultnumber of visits (which 
defaultwere
default also recorded differently). 
defaultBelow are a few examples
default, chosen simply to illustrate the variety.

default&#xa0;default5.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn the survey, 60% of those asked described use of spending data as ‘low’ or ‘very low’ with another 30% not knowing.  
defaultThe highest 
defaultuse 
defaultwas 5357 pageviews in a 24 month period (a County Council) and the lowest 210 pageviews in a 26 month period (a District Council).  
defaultThe
default emerging picture of low use is supported by other research.
default 
defaultThis can be compared with visits to other sites (note visits and page views are different
default and
default the table
default is indicative only)

default100-200,000default&#xa0;default5.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultExplaining why interest appears low
default for the spending data
default is complex. However, survey respondents and interviewees offered a number of explanations. First, the way in which information was displayed is problematic. As one put it ‘a long list of every invoice over £500 is meaningless to most people’. The information was not contextualised or 
defaultattached to a narrative ‘a one line showing £x for product/service "Y" is of little use in understanding public expenditure’. 
defaultThe s
defaultites
default in the table above are different. For example,
default 
defaultPolice.uk
default hold
defaults
default specific and relevant information down to the street level. 
defaultTheyWorkForYou
default, which has had considerable success in attracting a wide variety of those not previously participating in politics, offers an easy, user friendly way of understanding the activities of individual MPs
default.
default5.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultSecond it may also not fit with habits: ‘People prefer to send an email rather than look for the information themselves’. They may lack both the ‘skills and time to analyse the data’.
default5.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultThird, as with all forms of participation, the motivation of the public is likely to be the key barrier. As one respondent put it ‘I assume that most people are not the slightest bit interested in spending their spare time poring over this type of material’. A number felt the lack of interest ‘reflects the general public interest (or lack of interest) in local government’.

default&#xa0; 
defaultThe public were intended to be the beneficiaries of the data but were not often named as the biggest users. This may because of the general barriers to participation outlined above. It may also be connected to where the interest of the public lies. Interviewees pointed out that general ‘engagement’ with local government concerned ‘problems’ or daily matters rather than spending. One Metropolitan Borough Council publishes the number of visits per month to various parts of its website.

default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the controversy over FOI use by journalists, one possibility was that the 
defaultnew d
defaultata would be 
defaultsimilarly 
defaultused by the media to hold authorities to account. Authorities reported a ‘flurry’ of interest from journalists but one that often died down. A search o
defaultf
default regional newspapers found 148 articles specifically using the term ‘spending over £500’ between May 2010 and August 2012 (though it is possible many journalists using the data did not mention the source
default in their article
default). The spending data was used to question authorities, focusing on odd spending at small level (air fresheners, taxis) or for individual councillors. Newspapers also urged the public to use the data and berated authorities that were slow or ‘lagging’ behind in publication. A selection of newspapers reported it more heavily where the spending data was causing particular controversy.  
default6.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultNGOs heavily use FOI, often as part of wider campaigns alongside other instruments such as attending meetings, writing to councillors etc. It is possible national groups (such as the Taxpayers’ Alliance, mentioned in the surveys) and local activists are using the data in a similar way.   
default6.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe biggest user group was business. Businesses are also big users of FOI at local level, from small ‘one person’ companies to multi-nationals
default.
default A 2010 study of data.gov.uk found a wide use by businesses and social entrepreneurs alongside IT innovators.
default 
defaultArmchair Auditors
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the most eye-catching ideas from the government’s Transparency Agenda is that of the ‘Armchair Auditor’ where citizens use newly ‘opened up’ information on spending, contracts and crime to hold public bodies to account. But has it happened
default?
default7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultAdrian Short has created open access software taken up by Auditors in the ‘North’ (Hull and Lincolnshire) and on the Isle of Wight. In London one particularly high profile case led to Eric Pickles publicly praising Armchair Auditors in their fight against Barnet’s ‘easycouncil’. But there are few signs of a wider 
default‘army’
default. 
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe first and most obvious 
defaultreason
default is that the
default information is not yet consistent
default,
default so questioning and understanding it is not easy or possible. The Armchair Auditor also needs to be a particular type of person:  engaged and interested in local government, with 
defaulta 
defaultgood grasp of ho
defaultw government works and motivation and skills
default to dedicate time to it. To have all these t
defaultraits in combination is rare. 
default7.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultA further
default issue is how to use the information is used. The data is likely to work alongside other accountability tools - the activists in Barnet used a combination of FOI requests, the local media and judicial review.
default It is not yet clear where exactly ‘Armchair Audit’ fits. 
default 
default7.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultArmchair Auditors, like all accountability mechanisms, work best in certain situations. A high profile scandal, as in Barnet, appears 
defaultto be one way of kick starting audit
default. Auditors have appeared in particular situations, normally ‘accountability vacuums’, where there is no existing accountability or ‘formal’ mechanisms have failed. Given these limitations and the general difficulty of ‘crowd-sourcing’ 
defaultaudit 
defaultis
default likely to re
defaultmain limited
default. The idea
default behind audit
default indicates one of the misunderstandings about data - it is not ‘power’ by itself: it requires narrative and explanation and, most importantly, like FOI, it needs to work with other tools to bring 
defaultabout 
defaultaccountability.
default 
default8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow successful has the Government’s Open Data initiative been in changing behaviour in the Civil Service and wider public sector? default8.1default&#xa0; 
defaultMeasuring any behaviour change is difficult, especially as Open Data is so new. The real benefits are likely to arrive in the future, when joined up data and innovations can offer targeted information.
default 
default8.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultInternally, some authorities have recorded improved information flows. There may
default also
default be increased ‘internal’ accountability as officials and politicians use the data to monitor 
defaultactivity from within. Some authorities 
defaultreporting 
defaultus
defaulting
default the new data internally but it was not 
defaultclear what
default for. 
default8.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere may also be better spending behaviour and professionalising of systems as a result of being ‘watched’. This again is difficult to measure but supported by some academic studies. Interviewees felt publishing spending data may either professionalise or drive ‘poor’ behaviour deeper underground. The exact effects would be dependent on how much the data
default is being used (and its quality
default) - the current low levels would be likely to have a small effect
default.
default 
default8.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultOpen Data holds tremendous opportunities for policy-making. Interviewees pointed out that an emphasis on how information could be used in policy-making would improve its reception and significant
defaultly alter
default how policy 
defaultis
default made and resources targeted, especially if joined up.  From small scale issues e.g. saving money through prescriptions to targeting homelessness or health resources, it can have a transformative impact.
default8.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, the lack of clarity over the aims makes it a difficult policy to persuade others to support. The danger is that, in times of scarce resources and growing pressure, senior officials would be unwilling to release data.  There may also be limitations due to 
defaultthe lack of technical 
defaultskills.
default8.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe failure of data.gov
default in the US
default may serve as a l
defaultesson, weakened by 
defaulta vicious cycle of a lack of co-operation from departments, eager to preserve current data for use in spending battles, and a lack of public use and interest.
default8.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultA final concern was that the spending data was a ‘political’ tool to help control local authorities and portray them as ‘reckless’ spenders
default who were
default ‘wasting’ money. This reflects a wider concern that the Open Data may be a ‘Trojan horse’ for privatisation by offering information to private providers.
default 
default9default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhich data is most useful?default9.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultResearch from FOI points towards a mismatch between what government hopes the public will be interested in and what data the public want. Aside from the high profile scandals, most requesters use FOI to obtain information of value to themselves and their 
defaultown lives: a form of ‘micro-political’ or ‘non-political’ use
default.
default This may be reflected in open data use. The most frequently downloaded data on data.gov concerns ‘core’ data useful for 
defaultbroader 
defaultanalysis or quotidian information. 
default10default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat type of transparency information is of most interest to users? default       defaultThe table below is drawn from the survey. Officials were asked what type of data was of most interest. The findings are interesting given the low interest in the spending data.
