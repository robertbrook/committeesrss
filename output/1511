[normal]Statistics and Open Data: [bold]Evidence[bold] f[bold]rom [bold]Dr. [bold]Ben Worthy[bold] [OD003][bold]Dr Ben Worthy is a Lecturer in Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. His research interests include Transparency, Freedom of Information and Open Data. 
[normal]Summary[bold]1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Research and Methods[bold]1.1[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The following findings are based on a piece of on-going research on the impact of the Coalition’s Transparency Agenda since 2010. The research focuses on local government, particularly the publication of all spending over £500. It is based on a survey of local authorities, FOI requests 
[normal]to 
[normal]selected authorities, and interviews with practitioners, innovators and users.
[normal]1.2[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]As of writing (
[normal]28
[normal]th
[normal] 
[normal]August 2013) the information is not compl
[normal]ete. The survey currently has 54 r
[normal]esponses representing around 15
[normal]% of local authorities
[normal].
[normal] The FOI requests were made to 50 authorities
[normal].
[normal] The data below needs to be read with these limitations in mind. 
[normal] There is also some inconsistency among responses, between for example hits or visits.
[normal] As it is 
[normal]on-going
[normal], all findings are provisional. 
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why is Open Data important? [bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Open Data offers an opportunity for a number of groups. For the 
[normal]public
[normal], as well as
[normal] journalists 
[normal]and
[normal] NGOs,
[normal] Open Data offers the chance to make government
[normal] more transparent and open. It 
[normal]also may work to increase levels of public trust or participation, 
[normal]though these are complex areas where information can have uncertain and unpredictable effects.
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It offers 
[normal]innovators
[normal] the chance to re-use data for political, economic and social applications. These can go from the democratic (such as 
[normal]Openly Local
[normal]) to the everyday (
[normal]school finder
[normal]). Such innovations are likely to be vital bridges to wider public use and access. 
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]For 
[normal]public authorities
[normal] themselves, it offers the chance to be more responsive by, for example, strengthening the evidence base of policy-making or targeting resources in a particular direction. To fully realise this would require joining up and sharing data, something many authorities appear keen on but at present feel they lack the resources to do.
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]One important point to make is that Open Data is not Freedom of Information, though the two overlap. While FOI is about accessing information, Open Data is also about re-use, innovation and adaption. Seeing one as a replacement for the other risks obscuring these key differences. 
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]For Open Data, the mix of technology and political aims further confuses the meaning. One recent study spoke of how the definition itself is ‘deeply ambiguous’ as it ‘blurred the distinction between the technology of Open Data and the politics of Open Government’. 
[normal] 
[normal]3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why does the Government need an open data strategy? What should the Government’s aims be for the release of open data? Are the Government’s stated key outcomes in its Open Data Strategy the right ones? [bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The core of Open Data
[normal] reform concerns publishing ‘government data in a reusable form’.
[normal]One emerging issue is the lack of clarity over the exact aims of the government’s Transparency Agenda.
[normal] A number of interviewees spoke of how government emphasis shifts between the ‘democratic’ aspects, using data to improve public understanding and participation, to the ‘economic’ objectives, creating re-use and economic growth. As the Shakespeare review pointed out, these aims may contradict each other and lead to 
[normal]different areas of government ‘pushing’ different aims.
[normal] This is likely to be further complicated by the competing economic aims of the EU P
[normal]ublic 
[normal]S
[normal]ector 
[normal]I
[normal]nformation
[normal] agenda
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Some of the aims are also hedged with uncertainty. The NAO felt that the economic aims were based on ‘highly uncertain assumptions’ and a number of interviewees felt similarly that, while the potential was clearly there, economic aims may be difficult to realise.
[normal] Other ideas, such as the concept of the ‘Armchair Auditors’, may also not work in the manner hoped (see below). 
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This lack of clarity is reflected in confusion among public bodies. A 2012 survey of by the LGA found a lack of understanding
[normal] at local level over 
[normal]who Open Data was intended for and concern that there was no clear strategy behind it.
[normal] 
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Is open data presented well and of adequate quality? Are the formats of the data being published accessible, useable and understandable to the public? What metadata is needed to make releases useful? [bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Public Accounts Committee (2012) highlighted concerns over how data was inconsistent, ‘raw’ and ‘very difficult to interpret’
[normal].
[normal] This was for two reasons. First, information needed to be comparable across equivalent bodies. Current use of excel 
[normal]files 
[normal]with short descriptors prevented any rigorous measurement between 
[normal]them
[normal]. 
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Second, information needed to be contextualised and accompanied by some form of ‘narrative’. One concern is that presentation ‘frames’ interpretation. So, for example, publication of spending data lends itself to consideration of ‘waste’ and ‘spending’ rather than understanding the effect the money has.
[normal] A fully ‘joined up’ approach could trace spending from central government down to local authority and then to the impact. 
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Third, the 
[normal]spending
[normal] information fits with the ‘granular’ and small-scale approach associated with successful online democracy experiments.
[normal] However, to bring about 
[normal]real accountability and participation the data also needs to be linked to clear and functioning accountability mechanisms. 
[normal]5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Who will use the Data?[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]FOI requests were made
[normal] to selected authorities
[normal] for the numbers of views of spending pages. There was variability in 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of visits (which 
[normal]were
[normal] also recorded differently). 
[normal]Below are a few examples
[normal], chosen simply to illustrate the variety.
[normal]Council[bold] type[bold]Number of[bold]page[bold]views [bold]Jan-Dec 2012[bold]district

[normal]district
[normal]35
[normal]district
[normal]41
[normal]district
[normal]636
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In the survey, 60% of those asked described use of spending data as ‘low’ or ‘very low’ with another 30% not knowing.  
[normal]The highest 
[normal]use 
[normal]was 5357 pageviews in a 24 month period (a County Council) and the lowest 210 pageviews in a 26 month period (a District Council).  
[normal]The
[normal] emerging picture of low use is supported by other research.
[normal] 
[normal]This can be compared with visits to other sites (note visits and page views are different
[normal] and
[normal] the table
[normal] is indicative only)
[normal] 
[normal]Site[bold]Visits per [bold]month[bold]Police.uk

[normal]DoTheyK
[normal]now
[normal]100-200,000[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Explaining why interest appears low
[normal] for the spending data
[normal] is complex. However, survey respondents and interviewees offered a number of explanations. First, the way in which information was displayed is problematic. As one put it ‘a long list of every invoice over £500 is meaningless to most people’. The information was not contextualised or 
[normal]attached to a narrative ‘a one line showing £x for product/service "Y" is of little use in understanding public expenditure’. 
[normal]The s
[normal]ites
[normal] in the table above are different. For example,
[normal] 
[normal]Police.uk
[normal] hold
[normal]s
[normal] specific and relevant information down to the street level. 
[normal]TheyWorkForYou
[normal], which has had considerable success in attracting a wide variety of those not previously participating in politics, offers an easy, user friendly way of understanding the activities of individual MPs
[normal].
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Second it may also not fit with habits: ‘People prefer to send an email rather than look for the information themselves’. They may lack both the ‘skills and time to analyse the data’.
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Third, as with all forms of participation, the motivation of the public is likely to be the key barrier. As one respondent put it ‘I assume that most people are not the slightest bit interested in spending their spare time poring over this type of material’. A number felt the lack of interest ‘reflects the general public interest (or lack of interest) in local government’.
[normal]6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Users of the Data [bold]The table below is drawn from the survey. Officials were asked which group 
[normal]were the primary users
[normal] of the data published by local authorities.

[normal]Public
[normal]6.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The public were intended to be the beneficiaries of the data but were not often named as the biggest users. This may because of the general barriers to participation outlined above. It may also be connected to where the interest of the public lies. Interviewees pointed out that general ‘engagement’ with local government concerned ‘problems’ or daily matters rather than spending. One Metropolitan Borough Council publishes the number of visits per month to various parts of its website.

[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the controversy over FOI use by journalists, one possibility was that the 
[normal]new d
[normal]ata would be 
[normal]similarly 
[normal]used by the media to hold authorities to account. Authorities reported a ‘flurry’ of interest from journalists but one that often died down. A search o
[normal]f
[normal] regional newspapers found 148 articles specifically using the term ‘spending over £500’ between May 2010 and August 2012 (though it is possible many journalists using the data did not mention the source
[normal] in their article
[normal]). The spending data was used to question authorities, focusing on odd spending at small level (air fresheners, taxis) or for individual councillors. Newspapers also urged the public to use the data and berated authorities that were slow or ‘lagging’ behind in publication. A selection of newspapers reported it more heavily where the spending data was causing particular controversy.  
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]NGOs heavily use FOI, often as part of wider campaigns alongside other instruments such as attending meetings, writing to councillors etc. It is possible national groups (such as the Taxpayers’ Alliance, mentioned in the surveys) and local activists are using the data in a similar way.   
[normal]6.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The biggest user group was business. Businesses are also big users of FOI at local level, from small ‘one person’ companies to multi-nationals
[normal].
[normal] A 2010 study of data.gov.uk found a wide use by businesses and social entrepreneurs alongside IT innovators.
[normal] 
[normal]Armchair Auditors
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]One of the most eye-catching ideas from the government’s Transparency Agenda is that of the ‘Armchair Auditor’ where citizens use newly ‘opened up’ information on spending, contracts and crime to hold public bodies to account. But has it happened
[normal]?
[normal]7.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Adrian Short has created open access software taken up by Auditors in the ‘North’ (Hull and Lincolnshire) and on the Isle of Wight. In London one particularly high profile case led to Eric Pickles publicly praising Armchair Auditors in their fight against Barnet’s ‘easycouncil’. But there are few signs of a wider 
[normal]‘army’
[normal]. 
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The first and most obvious 
[normal]reason
[normal] is that the
[normal] information is not yet consistent
[normal],
[normal] so questioning and understanding it is not easy or possible. The Armchair Auditor also needs to be a particular type of person:  engaged and interested in local government, with 
[normal]a 
[normal]good grasp of ho
[normal]w government works and motivation and skills
[normal] to dedicate time to it. To have all these t
[normal]raits in combination is rare. 
[normal]7.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A further
[normal] issue is how to use the information is used. The data is likely to work alongside other accountability tools - the activists in Barnet used a combination of FOI requests, the local media and judicial review.
[normal] It is not yet clear where exactly ‘Armchair Audit’ fits. 
[normal] 
[normal]7.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Armchair Auditors, like all accountability mechanisms, work best in certain situations. A high profile scandal, as in Barnet, appears 
[normal]to be one way of kick starting audit
[normal]. Auditors have appeared in particular situations, normally ‘accountability vacuums’, where there is no existing accountability or ‘formal’ mechanisms have failed. Given these limitations and the general difficulty of ‘crowd-sourcing’ 
[normal]audit 
[normal]is
[normal] likely to re
[normal]main limited
[normal]. The idea
[normal] behind audit
[normal] indicates one of the misunderstandings about data - it is not ‘power’ by itself: it requires narrative and explanation and, most importantly, like FOI, it needs to work with other tools to bring 
[normal]about 
[normal]accountability.
[normal] 
[normal]8[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How successful has the Government’s Open Data initiative been in changing behaviour in the Civil Service and wider public sector? [bold]8.1[bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Measuring any behaviour change is difficult, especially as Open Data is so new. The real benefits are likely to arrive in the future, when joined up data and innovations can offer targeted information.
[normal] 
[normal]8.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Internally, some authorities have recorded improved information flows. There may
[normal] also
[normal] be increased ‘internal’ accountability as officials and politicians use the data to monitor 
[normal]activity from within. Some authorities 
[normal]reporting 
[normal]us
[normal]ing
[normal] the new data internally but it was not 
[normal]clear what
[normal] for. 
[normal]8.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There may also be better spending behaviour and professionalising of systems as a result of being ‘watched’. This again is difficult to measure but supported by some academic studies. Interviewees felt publishing spending data may either professionalise or drive ‘poor’ behaviour deeper underground. The exact effects would be dependent on how much the data
[normal] is being used (and its quality
[normal]) - the current low levels would be likely to have a small effect
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]8.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Open Data holds tremendous opportunities for policy-making. Interviewees pointed out that an emphasis on how information could be used in policy-making would improve its reception and significant
[normal]ly alter
[normal] how policy 
[normal]is
[normal] made and resources targeted, especially if joined up.  From small scale issues e.g. saving money through prescriptions to targeting homelessness or health resources, it can have a transformative impact.
[normal]8.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]However, the lack of clarity over the aims makes it a difficult policy to persuade others to support. The danger is that, in times of scarce resources and growing pressure, senior officials would be unwilling to release data.  There may also be limitations due to 
[normal]the lack of technical 
[normal]skills.
[normal]8.6
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The failure of data.gov
[normal] in the US
[normal] may serve as a l
[normal]esson, weakened by 
[normal]a vicious cycle of a lack of co-operation from departments, eager to preserve current data for use in spending battles, and a lack of public use and interest.
[normal]8.7
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A final concern was that the spending data was a ‘political’ tool to help control local authorities and portray them as ‘reckless’ spenders
[normal] who were
[normal] ‘wasting’ money. This reflects a wider concern that the Open Data may be a ‘Trojan horse’ for privatisation by offering information to private providers.
[normal] 
[normal]9[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Which data is most useful?[bold]9.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Research from FOI points towards a mismatch between what government hopes the public will be interested in and what data the public want. Aside from the high profile scandals, most requesters use FOI to obtain information of value to themselves and their 
[normal]own lives: a form of ‘micro-political’ or ‘non-political’ use
[normal].
[normal] This may be reflected in open data use. The most frequently downloaded data on data.gov concerns ‘core’ data useful for 
[normal]broader 
[normal]analysis or quotidian information. 
[normal]10[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]What type of transparency information is of most interest to users? [bold]       [bold]The table below is drawn from the survey. Officials were asked what type of data was of most interest. The findings are interesting given the low interest in the spending data.
