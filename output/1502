default              
defaultPassenger transport is a service to people, to facilitate fulfilled lives when no other means of mobility is available.

default              
defaultPassengers do not live and work within neat administrative boundaries.
default1.3
default              
defaultServices in major transport modes have to be compatible with life needs - to and from work, reaching shops, markets
default,
default civic duties, leisure activities etc.

defaultBigger picturedefault’: 
default4.1
default              
defaultTransport cannot be viewed in isolation; it is an enabling mechanism, or in neo-classical economics, 
defaultderived demanddefault, 
defaultie
default determined by other than the consumption of that utility.  Transport links
default 
defaultgoods
default, events
default and services between supplier and consumer.  While any country is divided into administrative regions and territories, its populations do not conform to those boundaries.  
default4.
default2
default              
defaultThe inhabitants of Kings Lynn in Norfolk may have employment and leisure needs in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire rather than their own county, while the hinterland of Chester goes over the border into Wales.  Major employment centres such as Swindon have a catchment area across four other regional authorities – Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Gloucestershire
default;
default Stoke-on-Trent’s workforces come from Staffordshire and Cheshi
defaultre;
default Darlington’s regional importance serves 
defaultthe neighbouring areas of North 
defaultYorks
default, Durham and the City of Stockton.  These patterns of work and other travel crossing administrative boundaries are replicated throughout the UK.
default4.
default3
default              
defaultCar ownership is highest outside of urban centres, 
defaultdue to
default 
defaulta
default lack of suitable passenger transport; ‘suitable’ being to reach work at times compatible with 
defaultworkplaces
default, travelling via routes which link home and workplace, travelling in reasonably direct routes, and fares being affordable.  
default4.
default4
default              
defaultPublic transport provision keeps the rural carbon footprint down, 
defaultreducing
default noise pollution 
defaultand
default cutting the likelihood of accidents.  A secondary benefit is the lessened need for road maintenance with fewer vehicles using them, freeing up scarce funding authority resource for other commitments.
default4.
default5
default              
defaultPlanning and supply of transport has to account for demand across administrative boundaries, as well as differing population densities, and timings of public transport need.  
default4.default6default              defaultThis creates an absolute need to unify ticketing and travel passes conditions of use across boundaries.default4.
default7
default              
defaultThe biggest anomaly is with the 
defaultNBPdefault - National Bus Pass – issued to all 
defaultwho age-qualify 
defaultbut 
defaultoften (‘
defaultrurally
default’) 
defaultno, few or unsuitable services to use.  This is not an argument against the NBP. 
default4.
default8
default              
defaultSome bus operators are dependent upon the revenue from National Bus Passes to stay viable.  Bus operator Trent Barton in Nottinghamshire claims that NBP generates 25% of their revenue (
defaultstatement to National Pensioners’ Convention Transport Working Party, August 2013
default), and without that income, the company would not be viable.  NBP users spend money in their destinations, bringing a wider benefit to the economy.  Some of that money would be spent anyway, but supplementary spend, on refreshment and other leisure, puts extra money into circulation.  While in the major centres, mobility is effectively taken for granted, and the circulation of money on the broader regional economy is a given, this is less so in thinner-densities of population.
default4.default9default              defaultThis is an argument for suitable and sufficient public passenger transport, with unified terms and conditions between neighbouring issuing authorities.default5

default‘
defaultInside informationdefault’: 
default5
default.1
default              
defaultTSSA’s unique combination of roles and grades throughout the transport industries gives us access to planning principles, operating criteria, service management and assessment of efficacy.  
default5
default.2
default              
defaultThe principle of passenger transport planning, when I joined most of 
defaultmy industries
default, was to consider the passenger first, to build service
defaults
default and route structure
defaults
default around their needs.  This 
defaultended
default as transport 
defaultbecame
default private, where service was determined by financial reward and appropriate local, regional or national authorities had to finance any shortfall arising from this mutation.  
default5
default.3
default              
defaultTransport is rarely purely urban, nor purely ‘rural’ – the best means of utilising transport vehicles (
defaultroad or rail
default) is to integrate schedules, making best use of buses and trains.  Types of service and ways to link locations may vary for time of day and day of week – the difference between compelled travel and discretionary travel.  That definition gap often blurs – is someone travelling to pay a Council Tax bill once a month at the Town Hall, a discretionary or compelled journey?
default5
default.4
default              
defaultPassengers having to cross administrative boundaries often found their bus services in particular redu
defaultcing in frequency (
defaultfrom, for example, daily to market days at the regional centre determined by the bus operator, not necessarily the centre used by the community
default), capacity (
defaultdouble-deck buses replaced by single-deck vehicles
default), and service (
defaultgoing from hourly or better on days operated to just one or two buses per day
default).
default  
default5
default.5
default              
defaultLack of a commercial traffic from a Hertfordshire village, 
defaultSarrattdefault, just outside Watford, resulted in the hourly daily except Sunday double-deck route 318 bus service provided by London Transport (
defaultwhich handed over ‘country area’ operation
defaults
default to the National Bus Company in 1970
default) steadily 
defaultreducing
default in all aspects – trips per day, days of operation
default,
default replacement by smaller and single-deck 
defaultbuses
default until toward the end of the 20th century, the village had lost all of its scheduled services and became reliant on a community facility staffed by volunteers.  That service had 
defaultimperfect

default as drive
defaultr
default volunteers could not be guaranteed for all the 
defaultscheduled
default trips.
default5
default.6
default              
defaultComputer scheduling has allowed ‘integrated schedules’ to a far greater degree than manual compilation which preceded it.  More sophisticated systems allowed efficient linking up of different routes’ journeys.  Simpler ‘hub and spoke’ route patterns have been transformed, especially outside of major cities, into integrated operating patterns
default5
default.6.1
default              
defaultEg
default - a bus travelling route ‘A’ from a centre to an outlying point, then to form the next trip on route ‘B’ to a different location, then to a route ‘C’ which might serve yet more places.  Other vehicles on those routes could be drawn from different routes, which would be invisible to users except when a double- or single-deck bus appeared for no visible reason instead of the usual type.  
default5
default.7
default              
defaultWhen a capacity increase occurred, no-one was inconvenienced, but where a scheduling efficiency reduce
defaultd
default carrying capacity (
defaultlink
defaulting
default two other operations
default,
default bringing a single-deck vehicle 
defaultvice
default a previously-operated double-decker
default), people could be left behind, 
defaultpossibly
default with no later bus to catch.  This leaves funding authorities with a dilemma – ensuring by subsidy that a route is of sufficient capacity might mean paying excessively, as either scheduling efficiencies would be lost (
defaultraising operating costs
default) or paying for a double-decker to cover irrelevant workings on an integrated operating roster, 
defaultgiving
default 
defaulta
default bus operator money for nothing.  
default5
default.8
default              
defaultThe same applies for rail 
defaultbeyond
default major centres – 
defaultTOCdefault (Train Operating Company) franchises determine service (
defaulttimings, frequencies and capacity
default) but do not impose requirements to serve the community beyond the rail station.  Trains will run from very early to very late, often seven days a week, but buses may not.  Invariably 
defaulta
default bus operator is called upon to fill in the gap, which 
defaultmay create

default5
default.9
default              
defaultOutside major centres, less-dense populations and the spread of routes from transport interchange points creates inefficient bus use and poor interchange between modes.  ‘Rural’ populations always take a bigger hit on service quality than urban dwellers who have strength in numbers to determine bus service standards.

default  It was impossible to confirm/refute, and public money vanished unaccountably.
default5
default.12
default              
defaultIn the 
defaultwest countrydefault, buses always ran late along one urban corridor, highlighted in a 
defaultBBC Radio Four programme,default File on Fourdefault, on Tuesday 09 August 2005; BBC researchers and presenter(s) lacked inside knowledge to 
defaultsee
default what was really going on, nor to see how the local authority had been duped into premature and un-necessary spend on road improvements.  No matter what the Local Authority was persuaded to do, and did, buses continually ran late, even with bus priority measures.  
defaultI have the programme’s transcript.default  
defaultFile on Four
default is a recorded programme and did not have an imminent editorial deadline to meet.  
default5
default.12.1
default              
defaultThe truth was simpler: the bus operator was running the service with one vehicle LESS than the service frequency and RTRT - 
defaultround trip running timedefault - demanded.  The maximum number of buses a route requires is called the PVR – 
defaultPeak Vehicle Requirementdefault –
default determined from the time taken at the busiest period for a single vehicle to start from its origin point, ready to pick up its first passengers, reach its destination and alight all its passengers, take a ‘
defaultturnround
default time’ break and make the return service journey and be ready 
defaultfor
default its next journey.  Dividing the RTRT by the 
defaultheadwaydefault (
defaultfrequency of service to be provided
default) gives the number of vehicles required.  Thus a 40 minute RTRT and a 10 minute headway requires FOUR buses; a sixty seven minute RTRT on a five minute headway requires 13.4 buses…  ‘Point four’ of a bus is impossible, therefore fourteen vehicles are needed to run the route, by extending the standing time at one or both ends of the route.  
default5
default.12.2
default              
defaultHowever, if a bus operator cannot or will not provide the missing ‘point six’, the route m
defaultight
default still run with thirteen buses, despite submitting a full schedule to the Traffic Commissioners and/or Local Authority.  The service runs 
defaultincreasingly 
defaultlate as the 
defaultday progresses; the 
defaultoperator 
defaulthas to
default cancel at least one round trip later to avoid paying drivers overtime rates for late running.  
default5
default.12.3
default              
default ‘Inside information’ would have told the BBC this – it 
defaultopted
default not to question, not to ask for an external verification of the operator’s claims and to broadcast material as it was given.  The lack of inside information, the skills and knowledge of transport workers, will continue to allow distortion of facts, and keep false impressions vibrant.  
defaultTransport operators deliberately suppress knowledgedefault.
default5
default.13
default              
defaultThis accepted level of deceit has to change; we have to re-impose principles of planning for passengers first.  We have to recognise and act on the ‘bigger picture’, to integrate people and Society.  This also means that the technical skills used to plan, deliver and administer transport must become more transparent and more accountable.
default5default.14default              defaultLaws covering Companies, taxation, finance, and the guidelines on accountancy practice must change to show where and how public money is being used, not just in transport.default6
default              
default‘
defaultScheduling and operating constraintsdefault’: 
default6
default.1
default              
defaultAn operator only has so many buses and trains.  On the railways, train operations are determined by the franchise; on the roads, vehicles are numbered by the likelihood of a profit from fares along the route network or subsidy from a relevant authority.  In both cases, scheduling efficiency determines advantageous uses of equipment.  In both modern cases, the transport supplier’s operating desires come ahead of passengers’ needs.
default6
default.2
default              
defaultIn major centres, bus route patterns and service 
defaultlevels
default 
defaultmay be
default determined (
defaultLondon in particular, Newcastle is set to follow
default) by a route contracts regime.  Beyond these centres, bus operators since national ‘deregulation’ (
defaultexcept London
default) in 1986
default may operate where and when they wish
default.  
defaultBefore
default 1986, regional Traffic Commissioners control bus service
default level
defaults.  The emphasis switched from serving a passenger need to operating only 
defaultwhere
default positive net revenue
defaults might be found
default.
default6
default.3
default              
defaultAn operation 
defaultcan be
default schedule
defaultd
default so that 
defaultfor 
defaultany subsidised se
defaultgment
default, the paying authority 
defaultis under-writing
default an extra vehicle on that route 
defaultby a
default sole operator.  Service planners work for an employer, not passengers, apart from remaining municipal bus operators.  This gives the bus company an opportunity for a new bus for nothing or very little, as the funding authority will 
defaultend up
default paying for crewing the extra vehicle – a bus on the road for most of a ‘traffic day’ (
defaultearly
default 
defaultmorning to evening Monday-Friday
default,
default possibly plus earlier/later services for commuting workers
default) requires two drivers.  Limitation of work hours (
defaulton the road
default) prohibit a single driver from working throughout.  An operator may ‘discover’ a new (
defaultor nearly-new
default) bus available at little or no extra cost, to also be used elsewhere, outside of the ‘PVR’ (
defaultabove
default) 
defaultand at weekends, 
defaulton other revenue-earning operations.
default6
default.4
default              
defaultThe paying authority’s other choice is 
defaultopen
default the missing journeys to tender.  It will then be paying a third party to inefficiently use a bus to fill those gaps.  ‘Missing journeys’ tend not to occur in urban settings, placing extra financial burdens on outlying funding authorities.  This is an excess cost in either scenario, and lacking skills to decode this will always mean those paying authorities 
defaultmay line
default the pockets of unscrupulous operators.  
default6default.5default              defaultLocal Authorities subsidisdefaulting bus routes and under-writing raildefault services must defaulthavedefault ring-fenced transport ‘professionals’ to analyse their passenger operation subsidy to suppliers.default6
default.6
default              
defaultOne 
defaulturban 
defaultexample of an over-generous schedule was a
defaultn
default East London trunk route, which on the successful TfL tender required ‘X’ vehicles.  Investigations later revealed that the route was 
defaultrun
default with ‘X-minus-1’ buses.  The route at one end terminated inside its home garage; as a 
defaultgiven
default bus arrived ex-passenger service, it would be left ready for the next departure, having been fully fuelled at the start of the day.  Garage staff removed the arriving ‘running number’ (
defaultthe identity of that day’s combination of trips
default) and installed the next available number in the route sequence.  On paper, this was the full ‘X’ allocation of buses; the turn-round time inside the garage hid the identity swap and enabled the true ‘X-minus-1’ operation.  
default6.6.1
default              
defaultIn London the density of population and generous location of intelligent eyes uncovered this, but in outlying areas, where fewer people 
defaultexist
default to detect this, public purse costs will accumulate.  
default6
default.7
default              
defaultA major issue with rural bus operations is 
defaultbusdefault standardisationdefault; European Union rule
defaults
default govern width and length maxima, which most manufacturers adopt as default, charging extra for variations.  The EU-wide maximum permitted width of passenger service vehicles is 2m55, but this is often excessive for country lanes and narrow roads in ‘traditional’ centres.  This leave
defaults
default undesirable options
default:
default(1) purchase 
defaultdearer, 
defaultnon-standard (
defaultie
default narrower
default) vehicles, which may reduce carrying capacity;
default(2) schedule less efficiently so that buses do not pass each other in restricted areas;
default(3) use minibuses, which have limited capacity, and may not satisfy travel demand.
default6default.8default              defaultSuppliers of buses to the UK must offer reasonably priced and availabdefaultledefault smaller vehicles of suitable and sufficient capacity.  This may mean centralised manufacturing support, either to bus builders or operators or to Local Authorities procuring routes and services.default6
default.9
default              
defaultRural rail operations are constrained by two key factors – trains which are too small (
defaultparticularly ‘Class 15x’ typ
defaultes of trains – series 150, 
default156, 158 notably
default) and single-tracked 
defaultroute 
defaultsections.  The former restriction leads to dangerous overcrowding –
default 
defaulteg
default the route linking Birmingham 
defaultand
default Norwich, where two-carriage class 158 trains are used, with excessive standing and crush-loading over segments 
defaultserving
default bigger intermediate and terminal locations.  The latter restriction prevents a ‘clock-face’ service from being operated (
defaultie
default so many minutes past each hour
default), as ‘passing loops’ act as hindrances to increased or regular operations.  
default6default.10default              defaultTraindefault supply must be increased – defaulttype 15x rolling stock is not yet life-expired, and should be rebuilt defaultasdefault longer trains, re-engineering single-carriage (or ‘car’) units into two-car trains, and 2-car trains into three-car formations.  By re-forming those trains, new rolling stock would be defaultneededdefault to maintain and improve services.  This would be adefaultndefault opportunity for UK train manufacturing and component suppliers, and would help to meet increasing passenger demand, as well as developing a better service for rural and less-densely-populated areas.default&#xa0;default6default.11default              defaultRailway track patterns must be analysed for the restrictions theydefault imposedefault; double-tracking and use of former routes needs attention; where track doubling cannot be achieved, opportunities for more ‘passing loops’ should be examined.default6
default.12
default              
defaultExtreme loadings on small trains often arise from poor or nil alternative – a bus may run parallel or close for some or all of those segments, but the elapsed time on the roads and possibly infrequency of operation deters these options, and ‘forces’ those who must use public transport on to trains, or if they are capable, to use private cars.
default6default.13default              defaultAn inspection regime defaultshoulddefault be instituted, ring-fence resourced and sustained, to audit and examine claims defaultfromdefault operators of road and rail passenger services; this regime must be staffed by professional transport people.  Scheduling constraints must be described and demonstrated by bus operators in receipt of public funds.  The practice of claiming commercial confidentiality in the use of public funds defaultmustdefault be rescinded; where public money is used, those receiving it must show how, where and when this resource is utilised.default7
default              
default‘
defaultKnowing the deceitsdefault’: 
default7
default.1
default              
defaultATOCdefault (Association of Train Operating Companies) is dependent on no-one questioning it.  In 
defaultDecember 2011default, ATOC released a ‘breakdown’ of how each penny per £ of the rail fare was divided up.  This was a technical deceit, too complex for media to challenge – it went beyond the time-slot a radio or 
defaulttv
default programme could allocate, and would not productively fill column inches of printed media.  I asked ATOC if I could speak to the analysis compiler; the instant reply was ‘he’s left the industry’.  I asked for a means to contact him; the instant reply was ‘we have no means to reach him’.  My enquiry was

default7
default.2
default              
defaultA typical ATOC deceit in this analysis was that N% of each fare went in staff costs; so, imagine two passengers are in the queue at Waterloo ticket office…  The first passenger asks for a day return 
defaultto Surbiton (
defaulta London south western suburb, served by local trains
default), which for the sake of argument costs £6, out of which N% 
defaultis for
default staff overheads.  The second passenger wants an open First Class return to Exeter, which for the sake of argument costs £200.  The booking clerk will only have pressed a different combination of computer buttons.  Is the same N% really applicable for both transactions?  ATOC

default, each passenger has only pressed different buttons on the same machine.  Both transactions 
defaulttake

default train operator to deliver.  I
defaults the argument that staff overheads are averaged per transaction?  If so, over which period, and what is the basis of the calculation by ATOC, given that each TOC pays different wages to their staff, has different 
default(

defaultcontracts for their ticket machines, and pays different rentals to the freeholder, Network Rail?  ATOC is also very good at selectively deriving misleading positive data from quarterly

default is deceitful – the

default value is ‘return on capital’.  Profit only arises from the day-to-day running of the operation; return on capital, which is unconstrained by neither law nor contracts, is what the operator takes back for its investment.  The 
defaultFinancial Times
default has pointed out that in the transport sector, ‘return on capital’ is effectively a licence to print money, and makes ‘profit’ irrelevant.  
default“In some cases you can make between 50 per cent and 70 per cent return on capital employed”default said Mark 
defaultManduca
default, Bank of America Merrill Lynch transport analyst in London, but

defaultMachines do not answer questions;

defaultSouth West Trains at Waterloodefault, all requests to a TVM for a journey to Basingstoke will first offer the routeing via Reading which is infrequent, longer than the through service would take and requires a change of trains via non-adjacent platforms.  This ticket is also valid for the cheaper, direct services, which run up to four times each hour and will take up to an hour less than the ‘via Reading’ option.  It is not possible to see from this enquiry at a machine that this is a less-desirable option, let alone why.

default

defaultThe UK has no shortage of people willing to become transport professionals – the reluctance is in the employers who service the corporate need first.  A cultural and commercial shift is essential to improve the transport quality in all areas, not just the lesser-populated regions.
default8default.13default              defaultA railway needs operating and maintenance staff within reasonable distances, suitably and sufficiently equipped to travel and work on the ‘permanent way’.  A risk analysis may show low likelihood of an event but the other aspect, the severity indicator has been ignored.  A railway is a safety-critical facility: lives cannot be reduced to half of a risk analysis.default9
