"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Annabelle Nason [FBB0043]&#xa0;\nI like \nadvert free\n radio and believe it should be preserved\n however I don’t see why a commercial station couldn’t bid for the money to provide advert free\n programmes.  It wouldn’t bother me if there were adverts in between shows.\nI think the current \nlicence fee is completely wrong\n and the fact that a man from the state broadcaster can come to your door and threaten you with prosecution is \ncringeworthy\n.  \nNow that everyone has digital the \ntelevision \nchannels should be locked until a subscription is tak\nen out, the s\nubscription should be flexible, \nit should be possible\n to pay for a month or twelve months or a single event\n or programme\n.\n  \nThe \niplayer\n could have advertising, however if you are a subscriber you could enter a code and watch advert free.  Perha\nps an online only subscription to watch live via the \niplayer\n could be on offer cheaper than a main Television subscription.\n  \nThe most important thing is to radically cut down the cost of the \ncompulsory \nlicence\n to just cover the cost of Radio, a small webs\nite and news.  All television should \nbe supported by advertising or subscription.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
