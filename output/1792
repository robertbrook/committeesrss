[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government welcomes the opportunity to input into the Committee’s inquiry into heat. 
[normal]In the last two years, the Government has made significant progress in 
[normal]meeting the challenge of 
[normal]chang
[normal]ing how
[normal] we produce and consume heat.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In March 2012, we published a “
[normal]Strategic Framework
[normal]”
[normal] for Heat. The document set out for the first time a framework for solving the problem of ensuring affordable, secure and low carbon heating.  It also set out the Government’s vision for heat in the decades ahead: a future with secure supplies of low carbo
[normal]n and renewable energy at affordable prices, supporting a strong UK economy.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 2012 document began an important public dialogue. 
[normal]In March this year, the Government 
[normal] followed this up with
[normal] “
[normal]The Future of Heating: Meeting the Challenge
[normal]”
[normal] which
[normal] proposes po
[normal]licies to deliver the Government’s visions across four key areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A program
[normal]me of w
[normal]ork
[normal], led by DECC and involving other Government departments and Local Authorities, 
[normal]is currently underway to deliver these commitments
[normal], working closely with the private sector and with academia, among others
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This memorandum will address each of th
[normal]e questions raised by the committee in turn.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q1 and 2 – Reducing demand for heat[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government’s approach to reducing energy demand for heat is part of its overall approach to reducing carbon emissions, as set out in the Carbon Plan.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]E
[normal]nergy efficiency 
[normal]is one of the most cost-effective means of cutting carbon and it 
[normal] featured in all of the Carbon Plan scenarios.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]ide-scale take-up of energy efficiency measures the UK can 
[normal]also 
[normal]stimulate growth
[normal] and
[normal] save consumers money. 
[normal] Over [80%] of energy consumed in b
[normal]uildings is used as heat, so m
[normal]anaging our demand for heat has a key role to play in this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are a number of policy instruments that have been put in place to manage heat demand.  By 31 December 2012, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) had de
[normal]livered around 6 million professionally installed insulation measures by placing an obligation on the 6 largest energy suppliers to save CO
[normal]2
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Community Energy Saving Programme [bold]([bold]CESP) was a pilot programme designed to deliver energy efficiency 
[normal]retrofits to low income households, street by street.  By 31 December 2012, it had delivered 16.31 million lifetime tonnes of CO
[normal]2 
[normal]savings, through almost 500 schemes
[normal]. . 
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) replaced CERT, CESP and Warm Front from 1 Janu
[normal]ary 2013.   It forms part of the Government’s programme to tackle fuel poverty and works alongside the Green Deal to provide more support for energy efficiency measures, including insulation for harder to treat properties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.
[normal] 
[normal]The Green Deal is a market-based
[normal] scheme which offers households and businesses a new finance mechanism to cover energy-saving improvements without having to pay all the costs up front.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It 
[normal]is
[normal] help
[normal]ing to
[normal] drive take-up of measures such as insulation and more efficient heating technologies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11.
[normal] 
[normal]In November 2012, the Government published its Energy Efficiency Strategy.  As part of this, DECC is commissioning research into the potential of advanced heating controls to reduce domestic energy demand and developing a trial to study the impact of adv
[normal]ice on how to use heating controls provided when boiler checks are carried out. Th
[normal]e trial will report results in s
[normal]ummer 2014.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q3.[bold]              [bold]What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture? [bold]&#xa0;[bold]12.
[normal] 
[normal]The Greenhouse Gas 
[normal](GHG) lifecycle methodology for solid biomass and biogas used by the RHI is as set out under the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive
[normal]. This EU approach considers the direct emissions impact of the biomass feedstock, from cultivation, harvesting, processing 
[normal]and transport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13.
[normal] 
[normal] The methodology used for the RHI does not include possible indirect impacts, such as indirect land use change. However, we consider it essential the UK uses the EU approach to provide consistency, to support a single European market, and 
[normal]to avoid unnecessary burdens, particularly on smaller biomass producers and users. Moreover, the expectation is that most solid biomass or biogas used for heat in the UK will be from lower value residues or process waste: and, that where it is a dedicated 
[normal]perennial energy crop, most will be grown on low quality or degraded land unsuitable for food production. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14.
[normal] 
[normal]DECC is currently developing a bioenergy calculator - the BEaC (Biomass Emissions and Counterfactual) Model, which will be in a format similar to DE
[normal]CC’s existing 2050 pathways calculator. This model considers all potential GHG emissions, including indirect impacts and carbon stock changes in forests which are not accounted for by the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive. Users can choose various scenari
[normal]os for bioenergy and the calculator then models lifecycle GHG emissions resulting from those scenarios.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This tool will inform the UK’s future negotiations on global accounting and future energy and decarbonisation targets internationally. It will also be 
[normal]used to inform 
[normal]long-term 
[normal]bioenergy policies 
[normal].[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Q4.[bold]              [bold]There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]15.
[normal] 
[normal]The use of biomass for heat  was identified by the UK Bioenergy Strategy
[normal] as a low risk priority pathway that the UK would want to encourage. The high conversion efficiencies of heat generation
[normal] 
[normal]mean biomass heat is an attractive, cost-effective technology that c
[normal]an
[normal] make a significant contribution to the UK meeting its 2020 renew
[normal]ables target. 
[normal]The longer term role of biomass for heating is less straightforward (given the competing other users for which a finite bio-energy resource is likely to be needed), but modelling implies it could have a significant role, especially where high
[normal] temperature heat is required, as in industrial processes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16.
[normal] 
[normal]We want the UK to be at the forefront in the EU in ensuring biomass supplies are sustainable and are bringing in robust RHI sustainability standards.  These are set out in the Government Response to 
[normal]‘Providing Certainty, improving performance’
[normal] consultation
[normal] published in February
[normal] and include a GHG lifecycle emissions target to ensure genuine emissions savings and land criteria to prevent deforestation or environmental degradation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17.
[normal] 
[normal]The GHG lifecycle emissions target will be a minimum 60% GHG lifecycle saving
[normal]s compared to the GHG emissions of the EU fossil heat average; this is significantly tougher than the 35% initial saving recommended by the European Commission in their 2010 report
[normal]. To be eligible for support, RHI installations will be required to demonst
[normal]rate meeting the GHG target from April 2014; and the land criteria from April 2015.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18.
[normal] 
[normal]The Government intends to review the effectiveness of the UK’s approach as part of the UK Bioenergy Strategy Review in 2017. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q5.[bold]              [bold]What will the local environmental impa[bold]ct be from the use of heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]19.
[normal] 
[normal]Studies suggest that biomass boilers and CHP
[normal], both biomass and natural gas fired,
[normal] in urban areas could, in the absence of mitigating measures, have an adverse impact on; air qual
[normal]ity (particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
[normal]x))
[normal] and noise. The RHI is introducing emissions limits and targeted tariff values for biomass CHP and other biomass boilers which seek to mitigate their impact on air quality.  Air quality impacts will
[normal] be kept under review. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20.
[normal] 
[normal]The air pollutant emissions of biomass boilers and CHP plant 
[normal](of all fuel types) 
[normal]above 20MW thermal input are controlled by Environmental Permitting requirements.  Smaller plants are governed by the Clean Air Act 1993 and the 
[normal]plann
[normal]ing process.  Defra has assisted with the development of guidance for local authorities on addressing air pollution impacts of CHP and biomass boilers. By careful plant location and good acoustic design, the noise impact of CHP can be mitigated. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q6.[bold]              [bold]What[bold] are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]21.
[normal] 
[normal]Different approaches to heating bring different benefits.  
[normal]H
[normal]eat demand shows more variability than electricity demand across the day and across the seasons. UK electricity demand 
[normal]varies between 20 and 55
[normal]GW
[normal] daily
[normal].  Heat demand across all sectors can vary between 150 and 400GW during the coldest winter days. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22.
[normal] 
[normal]The ga
[normal]s network helps manage variability
[normal],
[normal] with suppliers able to purchase gas quickly from a number of sources. The gas grid is able to handle short term spikes in demand due to the gas market’s liquidity. The electricity grid is less able to accommodate spikes 
[normal]in demand without substantial spare generation capacity to meet peak winter demand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23.
[normal] 
[normal]The high-level conclusions of the economic modelling commissioned for the 
[normal]Meeting the challenge 
[normal]document suggest there could still be a limited role for natural gas in 205
[normal]0 to meet peaks in heat demand on the coldest days of the year. It suggests this could be more cost-effective than the alternative of full electrification. We are also seeing the development of hybrid heating systems that use gas and renewable energy sourc
[normal]es, which could play a part in meeting peak heat demand.  Energy efficient measures, smart meters, smarter electricity grids and developments in electricity and thermal storage will also help
[normal], as will the development of low carbon heat networks with multip
[normal]le heat sources
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24.
[normal] 
[normal]When considering the relative merits of gas heating against electric heat pumps, costs of both fuel and infrastructure both now and in the future have to be considered.  For gas, there is the issue of the cost of maintaining the gas netw
[normal]ork; for electricity, there are the issues of the cost of reinforcement of the local electricity distribution grids. 
[normal]In both cases, some built-in redundancy is likely to be needed to ensure peak demand can be met.  This is why energy storage and demand-sid
[normal]e response is so important. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q7.[bold]              [bold]Why is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]25.
[normal] 
[normal]The amount of heat supplied to buildings in the UK via heat networks is around 2% of domestic, public sector and commercial heat demand. This amounts to around 2000
[normal] networks serving approximately 210,000 dwellings and 1700 commercial and public buildings across the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26.
[normal] 
[normal]Many of the schemes in operation today in the UK originate from the 1960s and 70s. For a number of reasons, including the waning popularity of high-r
[normal]ise housing developments, and the poor design, construction
[normal], maintenance
[normal] and economic performance of some early schemes, heat networks fell out of favour. 
[normal]European countries where they remained popular have tended to have less well-developed natural gas gr
[normal]ids than the UK. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over the past decade, as local authorities have looked for ways to cut carbon emissions and address fuel poverty, the case for heat networks has strengthened. 
[normal]Consumer reaction to networked heat is not straightforward; it can range from 
[normal]very positive where bills come down and reliability goes up (in comparison, for example, with electric heaters in a flat), all the way through to negative where a flat rate is charged, which is deemed to high and bearing no relation to actual heat consumed
[normal]. The majority of heat consumers, however, are far more familiar with boilers and remain ignorant of the district heating option.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27.
[normal] 
[normal] Government and other analysis over the previous years, including new modelling presented as an Annex to our March heat docum
[normal]ent, and responses from a wide variety of stakeholders, have shown that modern, low carbon heat networks can have a crucial role to play in a sustainable heating future, especially where heat demand is highly concentrated and a range of types of heat suppl
[normal]y might be available, ie in urban areas. Major cities across the UK are already pursuing this route, but they often encounter barriers to development.. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28.
[normal] 
[normal]To help local authorities and local economic partnerships to overcome the financial, commercial and te
[normal]chnical skills barriers to developing low carbon heat networks,  DECC is establishing a new Heat Networks Delivery Unit to help local authorities and local economic partnerships to overcome the financial, commercial and technical skills barriers to develop
[normal]ing low carbon heat networks.  
[normal]This will be up and running by October this year[
[normal]footnote
[normal] – 
[normal]once cleared, attach link to announcement of HNDU investment director appointment].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29.
[normal] 
[normal]Over and above networked heat projects, 
[normal]The Government is keen to
[normal] 
[normal]see more local
[normal] communities getting involved in reducing energy use, managing energy demand and collectively purchasing energy to get a better deal.   We will be publishing a Community Energy Strategy in the autumn, which will identify the potential of community energy p
[normal]rojects in the UK to bring benefits to communities while helping to tackle climate change and maintain energy security. It will consider how to help community energy projects overcome the main barriers they face.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30.
[normal] 
[normal]UK CHP capacity has grown year on year to 
[normal]6.1 GW
[normal]  in 2012 contributing 6.4% of electricity generated. Most of this capacity (89%) is industrial supplying industrial process heat. The rate of growth has been slow, due to CHP projects facing significantly higher hurdle rates than power-only generat
[normal]ion projects and difficulties for small CHP operators in securing a good price for the electricity they produce. DECC is working on a bespoke policy to support deployment of additional CHP capacity
[normal], provided this can be shown to be lower carbon that the el
[normal]ectricity it is displacing
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q8.[bold]              [bold]What are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]31.
[normal] 
[normal]The Committee has helpfully set out that it would like information on: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32.
[normal] 
[normal]The share of the market for combi boilers is now approaching two-thirds of all boilers in the UK. The issue of the need for hot water tanks in the future was highlighted in 
[normal]Meeting the Challenge
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33.
[normal] 
[normal]Industry reports
[normal] suggest that of those hou
[normal]seholders that do not currently own a hot water tank, the proportion saying that they would find it easy to find space, and those saying it would be difficult, are of the same order. Technology may help that proportion of people who find the space requirem
[normal]ent for a new heat store difficult to meet.  First, hybrid heat pumps that incorporate condensing boilers will allow for the supply of hot water, thus negating much of the need for a thermal store. Secondly, developments in thermal storage, currently being
[normal] researched by DECC, may make kit smaller and more efficient.  Thirdly, heat networks can offer storage capacity at scale, an important consideration in terms of matching supply with demand which in turn has wider benefits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Heat networks also enable easy 
[normal]transition between fossil fuel and low/zero carbon sources of heat. It allows changing on
[normal]e 
[normal] large heat supply 
[normal](or switching between a small number of different centralised heat sources) 
[normal]rather than changing many individual boilers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34.
[normal] 
[normal]As stated above, the 
[normal]UK encourages the use of biomass heat in buildings and for industrial processes
[normal].  
[normal]So, it is important that investors are given sufficient certainty to bring forward large scale investments without being subject to the risk that changing environmental and s
[normal]ustainability criteria will create stranded assets. Therefore we have decided that for existing non-domestic biomass RHI installations the sustainability criteria will be “grandfathered” from the date the criteria are first introduced under the RHI.  For n
[normal]ew biomass heat installations, including domestic installations, grandfathering of the criteria will be applied at the point of accreditation. In the longer-term, biomass sustainability controls could be changed, so new installations accredited after these
[normal] changes may have to meet different standards.  We believe this offers a sensible balance between providing the certainty needed to bring forward new biomass heat generation while still allowing us the flexibility to adjust the controls for new installatio
[normal]ns
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35.
[normal] 
[normal]New installations of biomass systems will also need to meet air quality standards in relation to PM and NO
[normal]x
[normal]. Domestic legacy installations, installed between 15
[normal]th
[normal] July 2009 and the launch of the scheme, will not need to meet this requirement. The air
[normal] quality standards will also apply to all biomass systems which join the non-domestic RHI from September 24
[normal]th
[normal] 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q9.[bold]              [bold]Should the government take any further specific actions in relation to cooling?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]36.
[normal] 
[normal]Cooling in the UK is primarily geared towards 
[normal]removing excessive heat gain in non-domestic buildings such as offices, to maintain comfortable ambient temperatures. Whilst mechanical cooling in buildings is currently responsible for 4% of the total energy demand, cooling in homes is less significant; a
[normal]ccounting for 1% of household energy use
[normal]. Commissioned reports into the possible effects of climate change suggest that the domestic uptake of air conditioning
[normal] is likely to
[normal] rise. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]37.
[normal] 
[normal]Meeting the Challenge
[normal] proposed a number of areas that we need to examine i
[normal]n tackling cooling in non-domestic buildings, such as improving our understanding of the way non-domestic buildings work and the way they are used to in relation to heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. This is a complex area as the non-domest
[normal]ic building stock is diverse and the buildings are used so differently. Currently cooling is 
[normal]predominantly carried out through
[normal] electric air conditioning although there are other measures that can be used as part of a new build or retrofit development. Our 
[normal]March document, for example, pointed to the increased role for renewable systems, such as reversible heat pumps in heating and cooling buildings. There may also be scope to combine summer-time cooling with solar photovoltaic electricity generation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are
[normal] work
[normal]ing
[normal] with industry and  wider stakeholder groups on these issues to decide on the specific actions that 
[normal]may be needed
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q10.[bold]              [bold]Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully[bold]?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]38.
[normal] 
[normal]The non-domestic RHI currently only incorporates ground source
[normal] heat pumps (GSHPs).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is an existing strong and growing market for reversible air to air heat pumps (AAHPs) therefore we do not propose introducing RHI support for this technology. Towards the end of 2012, consultations closed which discussed the pos
[normal]sibility of introducing support for heating-only AAHPs and air to water heat pumps. We are currently reviewing the responses and other evidence and plan to publish our decision as to whether or not RHI support is appropriate in autumn 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]39.
[normal] 
[normal]In response to industry and market feedback, DECC has looked at the evidence on cost data and heat usage assumptions used to set the levels of tariffs when the non-domestic scheme was launched alongside the level of uptake so far under the scheme and evide
[normal]nce from the renewable heat industry and market. As a result of this, we launched 
[normal]the Non-Domestic Scheme Early Tariff Review consultation
[normal] in June which set ou
[normal]t how the Government proposed to respond to 
[normal]the low up take of some technologies, including GSHPs, in the scheme so far, to ensure that renewable heat can make an effective contribution to our 2020 renewable energy targets, support the UK renewable heat in
[normal]dustry and achieve decarbonisation of our heat supply by 2050. The consultation has now closed and we plan to announce the outcomes this autumn.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]40.
[normal] 
[normal]Another factor affecting the deployment of GSHPs is the construction industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] GSHPs are most commonly instal
[normal]led as part of new-build construction projects, as retro-fitting is often not an option in older properties due to a lack of space for a suitably sized ground-loop.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] As the number of new-build construction projects have declined over the past few years, so
[normal] has the demand for GSHP installations.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]41.
[normal] 
[normal]The domestic scheme, which will open for applications in spring 2014, will support ground and air source heat pumps.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q11.[bold]              [bold]How successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]42.
[normal] 
[normal]We are confident that the dom
[normal]estic RHI will successfully incentivise the uptake of renewable heat technologies, and anticipate 3.9TWh of 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]renewable heat will be supported through RHI by 2020/21. We estimate that this equates to cumulatively 745,000 installations by 2020/21. We
[normal] expect to see steady growth in installations over the next few years, preparing the ground for mass rollout of renewable heating to households in the 2020s and 2030s. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]43.
[normal] 
[normal]The final policy was designed through extensive engagement over the consultation period, including consumer experience to date and consumer behaviour research by Ipsos MORI.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]44.
[normal] 
[normal]We are undertaking a range of activities to encourage uptake ahead of the schem
[normal]e’s launch next year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The DECC-led RHI Consumer Protection and Empowerment and RHI Industry Advisory Groups are developing consumer engagement and industry promotional tools. Finally, DECC and Ofgem are working to streamline the application process.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q1[bold]2.[bold]              [bold]Thermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.[bold]&#xa0;[bold] What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]45.
[normal] 
[normal]The Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group
[normal]’s Technology Innovation Needs Assessment for Heat, September 2012, identified heat storage as a priority area for support in the near future and research programmes are already in place.  A low carbon innovation strategy, to co-ordinate and guide potentia
[normal]l future public sector funding in this area, will be published before the end of 2013.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As stated above, heat networks store heat and connect to large thermal stores.   DECC is providing £6m to be managed by the Heat Networks Delivery Unit, which will supp
[normal]ort local authorities and local economic partnerships to develop heat networks.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]46.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, the Energy Technology Institute is running a £100m multi-year project looking at smart systems and heat, which includes demand-side response and storage options
[normal]. The programme objectives are
