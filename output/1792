defaultThe Government welcomes the opportunity to input into the Committee’s inquiry into heat. 
defaultIn the last two years, the Government has made significant progress in 
defaultmeeting the challenge of 
defaultchang
defaulting how
default we produce and consume heat.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn March 2012, we published a “
defaultStrategic Framework
default”
default for Heat. The document set out for the first time a framework for solving the problem of ensuring affordable, secure and low carbon heating.  It also set out the Government’s vision for heat in the decades ahead: a future with secure supplies of low carbo
defaultn and renewable energy at affordable prices, supporting a strong UK economy.  
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2012 document began an important public dialogue. 
defaultIn March this year, the Government 
default followed this up with
default “
defaultThe Future of Heating: Meeting the Challenge
default”
default which
default proposes po
defaultlicies to deliver the Government’s visions across four key areas:
default&#xa0;
defaultA program
defaultme of w
defaultork
default, led by DECC and involving other Government departments and Local Authorities, 
defaultis currently underway to deliver these commitments
default, working closely with the private sector and with academia, among others
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis memorandum will address each of th
defaulte questions raised by the committee in turn.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1 and 2 – Reducing demand for heatdefault&#xa0;default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government’s approach to reducing energy demand for heat is part of its overall approach to reducing carbon emissions, as set out in the Carbon Plan.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultE
defaultnergy efficiency 
defaultis one of the most cost-effective means of cutting carbon and it 
default featured in all of the Carbon Plan scenarios.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultW
defaultide-scale take-up of energy efficiency measures the UK can 
defaultalso 
defaultstimulate growth
default and
default save consumers money. 
default Over [80%] of energy consumed in b
defaultuildings is used as heat, so m
defaultanaging our demand for heat has a key role to play in this.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are a number of policy instruments that have been put in place to manage heat demand.  By 31 December 2012, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) had de
defaultlivered around 6 million professionally installed insulation measures by placing an obligation on the 6 largest energy suppliers to save CO
default2
default.  
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultCommunity Energy Saving Programme default(defaultCESP) was a pilot programme designed to deliver energy efficiency 
defaultretrofits to low income households, street by street.  By 31 December 2012, it had delivered 16.31 million lifetime tonnes of CO
default2 
defaultsavings, through almost 500 schemes
default. . 
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Energy Company Obligation (ECO) replaced CERT, CESP and Warm Front from 1 Janu
defaultary 2013.   It forms part of the Government’s programme to tackle fuel poverty and works alongside the Green Deal to provide more support for energy efficiency measures, including insulation for harder to treat properties.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default 
defaultThe Green Deal is a market-based
default scheme which offers households and businesses a new finance mechanism to cover energy-saving improvements without having to pay all the costs up front.
default&#xa0;
default It 
defaultis
default help
defaulting to
default drive take-up of measures such as insulation and more efficient heating technologies.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default 
defaultIn November 2012, the Government published its Energy Efficiency Strategy.  As part of this, DECC is commissioning research into the potential of advanced heating controls to reduce domestic energy demand and developing a trial to study the impact of adv
defaultice on how to use heating controls provided when boiler checks are carried out. Th
defaulte trial will report results in s
defaultummer 2014.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3.default              defaultWhat should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture? default&#xa0;default12.
default 
defaultThe Greenhouse Gas 
default(GHG) lifecycle methodology for solid biomass and biogas used by the RHI is as set out under the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive
default. This EU approach considers the direct emissions impact of the biomass feedstock, from cultivation, harvesting, processing 
defaultand transport. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default 
default The methodology used for the RHI does not include possible indirect impacts, such as indirect land use change. However, we consider it essential the UK uses the EU approach to provide consistency, to support a single European market, and 
defaultto avoid unnecessary burdens, particularly on smaller biomass producers and users. Moreover, the expectation is that most solid biomass or biogas used for heat in the UK will be from lower value residues or process waste: and, that where it is a dedicated 
defaultperennial energy crop, most will be grown on low quality or degraded land unsuitable for food production. 
default&#xa0;
default14.
default 
defaultDECC is currently developing a bioenergy calculator - the BEaC (Biomass Emissions and Counterfactual) Model, which will be in a format similar to DE
defaultCC’s existing 2050 pathways calculator. This model considers all potential GHG emissions, including indirect impacts and carbon stock changes in forests which are not accounted for by the 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive. Users can choose various scenari
defaultos for bioenergy and the calculator then models lifecycle GHG emissions resulting from those scenarios.
default&#xa0;
default This tool will inform the UK’s future negotiations on global accounting and future energy and decarbonisation targets internationally. It will also be 
defaultused to inform 
defaultlong-term 
defaultbioenergy policies 
default.default&#xa0;default default&#xa0;defaultQ4.default              defaultThere are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?default&#xa0;default15.
default 
defaultThe use of biomass for heat  was identified by the UK Bioenergy Strategy
default as a low risk priority pathway that the UK would want to encourage. The high conversion efficiencies of heat generation
default 
defaultmean biomass heat is an attractive, cost-effective technology that c
defaultan
default make a significant contribution to the UK meeting its 2020 renew
defaultables target. 
defaultThe longer term role of biomass for heating is less straightforward (given the competing other users for which a finite bio-energy resource is likely to be needed), but modelling implies it could have a significant role, especially where high
default temperature heat is required, as in industrial processes. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default 
defaultWe want the UK to be at the forefront in the EU in ensuring biomass supplies are sustainable and are bringing in robust RHI sustainability standards.  These are set out in the Government Response to 
default‘Providing Certainty, improving performance’
default consultation
default published in February
default and include a GHG lifecycle emissions target to ensure genuine emissions savings and land criteria to prevent deforestation or environmental degradation.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default 
defaultThe GHG lifecycle emissions target will be a minimum 60% GHG lifecycle saving
defaults compared to the GHG emissions of the EU fossil heat average; this is significantly tougher than the 35% initial saving recommended by the European Commission in their 2010 report
default. To be eligible for support, RHI installations will be required to demonst
defaultrate meeting the GHG target from April 2014; and the land criteria from April 2015.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default 
defaultThe Government intends to review the effectiveness of the UK’s approach as part of the UK Bioenergy Strategy Review in 2017. 
default&#xa0;defaultQ5.default              defaultWhat will the local environmental impadefaultct be from the use of heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?default&#xa0;default19.
default 
defaultStudies suggest that biomass boilers and CHP
default, both biomass and natural gas fired,
default in urban areas could, in the absence of mitigating measures, have an adverse impact on; air qual
defaultity (particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
defaultx))
default and noise. The RHI is introducing emissions limits and targeted tariff values for biomass CHP and other biomass boilers which seek to mitigate their impact on air quality.  Air quality impacts will
default be kept under review. 
default&#xa0;
default20.
default 
defaultThe air pollutant emissions of biomass boilers and CHP plant 
default(of all fuel types) 
defaultabove 20MW thermal input are controlled by Environmental Permitting requirements.  Smaller plants are governed by the Clean Air Act 1993 and the 
defaultplann
defaulting process.  Defra has assisted with the development of guidance for local authorities on addressing air pollution impacts of CHP and biomass boilers. By careful plant location and good acoustic design, the noise impact of CHP can be mitigated. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6.default              defaultWhatdefault are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps?default&#xa0;default default&#xa0;
default21.
default 
defaultDifferent approaches to heating bring different benefits.  
defaultH
defaulteat demand shows more variability than electricity demand across the day and across the seasons. UK electricity demand 
defaultvaries between 20 and 55
defaultGW
default daily
default.  Heat demand across all sectors can vary between 150 and 400GW during the coldest winter days. 
default&#xa0;
default22.
default 
defaultThe ga
defaults network helps manage variability
default,
default with suppliers able to purchase gas quickly from a number of sources. The gas grid is able to handle short term spikes in demand due to the gas market’s liquidity. The electricity grid is less able to accommodate spikes 
defaultin demand without substantial spare generation capacity to meet peak winter demand.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default 
defaultThe high-level conclusions of the economic modelling commissioned for the 
defaultMeeting the challenge 
defaultdocument suggest there could still be a limited role for natural gas in 205
default0 to meet peaks in heat demand on the coldest days of the year. It suggests this could be more cost-effective than the alternative of full electrification. We are also seeing the development of hybrid heating systems that use gas and renewable energy sourc
defaultes, which could play a part in meeting peak heat demand.  Energy efficient measures, smart meters, smarter electricity grids and developments in electricity and thermal storage will also help
default, as will the development of low carbon heat networks with multip
defaultle heat sources
default. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default 
defaultWhen considering the relative merits of gas heating against electric heat pumps, costs of both fuel and infrastructure both now and in the future have to be considered.  For gas, there is the issue of the cost of maintaining the gas netw
defaultork; for electricity, there are the issues of the cost of reinforcement of the local electricity distribution grids. 
defaultIn both cases, some built-in redundancy is likely to be needed to ensure peak demand can be met.  This is why energy storage and demand-sid
defaulte response is so important. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7.default              defaultWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK? default&#xa0;
default25.
default 
defaultThe amount of heat supplied to buildings in the UK via heat networks is around 2% of domestic, public sector and commercial heat demand. This amounts to around 2000
default networks serving approximately 210,000 dwellings and 1700 commercial and public buildings across the UK.
default&#xa0;
default26.
default 
defaultMany of the schemes in operation today in the UK originate from the 1960s and 70s. For a number of reasons, including the waning popularity of high-r
defaultise housing developments, and the poor design, construction
default, maintenance
default and economic performance of some early schemes, heat networks fell out of favour. 
defaultEuropean countries where they remained popular have tended to have less well-developed natural gas gr
defaultids than the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOver the past decade, as local authorities have looked for ways to cut carbon emissions and address fuel poverty, the case for heat networks has strengthened. 
defaultConsumer reaction to networked heat is not straightforward; it can range from 
defaultvery positive where bills come down and reliability goes up (in comparison, for example, with electric heaters in a flat), all the way through to negative where a flat rate is charged, which is deemed to high and bearing no relation to actual heat consumed
default. The majority of heat consumers, however, are far more familiar with boilers and remain ignorant of the district heating option.
default&#xa0;
default27.
default 
default Government and other analysis over the previous years, including new modelling presented as an Annex to our March heat docum
defaultent, and responses from a wide variety of stakeholders, have shown that modern, low carbon heat networks can have a crucial role to play in a sustainable heating future, especially where heat demand is highly concentrated and a range of types of heat suppl
defaulty might be available, ie in urban areas. Major cities across the UK are already pursuing this route, but they often encounter barriers to development.. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default 
defaultTo help local authorities and local economic partnerships to overcome the financial, commercial and te
defaultchnical skills barriers to developing low carbon heat networks,  DECC is establishing a new Heat Networks Delivery Unit to help local authorities and local economic partnerships to overcome the financial, commercial and technical skills barriers to develop
defaulting low carbon heat networks.  
defaultThis will be up and running by October this year[
defaultfootnote
default – 
defaultonce cleared, attach link to announcement of HNDU investment director appointment].
default&#xa0;
default29.
default 
defaultOver and above networked heat projects, 
defaultThe Government is keen to
default 
defaultsee more local
default communities getting involved in reducing energy use, managing energy demand and collectively purchasing energy to get a better deal.   We will be publishing a Community Energy Strategy in the autumn, which will identify the potential of community energy p
defaultrojects in the UK to bring benefits to communities while helping to tackle climate change and maintain energy security. It will consider how to help community energy projects overcome the main barriers they face.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default 
defaultUK CHP capacity has grown year on year to 
default6.1 GW
default  in 2012 contributing 6.4% of electricity generated. Most of this capacity (89%) is industrial supplying industrial process heat. The rate of growth has been slow, due to CHP projects facing significantly higher hurdle rates than power-only generat
defaultion projects and difficulties for small CHP operators in securing a good price for the electricity they produce. DECC is working on a bespoke policy to support deployment of additional CHP capacity
default, provided this can be shown to be lower carbon that the el
defaultectricity it is displacing
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8.default              defaultWhat are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?default&#xa0;default31.
default 
defaultThe Committee has helpfully set out that it would like information on: 
default&#xa0;
default32.
default 
defaultThe share of the market for combi boilers is now approaching two-thirds of all boilers in the UK. The issue of the need for hot water tanks in the future was highlighted in 
defaultMeeting the Challenge
default. 
default&#xa0;
default33.
default 
defaultIndustry reports
default suggest that of those hou
defaultseholders that do not currently own a hot water tank, the proportion saying that they would find it easy to find space, and those saying it would be difficult, are of the same order. Technology may help that proportion of people who find the space requirem
defaultent for a new heat store difficult to meet.  First, hybrid heat pumps that incorporate condensing boilers will allow for the supply of hot water, thus negating much of the need for a thermal store. Secondly, developments in thermal storage, currently being
default researched by DECC, may make kit smaller and more efficient.  Thirdly, heat networks can offer storage capacity at scale, an important consideration in terms of matching supply with demand which in turn has wider benefits.
default&#xa0;
default Heat networks also enable easy 
defaulttransition between fossil fuel and low/zero carbon sources of heat. It allows changing on
defaulte 
default large heat supply 
default(or switching between a small number of different centralised heat sources) 
defaultrather than changing many individual boilers.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default34.
default 
defaultAs stated above, the 
defaultUK encourages the use of biomass heat in buildings and for industrial processes
default.  
defaultSo, it is important that investors are given sufficient certainty to bring forward large scale investments without being subject to the risk that changing environmental and s
defaultustainability criteria will create stranded assets. Therefore we have decided that for existing non-domestic biomass RHI installations the sustainability criteria will be “grandfathered” from the date the criteria are first introduced under the RHI.  For n
defaultew biomass heat installations, including domestic installations, grandfathering of the criteria will be applied at the point of accreditation. In the longer-term, biomass sustainability controls could be changed, so new installations accredited after these
default changes may have to meet different standards.  We believe this offers a sensible balance between providing the certainty needed to bring forward new biomass heat generation while still allowing us the flexibility to adjust the controls for new installatio
defaultns
default.
default&#xa0;
default35.
default 
defaultNew installations of biomass systems will also need to meet air quality standards in relation to PM and NO
defaultx
default. Domestic legacy installations, installed between 15
defaultth
default July 2009 and the launch of the scheme, will not need to meet this requirement. The air
default quality standards will also apply to all biomass systems which join the non-domestic RHI from September 24
defaultth
default 2013. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9.default              defaultShould the government take any further specific actions in relation to cooling?default&#xa0;default36.
default 
defaultCooling in the UK is primarily geared towards 
defaultremoving excessive heat gain in non-domestic buildings such as offices, to maintain comfortable ambient temperatures. Whilst mechanical cooling in buildings is currently responsible for 4% of the total energy demand, cooling in homes is less significant; a
defaultccounting for 1% of household energy use
default. Commissioned reports into the possible effects of climate change suggest that the domestic uptake of air conditioning
default is likely to
default rise. 
default&#xa0;
default37.
default 
defaultMeeting the Challenge
default proposed a number of areas that we need to examine i
defaultn tackling cooling in non-domestic buildings, such as improving our understanding of the way non-domestic buildings work and the way they are used to in relation to heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. This is a complex area as the non-domest
defaultic building stock is diverse and the buildings are used so differently. Currently cooling is 
defaultpredominantly carried out through
default electric air conditioning although there are other measures that can be used as part of a new build or retrofit development. Our 
defaultMarch document, for example, pointed to the increased role for renewable systems, such as reversible heat pumps in heating and cooling buildings. There may also be scope to combine summer-time cooling with solar photovoltaic electricity generation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are
default work
defaulting
default with industry and  wider stakeholder groups on these issues to decide on the specific actions that 
defaultmay be needed
default. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10.default              defaultWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfullydefault?default&#xa0;
default38.
default 
defaultThe non-domestic RHI currently only incorporates ground source
default heat pumps (GSHPs).
default&#xa0;
default There is an existing strong and growing market for reversible air to air heat pumps (AAHPs) therefore we do not propose introducing RHI support for this technology. Towards the end of 2012, consultations closed which discussed the pos
defaultsibility of introducing support for heating-only AAHPs and air to water heat pumps. We are currently reviewing the responses and other evidence and plan to publish our decision as to whether or not RHI support is appropriate in autumn 2013.
default&#xa0;
default39.
default 
defaultIn response to industry and market feedback, DECC has looked at the evidence on cost data and heat usage assumptions used to set the levels of tariffs when the non-domestic scheme was launched alongside the level of uptake so far under the scheme and evide
defaultnce from the renewable heat industry and market. As a result of this, we launched 
defaultthe Non-Domestic Scheme Early Tariff Review consultation
default in June which set ou
defaultt how the Government proposed to respond to 
defaultthe low up take of some technologies, including GSHPs, in the scheme so far, to ensure that renewable heat can make an effective contribution to our 2020 renewable energy targets, support the UK renewable heat in
defaultdustry and achieve decarbonisation of our heat supply by 2050. The consultation has now closed and we plan to announce the outcomes this autumn.
default&#xa0;
default40.
default 
defaultAnother factor affecting the deployment of GSHPs is the construction industry.
default&#xa0;
default GSHPs are most commonly instal
defaultled as part of new-build construction projects, as retro-fitting is often not an option in older properties due to a lack of space for a suitably sized ground-loop.
default&#xa0;
default As the number of new-build construction projects have declined over the past few years, so
default has the demand for GSHP installations.
default&#xa0;
default41.
default 
defaultThe domestic scheme, which will open for applications in spring 2014, will support ground and air source heat pumps.
default&#xa0;defaultQ11.default              defaultHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?default&#xa0;default42.
default 
defaultWe are confident that the dom
defaultestic RHI will successfully incentivise the uptake of renewable heat technologies, and anticipate 3.9TWh of 
defaultdomestic 
defaultrenewable heat will be supported through RHI by 2020/21. We estimate that this equates to cumulatively 745,000 installations by 2020/21. We
default expect to see steady growth in installations over the next few years, preparing the ground for mass rollout of renewable heating to households in the 2020s and 2030s. 
default&#xa0;
default43.
default 
defaultThe final policy was designed through extensive engagement over the consultation period, including consumer experience to date and consumer behaviour research by Ipsos MORI.
default 
default&#xa0;
default44.
default 
defaultWe are undertaking a range of activities to encourage uptake ahead of the schem
defaulte’s launch next year.
default&#xa0;
default The DECC-led RHI Consumer Protection and Empowerment and RHI Industry Advisory Groups are developing consumer engagement and industry promotional tools. Finally, DECC and Ofgem are working to streamline the application process.  
default&#xa0;defaultQ1default2.default              defaultThermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.default&#xa0;default What is government policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different? default&#xa0;
default45.
default 
defaultThe Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group
default’s Technology Innovation Needs Assessment for Heat, September 2012, identified heat storage as a priority area for support in the near future and research programmes are already in place.  A low carbon innovation strategy, to co-ordinate and guide potentia
defaultl future public sector funding in this area, will be published before the end of 2013.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs stated above, heat networks store heat and connect to large thermal stores.   DECC is providing £6m to be managed by the Heat Networks Delivery Unit, which will supp
defaultort local authorities and local economic partnerships to develop heat networks.  
default&#xa0;
default46.
default 
defaultIn addition, the Energy Technology Institute is running a £100m multi-year project looking at smart systems and heat, which includes demand-side response and storage options
default. The programme objectives are
