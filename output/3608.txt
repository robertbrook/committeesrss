[[[The constitutional role of the judiciary if there were a codified constitution]]]&#xa0;1. At present, the UK judiciary does not specifically carry out constitutional review, partly because there is no single express constitutional text to form a basis for such activity. Furthermore, the judiciary does not generally have a power to disapply or void Acts of Parliament. A broad principle of the UK constitution is that Acts of Parliament are supreme, and subordinate only to subsequent Acts of Parliament, which can amend or repeal earlier Acts either expressly or by implication.&#xa0;2. An important change in the role of the judiciary, were the UK to introduce a codified constitution, is that it might well take on a role in assessing the actions of public authorities – including Acts passed by the UK Parliament – for their compliance with the constitution as set out in the text. Courts could be empowered to quash those official actions that could not be reconciled with the constitution, including if necessary striking down Acts of Parliament.&#xa0;3. On the surface this change is a dramatic one. It could be seen as representing a shift away from a prevailing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty to a system in which the constitution – held to be an expression of popular sovereignty – is supreme.&#xa0;4. Advocates of a codified constitution might argue that this enhancement of the role of the judiciary would be desirable. They could find favour with the idea of constitutional values – including individual rights and the rules governing the relations between different institutions – being more fully protected. They might also welcome the possibility that fundamental constitutional principles could not be altered by simple legislative procedures, but that a more demanding process would be required, as set out in the constitutional text.&#xa0;5. Opponents of constitutional codification might regard this change as unfortunate. In their view, it might involve the courts – that lack the democratic legitimacy of Parliament – inappropriately involving themselves in political decision-making. It could also create consequent pressure for the politicisation of judicial appointments, since legal decisions could have powerful implications for government public policy programmes.&#xa0;6. However, assessing the change in the role of the judiciary that codification might bring about is not a straightforward task. First, in some models for a codified constitution, the judiciary may not be given a prominent role in the upholding of the constitution, and may not have the power to void primary legislation. The Nordic countries, for example, restrict the courts in this regard. In his proposed blueprint for a UK constitution, Tony Benn did not envisage that the judiciary would be able to review primary legislation. Benn preferred instead to retain parliamentary supremacy.&#xa0;7. Second, though the UK judiciary does not expressly carry out constitutional review, it does already conduct assessments of public authorities against principles that could well be regarded as constitutional in nature. For example, judicial review involves the consideration of whether decisions or actions are legal, rational and procedurally fair. These principles – which many would regard as fundamental to the rule of law – are constitutional, and were, for instance, included in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 (s.33).&#xa0;8. It is conceivable that in future judicial review could develop a more clearly constitutional character. A tendency exists for the executive and other public bodies to publish codes – often without a statutory basis – setting out their core principles and procedural rules. These texts include the Ministerial Code, the Civil Service Code (that now has a statutory basis under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010) and the Cabinet Manual. Feasibly courts could begin to use some of these documents in judicial review proceedings, perhaps arguing that they create a legitimate expectation that certain procedures be followed in decision-taking. By this means the juiciary could develop a greater constitutional role for itself without full codification having taken place.&#xa0;9. However, traditional judicial review, though it can entail quashing secondary legislation, does not allow for the assessment of the validity of Acts of Parliament. Under the Human Rights Act 1998, the courts can go further than they can under judicial review. As well as striking down secondary legislation, they can declare Acts of Parliament passed both before and after the 1998 Act incompatible with Convention rights (s.4). The role of the judiciary thereby means that the rights contained in the Convention are enforced, and ensures that the 1998 Act, and the existence of the Convention in UK law, are protected from implied repeal. But it falls to ministers and Parliament to resolve issues of incompatibility. The courts cannot strike down Acts of Parliament under the Human Rights Act; and would probably accept as law an Act of Parliament that expressly amended or repealed the 1998 Act, that is to say the stated this intention specifically. Nonetheless, under the Act judges are required as far as possible to read legislation as compatible with the Convention (s.3). In the process they can wield a great deal of discretion, even reading into the texts of Acts of Parliament words that were not included in them.&#xa0;10. UK membership of the European Union, as provided for in UK law by the European Communities Act 1972, entails European law taking precedence over domestic law. The courts are able to suspend the operation of an Act of Parliament that by implication conflicts with European law, as established in 1991 through the second Factortame case. Yet, as with the Human Rights Act, the courts would probably accept an Act of Parliament that expressly overrode the European Communities Act. Nonetheless, the judiciary is already performing in relation to European law a role akin to that which it might play under a codified constitution.&#xa0;11. Legislation produced by the devolved assemblies is subject to full judicial review. The judiciary can assess these laws both for their compliance with the ECHR and whether they are within the scope of the Acts of Parliament providing for devolution. In this sense, the swathes of policy that is now devolved have become subject to what could be regarded as constitutional review by the judiciary, where previously they came within the remit of the UK Parliament and its ‘sovereignty’ (though ultimately the authority of the UK Parliament is reserved to it).&#xa0;12. It should be noted for the purposes of the present Committee inquiry that the Acts of Parliament underpinning devolution include provisions for advanced scrutiny of bills passed by the devolved assemblies, to ensure they are within the bounds set out for them, before they are permitted to become law (see eg: Scotland Act 1998 ss.31-33). Under a codified constitution, the courts might have such a pre-legislative scrutiny role, or it could be given to a body which is not a court in the more usual sense of the term, perhaps an equivalent to the French Council of State. A process of this kind would mean that the constitutionality of an Act was considered not only when challenged in relation to a particular case, but that it was assessed in the abstract.&#xa0;13. The UK Supreme Court now has a special role in relation to devolution issues. In this sense, it is beginning to resemble a constitutional court, and might well perform this function within a codified UK constitution. An issue to be considered is whether any court could consider a constitutional case, or whether it would have to be dealt with specifically by a constitutional court.&#xa0;14. Finally, even without a codified constitution being introduced, the courts may seek to assert an even greater role than they already possess with regard to the review of primary legislation, when applying what they see as fundamental constitutional principles. A view exists that parliamentary sovereignty is a creation of the common law: that this doctrine came into being because it was recognised in judicial decisions, and that judicial decisions could therefore supplant it. The courts may at some point seek to establish a more sophisticated hierarchy of law, identifying core constitutional enactments as protected from implied repeal. Possibly the judiciary could also refuse to recognise attempts by Parliament to bring about what the courts saw as abrogations of fundamental constitutional principles, such as a serious curtailment of the potential for the conduct of judicial review. Such a clash between Parliament and the judiciary would represent a serious constitutional crisis. It could be argued that the lack of a codified constitution makes this kind of scenario more likely, since a constitutional text could make the boundaries clearer, discouraging both Parliament and the courts from exceeding their proper role.&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]15. It is likely that constitutional codification would expand the remit of the courts, giving them a more explicit role in upholding the text. This new set of functions could well include the capacity to disapply or void primary legislation; and perhaps provide rulings on the constitutional compliance of bills before they were allowed to become Acts of Parliament. Such a role for the judiciary would be difficult to reconcile with the continuation of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.&#xa0;16. However, the present constitutional role of the courts should not be understated. It extends in some cases as far as being able to suspend primary legislation. Established doctrines suggest that Parliament, if determined enough, can have its way. However, judicial attitudes and practices are not static, and may develop in increasingly assertive ways. A codified constitution could be deemed necessary to restrain the courts, rather than augment them.&#xa0;18 November 2013&#xa0;
