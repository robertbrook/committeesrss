[normal]The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) 
[normal]represents 
[normal]over 17,000 heads, principals, deputies, vice-principals, assistant heads, business managers and other senior staff of maintained and independent schools and colleges throughout the UK. ASCL has members in more than 90 per cent of secondary schools and colleges of all types, responsible for the education of more than four million young people. This places the association in a unique position to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the leaders of secondary schools and of colleges.

[normal]ASCL welcomes deregulation in principle. In general, those who lead schools and colleges, our members and governors, are best placed to make decisions about them.

[normal]However, there is always a need for a framework of regulation within which such decisions are taken in order to maintain probity and improve quality. The question is what an appropriate balance between regulation and restriction is. There is no easy answer, and different balances will seem right to different people, in different circumstances, and at different times.

[normal]The elements of the bill that concern ASCL are mainly in schedules 12 to 14: 
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Schedules 12 and 13 are essentially uncontroversial. Schedule 12 is just reflecting that the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) has become an arm of the department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS). The only element in schedule 13 that is likely to be opposed is the removal of the regulatory need for teachers in further education (FE) to be qualified, which has never been fully implemented. Colleges argue that they can best decide whom to employ, so ASCL would not want to oppose this.

[normal]Schedule 14 relates to schools, and there is a little more to say about it.

[normal]Many ASCL members feel that discipline is of such importance that it should be necessary for school governing bodies to set the framework for it. ASCL would certainly urge its members to ensure that they are operating within a disciplinary policy agreed by governors and supported by them. The bill only removes the requirement for governors to be involved – they still could be, and as it is so important, in most cases they still will be. However, there may be exceptions, and the removal of the item from the governing bodies list of statutory duties does seem to downplay it. 
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Perhaps a compromise would be for the issue to be deregulated, but for the Department for Education (DfE) to publish guidance urging governors to be involved and professional school leaders to involve them? It certainly should be made clear that removing the regulation that governing bodies must adopt a disciplinary policy is not to say that that they cannot, or should not, do so.
[normal]9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A similar point applies to home-school agreements. It should be clear that removing the requirement to have them is not because they are anything other than a good idea in many contexts, and it should be clear that schools still have the power to use them.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The question of term dates is a difficult one. As many schools become academies, and have the power to set their own dates, the duty on local authorities (LAs) to set school dates seems to have less point. In an extreme case, where all schools are academies, there are no schools that have to use the LA’s term dates. But the problem is not having anything from which to vary, with the possibility of chaos. At present most academies follow the pattern of their LA quite closely in order not to create unnecessary difficulty for parents with children in different schools. The LA setting dates is an efficient way of establishing a local norm, from which academy schools depart to a greater or lesser extent at their discretion.
[normal]11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It would be hard to argue that maintained schools should be constrained in ways that academies are not, so perhaps the best solution would be for the LA to continue to have a duty to publish term dates, but remove the duty on maintained schools o follow them. Though no school would be obliged to follow them, such a set of dates would still serve a useful function, and would represent a very small cost to the LA. As noted above, where all or most schools are academies this is the current situation.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There has not been an opportunity properly to reflect on the likely consequences of the proposed deregulations in the areas of employment and school staffing. In general, as stated above, ASCL welcomes its members having more freedom to make local decisions, but there is a need for a degree of regulation to reduce the instance of bad practice, and to establish a minimum level to prevent bad practice driving out good.
[normal]13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The clauses about the publication of reports appear essentially to change some ‘musts’ to ‘must make reasonable efforts to’, and as such are probably uncontroversial.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I feel obliged to point out that conducting consultations with short deadlines in the summer months, though it no doubt suits the Parliamentary timetable, is not a good way to elicit considered responses. 
[normal]15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I hope that this is of value to your consultation, ASCL is willing to be further consulted and to assist in any way that it can.
