I am Chief \nExecutive of the Consumer Finance Association.\nAdam Freeman: I am A\ndam Freeman; I am the CEO of Mr \nLender\nAndy Lapointe: \nI am Andy \nLapointe\n. \nI am \nUK\n Public Affairs \nManager for QuickQuid.\n&#xa0;\nQ2 &#xa0; \nChair: Before I open with the questions, can I emphasise t\nhat, with five of you, \nthere is no need for every person to answer every question\n? \nWe only have an hour with you\n,\n and \nwe have \na considerable number of questions\n. \nHowever, in saying that, if you disagree with a pre\nvious answer, or \nif you feel there is something you need to add to a previous answer, feel free to do so.\nI am going to start with the industry charter\n. \nAs you will know, this was introduced in November of last year\n. \nIt was designed to ensure responsible lending\n. \nSince then, CAB, StepChange and OFT have reported that the reverse seems to have happened\n. \nThere has been a significant increase in complaints about\n,\n and problems with\n,\n the industry\n. \nWhat is your reason for that\n? \nWho will lead on it\n? \nCan you give an explanation?\nGreg Stevens: It is important to know what the C\nonsumer \nC\nredit \nT\nrade \nA\nssociation\n is\n,\n in terms of its membership base\n. \nWe have 373 members, which range from SMEs to large firms\n. \nMany of our members are community commercial lenders and many \nare second\n and third\n&#x2011;\ngeneration businesses\n. \nThey are\n,\n and always have been\n,\n attempting to do the best they can do with regard to their customers\n. \nWe have 61 members who either partially or wholly provide payday\n&#x2011;\nlending\n products, and \nthat is reducing, because many members \nhave \nm\noved\n away from payday lending over the course of the last 12 months\n. \nThe \namount of payday\n&#x2011;\nlending members has decreased within the Consumer Credit Trade \nAssociation by 13%\n. \nMany of our members are coming out of this market, as I said\n. \n70% of members are still in traditional credit granting.\nThe charter and\n the\n code of practice, which \nwere\n i\nntroduced in November 2012, have \nchanged things\n. \nWe see it \nin\n the number of complaints that actually come through to us\n. \nThe total number of complaints about payday lending for the year 2012 was 15\n. \nDuring the period we have measured in 2013,\n year to date,\n there have been 36 complaints, 19 of which came from one member\n. \nT\nhere is \na reduction in terms of the overall number of complaints, because we have people \nwho are doing more loans in tho\nse areas\n. \nThe actual number of loans has increased, even though the number of our members has decreased to an extent\n. \nThe feedback \nthat \nwe have taken from members is that many things are changing\n. \nWe do not \nbelieve that credit is being given in terms of the changes that have taken place\n and that \ncontinue to take place\n. \nComing back to the figur\nes and assertions that are \nmade, we would be very concerned if the \nstatistics from Citizens Advice\n were found to be representative, accurate and up-to-date\n. \nWe have asked for granularity; we have asked for clarity on the customers, including customer details and agreement numbers\n. \nThese have not been forthcoming.\n \nWhen assertions about companies are made, we do need evidence in terms of case studies\n. \nWe need those to take back to our members to understand what is\n \ndeemed to have gone wrong, so that we can actually work with the members\n.\nThe \nConsumer Credit Trade \nAssociation is 122 years old\n. \nWe have been working with regulators and legislators over that period to ensure best practice for consumers\n,\n and we continue to do that\n. \nWe are doing regular training and compliance meetings with our members to ensure \nthat \nthey actually provide the best service.\n&#xa0;Q3 &#xa0; \nChair: \nMay \nI follow up on that\n? \nYou said \nthat complaints had increased to 36, 19 of which were from\n one company\n. \nCan you give det\nails of what those complaints a\nre about?\nGreg Stevens: No, I cannot\n. \nI do not have the breakdown.\n&#xa0;Q4 &#xa0; \nChair: With respect, you have\n just\n criticised others for a lack of granularity\n. \nIt would appear that you are as deficient in that as they are.\nThe charter actually does outline that there should be affordability checks\n. A\n loan has to be suitable \nto be\n taken out\n, and i\nt must take into account the circumstances of the individual\n. But\n the OFT report said that only 74% of lenders actually took affordability into account\n. \n67% said they did not do so for every loan\n,\n and 23% said they did so for a rollover\n. That\n seems to conflict with the charter \nthat \nthe industry itself has set out\n. \nHow do you explain that?\nHenry Raine: Mr \nChairman, I wonder if I could \ngive some context—\nnot on behalf of the i\nndustry, but on behalf of Wonga—on \nthe background to this\n. \nOne thing I would point out—this is not \nto decry any people \non thi\ns p\nanel or elsewhere—is that, not surprisingly, perhaps, the OFT found that compliance was better among the larger lenders, because, frankly, we have more sophisticated systems to do so.\nI think that t\nhe charter was an important development\n. \n[Interruption.]\n The charter was an important development. \nAccording to the OFT, \nsome \n90% of the industry came together\n to agree tho\nse provision\ns. \nIt will take time for some of the lenders to comply with them\n. I think actually, t\nhe picture is mixed\n. \nAs far as Wonga is concerned, as people know, we h\nave always done thorough credit\n&#x2011;\nchecking; we have always bought and returned data\n. \nYou are seeing improvements across the sector.\nThe\n \nother thing to be borne in mind is that the OFT has done its own review of the sector\n. \nI believe they will tell you later that, of the 50 lenders they visited, 19 are no longer carrying on payday\n&#x2011;\nloan activities\n. \nThat has to be seen in the context of this process as well\n. Because\n we do not have \nthe \ngranularity as to who has done what, we will have to bear that in mind as well.\nI think that t\nhe charter has made some progress; \nI think \nit is absolutely right that people keep focusing on it\n and th\ne commitments.\n&#xa0;\nQ5 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: Very specifically on this, \nI think \nit was reported earlier this year that Wonga had had a significant increase in the number of bad debts \nit was\n writing off\n. \nThat does suggest a less than robust approach to affordability.\nHenry Raine: That is not the case, actually\n.\nPaul Blomfield: It was reported in the papers\n, was it not? \nHenry Raine:\n I know. It was a mistake.\nPaul Blomfield: The papers were wrong, were they?\nHenry Raine: \nI think t\nhey took the wrong figure\n. \nI addressed this \nwith the Public Accounts \nCommittee\n. Because i\nn our previous accounts we had not shown the amount of money we had lent, \nwhich wa\ns over \n£700 million, the comparison wa\ns made between \n£77 \nmillion and a lower number\n. The National Audit \nOffice confirmed at that meeting that the correct comparison was to compare the write-off with the amount of money lent\n. \nThat is roughly 9.7%; it has not changed\n. That\n was \njust a\n misreporting.\n&#xa0;\nQ6 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: \n£77 \nmillion of \nbad \nloans is still a substantial number\n. That\n is a substantial number of people, considering the average size of the loans \nthat \nwe are talking about, who are presumably left in a position where their credit rating is ruined and they are unable to repay a debt\n. That, surely, \nis a matter of concern\n \nif you are \nsaying that you are \nrigorously assessing affordability criteria.\nHenry Raine: I\n think, in one sense, any loan—\nWonga’s business is \naimed \nto lend to people who can pay us back\n. \nThat is how we make money\n. \nThe vast majority of people pay us back on time\n. \nWe freeze interest after 60 days\n. \n25% of people pay us back early.\n So in one context, of course, any loan—but w\ne are lending \nsmall\n&#x2011;\nsum\n credit to vast numbers of people\n, and I think \nit is fair to say that those figures compare favourably with other lenders in the industry, including credit cards and banks\n. \nWe also have a very significant system, as you know, to he\nl\np people in financial difficulty, \nincluding freezing interest after 60 days and allowing people to go online and do their own\n income\n&#x2011;\nand\n&#x2011;\nexpenditure form and, effectively, have a proposal accepted\n. So w\ne do everything we can to lessen the effect of bad debt.\n&#xa0;\nQ7 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Just coming back on th\nis\n 60\n&#x2011;\ndays point, a lot of your advertising will focus on much shorter period\ns\n of time\n, and argue\n that you have great cost transparency over 18 days, \nwhich a \nlot of your advertising focuse\ns on. \nIf peop\nle end up borrowing for 60 days\n because they are rolling over loans, they end up paying a lot more.\nHenry Raine: To be clear, our average\n first time\n loan is £17\n8\n for 17 days\n. \nPeople cannot borrow for 60 days\n. \nIf people cannot pay us back, \nthen \ninterest continues, \nbut \nthree days \nbefore the due date, \nand 24 hours before the due date, they get reminders\n. They get\n text messages\n. They get \nnumbers they can call if they are having financial difficulty\n. So v\nery few people ever end up paying us that amount of money.\nThe point of introducing a cap was to differentiate ourselves from the credit\n&#x2011;\ncard market, where, as you know, the basic business model\n, I think,\n is to lend \npeople money they cannot afford;\n they pay the minimum amount and they\n get \ninto a debt spiral.\n That is why we do it like that.\n&#xa0;\nQ8 &#xa0; \nChair: Can you give us figures for how many people owe \nthat \namount of money?\nHenry Raine: \nI think\n \naround 3% of loans go to that period, but I can confirm that.\n&#xa0;Q9 &#xa0; \nChair: How many would that be in numbers?\nHenry Raine: I do not know\n. \nI would have to confirm that to you in writing\n. I do not know the exact\n numbers.\nAdam Freeman: I can jump in there\n. \nIt is probably about 2% or 3% with us, as well, who say they are going into financial difficulty.\nChair: I am trying to pin down how many people \nthat \ninvolves\n, to get a picture.\n \nAdam Freeman: \nIt is pro rata. \nIf it is 100,000 people or 10,000, it is always going to be a percentage of people\n. \nIt depends.\n&#xa0;\nQ10 &#xa0; \nChair: The point is that there still could be an awful lot of people enduring an awful lot of hardship as a result of it.\nHenry Raine: To come back on that, we and\n I am sure\n other lend\ners here d\no everything we possibly can to avoid th\nat, not only by thorough credit-\nchecking, but also by moderating the amount people are borrowing and giving them lots of warnings about the impact, both on our website and throughout the journey\n. Of course it is regrettable, and\n our j\nob is to make that\n number as small as possible.\n&#xa0;\nQ11 &#xa0; \nChair: We \nshall \nbe \ncovering credit-checking in a moment,\n \nand \nI will bring Robin back in to deal with that\n, but\n \nmay\n I\n go\n back to the charter for a moment\n? \nWhat sanctions are there for lenders that do not actually abide by the charter?\nGreg Stevens: The c\nharter and the addendum to our c\node of \np\nractice, which is the payday\n&#x2011;\nlending addendum, lays down what members should do\n. \nWe are not a regulator\n. \nI pointed this out to the then Minister, which was Norman\n&#xa0;\nLamb, with regard to \nus being a\n trade association.\n \nWe are there to ensure members adopt best practice\n. \nWe monitor it \nin \nthe same way that the OFT do: we look in terms of complaints\n. \nWe take up the complaints with the companies\n. \nIf we find there are regular complaints about an organisation, the sanctions are we work with them \nwith regard \nto applying \na best practice model, so \nsomebody goes in and works with them\n. \nWe can then suspend the member and, eventually, we can actually expel the member from the trade association.\n&#xa0;\nQ12 &#xa0; \nChair: Do you actually monitor whether the companies abide by the charter as opposed to \njust \nresponding to complaints?\nGreg Stevens: We do not directly monitor on a regular basis\n. \nWe monitor when the company comes into the trade association\n. \nWe do not know what takes place after that\n. \nWe do not do regular monitoring.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nT\nhe larger lenders that I represent are independently monitored by an independent panel\n. \nWe have incorporated the charter commitments into a wider code of practice\n,\n and introduced independent monitoring for that.\nHenry Raine: In Wonga’s case, we are \na member of the \nFLA\n, which I think many of you know \nhas been going for around 20 years\n. \nThey have their own code, which we abide\n by, and of course\n the\ny have independent monitoring;\n they do monitor us.\n&#xa0;\nQ13 &#xa0; \nChair: But\n the only sanctions are, basically, suspension from the membership of the association or organisation.\nGreg Stevens: \nOr expelling.\nChair: It does not stop them trading.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: We would also expect, if someone was in breach \nof our code \nand had not corrected it given the opportunity, having been identified by the independent monitoring, we would expect them to be reported to the regulator\n. \nWe would expect the independent panel to be able to make a statement to that effect and, ultima\ntely, recommend to the Consumer Finance \nAssociation that the member be expelled from the trade association.\n&#xa0;\nQ14 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: Very quickly, to Russell and Greg, \nso \nhow many people have you expelled in the last 12 months?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: Our independent panel has been in place since March and we have not expelled any members yet\n. \nThey have all been seen to be compliant.\nNadhim Zahawi: Greg, you said you have been going for 120 years.\nGreg Stevens: I will answer the question in terms of payday lending, which is what we are talking about\n. \nIn terms of payday lending, we have expelled nobody\n. \nWe have had many pe\nople who have exited the market\n because of the charter\n. \nWe have had people who \nhave left the trade association\n because they did not want to comply with the charter\n and the c\node of \np\nractice.\nNadhim Zahawi: \nBut y\nou have not\n \nexpelled anyone.\nGreg Stevens: They have expelled themselves, because they—\nNadhim Zahawi: \nYou have not \nactually taken action and expelled anyone\n. \nThat is my question: yes or no.\nGreg Stevens: No\n, as I have said.\n&#xa0;\nQ15 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: Do you think either of your organisations are doing a good enough job in this market\n,\n or have you just gone native?\nGreg Stevens: The answer is no,\n we have not gone native\n. I do \nnot \nthink \nenough credit is being given in terms of how the market has been tidied up, in terms of the work done by the OFT, by the charter and \nby \nthe consumer groups\n. Many people have left the\n market.\n \nYou also have to remember there are more companies that are not in trade associations than in trade associations\n, and m\nany of those companies are the ones that create the problems in the market\n, \ncertainly with regard to lead generation\n. \nThere are other factors that play in this market\n. \nMany of the complaints that come in are \nabout companies that are \nnot under trade associations.\n&#xa0;\nQ16 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nBut also i\nt is a market that gravitates towards the very big guys, because they can afford the advertising\n. That is the model.\nGreg Stevens: Yes.\n&#xa0;Q17 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: The market is concentrated in a handful of Wonga-type companies\n. \nLet me get this right, Mr\n&#xa0;\nRaine: what was your profitability last year on the £700\n&#xa0;\nmillion of loans \nthat \nyou made?\nHenry Raine: The most recent profitability\n was\n we lent £1.2\n&#xa0;\nbillion and we made a net income of £62\n.5\n&#xa0;\nmillion, which\n is about £5 for every £100 lent\n.\nNadhim Zahawi: What was it before tax?\nHenry Raine: I think\n \nit was \n£80\n&#x2011;\nsomething\n&#xa0;\nmillion; I do not have an exact figure\n. \nWe look at the net income.\n&#xa0;\nQ18 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: You said that 2% or 3% were people getting into real pain on your model.\nHenry Raine: \nAround \nthat\n, yes. \nNadhim Zahawi: It is the same for Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman\n, roughly?\nAdam Freeman: \nCorrect\n.\nNadhim Zahawi: You refused to give us an answer, but my calculation would be that there are around 123,000 people \nthat you put \nin real pain.\nHenry Raine: We have\n around\n 1.25\n&#xa0;\nmillion customers\n,\n and 3% of that is a much lower number.\nNadhim Zahawi: I worked this out from £700\n&#xa0;\nmillion\n. \nYou said the average loan was £174, so I did the calculation\n. \nWhy do you not just give m\ne the number, instead of \nme try\ning\n to work it out?\nHenry Raine: \nAbsolutely. Well, \nI do not know the number.\n The average loan—\nNadhim Zahawi: You must know the number, Mr\n&#xa0;\nRaine\n, because\n you will have that number.\nHenry Raine: The average loan across the portfolio is £27\n2\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ19 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: I just want to know how many people you put in real pain\n—in \na number, not \nin \na percentage.\nHenry Raine: I do not accept we put any\nbody\n in real pain\n. \nIf you take \n1.25\n&#xa0;\nmillion customers and\n 3% \nof them \nis the \nnumber \nwho\n, in your definition,\n have gone beyond 60 days\n, t\nhat will give you the number of customers you are looking for.\nChair: It is around about 40,000, is it not?\nNadhim Zahawi: Yes, it \nis about\n 40,000 people\n—\nnot 125,000; I \ngot it \nwrong.\nHenry Raine: Respectfully, \nI think that is \nthe way \nof looking at it, yes\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ20 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: Do you think that your charges are extortionate and that you are a rapacious organisation?\nHenry Raine: No, of course we do not accept that\n. Indeed—this is an important point—when you look at the market that we are competing in, w\nhen the business was started, the aim was clearly\n to disrupt the financial \nservices market and disrupt consumer credit\n. \nWhat we looked across at were people who \nwere having \nto borrow fixed-term sums and \nwho \nhad no flexibility\n. \nWith Wonga, as you know, the first thing you see \nas \nyou come on\n \nto the website is the amount it is going to cost you; you choose how much to borrow for how long\n. \nThe product actually \nis \nused moderately by most people.\nOf course, the market \nthat \nwe have opened up is composed of those people traditionally using overdrafts and credit cards\n. \nAll the surveys show—the research from \nBristol\n rather confirmed this—that\n, for online customers, that\n is the market we are serving.\n&#xa0;\nQ21 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: I have had an overdraft\n. I ra\nn a small business\n. \nWhat is your interest rate when someone goes over the period of time for the overdraft or equivalent in your world?\nHenry Raine: If you borrow £100, my understanding—this is from \nWhich?,\n who \nI think \nwill be here later—\nis that \nthe unauthorised overdraft charges for 30 days run up to between \n£80 and £115. \nIf you borrow \nthe same \nfrom Wonga, our most expensive loan for 30 days is £37\n. Those are some of the comparisons.\nPeople also tell us, and \nthere is evidence from the Friends\n&#xa0;\nProvident\n&#xa0;\nFoundation, \nthat the vast majority of those people using credit cards are not, of course, paying their debt off every month\n, and\n \ntherefore\n the cost to them of using a credit\n&#x2011;\ncard product is considerably higher.\nChair: We are still on our first question and there are a lot more to come\n. If you could make\n questions and answers brief, I would appreciate it.\n&#xa0;\nQ22 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: This morning, Wonga admitted\n that\n they were one of the 50 companies investigated by the OFT, which covered 90% of the market\n. \nCan the other two companies here today confirm whether they were also on that list of 50\n? \n19 of those 50 lenders \nhave now left the market, according to the OFT\n. \nCan the trade associations confirm how many of those 19 were one of their members?\nAdam Freeman: We had the OFT audit us at the beginning of the year.\nAndy Lapointe: Yes, QuickQuid was also one of the 50.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: Of the 19, none of them were members of my trade association.\nGreg Stevens: The 19 is a spurious figure\n. \nMany of those people were not in trade associations\n. From the 19, w\ne had two\n,\n who have actually changed products\n. \nThey are still trading as credit granters.\nAnn McKechin: \nT\nhey are no longer in payday lending\n. \nThank you for the clarification.\n&#xa0;\nQ23 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: I would like to pick up on something that Mr\n&#xa0;\nStevens intimated\n. \nHe intimated there were good payday lenders and there were bad payday lenders\n. \nCould you very briefly define who the bad payday lenders are?\nGreg Stevens: I \ndon’t think I\n intimate\nd\n good and bad\n. I think there are lenders and lead-\ngenerators who have been confusing the market\n. \nTheir practices were probably not where they should have been.\n&#xa0;Q24 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: I admire your defence\n. \nMay I go on\n? \nAre all the payday lenders on this panel members of your association?\nGreg Stevens: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ25 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: Let me pick up a point\n. \nMr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman, I shall come to you shortly\n. \nOn the Mr\n&#xa0;\nLender website, it says, “If, for whatever reason,\n I can’\nt lend to you, \nthen \nI will do my very best to ask around and recommend another friend of ours, who may be able to help you ou\nt. P\nroviding you have consented I can do this\n.”\nOn the surface, that sounds very good indeed\n, but w\nho are the friends\n? \nWho do you think the friends are, Mr\n&#xa0;\nStevens?\nAdam Freeman: We—\nMr Binley: I will come to you, Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman\n. \nWho do you think the friends are, Mr\n&#xa0;\nStevens\n? \nGreg Stevens: \nI am sorry; could you repeat the question? \nMr Binley: I want to know who yo\nu think those other friends are who\n are operating in the business\n and \nclearly \nare \nnot operating to the standards that Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman would want to operate to.\nGreg Stevens: \nFirst of all\n, having 373 members\n,\n I cannot comment on one company\n. \nAll lenders work with other companies with regard to people’s special circumstances, because the underwriting criteria of most companies are\n different from\n \neverybody else’s. \nThere will be times when somebody would fit somebody else’s underwriting criteria and might be better placed\n. \nThe one thing that is not going away in all of this is the fact that people need th\nat\n \nmoney\n. \nThere is a need for small cash\n&#x2011;\nsum loans\n. \nT\nhat\n need is there\n. \nPeople will direct them to a place that is more beneficial and more suitable for that consumer.\n&#xa0;\nQ26 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: I know the good side of your business, sir\n. \nI am concerned about the bad side\n. \nWe have \ngot \nenough reports of the bad side to know it exists\n. You, a\ns the head of the association of payday lenders, \nneed to help me \ndefine who the bad lenders \nare \nand who you think the “friends” are\n, as\n intimated on \nthe Mr\n&#xa0;\nLender\n website\n. \nWill you do that\n? \nAdam Freeman: Can—\nMr Binley: I will come to you, Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman.\nGreg Stevens: First of all, only 16% of our members are \npayday lenders, so i\nt is not \nthe payday\n&#x2011;\nlending trade \nassociation\n. \nIn terms of the good friends and the bad friends, that is a situation in terms of looking in terms of referral\n. \nReferral is a general practice for all financial institutions\n. \nIt is nothing dissimilar to \nwhat \nother credit granters do.\n&#xa0;\nQ27 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nI find your defence unacceptable. Now l\net me come to Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman\n. \nWhat does “friends” mean?\nAdam Freeman: It is a kind of branding for us\n. \nWe hold a consumer credit licen\nce with a broker licence and a lender licenc\ne\n. \nWe probably facilitate one loan out of every 100 people that apply to us\n. \nWe have very strict lending criteria\n. \nIf we cannot lend to a customer, we will pass it to other lenders.\n&#xa0;\nQ28 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: And who are they?\nAdam Freeman: It would be on a broker model, so we would actually give it to a broker to push through to other lenders.\n&#xa0;\nQ29 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nSo w\ne are not talking about those people who work in the shadows of your industry, then\n. \nSomebody considers them to be friends; you are saying it is not you.\nAdam Freeman: I see your point.\nMr Binley: \nOh good;\n I am glad about that\n. \nNow answer the question.\nAdam Freeman: I see your point\n,\n and I see why you are making the point\n, but \nwe are very strict at lending\n. \nWe literally lend to one in 100 people.\nMr Binley: This is not about you; it is about your friends.\nAdam Freeman: \nThat is right. And my friends, or \nMr Lender’s friends\n,\n are obviously people that will \nfacilitate\n people\n who\n are working part\n&#x2011;\ntime or \nare \non benefits\n. \nWe will not lend to people like that.\n&#xa0;\nQ30 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Do your receive commission for it?\nAdam Freeman: \nSometimes;\n sometimes not.\nMr Binley: This is the loophole.\nAdam Freeman: Can I ask—can we ask—what am I \nmissing?\nMr Binley: You do not ask the questions; we do.\n              \nAdam Freeman: Fair enough.\n&#xa0;\nQ31 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Coming back to affordability, which is \nabsolutely \ncrucial, you all say\n, as companies,\n that you have rigorous affordability criteria\n. \nYou have just said you only approve about one in 100 people, which seems extraordinary\n. I think \nWonga have said that about 60% of people do not get through that particular— \nHenry Raine: 80%.\nMr Walker: Thank you\n. \nThe charter says you will \n“C\narry out \na sound, \nproper \nand \nappropriate affordability assessment \nand credit vetting \nfor each loan application\n and before the loan is extended (\nrolled over\n)”. \nAs the Chairman poi\nnted out\n earlier, the OFT figures rather contradict that\n. May I ask \nthe three businesses on this panel, do you do th\nat\n on every loan and every rollover individually?\nAdam Freeman: Yes\n. \nWe have started to since the OFT investigation and since the charter.\n&#xa0;\nQ32 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: \nSo you did \nnot \nbefore the OFT investigation?\nAdam Freeman: Yes, but it is a lot more intense now\n. \nWe speak to every single customer that we will lend to\n. \nWe will go through income and expenditure\n. \nThere is one downside in it at the moment, which I am sure \nthat \nwe will come to: not knowing in real time\n. \nThat is \nprobably \nour biggest downside as a lender: not knowing in real time what other loans a customer will have at the time of applying with us.\nMr Walker: I want to come on to that.\nAdam Freeman: I am sure you will.\nMr Walker: It is a very important point\n.Adam Freeman: We do everything we can\n. \nIf someone has an income of £1\n,\n500 and their expenses are £900, leaving £600 disposable income, we are not going to lend that customer £600\n. \nWe would probably go up to\n a threshold of about\n 50\n% to \n60\n%—maybe £300 to £35\n0.\nAs a lender, what we do not know at the time is, “Have they just gone to QuickQuid or Wonga and got a loan with them\n?” \nI would love that information, because I like to lend to people who can afford to pay me back.\n&#xa0;\nQ33 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: I will come back to that, if I may\n. \nMr\n&#xa0;\nLapointe, does QuickQuid do individual assessments for every loan and rollover?\nAndy Lapointe: QuickQuid does an affordability assessment and creditworthiness check with each and every loan and rollover\n. \nWe do a credit report, an over\n&#x2011;\nindebtedness report and we query a number of other databases\n. \nAt the time of a rollover, a customer is going to be asked a series of questions to determine whether or not the rollover is suitable for them and nobody would be guaranteed to have access to any rollovers.\n&#xa0;\nQ34 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: In what circumstances would a rollover not be suitable\n? \nIf someone cannot afford to pay back the princip\nal\n, how would you \nthen \ndecide \nthat \nthe rollover was not suitable for them?\nAndy Lapointe: If a customer went to roll\n \nover a loan and advise\nd\n us that he had just lost his job, \na\n rollover would not be suitable\n; a\n forbearance arrangement would be suitable at that point.\n&#xa0;\nQ35 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: How often does that happen?\nAndy Lapointe: I\n think i\nt happens fairly frequently.\n&#xa0;\nQ36 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: It would be interesting to see some figures on th\nat\n.\n \nComing back to Wonga on this, I saw that you were nodding in terms of saying \nthat \nyou do \nan \nassessment on every loan and every rollover.\nHenry Raine: The way Wonga started was by doing everything online and buying as much data \na\ns we could\n. \nThat was the differentiating factor in our model\n. \nEarly on, we worked with Callcredit\n,\n \nin particular, \nand \nwith other bureaux\n to \ndevise as much data as we could. \nWe buy all the raw da\nta from the\n bureau\nx\n; we do not buy reports\n. \nWe buy the raw data and crunch it ourselves\n.\nWe also look at lots of other factors\n. \nThere is a lot of public data you can buy in the marketplace t\no\n assess people’s affordability\n. Obviously, our algorithm has got better\n the more we have lent, because you learn about people\n. Without going in\nto too much detail, we also look at how people interact with the sliders and how they interact on the screen in terms of whether they are appropriate for the loan.\nIn terms of rollovers, we have always checked\n. \nLess than one in 15 customers at Wonga ever rolls over a loan once\n. \nRollovers have not been a big feature of our business\n. \nIndeed, when we started we did not offer extensions at all\n. \nCustomers\n kept phoning up and saying, “It\n is my due date; can I extend for another five days?\n”\n and we had no mechanisms to do it, so we introduced the limited concept of extensions, whereby you could extend for how long you want, i.e\n. \nyou do not have to extend the whole loan for the whole amount\n. \nYou can extend £20 for 10 days\n. \nThat is what we do.\nClearly, the big challenge for us\n, which is why \na number of us here are working together on this with the bureau\nx, \nis \nto find\n the best method of getting all data from all lending on a real\n&#x2011;\ntime basis\n. \nFor us, as I said, the majority of our customers are coming from bank products and credit\n&#x2011;\ncard products, so it is vital we unders\ntand their whole credit history, \nnot just whether they borrowed from QuickQuid or Mr Lender\n. I think \nreal progress \nis \nbeing made on that\n. \nGiven that they will be FCA\n&#x2011;\nregulated, the CRAs give us a real opportunity to do something\n about\n that\n. \nReciprocity is key, \nobviously—\nputting data in and getting it out.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: It is helpful to\n note,\n \nfor context, that the OFT report wa\ns\n published\n some time ago\n. \nSince that point, lenders were given a 12-week window in which to put in some additional measures\n. \nWe are still waiting on a response\n from that, but i\nt included affordability checks\n.\nWe are already limiting the number of rollovers, putting in clear costs, reducing the use of con\ntinuous payment authority, putting\n clear cost\ns i\nn adverts, \nand \nworking with debt\n&#x2011;\nadvi\nce agencies\n referring people to\n free debt \nadvice\n. \nAll of those things have happened\n,\n and are happening\n,\n \npost \nthe OFT report\n. \nWhile the OFT report is an important point\n of reference, the industry has\n moved a long way forward since that time.\nWe recently surveyed the customers of the businesses I represent using YouGov\n. \n93% of them said that their lender asked them about their income, employment and other financial details before approving \na\n loan\n. \n90% felt they were offered a fair loan based on the employment and financial information they provided.\n&#xa0;\nQ37 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: There are still significant numbers\n of people,\n even in those surveys\n,\n who feel \nthat \nthey are not going \nthrough the assessment, \nand that is a \nmatter of \nconcern\n. Returning to th\ne OFT figures \nthat \nthe Chairman spoke about earlier, only 23% of people responding to that survey said \nthat \nthey were reassessing at the time of rollover\n. \nThat does seem a matter of concern\n. \nI accept that is \nin the past; it may have improved\n.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: What is going on behind the scenes is not necessarily transparent to the customer either\n. \nThey\n just\n ask whether they can have a rollover.\nMr Walker: This was lenders giving information to the OFT, not customers.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nAnd their answers were b\nased on the way \nthat \nthe question was phrased, \nand \nthe lenders were being honest in the way \nthat \nthey were responding to some of those questions.\n&#xa0;\nQ38 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Coming back to\n the\n point \nthat \nMr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman raised\n, which I think is very important,\n about the transparency of knowing whether people have borrowed, Wonga has said that you pay \na lot of money for data, \nor you invest in data\n. \nDo you not think the industry should be able to pay for a sharing system or some form of database, which shows all the short-term loans that people have out there, so \nthat \nyou can get that greater picture of affordability?\nHenry Raine: \nI think w\ne are working on that\n. Obviously, f\nar be it from me to dictate anything; I am not a member of the industry bodies\n. I think w\ne are working with a number of industry players and Callcredit to develop a system with a recognised CRA.\nAs I said before, if I\n may pick up this\n point, it is more than a payday\n&#x2011;\nlending database\n. \nIt does not mean we should not do it, by the way, but \nthe challenge is that \nwhat we are looking at here is a \nsignificant\n amount of people having other short\n&#x2011;\nterm financial products, which are causing them financial difficulty\n. \nWe need to be able to get hold of as much data as we can\n,\n on a reciprocal basis\n. \nObviously, for the larger lenders, there is a downside: \nthat \nwe are putting more data in and getting less out\n. \nYou may find a situation where\n,\n for some of the smaller lenders\n,\n the economics simply do\nes not work for them \nand the technology does not work\n. \nMr\n&#xa0;\nStevens may have a view on that.\nAndy Lapointe: I participated in a number of meetings with the credit\n&#x2011;\nreporting agencies to get this built and to push it\n,\n so that it does happen\n. \nOne of the advantages of using an actual credit\n&#x2011;\nreporting agency is \nthat \nyou can take account of all types of credit\n. \nThe \nUnited\n&#xa0;\nStates\n has certain databases that only keep track of payday loans\n,\n and they do not k\neep track of log\n&#x2011;\nbook loans or pawn \nloans or instalment loans or anything else.\n&#xa0;\nQ39 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: \nI believe \nCanada\n has quite a developed system in terms of registering loans and sharing that information\n. \nIs that one \nthat \nany of you have looked at?\nAdam Freeman: There is one main \ncredit \nreference agency that the vast majority of lenders use\n. \nI was in a meeting around a year and a half ago when this company was talking about real-time sharing\n. \nAs I said before, the problem we have is that the data could be up to 60 days old, because if you are doing loans towards the end of the month and you have to report at the end of the next month, you basically have to wait 60 days back.\nAbout a year ago, they identified payday loans as a product\n. \nIt received its own code, which was “Advance Against Income” or AAI\n. \nThis is specifically related to payday lending\n. So \nI know if a customer has settled payday\n&#x2011;\nloan accounts before\n, and \nI know if they have any open payday\n&#x2011;\nloan accounts\n. \nYou can choose not to lend to that particular person with open payday loans, but the data is 30 or 60 days old\n. \nIf I knew today \nthat this\n customer has a loan with QuickQuid and Wonga,\n there is no way I\n would lend to them\n. \nAs I said, I like to lend to people who can afford to pay me back\n. \nThere might be a £50 or £100 loan, because they still have £200 disposable income, \nbut \nif I had that information, I would be the first to share it and I would be the first to use it.\n&#xa0;\nQ40 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Improving this information is clearly crucial in making sure \nthat \npeople are\n not \nbeing lent money if they cannot afford it, there are\n still concerns. \nOne of the lines in the OFT report \npicked up on this. It \nsaid that even where bank accounts were being scrutinised and people could\n see fro\nm the bank accounts\n that\n borrowers \nwere \nalready making payments to payday lenders, they were still being given loans\n. \nWould you all accept\n that\n, from your business\n’s\n perspective, this should not happen?\nAdam Freeman: If we knew \nwithin a few days \nthat they had a\nn open loan with another lender\n, we would never lend to them\n. That\n is not a good business model, because you are not going to get your money back.\nAndy Lapointe: That\n is why we prefer using automated systems to using live people reviewing bank statements and documents.\n&#xa0;\nQ41 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: If I may \nturn to the question of rollovers, gentlemen, the three companies before us today have all admitted that they were part of the OFT investigation\n. \nCould you confirm whether you were censured on the issue of rollovers?\nAndy Lapointe: Yes, we were\n. \nAnn McKechin: Mr Freeman?\n Adam Freeman:\n What did you say? \nAnn McKechin: Were you censured on the issue of rollovers by the OFT?\nAdam Freeman: \nWhat do you mean? Are you asking whether we were doing anything \nwrong with them\n, or—? \nAnn McKechin: Did they raise concerns with your company about the issue of rollovers?\nAdam Freeman: No, they did not.\nAnn McKechin: Mr Raine?\nHenry Raine: I am happy to answer that: no\n. \nIf I may say\n—\nit sounds rather pejorative\n—w\nhat the OFT did was\n, they\n investigated the 50 largest payday—\nAnn McKechin: I will come back to that later; thank you very much, Mr\n&#xa0;\nRaine. I have—\nHenry Raine: They investigated the largest\n payday lenders in the market.\nChair: Please do not interrupt a question.\n&#xa0;\nQ42 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: May\n I follow up on an issue \nthat \nMr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman raised\n? \nY\nou stated that you rejected\n a significant number of people\n who applied\n \nto you \nfor \na loan, but in turn, you referred\n a percentage of these to other lenders.\nAdam Freeman: \nC\norrect.\n&#xa0;\nQ43 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: I am \njust\n \nwondering to what extent that commission income is a percentage of your \ntotal turnover.\nAdam Freeman: It is minimal\n. \nIt would probably be less than 1%.\n&#xa0;\nQ44 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Is that \npractice know\nn to any of the other gentleme\nn\n? Is this known amongst the trade members of \nthe two\n associations, or \nto Mr\n&#xa0;\nLapointe and Mr\n&#xa0;\nRaine?\nAdam Freeman: May I intervene\n? \nWe give this to a broker\n. \nWe have cont\nracts behind the scenes, where\n they make sure all of our lenders actually—\nAnn McKechin: I am focusing on the issue about this particular type of trade where you are referring a borrower from one lender to the next and how that is regulated\n. \nI am just trying to clarify that\n. \nAndy Lapointe: The OFT did say that we should change\n certain\n of our processes to make sure \nthat we ga\nve out less rollovers.\nAnn McKechin: \nOkay, but y\nou do offer the alternative of another lender to some of the people who apply.\nAndy Lapointe: No\n.\nAnn McKechin: \nMr\n&#xa0;\nRaine\n?\nHenry Raine: No.\nAnn McKechin: Are either of the two trade associations aware of any of your members being people who refer people \non \nto other lenders?\nGreg Stevens: I have already said that it is a general model in the market\n. I\nf \nsomeone\n do\nes\n not fit their underwri\nting criteria, they will pass that person\n on\n. \nIt is most prevalent in motor finance\n. \nUnderwriting criteria vary massively\n; therefore, \nleads do move around.\n&#xa0;\nQ45 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Mr\n&#xa0;\nHamblin\n&#x2011;\nBoone, the Consumer Finance Association has introduced a limit of three rollovers for loans\n. \nCan you confirm \nthat \nyour members are \ncurrently \n100% compliant?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: They are 100% compliant inasmuch as they are independently monitored\n. \nI cannot confirm\n this; nor could anybody. I imagine that e\nven Marks\n&#xa0;\n&amp;\n&#xa0;\nSpencer could not say that all of their staff were 100% compliant with something\n. But it\n is \nthe\n policy\n. \nIt is independently monitored\n. \nWe do know that the average\n length of a loan of one of my\n members’ customers is now 41 days, which suggests \nthat \nthey are not rolling over their loan anywhere near that\n amount.\n&#xa0;\nQ46 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: \nIf 40\n days is the average, that implies \nthat \nquite a number of \npeople are well over that 40\n days.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: 41 days is the average length.\nAnn McKechin: Yes\n. \nIf you are saying that the bulk pay on time within 30 days\n,\n and the average is 40 days, \nthat would suggest it is\n much longer.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: 85% pay on the due date\n. \nOf the remaining 15%, two\n&#x2011;\nthirds of them roll over their loan at least once\n. \nBased on the 41 days, the majority of them roll over just once.\n&#xa0;\nQ47 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: \nIn respect of when\n a borrower has missed a repayment, \nin their evidence the OFT said, “In our view, \nthis should be \nprima facie\n evidence that the customer is in financial difficulties a\nnd the lending is unsustainable\n”\n.\n Would that be a criterion of analysis\n for\n your independent monitoring?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: As Mr\n&#xa0;\nRaine said, when the original loan product\n \nfirst came to market, \nthere was no\n ability to extend the loan\n. \nThere are all sorts of reasons for rollovers\n. \nWhether this is due to late payments, people not getting the cheques through or people needing to delay their payments in order to pay other debts that are more priority debts, we need to have the flexibility to grant people at least one or two extensions.\n&#xa0;\nQ48 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: The specific question I am asking is\n whether, \nif someone has missed a repayment, according to the OFT, that would be \nprima facie\n evidence \nthat \nthe lending is unsustainable.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nNo, \nI disagree.\n&#xa0;\nQ49 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: If someone comes to you and says, “I have missed a repayment,” would they automatically then be allowed to roll over?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nNot automatically;\n nobody is allowed to roll over automatically\n. \nIt is important that there is some flexibility for \na short\n&#x2011;\nterm loan,\n and \nthat \nwe do not immediately put someone into default, affect their credit score and not give them any options.\n&#xa0;\nQ50 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: You are carrying out this independent analysis\n. \nPresumably, you have only just started\n,\n so the figures will not yet be available\n. But \nif you are starting it, \npresumably \nyou will be able to find out on how m\nany occasions, and for\n \nwhat \npercentage of people\n,\n \nloans \nare ro\nlled over on the basis that \na payment\n has been missed, so you w\nill be able to provide those statistics in the p\nublic domain in the near future. Would that be the case?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: People missing a payment would be contacted by the lender.\nAnn McKechin: No, I am asking \nthat \nyou reveal the actual figures of how many missed repayments then roll over, so we can have an indication of how many of these loans would be deemed, \nprima facie\n, to be unsustainable.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: If someone misses a payment and the lender makes contact with them\n,\n or they make contact with the lender and say\n,\n “My circumstances have changed,” “I have lost my job,” “My partner has left me,” or whatever it may be, that person \nis deemed to be in financial difficulty.\n&#xa0;\nQ51 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: \nOkay, so y\nou are not going to provide this evidence.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: That person is deemed to be in financial difficulty\n. \nIn that circumstance\n, that\n definition does apply\n. \nWe will immediately freeze the—\nAnn McKechin: I am not asking how you deal with the process\n. \nI am asking how you record the process and how you are transparent about the process, Mr\n&#xa0;\nHamblin\n&#x2011;\nBoone\n. \nThank you very\n much for that.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: You have asked me to define whether one rollover is someone in financial difficulty or not\n. \nIn some circumstances, it absolutely is and we take action\n. \nIn other circumstances, there\n is a reason they want to extend\n the loan\n that \nis not financial difficulty.\n&#xa0;\nQ52 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: \nSo y\nou do not think the OFT can work out what is and is not financially unsustainable and what is and is not financial difficulty.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: The OFT report was some time ago.\nChair: May I intervene at this point\n? \nWe are short of time\n. \nYou will have the opportunity, if you feel \nthat \nyou need to add to any response you have given, to do it in the form of supplementary written evidence after this \ni\nnquiry\n. \nIt will be taken into con\nsideration when we produce our R\neport\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ53 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: According to the OFT, 17 lenders actively promoted rollovers in marketing material at the point of sale\n,\n and 15 proactively alerted customers to the rollover \noptions prior to the loan due \ndate\n. \nDo any of you support those practices\n? \nIf not, how ca\nn that\n promotion be stopped effectively?\nAndy Lapointe: QuickQuid does not promote rollovers\n,\n and our call\n&#x2011;\ncentre representatives are not allowed to present rollovers\n. \nWe do qu\nality assurance monitoring to make \nsure \nthat \nthey are not doing so.\nAdam Freeman: \nS\name here\n, with us. \nBefore the OFT, we did actively promote\n them, but since the OFT review and audits,\n we do not actively promote them.\nHenry Raine: Our practice has never b\neen that. In monitoring, a\ns Andy says, one of the key issues is looking at call\n&#x2011;\ncentre training\n—t\nhat is a challenge for all of us—as well as what is on the website\n. \nOf course, t\nhere is no \none here from the storefront sector, so we do not know what goes on in terms of people going into stores.\n&#xa0;\nQ54 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: What is your \ncompany’s policy on limiting the number of rollovers?\nHenry Raine: \nWe have always had a limit of three\n, and as I say, less than one in 15 ever extend a Wonga loan once.\n&#xa0;\nQ55 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: Mr Stevens, we all want to get rid of the unsavoury element to your business, which we all know exists\n, and it seems to me the reference area that you referred to, saying that it was reasonably widespread, is a \nway of \nsort of \noperating outside of the charter for some people\n. \nDo you accept that particular point?\nGreg Stevens: \nI think people who are—\nMr Binley: \nIt is a simple question: yes or no?\nGreg Stevens: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ56 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: You do ac\ncept the point. Then let me ask you this: if you do feel that there is a loophole here, where \npeople \nare operating\n in a way \nthat all of us, you included, would not want to happen, h\now might we close that loophole?\nGreg Stevens: As an industry, \nwe have been trying to close several loopholes, certainly with regard to lead-generators, who are not \nunder the OFT\n. \nOne of the problems is \nthat \nthe marketplace \nexists on the leads being generated. It \ndepends on \nthe acquisition of those leads to drive the business forward. I\n do not think enough credit is being given \nin terms of the work the OFT has done and the work that is going to be done by the FCA. Even the actual consultation report from the FCA \nwill drive people from the business\n. You will get the thing you want.\n&#xa0;\nQ57 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nFine; wonderful, but \nyou have already admitted that the loophole exists\n. It is surely in the interests of the decent side of the business to close that loophole. \nIt is also within your area of action to ensure \nthat \nyour memb\ners do not operate in that way. \nI repeat my question: what will you do \nto ensure that the loophole that you say exists is closed from the \nperspective\n of your membership\n?\nGreg Stevens: \nWith regard to the worst cases, w\ne have reported thos\ne organisations to the Ministry\n&#xa0;\nof\n&#xa0;\nJustice\n. \nIt comes back to \nthe fact that those companies are not regulated by a regulator that covers consumer credit. This is where a lot of the problems occur. I\nf you go on\n \nto the \ninternet, \nthe first \nfew pages of websites are lead-generators; they are \nnot lenders\n. That is how consumers get confused.\n&#xa0;\nQ58 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: Why do you not simply get your members to outlaw the \npractice?\nGreg Stevens: \nIn what way do you mean?\nMr Binley: \nIn terms of referrals. Why do you not simply say, “It \nis outside o\nf the remit of this association; if you are a member of this association, we do not think you should be involved in that particular process”?\nGreg Stevens:\n I am talking about acquisitions.\nMr Binley: \nI am talking about something else.\nGreg Stevens:\n I am not talking about referrals.\n&#xa0;\nQ59 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nI want you to recognise that y\nou are a trade body and have\n some role in policing the well\nbeing of the trade\n. \nYou have admitted \nthat \nthere is a loophole in terms of the referral system\n. \nWhy do you not \ntake action and ensure your members are not involved in \nany referrals, so that we know \nthat \nthe company we are dealing with does not pass information \non \nto companies that do not act as credibly as \nyour members do?\nGreg Stevens: It happens in every market. This \nis not specifically about payday lending\n. I have already made the point twice: e\nverybody has their own unique underwriting criteria.\n&#xa0;\nQ60 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: You are being very evasive. Why do you not simply say that you can or cannot act as a better regulator, as an association, \nin this respect?\nGreg Stevens: \nAs I have said before, w\ne are not a regulator\n; we are a trade association.\nChair: \nI think w\ne have probably pursued this line\n. \nWe understand \nyou are not taking responsibility for that, and we may wish to comment on that.\n&#xa0;\nQ61 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: You were asked by my colleague, \nAnn\n&#xa0;\nMcKechin, about the OFT and censure. O\nnly QuickQuid said \nthat they had to change the criteria for rollover \nprocedures\n. To Adam and Henry, have you had \nto \nchange anything since the OFT investigation into your businesses?\nAdam Freeman: \nWe did change the rollover process after the OFT investigation.\n&#xa0;\nQ62 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nSo the OFT investigation found that \nyo\nu were basically behaving badly and you had to change.\nAdam Freeman: \nNo, it was not badly. \nNo\n \none \nactually \ntold us what to do at any point\n, so I would not say we behaved badly. We did what we did as a business. \nAt the beginning, we were assessing people on \naffordability over two or three months, because that is what we were doing. T\nhe OFT \nca\nme in and \nsaid, “You have to do it on your own merits. If someone wants to \nroll ove\nr, at the\n point of rolling over \nyou have to assess their affordability then.”\nWe spent a lot of money on \nsystem changes and \nstaff \ntraining\n,\n and we changed our process\n. One of the options is, “I am in financial difficulty and cannot afford to repay in full”. That is literally an option on a drop\n&#x2011;\ndown\n menu. \nAs soon as that happens, we will not \nroll over that customer. We will put them on a frozen\n&#x2011;\ninterest payment plan and work with them over a month, three months, six months or a year—whatever works for them.\n&#xa0;\nQ63 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: Is that the onl\ny change you were asked to make by the OFT?\nAdam Freeman: There were about 30\n. Some were tiny text changes. We had to make our representative APR\n slightly bigger\n. I have to say that I was surprised at the opening comment, because I think the \nOFT have done \nquite a good job. \nI have seen people exit the market that should exit the market\n. I am all for regulation.\n&#xa0;\nQ64 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nCould you let the Committee have those 30 things you have had to change?\nAdam Freeman: Yes, of course, \nif I am allowed to share\n them\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ65 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nHenry, did you have to make any changes following the OFT report?\nHenry Raine: \nYes. \nCan I just make \none comment?\nNadhim Zahawi: \nBefore you make it, could you say whether you had to make any changes? \nHenry Raine: \nYes, w\ne \nhad to make a number of changes to our website.\n&#xa0;\nQ66 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nWhat were those changes?\nHenry Raine: \nThey were about more disclosure. There were some issues about the size of the APR on various \npages\n. \nMost of the OFT work with us was more on \nthe information-gathering side, i.e. they \nwanted to \nunderstand more about how we do certain things, which was very helpful.\n&#xa0;\nQ67 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nI understand what they wanted to understand, but what were the changes they asked you to make?\nHenry Raine: \nWe had to highlight risk factors slightly higher up on our home page, and other things like that.\n&#xa0;Q68 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: \nW\nill you let us have \nthose changes that you made?\nChair: Could you submit, in written evidence, details of the changes that you had to make, arising from the \nOFT?\nHenry Raine: \nYes. A\nssuming \nthat \nthe OFT is happy with that\n, of course\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ69 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nStill on the issue of rollovers, Mr\n&#xa0;\nRaine, you described a rather benign process where \nyou would not have dreamt of having rollovers if it was not for customer demand. There is a question here, is there not? Actually, a\nt the point where people are unable to pay, you do no\nt need to roll over their loan, doubling their interest and imposing a punitive penalty charge. You have an option of sitting down with them and saying, “You are clearly in financial difficulty. Shouldn’t we \nnegotiate an afford\nable repayment plan?”\nHenry Raine: \nFirst of all, we do not double their interest. \nPeople can choose to extend\n; we do not force them to extend and always credit-check them again before approving an extension. \nLess than \none in 15 people ever do. In the majority of cases like that, people are able to reschedule their debt and make an online repayment. \nFor some people, an extension suits them \nbetter. It may be that they are getting the money.\n&#xa0;\nQ70 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nIn what way are they suited by having a penalty charge for rolling over their loan?\nHenry Raine: It may be that we have people who are sole traders, who are \ngetting the money next week, \nwho would rather pay us and delay payment for a few days rather than go on to a \nrepayment plan.\n&#xa0;\nQ71 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: Do you perhaps understand why people are \nmore likely to listen to the OFT’s concern that a \nhigh\ner\n proportion of profitability \nin your business actually \ncomes from\n rolled-over loans than those that are repaid within the\n original terms?\nHenry Raine: \nI agree. One of the—the number of the—\nPaul Blomfield: You agree with that.\nHenry Raine: \nNo. T\nhe OFT’s point was \nthat in some cases 50% of revenue wa\ns derived from rollovers\n. In Wonga’s case, because only one in 15 ever roll over—\nPaul Blomfield: \nMr\n&#xa0;\nRaine, you keep trying to distinguish Wonga from the rest of the sector.\nHenry Raine: \nI can only answer on behalf of Wonga.\n&#xa0;\nQ72 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nYou certainly can. \nWhy were you \ncensured by the OFT as well, then?\nHenry Raine: \nOn rollovers? We were not.\nPaul Blomfield: \nNo, but in general, in terms of your business model and your conduct. \nHenry Raine:\n \nWe were not censured. No \none has been censured by the OFT\n. We have been asked to make various changes. \nThe 50 t\nop lenders were all visited by the OFT. All of us have been asked to make changes. It is not a case of censure. \n&#xa0;\nQ73 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nNo, but your practice was criticised.\nHenry Raine: No, we were asked to make changes to various things.\n&#xa0;\nQ74 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nPresumably, that was because your practice was not \nsufficiently good\n,\n i\nn terms of the OFT’s assessment in the first place.\nHenry Raine: \nThat is an open issue that we still have with them. But m\nany of the changes they recommended \nwere not about censure; they were about making things clearer for customers.\n&#xa0;\nQ75 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nTo go back to my original point, y\nou are saying that rollovers are there to assist the customer\n. \nWould it not be \nof more assistance to a customer in financial crisis to sit down and say, “You are in difficulty; let’s have an affordable repayment plan,” rather than punitive additional interest and a penalty charge?\nHenry Raine: \nOf course we agree with that, which is why we have a whole hardship plan.\n&#xa0;\nQ76 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: It is not what you do, is it? \nHenry Raine: Less than \none in 15\n people ever get an extension from Wonga\n. The vast majority of people who cannot pay back their loan move on to a repayment plan. \nThere are some people \nfor whom an extension obviously works, and that is a \nsmall minority\n.\nIf I may say so, i\nn terms of rollov\ners and extensions, Wonga is in a very different position from the rest of the sector. \nI cannot answer on behalf of the \nrest of the sector.\nAdam Freeman: \nMay I jump in? Just because someone rolls over a loan, it does not mean that they are in financial difficulties. It is circumstantial.\n&#xa0;\nQ77 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: Do you think they \nwould voluntarily want to take on the punitive additional charges if they were able to afford to repay?\nAdam Freeman: It is like a cred\nit card. You get a credit card bill through for £500. In that month you have had to buy some food and clothes, so\n you cannot clear your credit card\n. You are going to pay £250 plus interest. \nJust because someone rolls over a loan, it does not mean \nthat \nth\ney are in financial difficulty.\nThis is on behalf of Mr\n&#xa0;\nLender. \nIf that customer \nis saying, “I cannot afford to pay this loan in full this month or next month, because I have \nlost my job,\n” we are \nnot going to roll over that loan\n. We are not going to charge any interest. There will be no more fees.\n&#xa0;\nQ78 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nWhat about Mr\n&#xa0;\nLender’s friends?\nAdam Freeman: Exactly, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ79 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nMay\n I press\n all of you\n on the issue of rollovers\n? The FCA are proposing a limit of two rollovers. Do you agree with that: simply yes or no?\nAdam Freeman: \nIt is detrimental to the consumer. You need to give the consumer the option. \n&#xa0;\nQ80 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: Would the option of an affordable repayment plan not be better?\nAdam Freeman: It is circumstantial and you cannot predict your circumstances in the future.\n \nThey might need\n one, two or three months, where they are low on cash, to pay it back. J\nust because someone has rolled over, \nit does not mean they cannot pay capital towards their loan as well. They do not have to pay you the interest. They might say, “Mr\n&#xa0;\nLender, we are g\noing to pay you £50 capital and the pro rata interest.” It is not an additional charge; it is pro rata interest.\n&#xa0;\nQ81 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: If you roll over a £100 payday loan just three times, you are paying about \n£120 in interest alone\n. In what way is that in the interest of the consumer?\nAdam Freeman: \nIt is £75, actually. It is £25 per £100. If it is a good customer and they are our friends, it is £20—it is £20, £20, £20, which is £60.\n&#xa0;\nQ82 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nI have allowed you to distract me, Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman. My question is whether \nyou each accept\ned\n the \nrecommendation of the FCA for a two\n&#x2011;\nrollover limit. Your answer was no, Mr\n&#xa0;\nFreeman. What do other members of the panel say?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nWe are looking at the \ndata of our members\n’ customers. As I said, t\nhe average loan there is 41 days\n. \nWe have not \nreached a position yet, but there is an \nindication that \ntwo \nrollovers may be \nan option.\nGreg Stevens: The figure is arbitrary; we do not know how they have arrived at it. Obviously, we are in the middle of the consultation\n&#x2011;\nresponse\n period, and we are asking for more information. Our view has been the same right the way through: in \ncertain cases, one rollover is too many\n. It is about looking at affordability. Affordability is the question that should be asked, not the number of rollovers.\nAndy Lapointe: \nQuickQuid has a limit of two.\nHenry Raine: T\nhis is \nnot the big issue, frankly, in terms of how the industry needs to be regulated.\n&#xa0;\nQ83 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: If \nthe limit of two is introduced, \nwhat guarantees can you give and what procedures will you put in place to ensure that debt that might otherwise be rolled over is not \nsimply repackaged as a new loan?\nHenry Raine: In Wonga’s case, y\nou cannot get a new loan until you have paid off your old one\n. We will not be repackaging anything at all. You can check the website. Of course, the FCA will be able to investigate all of this so that it does not happen.\nAndy Lapointe: The FCA’s guidance says that \nthey are not just going to be a tick\n&#x2011;\nbox regulator\n. What they are saying is, “I\nf \nthe outcome is bad, it does not matter how good your processes were.” That would fall into that bucket, and we would have to \ndesign our \nloan \nproducts accordingly.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nThe consultation makes clear that this applies to rollovers and refinancing.\n&#xa0;\nQ84 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nI would like to quote what the charter says about advertising, but it does not say anything about it at all. \nCould I have your views on whether there should b\ne something about advertising in it?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nAs I said, t\nhe charter commitments are incorporated into a broad\ner code of practice that we use. I\nt requires the lenders to comply with all \nof \nthe marketing and advertising \nlaws that exist. We work very closely with the Advertising\n&#xa0;\nStandards\n&#xa0;\nAuthority, and we have just \nset up some workshop\ns with them to work on how short\n&#x2011;\nterm lenders should be \nmarketing and what their adverts should look like. \nCustomers are in control of marketing, fo\nr example. They can opt out of marketing. \nWe will not \nallow people to be spammed.\nMike Crockart: \nI will come on to marketing in a minute; I am talking about advertising.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nThe other point to make about adverts is that n\nobody buys directly from an advert\n. \nAn advert will \ndirect you to a website, and there is a lot of information—all of the information you need.\n&#xa0;\nQ85 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nYou will be directed to a website, \nwhich the OFT has described \nlike this: “Most websites made claims we consider \npotentially misleading\n”. The information on the website is not going to be the best.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone:\n The OFT report was some time ago. A\ns \nMr\n&#xa0;\nRaine has pointed out, he has made changes to his website and, as the other lenders have pointed out, \nthey have\n made changes to their website. They look very different to when that report was written.\nMike Crockart: \nThere are no more examples of things like, “No credit checks,” or, “No credit, no problem,” or, “Loan guaranteed, no questions asked”.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ86 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: None of you would have \nanything like that on your website. There are still things out there like that, are there not?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nThere absolutely are. \nWhen we find them, we report them to the regulator.\n&#xa0;\nQ87 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nI have had a look at particular websites this morning. The OFT talked about\n \none of the most misleading things being\n the promise of\n money within a very short time, which effectively was a marketing ploy. All \nthree of the companies represented today \nadvertise\n, in quite prominent places on all three, the fact \nthat loans can be made \nwithin \nfive or 10 \nminutes\n.\nAndy Lapointe: That is from approval\n. \nIf someone \ncomes in to apply for a loan and they require manual checking, it might take us three hours to \nclear them\n. \nThe five minutes is indicating \nfrom the time that they are approved.\nMike Crockart: \nAbsolutely, so let us look at the QuickQuid website, where, \nin \nthe largest text, at the top, it says, “Cash sent within 10 minutes after approval” \nand there is a little \nstrange symbol beside it. If we go down to the FlexCredit part, it says, “Get cash sent within 10 minutes of approval”, and there is the same strange symbol. It says, “Short-term loans, g\net cash sent \nwithin 10 minutes after approval”, and there is another symbol. You have to go right down to the bottom and look in really small text,\n in the midst of \nlots of other little symbols, to find out what that means. Is that a \nfair way of portraying things?\nAndy Lapointe: Our responsibility is to do the credit checks\n. \nSome of the credit \nchecks are done quickly; some customers have red flags in the approval process, which means they remain there for manual processing.\n \nThis is something we have to do.\n \nIt is accurate of our processes.\n \nI am not going\n to say the OFT approved that; it \nwas one of the things that we changed in light of the OFT review.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nWe are talking about speed of delivery there. \nWhen you are transferring money \nelectronically, you can do it \nvery quickly\n. If you apply for a credit card, the \napplication process \nwould \nbe as long as \nif you were applying for a short\n&#x2011;\nterm loan. The difference would be that you have to wait a few weeks for your \ncredi\nt card to come through, as opposed to lenders, who are able to transfer money directly.\n&#xa0;\nQ88 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: For all three of the companies represented here, which you are saying are at the better end of the scale of \npayday lenders, the speed of getting the money is a major \nselling point.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: That is the value of the product\n. In fact, the London\n&#xa0;\nMutual\n&#xa0;\ncredit\n&#xa0;\nunion has just invested in technology in order to be able to get money into people’s accounts quickly, \nrecognising that\n,\n if you need to get your washing machine repaire\nd or you need a short\n&#x2011;\nterm loan urgently, you do not \nwant to wait to apply for a credit card, because you need the money now. It is what the circumstances demand, and that is why even the \ncredit unions are \nrecognising that this is a need of the customer and a value of the loan.\nChair: It is completely misleading to make a comparison with credit unions, where you have to be a member\n and there will be \nsome record of that person’s creditworthiness and credit history, \ncompared to the approach that is used by payday lenders\n. \nRussell Hamblin-Boone: \nNo. C\nredit unions do not \ndo the level of checks that we do. Some of them do have longer\n&#x2011;\nterm relationships with customers, but, with respect, Mr\n&#xa0;\nChairman, I was not making that point\n. I was making the point that t\nhe process of delivery \nof the product, based on speed, is something the credit unions—\nChair: \nW\nith respect to you, I do not think the process of delivery is really the \nissue at stake. It is the lack of examination of creditworthiness there and the use of this that is made \nin marketing.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: The question was\n, “How quickly after approval can the money go into the account?” That is \nwhat the lenders advertise.\nAdam Freeman: \nWhen the OFT came to us earlier in the year, this was one of the main things they said. I would not say it was their recommendation, but everything forward\n&#x2011;\nfacing was \nbeing audited. We have got to a place where we have been told\n that \nthis is what we are allowed to put across. We\n are only doing what we are allowed to do.\n&#xa0;\nQ89 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: \nWe are running over quite a bit. I will try to keep my questions short, but if you could keep your answers even shorter, that would be great. \nObviously, \nwith \nusing the speed of getting the money as a tool to draw people in comes the recommendation or regulation that you have to promote the APR as prominently as you possibly can.\n \nLooking at Wonga’s website this morning, it is there: 5,853% APR.\n \nMr\n&#xa0;\nLender, you manage to beat that with 4,849% APR.\n \nInterestingly\n, QuickQuid, you need to have a serious look at your website, because the page which launches and fills the window is not actually the full page. To get to the point where you see the APR, you have to resize.\nAndy Lapointe: What is the system of that device that you are using?\nMike Crockart: It is an iPad. It is a fairly well-used thing you might have heard of.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: You have not asked the lenders how much the customer has to pay, because I think that is probably more important than the APR.\nMike Crockart: The regulation is to do with the promotion of the APR, so that is what I am dealing with at the moment.\nAndy Lapointe: Our intention with putting it on the side there is that it would be easy for the customer to see, because there are devices that cut off the bottom. If you put it on the bottom, people do not see it. That was placed there for prominence.\n&#xa0;\nQ90 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: It is not, then, a deliberate attempt to hide it from customers.\nAndy Lapointe: No. Every time that I have seen that screen, that is right there, rather than having to pan down to the bottom, which is more common, especially on handheld devices.\nMike Crockart: Perhaps I can show you this afterwards and you can take it away and deal with it.\nAndy Lapointe: No, I trust what you are saying.\n&#xa0;\nQ91 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: If we can turn then to the calling that you do, which is a particular interest of mine, first of all looking at existing customers, do you follow any guidelines? You have the right to phone them. You have a relationship with them. It is a first-party consent that you will have received from them. Do you have any guidelines about the way in which you contact them, the number of calls that you make over a period of time, or where you phone them? We have heard some fairly horrendous stories about people being hounded by large numbers of calls, sometimes made to places of work. Do you have guidelines that you follow about the contact that you have with your customers?\nAdam Freeman: Again, since the OFT—we were quite good beforehand—if we phone a customer and the customer says, “Do not phone me at work,” we will not phone the customer at work again—period. We are not allowed to. It is treating the customer fairly. If a customer says, “Do not call me at work,” we will say, “Do you have an alternative number?” or an e-mail address or something, but we are not allowed to contact that customer at work again.\n&#xa0;\nQ92 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: What about the number of calls that you would make to them?\nAdam Freeman: We would only need to say \nthat once, would we not?\nMike Crockart: No, I mean generally, not about phoning them at work.\nAdam Freeman: You would only need to say it once to the customer, so I do not know how many times they have to phone.\n \nIt is probably once or twice; I do not know.\n&#xa0;\nQ93 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Again, we had some fairly horrendous stories about people being phoned 10 times a day to be chased for payments.\nAdam Freeman: Yes, but we would not phone someone 10 times a day.\n&#xa0;\nQ94 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: That is why I am asking. Do you have any guidelines?\nAdam Freeman: Yes, treating the customer fairly. That is not fair, so we would not do that.\n&#xa0;\nQ95 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Treating the customer fairly can be taken to mean a number of different things. Do you have guidelines?\nAdam Freeman: Yes, we have policies and guidelines\n in place, of course. I can send those to you as well afterwards, because I think they will be quite helpful.\nMike Crockart: That is great.\nHenry Raine: We do not \nhave people’s employment details.\n \nWe do not have a way of contacting them at work.\n \nThere are regulations, which I am afraid I am not entirely on top of, that we follow about when you can call people, what times during the day you can call them, and what happens.\n \nThe vast majority of our interaction is online with customers, because that is how they have come to us, so we do not have a lot of phone contact.\n&#xa0;\nQ96 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: When you say that there\n are guidelines, are you talking about your guidelines or the guidelines of someone else?\nHenry Raine: No, the debt collection guidance of the OFT, which we all follow. I am afraid I do not know it, but it is all part of our systems, and I suspect the other lenders’ too. That stipulates how you can contact people and how often, and also, I think, only in certain hours of the day. If people are being contacted by lenders or by representatives outside those hours, then it is clearly in breach of the OFT guidelines, but, as I say, we do not do it.\n&#xa0;\nQ97 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: If I can turn to generating new customers, what do you do in terms of cold-calling? Do any of your organisations cold-call to find new customers?\nHenry Raine: No.\nAndy Lapointe: No.\n&#xa0;\nQ98 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Do you use lead-generators to come up with new customers?\nAdam Freeman: Yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ99 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: You cold-call by proxy, then, effectively.\nAdam Freeman: No, we never cold-call. We never cold-call new business.\n&#xa0;\nQ100 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: If you are using lead-generators, you are effectively cold-calling, but getting somebody else to do the hard work.\nAdam Freeman: No, not at all. This is all online. Sorry, maybe there is confusion. This is online lead generations, where someone has gone to a broker’s website and applied for a loan, and we have purchased that lead. That customer knows they are a Mr Lender customer. It is not a cold call. We know that they are a customer. We can facilitate them.\n&#xa0;\nQ101 &#xa0; \nChair: May I just suggest, where you have guidelines, can you send them to the Committee for them to examine, and we can make a judgment on them?\nAdam Freeman: Definitely.\nMr Binley: Sorry, Mr Chairman, may I add: we do not want your rules; we want your talk guides as they appear on the screen and we want continuation lines.\nAdam Freeman: Yes, of course.\nChair: If we are not satisfied with what they cover, then we will come back to you.\n&#xa0;\nQ102 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: Do you use texts in your marketing, to new or existing customers?\nAdam Freeman: We would never randomly text somebody, “Do you need a loan? Come to Mr Lender.” No, we have never purchased lists or done anything like that.\nHenry Raine: We do not text people as a way of getting business. The day before payment date, we will use a text to text them to say, “Just to remind you that your money is due,” so it is not a PPI-type situation where we are all getting texts the whole time. We do not do any of that.\nAndy Lapointe: You would have to opt in to receive texts from us.\n&#xa0;\nQ103 &#xa0; \nChair: On that issue, you will know that, on “Newsnight” last night, there was an example of somebody, I think, being texted for a loan during the course of an evening. Are you saying that that does not apply to Wonga?\nHenry Raine: Yes. I am sorry; I did not see “\nNewsnight\n” but no, as far as I am aware—if I am wrong, I will confirm to the Committee—we do not do text-marketing.\nChair: I think that needs to be clarified, and if you could send evidence that would clarify that, I think the Committee would be grateful.\nHenry Raine: I can confirm it or not.\n&#xa0;\nQ104 &#xa0; \nRebecca Harris: I just want to talk about what the current industry practice is around continuous payment authorities. We had a bit of a discussion earlier on about the 3% who default and whether they were the people who were caused real pain. Some of the evidence we have seen is that it is people who have money taken through continuous payment authority who suffer the real pain and who have, therefore, defaulted on their mortgage or been unable to pay a utility bill. My first question is: why do you use continuous payment authorities rather than other forms of payment?\nAndy Lapointe: The simple answer is that, with a continuous payment authority, if a customer has a failed payment, they do not have any penalty. Their bank is not going to charge them a fee. If you use a BACS payment or a cheque, and that is returned, the customer is charged a fee. That is the primary reason why a continuous payment authority is a good thing for the customer for collections.\n&#xa0;\nQ105 &#xa0; \nRebecca Harris: Are you aware of any better alternatives to a continuous payment authority?\nAdam Freeman: I do not think there is. If you do it properly, it is a good way and it works. I think it is the best way.\n&#xa0;\nQ106 &#xa0; \nRebecca Harris: For the lenders or for the customer?\nAdam Freeman: Both—for the consumer. I think there is a massive misunderstanding about CPA. There is a technical issue there, going back to the roots of Visa. You cannot just dip into someone’s account and take 50 lots of £5 to get £250 from them on a day when the loan is not due, so I think there is a big misunderstanding or misconception of what CPA actually is. It is a date where you agree with the customer to take a payment from them. As long as you are transparent with that, it is perfect for the product, and both the consumer and the lender, if used properly.\nAndy Lapointe: You can cancel a CPA at any time. We have a 24/7 call centre, which is open 365 days a year. You can call them up and they will cancel it at your demand. You can also cancel it by e-mail at our company, so it is not something where people are just stuck or trapped using it. They do receive a notice ahead of time that we are going to be debiting, so it should not be a surprise and it does give them the option to cancel.\n&#xa0;\nQ107 &#xa0; \nRebecca Harris: Are you confident that customers are pre\n&#x2011;\nnotified, do know when money is going to be taken and have an opportunity to contact you?\nAdam Freeman: I do not think it is about the CPA; it is about the transparency. This is going to be a bit of a problem with the FCA as well, because I think they are preliminarily saying you can have two CPAs. Personally, I think that is detrimental to the borrower, because you do not know when a borrower is going to get paid their money. They might say that, on 31 October, they are going to earn an income of £1,500. You do not know whether that company is going to pay them at 1 o’clock in the morning or 3 o’clock in the morning; you do not know. If you try to take that money from the customer at, say, 1 o’clock in the morning and it fails, you cannot then, with what the FCA are putting out there initially, try to get that money from the customer, so that customer is now going to become a defaulting customer because you cannot take the money from the customer.\nThis is why there is confusion with the CPA. If I tried 10 times that day to get £250 from that customer as £250, what is the difference to the customer? There is no detrimental effect to them. It is not costing them anything. It is not costing us. I have said, ‘On this date, 31 October, I am going to take £250 from you.’ Why should it be that they are the ones that cop out from that because the FCA have said you only get one attempt, and I try at 3 in the morning? A percentage of our customers will not get paid until the following day, because they work for a small company with one person on payroll who is off ill. They are now a defaulting customer. Do we report them to the credit reference agencies as a default? There is a large grey area. We will never—and never have done—go into an account and take seven lots of £50. We will take £350 or we will take the interest amount. I think that is an area that really needs to be looked upon and studied properly, because it is more detrimental to the consumer than the lender.\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: If there are insufficient funds for priority debts like mortgages or rent or council tax, or things like that, the lender will not go into the account. If they do go into the account and it has caused somebody difficulty like that, there is the option to refund. If it is proven that it has put someone in financial difficulty, they will refund the money immediately.\n&#xa0;\nQ108 &#xa0; \nChair: Has that happened?\nRebecca Harris: Yes, has that happened in practice?\nRussell Hamblin-Boone: Yes, that happens in practice. We asked customers a slightly different question to recent surveys. We asked them, “Did the lender explain to you how your bank details would be used to take the money from your account?” 85% of those people said that that was a clear explanation.\n&#xa0;\nQ109 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: Very quickly, on the Chair’s point, the industry’s code says very clearly that if people do get into financial difficulties as a result of a CPA, you will refund them. You said that happens. Would it be possible for you all to furnish the Committee with detailed information of how often that happens? We have all, in our constituency surgeries, had lots of examples of people who have presented with problems as a result of CPA administration. If you could all give us full details of how often you have refunded customers and how often your members have refunded customers as a result of financial difficulties they have created.\nHenry Raine: Of course. I think the issue there also is about them contacting the lender. Clearly, that is the other thing, which is why we work very closely with a lot of the debt-advice charities, because they have to make contact with the lender to establish that.\n&#xa0;\nQ110 &#xa0; \nChair: We will be talking to them. May I thank you for answering our questions? May I just emphasise that we could probably have spent three hours on this session? We have been constrained by time. It is almost certain that we will want to table supplementary questions to you, and we would welcome your responses and we will take them into account before we do our Report with its recommendations. Equally, I am conscious of the fact that you may feel that you have not had the opportunity to answer in full every question that has been put to you; feel free to submit anything in terms of supplementary evidence. I would say, anyway, that you can do this but I would emphasise that a number of issues have been raised where we have not felt that you have had the evidence that this Committee would require to come to a robust conclusion, and we would expect you to provide that evidence as we requested. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nExamination of WitnessesWitnesses:\n \nGillian Guy, Chief Executive, Citizens Advice, \nMartin Lewis, moneysavingexpert.com, \nPeter Tutton, Head of Policy, StepChange, and \nRichard Lloyd, Executive Director, Which?, gave evidence.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ111 &#xa0; \nChair: Good morning, and thank you for agreeing to address the Committee’s questions. I apologise for having you in rather later than intended, but I felt it was important to explore some of the issues with the previous panel. Could I just, first of all, ask you to introduce yourself for voice transcription purposes, starting with you, Gillian?\nGillian Guy: Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice.\nMartin Lewis: Martin Lewis of moneysavingexpert.com.\nPeter Tutton: Peter Tutton, Head of Policy at StepChange Debt Charity.\nRichard Lloyd: Richard Lloyd, Executive Director of Which?\n&#xa0;\nQ112 &#xa0; \nChair: We are short of time, so do not feel that all of you have to answer every question, if you feel that the issue has been covered by another speaker. I am going to start with a general principle: are you against payday loans in principle or just the way they work? Who would like to lead on that?\nRichard Lloyd: I am happy to kick off on that, if colleagues agree. I am not against people having access to short-term emergency loans that are provided on the basis of proper affordability checks and where the cost of that is absolutely clear and fair. People do need and often say to us that they sometimes are in need of that kind of credit. They are sometimes able to manage that credit properly and it is not a problem. It is for the vast majority of people for whom payday lending is a problem—in our surveys, half—\n&#xa0;\nQ113 &#xa0; \nChair: Okay. I just wanted to establish your general position on this. You will get plenty of chance to elaborate.\nGillian Guy: I absolutely agree with Richard, but what we do not agree with is that people are force-fed this opportunity when it is not necessarily the solution to their problems, and they should be directed towards debt advice.\nChair: Thank you, but you agree that there is a place in the market for them.\nMartin Lewis: They struggle to have a place. The advertising, marketing, operational structures, cost and the inappropriate way they are sold are all problems for me. People often say, “There is a time for a payday loan.” I find that very difficult when there are not alternative, cheaper forms of credit. There are two big problems, if we divide it this way: first of all, there are many people who take payday loans when they do not know how they will repay them in a month. If you do not know how you will repay it in a month, it is not for you, so let us wipe those people out first of all, or get rid of those; that is quite easy.\nPoint No. 2: the people who take payday loans and can repay them in a month. My suggestion—forgive me sounding a bit daytime television, but that is what I do—is you get a credit card, even a horrible 56% interest credit card. You put it in a bowl of water and put it in your freezer. Then, when you need it, you are going to have to smash it open, and if you pay that back in a month, which is what payday lenders want, you do not pay any interest on it, so it is interest-free. So when you ask me to answer, on a nerdy basis, “On what occasions is a payday loan the right choice for someone?” I struggle to give you a right answer. So do we really need them? I think we would all be a lot better off without them, and maybe it is worth the sacrifice for the small number of people who do find them rather convenient.\nRichard Lloyd: Could I just add, Chair, there are some credit unions that are now offering payday loans, so we need to be focused on the product—not necessarily the institution but the behaviour of the different kinds of lenders that are offering short-term, high-cost credit.\n&#xa0;\nQ114 &#xa0; \nChair: There are a variety of opinions there but, in effect, Richard, there is a role for them but the process is what is wrong. Would that be a reasonable summary?\nMartin Lewis: If you take 100 people who get payday loans—and I am making the number up—I would suspect 99% of them would find a cheaper and better alternative doing something else or not doing them. The problem is they are used by far too many people and they are not fit for the purpose they are being used for.\n&#xa0;\nQ115 &#xa0; \nChair: There has been concern raised about the increasing number of people seeking debt advice after taking out payday loans. What does this reflect, do you think? Is it just the \nincrease in the number of people seeking them, changes within the industry, failure of the charter that the industry introduced, or what?\n \nWho would like to lead on that?\nPeter Tutton: We have seen really explosive growth in the number of people seeking help, who have got payday loans amongst their other debts as well.\n \nIt is not just about the growth of the market.\n \nAccording to the OFT figures, the market has grown about double in the last four years; the number of people we are seeing with\n payday loan debts has grown eightfold, so we are seeing a much bigger growth in the problem than just the growth of the market\n. \nAs well as that, we are seeing more people with multiple payday loan debts, and the size of their payday loan debts getting bigger\n. \nThe average pa\nyday loan debt of a StepChange Debt C\nharity client is now \n£16,000. Their average income is £12,000. The problem is irresponsible lending and ineffective affordability checking.\n&#xa0;\nQ116 &#xa0; \nChair: You have partly answered my question\n. You said that, in effect, d\nebts have increased hugely, but \nso has the number of people applying. How far would you say, in rough terms,\n that\n is\n a change in the increasing levels of poverty, or the marketing of payday loans companies\n? Could you give any sort of weighting to that?\nPeter Tutton: It is hard to di\nsentangle the two. Certainly, the people we are\n seeing\n are poorer, and lots of households are struggling. The question there, to turn it a bit,\n \nis, “I\ns the payday lending industry, in a sense, taking advantage of people\n who are struggling and in financial difficulty?” Our evidence suggests that they are. For instance, people we see with payday loan debts are more likely to have debts with council tax, rent arrears\n and \nfuel bills. So, far from being emergency cash to get people through a period of financial difficulty, what we are seeing is that payday loans put people on a cycle of using high-cost credit\n to make ends meet\n. It\n makes the problem worse\n and worse and worse. \nIn a sense, people are \nin a hole, and a payday loan is helping them dig that hole deeper.\n&#xa0;\nQ117 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: Very briefly,\n I want to know whether \nyou think there is a connection between payday loans and\n the more unsavoury area of\n business, and whether that connection operates \nthr\nough what they call “friends.” We know, on one website, they talk about, “If we cannot service you, we have friends who might be able to”. Does that connection disturb you, or should we not bother too much about it?\nGillian Guy: I think we have to bother about \nany situation that is exploiting people’s difficulty. At Citizens Advice, we have seen a ten\nfold growth in the number of people coming to us\n in the last four years with payday-lending issues. \nJust to hark back to t\nhe previous point, that is people who are already in debt, so they are topping up their debt. They are trying to pay off \ntheir debt by further credit, as opposed to getting adv\nice to manage that. We do have concerns about people laying off details to others. If the\n risk is too high for one company, it may be th\nat they lay them off elsewhere, and then the concern we have is exacerbated about how those people are treated, because t\nhey then fall under the radar \nand we are not necessarily monitoring how those people are doing.\n&#xa0;\nQ118 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nThat is my concern. \nIs there a con\nnection with loan \nsharking\n in given localities\n?\nMartin Lewis: \nI am not sure any of us necessarily have that data, but t\nhe problem \nthat \nwe have here is\n that\n we hav\ne a desert of regulation. When you have a desert of regulation, and when it is so easy to get a licence to do this and set up a one-man band to do it, then the slippage\n—\nthe read-acr\noss towards loan sharks\n—\ni\ns not that far away. Of course, we are not talking here about the big, high-budget advertising companies that you have probably just\n taken evidence from\n. \nThey have their own ra\nft of problems, but we are talking about the one\n­\nman-band lack of regulation. We have been given a glass of water\n in the form of w\nhat the FCA is doing next April. It should be welcomed, but\n \ni\nt is\n a glass of water, not an oasis, to continue my analogy. We need a lot more.\n&#xa0;\nQ119 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: Jus\nt picking up on that, and taking it in a direction back to the people we took evidence from\n—\nsome of the bigger players\n—\nthis question is really for the whole panel, but Martin is an entrepreneur and\n understand\ns\n some of these business models\n. \nThey claim that they do everything in their power to\n try to ensure people are not effectively borrowing from different sources, and be\n as \nrigorous as \npossible\n at the moment in the process\n, and the reason \nthat \nthey claim that is\n that\n it is not in\n their interest to have the 3% of people who are in pain, who end up failing\n to pay\n. \nWould yo\nu say that claim is legitimate? Can I put it to you that actually it is part of their business model and they do not really care that much about\n that 2% or 3%, and\n therefore\n that model still churns out lots of profit, lots of cash, even though \nthey get a number\n—\nwhatever it was we had them admit\n; 40,000, in Wonga’s terms\n—\nof \npeople who do get in real difficulty and real pain\n? A\nre they being serious about their intention,\n or is it just part of the business model anyway, that they take this on?\nMartin Lewis: W\ne have to \ndifferentiate between wanting to lend to people who will not repay you, and wanting to lend to people who cannot afford to repay you but\n will repay\n you. \nThat is the subtle difference\n. Yes, \nI fundamentally \nbelieve they do not want to lend to people who will not pay them their money back. That would be a very\n stupid\n thing for them to do, and I believe that \nthey do their best to \nensure that that does not happen. \nI am not convinced of the\n ethics of the model\n. You called me an entrepreneur; I might have to clean myself afterwards, having been put in\n an analogy with that type of entrepreneurship\n. It is not something I would ever dream of doing. \nI am not \nsure of the ethics of that model, and saying, “We do everything we can,” is a bit like \nme saying I will do everything I can in a fight against Mike Tyson to beat him\n. I know I will not. I know the information is not out there. I will say, “I will do what I can, in this nice easy marketplace where\n credit scoring is not being done\n and we do not have real-time data. \nWe \nare not able to find out where you have \nborrowed through somebody else, and we do not have that much detail on you, but I will f\nind out what I can\n.” \nI think it is a nice, easy answer \nto say, “We are doing what we can”, and I suspect they are within that bracket.\nGillian Guy: \nI would like to take some difference with that, in a sense, because \nI do not think that we can \nsustain an argument that these people are doing what they can. T\nhey are not in the art of the possible\n. \nThey are doing \nwhat they feel they want to do in order to make their business model work. Our evidence comes from a \ntracker survey\n that\n we carried out of 3,000 people to date, and that \nwas from \nwhen the voluntary code came into being\n. According to that\n—\nwhere, incidentally, \nwe think 76% of those people \nhad a case \nfor a complaint \nwith \nthe Financial Services Ombudsman\n—\nover 60% of those people \ndid not have adequat\ne affordability checks for their first loan, and when they sought extensions and rollovers, or had them forced upon them, 94\n% of them did not \nthen \nhave affordability check\ns. To say, as we have heard on numerous occasions, that they have to fill in boxes online and therefore say whether they can afford it or not\n is not all that they can do\n. They can do a lot more.\n&#xa0;\nQ120 &#xa0; \nRebecca Harris: We had quite a bit of discussion about rollovers and whether they\n should be limited, and the industry were \nquite keen to tell us that sometimes a rollover\n \ncould be a very sensible, \nrational decision by a borrower in ter\nms of their temporary ongoing need. What sort of information do you think we could provide that would\n distinguish between \nwhat was \na rati\nonal decision by a borrower to take a rollover, and what was a sign that someone is in really serious\n debt problems?\nRichard Lloyd: That would be a more credible assertion for them to make if they were doing proper\n affordability checks at the outset\n. From our survey\n—\nwe\n have all done a lot of surveys on this\n—\nh\nalf the people \nthat we have surveyed who have taken out\n \npayday loans said that they have taken out credit that they could not afford to repay. Now, i\nf they are not carrying out proper affordability checks, you have \ngot \nto \nquestion whether, at the time at which someone requests a rollover, they are not simply compounding the problem. As Martin said, there is no real\n­\ntime data \nsharing between high-cost credit lenders, and I think it just is not credible to \nsuggest that they as lenders are somehow acting responsibly to allow people to roll over\n their loans\n. \nThis is where the FCA are absolutely right to limit that nu\nmber, because the lenders have just proved with their behaviour\n—\nboth at the beginning of the term and at the time that people are requesting\n a rollover\n—\nthat they are not properly checking\n whether people can afford to manage that ongoing loan.\nMartin Lewis: The follow-up to what you are asking fits in with what you said before. I\nf you ask me to run a business and say\n, “How am I going to do this effectively to ensure that it is a rational consumer decision?” I am going to need to get on the phone with you or sit down and have a long conversation, like Citizens Advice or StepChange would do,\n about \nyour affordability criteria and about \nthe fact that you have £2,000\n definitely \ncoming in\n, and you have a letter to prove it, so you are going to be able to repay it. \nThat does not fit the business model of payday loans\n. They are never going to do that. That is just never going to work. It would not make financial sense with the\n amounts \nthat we are talking about, so there is a real problem there. \nYes, there is a point where \nyou could decide whether it is reasonable to do a rollover, but how you do that within the business models that they have got—I am not sure I could see a way around it without increasing the \ncost drastically.\nGillian Guy: \nWhile we are talking about business models, b\near in mind that a \nlarge amount of the revenue comes from rollover. \nIt would be counter\n-\nintuitive to \nstop rollovers. Again, from the same survey of those 3,000 people, 70% of them said they were\n under pressure to take an extensio\nn or a rollover, as opposed to trying to find a way to perhaps go and get some advice and manage that debt out of being. W\ne do not think, from our evidence, that the incentive is there at all\n. Indeed, there is pressure to take on more debt, and no consideration as to whether the person can afford that. \nWe have an exampl\ne of someone who took out £100 last Christmas, for example, and every month took a rollover until such time as\n £700\n was taken out of their account on a continuous payment authority. They cannot pay their rent, they cannot pay their council tax, and they have just come to see us.\nPeter Tutton: We have heard about affordability checks, but we see a gap between\n that and the reality. We heard that the average payday loan debt in the market was about £250, but for our clients\n—\nwho, on average, have abou\nt\n £10,000 \nof other debts as well\n—\nthe averag\ne they owe on an individual payday loan is over\n £500\n. \nWhat we are seeing is \nthat \nthe people in the most financial dif\nficulty are being lent more to, rather than being checked. That is because those loans are getting bigger because of rollovers, fees and charges, and multiple loans. Of the \npeople we see with payday loans, nearly half have three or more payday loans\n. How, therefore, is there affordable checking going on consistently?\n              Chair: \nMay I interrupt? \nWe are moving into areas that other \nquestions are on. I would like the questioners to take the\n answers they have already received into accou\nnt, but equally, when answering, could you not repeat it subsequently, because we are very\n short of time\n? \n&#xa0;\nQ121 &#xa0; \nRebecca Harris: W\ne \nwere talking about the industry model and what is in their interest. In your experience\n—\nyou have seen people with debt problems, and we get them as MPs as well\n—\ndo you think this is across the board in the industry, or are \nsome companies or groups of companies\n better than others\n? I do not want you to mention any names, but are some doing a better job than others?\nPeter Tutton: Both things are going on\n. What you see\n—\nand this is typical in this and other credit industries, which often focus on people in financial difficulty\n—\nis\n problem\ns\n rig\nht across the market, problems like multiple loans, lack of affordability checking, and people having money taken from their account through a CPA, leaving them not enough to live on. T\nhese are right across the sector\n. \nIt is true that there is \na tail in the industry where there are really egregious practices, where we see\n default c\nharges massively inflate debts and \ndebt collection practices that \nwe thought we had got rid of 10 years ago. This is something that we see across credit markets, and it is one of the problems with regulation not working well. It is a systematic problem, but also, particularly in the tail of the market, there are some really roguish practices that have been allowed to go on for too long. \nMartin Lewis: The answer to your question is yes: there are \nsome lenders who are better than others. I have a guide on my site to payday loans. It basically\n details all the th\nings you should do rather than getting a payday loan, and at the end, we have a section that I refuse to call “best buys.” We call it\n \n“least worst lenders”;\n \nit is the “least worst” section, and there are six lenders in there. \nWe judge them on a number of \ncriteria. Again, this is “least worst”: I do not want anyone to get them, and the whole article is actually designed to try to\n put people off gett\ning them. It is a decision tree, if you like. “Are they registered with the OFT?” We hope so. “Have they signed up to the good practice charter?” \nIt is not pe\nrfect, it is not fully working, but it is better than nothing. “Do they do a credit check?” We\n have\n got\n six lenders \nin \nthere that do that. Some of the bigger lenders\n, if you are going to do it, are not as bad as some of the \nnearly criminal lenders out there, but I still would not touch it. I will not swear, but i\nn an \nindustry of baskets, some baskets are a little worse than the other baskets.\n&#xa0;\nQ122 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: \nWe have touched on affordability in a lot of the questions, but I would like to ask the panel: h\naving seen what the FCA is \nproposing, having seen the various regulations and approaches from the OFT in the pipeline, are there\n \nother affordability criteria that\n you think are essential to be taken int\no account? I will come back to the question of multiple loans, because I think that is very important, but is there anything else in terms of the affordability of the loans that you would like to see as a check before people are allowed to take them out?\nRichard Lloyd: It would not be impossible\n. \nThere is no reason why \nthe lenders cannot do real-time data sharing to check people’s credit backgrounds. Martin was talking about whether lenders do a credit check; there are lenders that today, on their websites, are promoting their service as not requiring a credit check. It is\n extraordinary\n. \nAs a minimum, \nwe need to know\n the behaviour that is \ngoing on. If the industry wants to demonstrate that it can behave responsibly, it needs to get itself in a position where in real-time, or at least in quick-time, it can do\n checks on whether people have got loans \nwith other players within the industry. That \nwould be a minimum\n. \nThe FCA’s plan, more broadl\ny, is welcomed, but we want the FCA\n to go further\n. \nWhat is the \nproof that is being got of affordability, and particularly on the income side? Now,\n of course, this will slow down the granting of a loan, bu\nt surely that is the point. This\n needs to be done based on \ncredible evidence that people can afford to repay it.\nPeter Tutton: I agree\n. \nWe are\n looking at the FCA rules, and there are many that copy over from what the\n OFT have done\n. \nNow, these are the responsible lending things that \nare very high-level, and repeatedly we see in credit markets that high-level lending rules\n have not worked\n. \nYou give \nfirms some guidance, and then come back and look later. As well as real\n­\ntime data sharing, because these products have got such a short-term duration and the risk can build up so quickly, \nmaybe the regulator also needs to be getting its \ndata in real time so it can spot wrongdoing as it is happening and intervene, rather than coming back months or\n years later\n. \nThe other thing is looking at how these\n products work. If the average income of our clients with a payday loan is about £1,250, can they\n afford to repay £500\n? \nThat is nearly \n50% of your net household income a \nmonth\n. \nHow is that affordable\n? \nIf you have got people offering up to £1,000, there is \na question of how the regulator will ensure that those products are not unsuitable from the start, because they are such an amount of people’s income that people will never comfortably be able to \nrepay\n it\n.\nMartin Lewis: I am not sure it quite counts within affordability, but one of my greatest concerns about payday lending is that people often think of this as a financial play. When the Archbishop came out and said we will have credit unions\n in churches, that is a wonderful thing, but it is not the same thing\n. \nThis \ni\ns\n a technology play, in many cases; this is instantaneous mobile phone technology. This allows you, while you are pissed and want to gamble at 11.30 at night, to\n get a loan in half an hour\n. For me, within affordability is actually the personal responsibility of affordability. I\nt just needs to be slower\n. \nIt needs to be slow\ner to allow time to reconsider, and while there is a cooling-off period you pay interest if you decide to change your mind, so you are effectively still getting the loan. W\nithin affordability, \nyou have the controls that need to be put on the lender, but then, to allow the individual\n to take \nsome more control of their own af\nfordability, the instantaneous, high-technology nature of the way these operate is very dangerous. It is a feeding mechanism, very close and akin to gambling\n, and there are many people who use them for gambling\n. I do not know whether that counts within your question.\n&#xa0;\nQ123 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: I think it is a useful point\n. Did you want to add anything from the CAB?\nGillian Guy: I was just going to reinforce the \npoint about proof. We have heard a lot about being able to tick boxes in\n technological ways of applying for loans, and they are never checked\n. \nPeople are almost \nencouraged to put the right answer in the box in order to get a loan. The business model\n itself, which preys o\nn rollover and the unaffordability inherent in that, needs much more\n focus from the regulator on just how secure those checks are\n. \nThe other \npoint in the business model is that it is competition on speed. It is not competition on price or on any of the other points, and that really has to be taken out of that product.\n&#xa0;\nQ124 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: \nI strongly agree with that. \nComing back to this po\nint about multiple loans, I think, StepChange, you said that a third of your people who are coming to you about payday loans have \nthree or more, which is an extraordinarily high proport\nion. Surely, that can be relatively straightforwardly dealt with through a central\n database of loans\n. We had a little bit of theological debate in the previous session as to whether it needs to be a central database of\n payday loans or all loans\n. \nSurely, that is something that a relatively small charge on this sector could\n pay for, to be run by a regulator. Do you think that might be the way forward?\nPeter Tutton: \nIt seems a sensible way forward. \nI remember, about two years ago, rep\nresentatives of payday lenders and consumer groups met with BIS\n across the road, and this was discussed\n. Now, t\nhere has been no movement since then, so \nI think that for a while, the argument has been, “How do you know what other loans and other payday loans people have got? Surely you should have real-time data.” \nThe industry\n, as you heard earlier,\n \nis moving \nextremely slow\nly towards that. I guess\n \nw\nhat we need \nnow is something to make them move much, much more quickly.\n&#xa0;\nQ125 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: We heard evidence in the last session that \nsome in the industry are spending a lot of money on credit data. Surely,\n if they are spending that individually, it would \nperhaps \nbe more efficient\n to spend it together as an industry and get that transparency across the board.\nGillian Guy: It depends on motivation, does it not? If the m\notivation is to \ntake the problems out of the industry and not put people into\n \nspiralling \ndebt and situations \nthat \nthey cannot afford, \nthen \nhow hard can it be?\n              Q126 &#xa0; \nKaty Clark: We \nshall come on to advertising later, but as you say, this is competition about speed. If you look at the advertising, it is very much how quickly you can get money that is the selling point for a lot of these operations. Obviously, a lot of people that are looking to get a payday loan\n feel desperate, and they are not necessarily looking properly \nat \nall the i\nnformation about interest rates, which perhaps could be more prominent. However,\n \neven if we regulated to make it more prominent, it still will not necessarily be the main thing that people \nwill look at. Do you think we need to regulate\n interest rates, and do \nyou \nthink \nwe \nnee\nd to have a maximum interest rate, which is something they do in other countries?\nMartin Lewis: I am not a fan of \nan interest-\nrate\n cap. I always use the example that if we were in a pub and I said, “I will lend you 20 quid, but you buy me a pint next week,” and the pint cost £3, that i\ns \n143,000% APR. That shows that, on short-\nterm loans, APRs are not that re\nlevant. The one thing I like about APRs on payday loans is that it is the one thing\n that puts people off\n. I quite like that it is there, even though it is irrelevant, if I am really honest, and\n I admit the logical inconsistency in that\n. I like it because it puts people off. I am in favour of a total-cost cap.\n&#xa0;\nQ127 &#xa0; \nChair: Just following up t\nhat point, if they were capped at a lower level, do you actually think there might be an increase in\n take\n-\nup of payday loans?\nMartin Lewis: I do not t\nhink it is about interest rates, and that is why I think you have to protect people from the cost. I am in favour of a total-\ncost cap\n. In very simple terms\n—\nand \nI am not setting a number\n—\nif\n I \nborrow £100 in total, including rollovers, fees,\n charges, everything, \nI\n should not have to pay more than \n£150. That is an explanation of the structure, not the actual cost I am looking to be set. I have not got\n that far yet, to be honest\n. That is a market-condition thing.\n&#xa0;\nQ128 &#xa0; \nKaty Clark: In effect, that is \nregulating interest rates. It may not be a maximum cap.\nMartin Lewis: Technicall\ny, it is not. It is regulating\n cost\n. \nIf you regulate \ninterest rates and say, “100% interest rate”, what you are actually doing is regulating\n the term of the loan\n. \nTherefore, you cannot lend over one day and ask \npeople to pay back the next day, but you can lend over a month, so you would actually elongate\n the loan term\ns if you did it that way. It is a subtle difference, but it is not quite the same thing.\n              Chair: \nI think we understand.\nRichard Lloyd: \nChair, \nI have got a slightly different point of view on this \nto Martin, and it is a nuance on what he has said. We think what gets people into difficulty the most is the fees and charges—that half of people that are borrowing, who I \ntalked about earlier\n,\n that find that they cannot \nafford to repay the original loan, are then late with a payment and get charged\n £25\n,\n and that gets added on and on\n and on. W\ne think \nthat cycle \nis \nthe biggest part of the problem in terms of affordability and the spiral into debt. Our view is to put\n a cap on the cost of \nthe \nfees and charges \nthat people are being hit with first. The evidence about what would happen to\n the market if there were a cap on the total cost of credi\nt is inconclusive, and we were talking earlier about the linkages between payday lending and other forms of high-cost credit and illegal lending. I think we have got to be\n really careful here\n. In our view, the FCA\n—\nand it has the p\nowers\n—\nshould attack the thing that we have identified is most often getting people into the most difficulty. It is the\n fees and charges,\n not necessarily the total cost, although I would not rule that out.\nGillian Guy: \nMay I add that there should be some charges that are looked at in terms of a ban? When we are looking at total cost, that means things like charging for failed continuous payment authorities on a continuous basis.\n              Chair: We are going to talk about those in a second.\n&#xa0;\nQ129 &#xa0; \nMr Binley:Mr Lewis, y\nou mentioned the connection with gambling\n. Do you know what percentage of payday loans are related to that? That is an interesting point.\nMartin Lewis: There is no way to know.\n&#xa0;\nQ130 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nAre there any checks on those people who have two, three, four, or even\n five payday loans and \nare doing treasury accounting by doing that? \nEvery time\n they get a loan, they pay off the other loan, so from the loan-giver’s point of view, it is a self-fulfilling increase.\nPeter Tutton: Yes, and that goes back to \nwhen we are thinking about default rates and things like that. We \nsaw this before in the past\n, with credit cards, and the issue of only looking at people who have actually fallen over and not looking at people whose problems are getting bigger and bigger. W\nhat we see with credit cards\n and some of the mainstream credit\n is\n that\n they pay much more atten\ntion to looking at information suggesting that people may be in more financial difficulty. That is clearly not happening with\n payday lenders.\nRichard Lloyd: Our research suggests that a quarter of payday\n&#x2011;\nloan borrowers are\n using those loans to repay other credit.\n&#xa0;\nQ131 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Is th\nere any way of the debt-advice charities represented here alerting credit reference agencies when they are coming across\n these multiple\n payday loans? Do you have any process for contacting the appropriate reference agencies and making them\n \naware \nof this, or would you welcome such a process\n, if it could be made available\n?\nGillian Guy: \nThe difficulty there is that t\nhat\n is about personal information that is brought to us on a confidential basis to help people out of a situation, so i\nt is quite difficult to do that\n. We have to have generic information that we then would pass on, and w\ne are very open \nto passing on data to show where the problems arise.\nPeter Tutton:\n More particularly, of course, by the time they come to us, people are coming for help with serious debt problems. W\nhat we need to do is preve\nnt those serious debt problems. By the time they come to us, it is trying to remedy a bad situation. The lenders have to be doing this earlier to prevent people taking out unaffordable loans, rather than us being informed when people have a problem.\nGillian Guy: T\no be fair, given the amount of surveys that we have done and the amount of data and evidence that we have got, we have\n passed on a lot that would say this business model needs \nre-\nlooking at\n and the practice needs to be changed\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ132 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: We have spoken quite a bit \nabout\n rollovers today, b\nut I just wanted your views on the FCA proposals to limit the number of rollovers to\n two per loan\n. \nDo you agree with the lim\nit, and if not, what would you like to see in its place?\nGillian Guy: It is good to have a limit, because w\ne see people getting into that spir\nal, and it has no end. I have got cases here with 11 or 12, and they just keep going and going and then, as I say, finding the money taken;\n \nthey just \nhave not got it in their account, but it is not in isolation, really\n. \nT\nhose people cannot be left to be told, “There is no solution for you,” because they may go to other places that are even less salubrious, \nor get into worse and wors\ne \nsituations. So they must be sign\nposted to \nget some help, advice and support to get them out of the situation.\n&#xa0;\nQ133 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: \nDoes anyone have any alternative views?\nRichard Lloyd: We think a limit of\n two is a sensible place to start, but we think \nprobably the FCA would ne\ne\nd\n to move to one\n. \nIn our \nview, one rollover is reasonable. You might need to take out a payday loan because of\n some unexpected expense one month, and\n the same may happen again. We should look very hard at whether two is effective and is tackling the\n problem properly\n, but two is a good place to start\n.\nMartin Lewis: I am with one as well, but I do worry about the rollover loophole: “We will give you another loan to repay the first loan that you had with us,” and\n—\nyou were discussing it before\n—\nwhat \nI call \nthe collective rollover, where\n you \neffectively roll over with another firm or another operator by doing the same thing, and there are \nno data checks\n. \nI am not sure how \neffective it really will be in practical terms for an individual. \n&#xa0;\nQ134 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Do you have quite a bit of experience of people taking existing loans and putting them into an alternative package?\nMartin Lewis: \nThat 25% figure is, effectively, that.\nRichard Lloyd: \nThat is what we have had.\nPeter Tutton: That is what we are seeing with people, spinning round and round and round and round.\n&#xa0;\nQ135 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: \nSo it is repackaging that is going on?\nPeter Tutton: \nYes. \nA \nlimit of one makes sense to us, but there is also this point about dealing with multiples. The FCA has to have a package that deals with the whole thing of people getting stuck in this spiral.\n              Q136 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: What restrictions on advertising do you think should be introduced\n to stop inappropriate lending\n?\nGillian Guy: I think we need to look at a whole raft of things on advertising, and an analysis of exactly\n what the market segment is that companies \nare targeting. We do hear that they are not targeting the people that we are talking about, and yet they are on daytime television; they use cartoons; \nth\ney put it at times when people that we see with multiple debts might be at home, because they are\n unemployed\n. \nIt is that kind of targeting\n. \nThere is no clarity \nin them about what the consequence of taking it on is. It all looks like a good thing, a quick fix, and something that is attractive. T\no be honest, it reminds me of the ol\nd days of cigarette advertising, where it was all very sexy and a good thing to be doing, and we did not worry about health warnings. \nThere are no health warnings on \nthese adverts. There is nothing about the dangers that they could present,\n or\n,\n indeed, that they are not \nthe\n solution to\n all things and there might be some other way out of a debt situation, rather than more debt.\nMartin Lewis: \nWe are in danger of grooming a new generation towards\n this t\nype of borrowing. If you think we have got problems now, you wait until 10 years’ time. G\nrooming \nis the right term\n. \nWe are talking about \na market that did not exist five years ago, and you have had people in arguing that this is how people\n like to use i\nt. They have created the demand,\n the\ny have created the operational structure, and now they are saying it is what people want. I\nt is deliberately contrived and controlled\n. \nLet me give you some stats that we are coming out with today. \n14% of \nparents of under-10s, when they have said,\n “No, you cannot have\n your toy,” or whatever they have asked for, have had a payday loan company quoted to borrow the money from. 30% of under-10s, in a poll of their parents that we have done on the website,\n are joking about these slogans, and laughing and repeating s\nlogans of payday lenders. We have normalised this. This niche lending of last resort has become normalised to a mainstream form of credit by \nthe use of advertising\n. \nI would have a blanket ban\n. These adverts go on children’s television channels and children’s television programmes. \nWhere would I start? A full ban on any children’s\n TV and advertising\n. It is a disgrace, and\n I use the term \n“\ngrooming\n”\n quite deliberately\n. Once we have done that, we need to look at the style and nature of the advert. There are\n \ncartoon puppets that make it seem fun, and deliberately fly in the face of the messages we know we want to get out there. They say, “It is easy;” they deliberately try and say, “T\nhe other messages you are hearing are wrong\n.” It is inappropriate propaganda. \nWe need\n,\n when these adverts come on\n,\n all the health\n warnings that we are saying today to be part of those adverts. \nI am close to saying that\n I would just ban the whole lot of them, but that is not a market economy, and we have to accept that\n we do not do that\n. They have to be far more responsible.\n&#xa0;\nQ137 &#xa0; \nChair: Have you any figures for the percentage of those who have payday loans, grouped by age?\nMartin Lewis: No, I do not\n. \nPeter Tutton: We can dig that out, with the people that we see who have come to us for help.\nChair: Could you provide us with that evidence?\nPeter Tutton: Yes\n. \nAnother thing is that I agree with what Martin said there\n. \nParticularly, from our point of view, there is a normalisation of using high-cost credit as a way of dealing with financial difficulties\n. \nAs I said before, we see people using payday loans in a way that makes their financial difficulties worse\n. \nOne part of advertising, which was talked about in the previous session, is unsolicited marketing\n. \nWe did some polling a couple of weeks ago, and I think something like 1.2 million people said they had been tempted to take \nout \na payday loan by unsolicited contact\n. \nOur clients tell us they are being bombarded by texts and phone calls\n. \nThese are people who are at their lowest\n ebb\n; they are massively financially vulnerable\n. \nThey do not know how they are going to g\net through the end of the month;\n they ar\ne completely stumped, cash-\nstress\ned. Then\n people are contacting them saying, “We have \ngot the solution to your problem;\n here is a high-cost loan\n.” \nWe know that, very often, those loans make the problem worse\n. So w\nhy is it that unsolicited marketing of what can be a very high\n­\nrisk product is allowed\n? \nWe do not argue for banning many things, but one of the th\nings that maybe \nthe FCA should consider\n \nis \na ban on \nunsolicited marketing\n of payday lending\n.\nGillian Guy: One of the things that we have to bear in mind, as well, is that we are now increasing the market\n for these adverts. With \nthe costs of living going up and people being unable to meet their priority debts, they are looking for solutions, and they are right in front of their eyes\n. \nIn a way, there is a more vulnerable situation that we have to deal with here\n. \nWe look at welfare reform, and we see monthly budgeting coming in and people being unable to manage on that basis\n. \nWhat is the answer to that\n? A\n quick fix, a quick loan, and there is your advert waiting for you.\nRichard Lloyd: On the demographic question, Chair, our research suggests that across the board, 4% of households take out a payday loan each month\n. For 18 \nto\n \n29\n-\nyear\n-\nolds, that is nearly double, 7%\n. \nMartin is quite right: there is clearly a growing problem here in terms of younger people being engaged with this market at an increasing rate, relative to the others\n. \nThe other thing I would do with advertising is make it really plain what the cost of a loan is, and I would express that in pounds per £100 borrowed, rather than in APR\n. \nPeople, we know, tend not to understand APR, tend not to be able to engage with that metric\n. \nI would force the lenders to explain much more clearly the costs, and as Gillian said, the consequences of default in terms of cost as well.\n&#xa0;\nQ138 &#xa0; \nMike Crockart: May\n I ask for a bit more detail\n? \nI am a big supporter of the “Got Their Number” campaign that was launched last week\n, and, of course, “Calling Time”, that Which? have\n been running for nuisance calls\n. \nWhat is the evidence that you have on who is making these calls\n? \nI questioned the big players that were here just a m\ninute ago, and they are adamant:\n “We are not doing any of this\n.” \nIf they are not doing it, who is\n? There seem\n to be so many of them.\nPeter Tutton: It is a good question\n. \nOne of the difficulties is that people are not often sure, because there are lead-generating firms\n. \nThere is a shadow market of consumer data, so part of the thing about passing i\nt to your friends is that if a consumer\n contact\ns\n a website, does that consumer know who their details are being passed to\n? \nPeople are being run\ng\n up, and they do not know who they are being called by\n. T\nhat open\ns\n people up \nnot only \nto perhaps taking an inappropriate payday \nloan, but also to fraud. We see types of advance-\nfee fraud that are based on cold-calling\n. There is a problem, \nbecause people do not necessarily really know who their data is being passed to and who is ringing them up, and it is very hard for us to trace that back again\n. \nPeople tell us they are bombarded by calls and texts\n. \nWe are getting people to send us those texts, and we can find out who is doing it, but it is very hard\n. \nThat is part of the problem: there is little control, and there seems to be massive non-compl\niance with things like the data \nprotection legislation\n. \nIt is hard for consumers to know where their details are going and who is contacting them\n. \n              Chair: I think we get the point\n. \nIf there is anybody who wishes to submit any\n further\n evidence on that, feel free to do so.\n&#xa0;\nQ139 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: We are all deeply aware of the problems with the use of continuous payment authorities\n. \nThe FCA are proposing a limit of two unsuccessful applications of a CPA\n. \nIs that enough to tackle the problem that you have experienced, and if not, what would you do?\nGillian Guy: I do not think it is just about how CPAs are administered\n. \nPeople do not, in the first instance, understand either that they have signed up to a CPA\n, which is very often the case, \nor how it differs from a direct debit, or that it does differ\n. \nThey do not get notice when a \npayment is about to be taken out, and the timing in people’s accounts is extremely impo\nrtant when they are living hand\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nmouth and if they have priority debts coming in\n. \nNone of that is taken into account\n. \nWe have had some struggle, as well, to make it clear to people that they can stop those CPAs, and it is within their rights to do so\n. \nThat has not been made clear enough.\nMartin Lewis: To follow up from that,\n the real struggle is, since November 2009, you have had a right to go to your bank and cancel a CPA, but you call up the bank and the bank staff do not know that, and they tell you that you cannot\n. \nPeople are right to say\n,\n “I cannot cancel it\n,”\n because they try\n to\n cancel\n,\n and they do not\n. \nWe have a real problem\n—\nnot just within payday loans; CPA is an issue right across the board\n—of being \nun\nable to cancel \nthat type of payment\n. \nSometimes the public are right: you cannot cancel it, even though you have a right to.\n&#xa0;\nQ140 &#xa0; \nNadhim Zahawi: Briefly, on that one, we heard from the panel previous to you\n—from Mr Lender—\nthat CPAs\n can be a really good thing for the customer\n. \nIt took me about 30 seconds to get something up here from \nthe \nConsumer Action Group: “I currently have a loan with Mr Lender\n. \nAnyway, that aside, I was recently made redundant; rang, e\n-\nmailed NatWest to cancel CPA, cancel my bank card; told Mr Lender I had been made redundant\n. \nThey of course asked for \n£\n75 to set up a repayment plan, which I refused\n. \nMr Lender has still managed to take one payment, £75, and another payment, £145\n. \nMay I add, my bank was already overdrawn before Mr Lender’s payments\n. \nThese show up on my statements\n. \nThe bank account I have with NatWest has no overdraft on it, and is £252 overdrawn\n. \nWhere do I go from here\n?” \nIs this typical of what is happening in the industry?\nMartin Lewis: It is certainly not shocking\n or surprising\n. \nI think “typical” is perhaps too strong a term\n. \nInterestingly, if that money has come out, this person has a right to go to the Financial Ombudsman and ask the bank to pay it back, because they should not have allowed it to come out\n. \nThis all flicks ba\nck to your earlier question to m\ne, about the difference between trying to do everything to make sure people do not repay, and being willing to lend to people you are going to get to repay when they cannot afford it\n. \nIf you have got the CPAs working in the right way, and people have £10 in their bank account and every day you are doing a CPA for £10 on a fishing expedition, people are going to repay\n. \nIt does no\nt mean they can afford to repay, but\n they are going to repay\n. T\nhat is the subtle difference in the language that we are hearing: “Will I get my money back\n?” \nIf it is a “no”, they do not want it, but if they will, regardless of the moral concerns of whether it is right to get it back, that is where they are pushing\n. \nRichard Lloyd: This must be about giving people control over their finances, and the way to do that is to require the lenders to give you notice that they are going to use a CPA\n. \nIf they do not do that, you are not in control.\nPeter Tutton: It is also about not pushing people further into difficulty\n. \nCharging £75 to set up a repayment plan is not good, responsible lending\n. \nIt is taking someone who is clearly in financial difficulty and taking another fee out of them\n. \nHow can that be justifiable\n? \nThe thing with CPA is that we would expect lenders to start thinking, if CPA fails once, “Okay, why has that failed\n? \nWhat should we do as a lender to try \nto\n make sure, if this person is in financial difficult\ny, we are not making it worse?”\n rather than, “\nI\nf we have not heard from them, we will just take the money anyway and maybe we wil\nl add some more charges.\n”\n&#xa0;\n              \nChair: I have got to finish here\n. \nWe have got the Minister here, and other bodies; we need to question them\n. \nIf you feel that you have not had the opportunity to answer a question as fully as you like, please submit it in written form as supplementary evidence, and it will be fully considered in our report\n. \nEqually, we may well have further questions that we would like to ask you, and we would be grateful for your responses\n. \nThank you very much\n. \n&#xa0;\nExamination of WitnessesWitnesses:\n \nJo Swinson MP, Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, \nLesley Titcomb, Chief Operating Officer and Programme Sponsor of Consumer Credit, Financial Conduct Authority, \nNadege Genetay, Head of Banking, Lending and Protection Policy, Financial Conduct Authority, and \nDavid Fisher, Anti Money Laundering, \nConsumer Credit\n and Consumer Direct\n, Office of Fair Trading, gave evidence.\n&#xa0;\nQ141 &#xa0; \nChair: Thank you for agreeing to answer our questions, and in particular, Minister, can I thank you\n? \nI think this is the first time I have ever known a Min\nister actually ask to attend a Select C\nommittee inquiry, and I do apologise for having you in rather later\n. \nI hate doing that, but as you can understand, the scale of the issues there provoked \nsuch \na lot of questions that it was very difficult to manage within the time\n \nscale available\n. \nHowever, we have you now\n. \nCould I just ask you to introduce yourselves for voice transcription purposes, starting with you, Minister?\nJo Swinson: I am Jo Swinson\n. I am the Minister for c\nonsum\ner a\nffairs, and \nam \nvery pleased that the Select Committee is returning to this important issue.\nLesley Titcomb: I am Lesley Titcomb\n. I am the Chief Operating O\nfficer of the Financial Conduct Authority, and the executive responsible for the transition of consumer credit regulation to us.\nNadege Genetay: I am Nadege Genetay\n. \nI am the Head of Banking, Lending and Protection Policy at the Financial Conduct Authority\n. \n              David Fisher: \nI am David Fisher\n. \nI am the senior director responsible for consumer credit and anti-money laundering at the Office of Fair Trading.\n&#xa0;\nQ142 &#xa0; \nChair: I will open with a fairly general question\n. \nThe industr\ny has produced its own customer \nservice charter\n. \nHow do you think the undertakings there match up with the compliance review that you published earlier this year\n? \nI gather, Minister, you wish to respond.\nJo Swinson: Absolutely\n. \nIt was helpful that the industry indicated that they wanted to clean up their act and have their own charter, which they created last summer\n,\n and \nthat\n came into force last November\n. \nUnfortunately, we did not find that the compliance with the industry’s own charter was what we would have expected\n. \nInitially, the industry had committed that they would review their own compliance on that, but when it came to the crunch, unfortunately, not all of the industry was prepared to undertake that review\n. \nAs the Department, we initiated our own surveys to try to test the extent to which there was compliance with the industry’s \nvoluntary codes, and what we found was pretty disappointing in terms of compliance\n. \nOne in five customers reported that the lender did not ask about their finances when they were taking out a loan, and this rose to 60% when they were actually rolling over that loan\n.\nIn terms of CPA, which I know you heard about in previous sessions, again, one in three customers reported it was not clearly explained, and nearly 60% of people were not told how to cancel \na \nCPA\n. \nSo our surveys were a snapshot in time, but certainly gave u\ns significant cause for concern\n about the levels of compliance, which is why I was so delighted to see really tough rules proposed by the FCA, given that I think the industry has had a significant chance to get its own house in order and has failed in that challenge\n. \nThat is why the regulators will be able to make sure that that is indeed what happens.\n&#xa0;\nQ143 &#xa0; \nChair: Minister, could I just extract one element of your answer there\n? \nYou implied \nthat \nthere was actually resistance from sectors of the industry\n. \nMy next question was, “Is this a result of a quickl\ny \nexpanding market, or are there deep-seated problems\n?” \nWould you agree that that seems to point to the latter?\nJo Swinson: I think so\n. \nThere are four main trade bodies within the industry, one of whom had basically said that they would undertake the compliance review as they had all signed up to do\n. So a\nt least in one part of the industry, they had indicated that willingness, but it was very disappointing that the rest of the industry did not do likewise or indicate that they would do, despite having previously agreed that that is what would happen.\n&#xa0;\nQ144 &#xa0; \nChair: Would it be fair to say that there were at least some elements within the industry that looked at its o\nwn charter as, if you like, \na smokescreen?\nJo Swinson: I certainly think that it was not taken as seriously as it should have been, because the customer experience backed up that it was not properly being delivered\n. \nAt the end of the day, it is\n the customer experience that is\n most important\n. \nActually, the issue about whether or not the industry wanted to review their compliance might not have mattered had\n we found\n, when we tested it, \nthat \nthe customers were saying that there was compliance\n. But the combination of a\n lack of interest in charting whether that code had been complied with and the fact that customers were then reporting significant problems certainly suggests, very strongly, that the industry was not taking it anything like as seriously as it should have been\n,\n in general terms.\n&#xa0;\nQ145 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: I have a\n couple of questions for Mr Fisher\n. \nYou\n have the power to revoke licenc\nes in extreme cases\n. How many licenc\nes have \nyou \nrevoked following your compliance review?\nDavid Fisher: Since the compliance review, we have revoked the licen\nces of three consumer-\ncredit companies, and we have a further two investigations that are at quite an advanced stage at the moment, so I would expect more would follow.\n&#xa0;\nQ146 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Thank you for that\n. \nGiven the number of failings that have been highlighted in your review\n—\nvery extensive failings, right across all sectors of the industry\n—w\nhat other sanctions are available to you, and have you used any of them since the publication of that report?\nDavid Fisher: “Sanction” is perhaps not quite the right word\n. \nThe work \nthat \nwe have done putting pressure on the 50 leading lenders that have been referred to earlier, accounting for 90% of the market, is not formal enforcement action, but we \ngave \neac\nh of those lenders \na very, very detailed dossier of their failings\n. \nLet us be frank: \nthat is exactly what they were—\nfailings\n. \nWe gave each of them a 12-week period in which to satisfy us that, in short, they had put their house right\n. \nWe have been following up on that since\n. \nThat has had a direct effect on the market, in that\n, as has already been mentioned, \n19 of the payday lenders chose to exit the market\n. So y\nou can say that \nit is \nnot formal enforcement action or \na \nsanction, but the pressure we have put on the payday lenders has resulted in some of the more undesirable ones leaving immediately.\n&#xa0;\nQ147 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Yes, but 19 out of 50 is actually removing competition\n. \nThere is less competition in the market as a consequence of that particular endeavour\n. \nI am sure we do not criticise you for it, but that is an inevitable consequence.\nDavid Fisher: \nI\nndeed\n. \nObviously, we are the \nUK\n’s leading competition authority as well, but you must remember that it is not competition for its own sake\n. \nOur motto is about making markets work well for consumers\n. \nWe have had real concerns about how competition operates in this market, very fundamental concerns, which led us to make a reference to the Competition Commission in the summer.\n&#xa0;\nQ148 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: Can I ask you one point\n? \nYou stated that if a borrower has to roll over a loan because of a missed payment, it is prima facie evidence that it is financially unsustainable\n. \nToday, when we took evidence from the industry, they appeared to find great difficulty in defining what was financially unsustainable\n. \nDo you consider that still remains a problem with the industry?\nDavid Fisher: Yes, it does\n. \nAbsolutely, it remains a problem\n. \nMay I just make a point that we do not have the power to make rules, but we do issue guidance, and we were ve\nry clear about this in our debt-\ncollection guidance\n. I\nt is not the use of continuous payment \nauthority that has bothered us; \nit is the misuse of it\n. \nIt seemed to us that if you have made one or two attempts to recover a loan\n,\n and the person just simply does not have the money in their account to repay it, then you should stop and ask, “What is going on\n?” \nYou should assume that there is a problem there.\n&#xa0;\nQ149 &#xa0; \nAnn McKechin: I am just going to ve\nry quickly ask the rest of the p\nanel whether they agree with the OFT’s analysis.\nLesley Titcomb: Yes, and that is why we have made the rules we have, or are proposing to make the rules we h\nave around rollovers, CPAs\n and so on\n. \nHowever, it is also important to understand that as the FCA, we will have available to us \ntools that the OFT has not had—\nauthorisation supervision and so on.\n              Ann McKechin: We will come to that later on\n. \n&#xa0;\nQ150 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: \nMay I ask the p\nanel what the reasons are for your referral of the industry to the Competition Commission\n? \nWhat were the most specific reasons that you really wanted to get down to?\nDavid Fisher: The compliance review that we conducted\n—\nand you have referred to it, and you have obviously been drawing on our report when preparing for this\n—showed \nnon\n­\ncompliance across all parts of the industry\n. \nWe did not find that there was a long tail of people who were failing to comply with the law and the OFT’s guidance; we found non\n­\ncompliance across all payday lenders\n. \nThat is not what you would expect to see in a properly working market\n. \nYou would, in a properly working market, naturally expect to find some people who were not complying with the law\n; t\nhat is just the way the world works, but you would expect to find the majority broadly compliant\n. \nWe did not find that\n. \nThat was the big trigger that said to us that there was something wrong with this market\n. \nWe were concerned that, actually, non-compliance is a competitive tool in this market\n. \nIt gives a competitive edge\n. \nWe were concerned about the lack of transparency that has been discussed in earlier sessions: do consumers actually understand what they are getting into with a payday loan\n? \nDoes the consumer understand the implications of a rollover\n? \nDoes the consumer understand what a continuous payment authority is\n? \nWe were concerned about low price sensitivity\n. \nAs one of the previous witnesses said quite clearly, and I agree, these people compete on speed and convenience; they do not compete on price, so there is low price sensitivity on the consumers\n. \nWe were concerned about barriers to switching from one lender to a\nnother, and high concentration:\n we estimate that the three leading payday lenders account for about 70% of the market\n. \nThose were the core reasons for referring to the Competition Commission.\n&#xa0;\nQ151 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: We heard earlier from the\n professional body organisers\n that they did not seem too concerned about the interface between the legal and credible part of the business and the illegal, and often incredible, black area of the business\n. \nDo \nyou see that as a real concern—\nthat blurred dividing line between what we consider to be not only indecent, but often illegal, and what the companies consider to be legal\n? \nIt seems that there is an interplay there that we are not getting hold of.\nDavid Fisher: There is a clear distinction between that which is legal and that which is illegal\n. \nTh\nere is the law on illegal money\nlending; for example, you do have to be regulated in order to provide a loan\n. \nThere is a clear distinction between what is illegal and legal\n. \nWhat we were concerned about was not so much what is legal, as how the law is being interpreted and applied\n. There\n you have a broad range of business practices, some of which are not illegal but are highly undesirable.\n&#xa0;\nQ152 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: What about references to “friends”?\nDavid Fisher: Yes, I was struck by the reference to a “friend”\n. \nThe friend in question, of course, would be another provider of short-term, high-cost credit\n. \nIf I am such a lender, and I decide that you are not a good credit risk but I refer you to a friend, what do you think they are going to charge you\n? \nTo call them a “friend” is a clear misnomer\n. \nIt would be another payday lender.\n&#xa0;\nQ153 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: \nW\ne are all concerned to get both regulation and enforcement right\n. \nIt was clear from our exchange with the industry earlier that both were not right at the moment\n. \nSelf-regulation had failed and there was no effective enforcement\n. \nNow, within the proposals that the FCA has published\n—\nor alongside those proposals\n—\nwhat are your views on \nenforcement, and in particular, on the sanctions that can be taken\n? \nYou talked about the new tools at your disposal.\nLesley Titcomb: I will kick off on that\n. \nWe all tend to think of the enforcement and the sanctions that tend to grab the headlines, but it is important to understand the whole regulatory process and the range of tools available to us\n. \nFirst of all, there is the authorisation gateway\n. \nFirms that want to continue in this sector will have to go through the full FCA authorisation process\n. \nThere is then ongoing supervision and monitoring, which will be tailored to the level of risk posed by the particular type of firm that we are talking abo\nut, and payday lenders are high-\nrisk and therefore can expect an increased supervisory focus\n. \nThey will \nhave to submit data to us, \netc\n. \nThen, of course, where we do have the offenders, there is a much wider range of enforcement sanctions available to us than there has been to the OFT\n. \nWe, for example, could instruct a firm to stop doing certain types of business or to not take on new business\n. \nWe can fine them\n. \nWe can, in certain cases, tackle the individuals who are responsible for the firms\n. \nWe can ban certain adverts\n—\nthat type of thing\n—\nand also, of course, we can ultimately take away a firm’s authorisation.\nJo Swinson: I would echo some of what Lesley said, but say that I think it is really important to recognise that the OFT has taken enforcement action that has led to the exodus of 25 firms from the market, th\nr\nough a combination\n of voluntary leaving and licenc\nes being revoked\n. \nHowever, they did not have the strength of powers that it has become clear are needed within this industry to tackle some of the very significant non-compliance\n. That is why the Government have\n made sure we have given the FCA\n, \nas the new regulator\n from next April\n, \nvery significant and robust powers\n. Lesley ha\ns outlined the whole process, and whether it is fines, which of course can be unlimited, \nor \nwhether it is banning products or getting redress for consumers, these really are much, much more significant powers\n. \nThis means that the FCA will be a regulator with\n—dare I say it?—perhaps more teeth than the OFT was equipped with, to be able to\n clamp down on payday lenders and any unscrupulous lending behaviour.\n&#xa0;\nQ154 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Just following on from Paul’s question, it is very reassuring to hear about the extra powers and the extra enforc\nement that we can expect to see\n from the FCA\n. \nI have heard some worrying suggestions that the EU consumer finance directive and the creation of a common market in consumer credit could mean, though, that companies operating outside the \nUK\n regulatory system would be able to sell products into the \nUK\n. \nDo you have powers to address that, and make sure that \nUK\n consumers are protected from that type of approach?\nLesley Titcomb: We have faced this situation already in a number of areas\n. \nWe do have a certain number of powers, but they are limited, obviously\n. \nWe are left with host country powers, effectively, so inevitably it is more difficult\n. \nIn any case where this type of business is mobile, it can move offshore, either to other parts of the EU or even outside the EU as well\n. That is an issue, \nit is more difficult for us\n,\n and we are more limited in what we can do\n. \nJo Swinson: On the consumer credit d\nirective specifically, while it can be helpful in some cases to have EU-wide regulation\n, \nwhich can mean uniformity of protection across the EU\n, \none of the issues that my officials are exploring with the Commission at the moment is that of how information can be provided\n. For very sensible reasons, the consumer credit d\nirective says that credit has to be expressed in APR, but I know that \nthis Committee in its previous R\neport has highlighted some of the failings of APR in helping consumers to understand the costs of taking out a short-term loan\n. \nObviously, when a borrower gets to the stage of taking \nout a loan\n, we can \nalso \nrequire the total cost of credit to be provided\n,\n in pounds\n. \nThe maxim\num harmonisation nature of the d\nirective means that there is perhaps more of a grey area about whether that can be required in advertising, or whether it can be as prominent as the APR\n. \nThat is an issue that we recognise is probably an\n unintended consequence of the consumer credit d\nirective\n. \nI have written to the Commission, and that is something that we are currently very engaged with the Commission on, to try to get some clarity on that so that the regulators know exactly what they are able to demand of lenders without falling foul of the European law\n. \nIf that ultimately does need to be changed, then I would hope the Commission would look positively at that, for this new type of credit that perhaps was not envisaged when the initial rules on APR were put together.\n&#xa0;\nQ155 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: I do think it is an important area to engage, and to try\n to\n make sure \nthat \nwe have as much control as possible to protect \nUK\n consumers\n. \nJust moving on from that, we have talked a lot today about affordability, and obviously the sector’s charter itself talks a good game on affordability but it is not something that appears\n, \nparticul\narly from the OFT investigation, \nto actually be checked\n as often as it should be\n. \nThe figures were disappointingly low for initial loans, and even lower for rollovers\n. \nWhat difference will the new regulations make, in terms of making sure that affordability really is put front and centre?\nLesley Titcomb: You have come, really, to the crux of the proposals in our consultation paper, which are to ensure proper affordability checking and that loans are only made to those who can afford to repay them\n. \nWhat we are looking at here is a package of measures to drive that\n. \nThere is obviously the proper assessment of affordability\n—what are people’\ns incomings, outgoings, etc.\n—\nbut there are measures on top of that\n, such as\n limiting the number o\nf CPA attempts that can be made. The CPA\n is\n,\n in our view\n,\n one of the incentives that drives firms not to carry out proper affordability assessments: they have no need to, because they know they can dip into a bank account to recover their money\n. \nThat is why you have to think of it as a proposal\n. \nThe key thing, from our point of view, is that we can make rules on this, whereas the OFT has only been able to make guidance underneath the principles that we have that people should be treating their customers fairly, anyway\n. \nWe are also able to devote more resources to monitori\nng against those rules, and taking\n enforcement action where appropriate.\n&#xa0;\nQ156 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: In terms of the monitoring, real-time data collection and shared information around credit would obviously make a huge difference here\n. \nThis is something that we have heard from the debt charities that they would like to s\nee. \nDo you think that is something that is achievable, either on the basis of the industry working together or something that y\nou as a regulator should\n be looking into bring\ning\n about?\nNadege Genetay: Clearly, this is an area where we have said we have an interest\n. \nWe will be looking to the industry; that would be a good reason for the industry to develop real\n­\ntime data \nsharing amongst them\n. \nWe will also be looking at the results of the Competition Commission investigation into the structure of the market\n. If we find that\n we are the people who would be best placed to mandate in this area, that is something we would be prepared to look at.\nJo Swinson: May\n I add to that\n? \nObviously, this is an area that works quite well already within the rest of the credit market\n. We are all familiar with the likes of Experian,\n Equifax and Callcredit, and the fact that when you apply for a credit product, normally you will go through a credit checking procedure\n. \nIt is set up by an industry committee, called the Steering Committee on Reciprocity, or SCOR\n. \nNow, it would be great if they were able to embrace the need for much more dynamic data and information under this very different type of lending, \nand\n,\n as I say, they have got a good track record in other parts of the industry\n. \nLast autumn,\n BIS officials convened a round \ntable on that matter with different people from industry, but it is probably fair to say that there has not been the kind of progress and speed that we might have wanted from \nthe \nindustry on this issue\n. \nIt is definitely something I am pleased that the FCA is\n going to look very seriously \nat, and if it transpired that the FCA was in need of any further powers in order to mandate that, then obviously, \nG\novernment would be very sympathetic to any powers that the independent regulator needed that they feel that they do not have currently.\n&#xa0;\nQ157 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: I am glad to hear you say that, Minister\n. \nWe did hear from StepChange earlier that they had lob\nbied your predecessor \nin your role about this\n,\n and felt that there had not been enough progress, so it is certainly something we would like to see more rapid action on\n. \nThere is a debate, I understand, as to whether the existing \ncredit\n reference agencies can actually achieve this, and whether the industry can achieve this without regulatory intervention, but I am reassured to hear the regulator say that they will consider stepping in if necessary\n. \nIt would be useful\n—and \nperhaps this is something that could be followed up in written evidence\n—to hear about what sort of timeline you see for when that would be needed\n. \nHave we looked at other jurisdictions \nthat \nare looking at using real-time data\n? \nCanada\n, I think, is one example; \nFlorida\n is another one where this has been achieved\n. \nHave you made any analysis of what that does to the market, and how it helps to improve?\nNadege Genetay: We are certainly looking at the experience in other countries\n. \nIndeed, we are making contact with the regulators in those other jurisdictions\n. \nThere is a variety of mechanisms, including enforcement databases as opposed to real-time data\n \nsharing between lenders, and we are interested in understand\ning\n those where they exist.\n&#xa0;\nQ158 &#xa0; \nMr Walker: Just one final question: we heard \na lot of evidence from the debt-\nadvice charities about the problems of people with multiple payday loans, and the fact that that puts people in a completely unsustainable position\n. \nIf this information were available\n—\nif we had real-time data \nsharing, and you could see whether people already had a loan\n—\nwould you support actually banning payday loans being made to someone who already had a payday loan out?\nLesley Titcomb: Again, what we say is it has to be a proper affordability assessment\n. \nWe hear that people’s individual circumstances can vary hugely\n. \nCertainly, multiple loans are a problem\n. \nIt is difficult to see how the second or third loan to somebody who is already having trouble repaying the first is really being lent to someone who can afford to repay\n. \nIt is certainly a very, very strong indicator that the person is in trouble\n. \nSo, should they be going \nthere? \nI would very strongly doubt it\n. \n              Q159 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: Good morning, Minister\n. \nThe OFT found that 28 of the 40 lenders using continuous payment authority failed to explain how it operated, or that borrowers have the right to cancel\n. \nGiven this evidence, should the continuous\n payment \nauthority mechanism be stopped?\nJo Swinson: It obviously very much backs up, or is backed up by, the BIS research that we undertook \nas well in our consumer surveys;\n what was supposed to be happening, in terms of information for consumers about CPA, was not happening\n. \nAs an initial step, I was very pleased to see the FCA getting the banks around the table to make it very clear, so that they understand that if a consumer rings the bank to cancel, then that is one way of doing it\n. I \nthink \nthe continuous payment authority is at the crux of many of the problems within this market\n. \nLesley has already outlined the link to the issues of affordability, which has basically given many payday lenders much less of an incentive to be thorough in their affordability checks, because they have had that ability to dip into customers’ bank accounts and get paid first, almost like a preferred creditor\n. \nI think that the proposal that the FCA have put forward is a very welcome one, because by limiting it to two CPA attempts over the course of the whole loan and it having to be the full amount of the loan that is requested, that rather removes the word “continuous” from “continuous payment authority\n”. It is still a payment authority but\n it is suddenly much more like a direct debit or a one-off payment, because the lender is then incentivised to make sure that they know \nthat \nthere will be \nenough \nto repay that when they take that payment\n. \nWhen you couple that with the limits on rollovers, so that they cannot have a loan that is going on ad infinitum and building up interest charges, suddenly the business model that some payday lenders have been working on is very much changed indeed\n. \nObviously, the Competition Commission might ha\nve more to say on that business-\nmodel point.\n \nI think the CPA restrictions, as proposed, are incredibly welcome.\n&#xa0;\nQ160 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: The real concern, of course, is that this industry has proved very difficult to control, has it not\n? \nOne of the problems is that we are always behind the curve\n. \nWill you do more with regard to regulation, to ensure that we get closer to the curve?\nJo Swinson: It is a really important point that you are making\n. \nIt is a very fast\n­\nmoving industry.\n \nIt has grown hugely in the last few years, and one of the difficulties around the sometimes cumbersome nature of putting legislation in place is the time that it takes from the consultation point to actually getting legislation in place\n. \nThat is why, by having giving very strong, robust powers t\no the FCA, they are much better \nplaced to respond quickly to any changes within the marketplace\n. \nThey can introduce new rules, if necessary, much more quickly than we could introduce legislation\n. That\n gives us a much more flexible way of dealing with the industry.\n&#xa0;\nQ161 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: I take the point about regulation, but it also needs policing.\n \nAre you sure that the policing powers or resources are in place to ensure that we are closer to that curve, as I said?\nJo Swinson: I am very confident that, in the FCA, we have a robust regulator with the resources and the tools and the powers that it needs in order to make sure they are on top of this industry\n. Further to that, obviously, G\novernment wants the independent regulator to be very successful, so if the FCA were to come and say, “We feel that we would need an extra power in this area or that area\n,”\n then \nclearly that is something that G\novernment would \nbe very positive about.\n              Mr Binley: So we have really got a regulator that regulates\n. \nThat is a novel and welcome thought.\n              \nQ162 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: I wonder if I could briefly follow up on that question of CPAs\n. \nThe proposals that the FCA are making are very welcome\n. \nWhen we had a debate back in July, the Minister also made the point that it would be helpful if there was a requirement for three \ndays’ notice of CPAs, and\n \nif, \nat that time, \nan awareness of the right to cancel was drawn to the attention of borrowers\n. \nIt would be helpful if that ended up in the FCA rules\n. \nAre you planning to do that?\nLesley Titcomb: We have not made a specific proposal to that effect at the moment\n. \nObviously, it is out for consultation, and that is one of the things that I know a number of bodies have different tweaks on, that they would like to see\n. \nThat is one that we have heard, for example\n. \nWe will have to weigh those up\n. \nWe absolutely understand that there is a need to make it clearer to people that they have a right to cancel these, and the point that was picked up earlier about the bank’s staff then acting on that\n. \nAlso, there are various triggers we have put in our rules where the lenders have to refer people for debt advice as well, and also we are very clear that they have to be up-front with people about how the CPA is likely to work and when it is likely to be withdrawn, but we have not put the three-day specific point in yet\n. \nDo you want to elaborate on that?\nNadege Genetay: We have certainly carried forward the idea that there needs to be transparency around when the firm is going to take a payment from the consumer\n. \nThe specific right to cancel is not a prominent tool, apart from the broader transparency point.\n&#xa0;\nQ163 &#xa0; \nPaul Blomfield: The one point I will make on rollovers\n—there were a number that I could have made—\nis that we heard concern from the consumer and debt organisations about the way in which the industry repackages debt into new loans\n. \nThe representatives of the industry that we spoke to denied \nthat \nthat happened at all\n. \nWhat measures will you take from the FCA to ensure that that does not happen in the future\n? \nClearly, there is widespread concern\n. \nIt is all very well to limit rollovers to two, but if that debt is then simply repackaged, you have solved nothing.\nLesley Titcomb: We are very clear as a regulator that there are always people who can and will game the rules that we make, and seek to get around them in precisely that sort of way\n. \nThat is why we recognise that \nongoing \nmonitoring and supervision is so important\n. \nWe will be making aspects of what we have heard about today a supervisory priority when we take on regulation next April; for example, concern has been ex\npressed around fees and charges\n as well\n. \nWe recognise that the rule itself is not the answer here\n. \nIt has to be accompanied by strong supervision, monitoring and enforcement where that is necessary\n. \nWhat I can offer you is increased resources and focus on the supervision and monitoring of those rules to prevent precisely that sort of thing.\n&#xa0;\nQ164 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: The FCA proposes that all advertisements and other\n promotions must be clear, fair\n and not misleading\n. \nHow will this b\ne monitored, policed, evaluated\n and enforced?\nLesley Titcomb: I will hand over to Nadege on part of this, but\n may\n I also say that we are also proposing that there has to be a risk warning on adverts, as well.\n&#xa0;\nQ165 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: So a sort of cigarette warning notice?\nLesley Titcomb: Absolutely, which starts, “Think\n: \nIs this loan right for you\n?” \nThat is specifically because the research has shown us that when people are watching these ads, thinking of taking a loan, they are not thinking about their ability to repay in the longer term\n. \nThey are just thinking about the here and now\n. \nThat is why we really want to focus them at that particular point.\n              Mr Binley: Particularly as we have heard that some of these loans are offered to people in casinos, with the money received in quarter of an hour.\nLesley Titcomb: Yes, that was a new one.\n&#xa0;\nQ166 &#xa0; \nMr Binley: That seems frightening to me, quite frankly\n. \nCan I go on to ask a supplementary\n? \nMartin Lewis suggested restrictions on advertising, such as banning adverts on children’s TV\n. \nWhat is the rationale for advertising on children’s TV\n? \nI do not understand that one\n. \nI understand the casino one, but not the children’s television one.\nLesley Titcomb: I am speculating here\n—\n              Mr Binley: You are the expert\n. \nI am looking for advice.\nLesley Titcomb: I am speculating here that there are two reasons\n. \nOne is that mothers will be watching with their children, and the other is the one that Martin quoted, which is pressure from the children on the parents.\n              \nMr Binley: Thank you for that\n. \nThat is interesting.\n&#xa0;\nQ167 &#xa0; \n              Chair: I need to finish now\n. \nI was going to ask the question, “The OFT highlighted a number of phrases \nthat\n it considered misleading; how will the use\n of such phrases be monitored?”\n and also include in that\n \nthe context of text messages\n. \nI think this could be answered in a written form\n. \nObviously, that is directed at the OFT, but if others have opinions on that, that would be welcome\n. \n              \nOn that note, I am conscious of the fact that there are a lot of frustrated questioners, and you may well feel frustrated that you have not been able to have full opportunity to answer everything\n. \nOf course, please feel free to submit further written evidence\n. \nEqually, if we realise that there are questions that we should have asked but did not, we will write to you and ask for a response\n. \nCan I thank you very much\n? T\nhat is very helpful, and we will report as soon as we can on this\n. \nThank you\n. \n              \nOral evidence: Payday Loan Companies\n, HC \n789-i\n              \n              \n2\n Note by witness: Witness subsequently amended this to “Yes, they did”.\n Note by witness:  This was amended to “We have had a limit of three for almost two years”\n Note by witness: Witness subsequently amended this to remove the word “guidelines”\n"
