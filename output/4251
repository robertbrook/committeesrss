defaultHow robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report?default7
default. 
defaultThe conclusions 
defaultof the report 
defaultare graded in terms of probability and confidence. 
defaultWe believe this provides a clear description of the robustness of the conclusions. 
defaultThe most robust conclusions are indicated by high levels 
defaulto
defaultf likelihood and/or confidence. Conversely the 
defaultleast robust 
defaultare assigned low likelihood/confidence.
default 
defaultHow much scope is there to question defaulttdefaulthe report’s conclusions? default8
default. 
defaultThe report draws on the published peer-reviewed literature and as such represents the current scientific understanding, with the conclusions being carefully graded in terms of likelihood/confidence, noting where appropriate the levels of uncertainty.
defaultTo what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?default9
default.
default 
defaultGiven AR5 is a comprehensive synthesi
defaults of the published literature, our judgement is that
default 
defaultthe report
default accurately reflects the views of the vast majority of professional climate scientists who are actively working the field.
defaultCan any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?default&#xa0;default default10
default. 
defaultThis depends on how one defines “settled”
default.
default In its purest interpretation, no area of science is ever settled since the scientific method 
defaultalways 
defaultallows for new evidence to overturn previously established theories. 
defaultTo
default 
defaultprovide readers with an accurate assessment of the state of scientific understanding
default, 
defaultthe report 
defaultqualifies many of its conclusions with 
defaultlevels of certainty 
defaultin the form of likelihood/confidence. 
defaultThe report 
defaultalso 
defaultmakes some unqualified statements when justified, for example, the Summary for Policymakers states that “Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the surface than any preceding decade since the 1850s” and “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal”.
default 
defaultWhat areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?default11
default. 
defaultScientific research is an on
default-going process that 
defaultattempt
defaults
default to reduce 
defaultthe levels of uncertainty in all
default 
defaultrelevant 
defaultarea
defaults. I
defaultt is important to note that in some instances it is reasonable to anticipate that further research may reduce the range of uncertainty, whereas in others the uncerta
defaultinty is a fundamental property (
defaultfor example there will always be a 
default50%
default chance of 
defaulttossing a “head” on an unbiased coin
default)
default. 
defaultThere are on-going efforts to narrow the range of uncertainty
default, for example,
default in a measure of the climate response with feedbacks to a change in atmospher
defaultic carbon dioxide concentration
default known as the “climate sensitivity”. 
defaultA key area of climate research where it is anticipated that further progress will reduce uncertainties is in the prediction of the regional detail of climate change
default.
defaultHow effective is AR5 and the summarydefault for policymakers in conveyingdefault&#xa0;defaultwhat is meant by defaultuncertainty in scientific termsdefault? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?default12
default. 
defaultIn general it is 
defaultchalle
defaultnging to communicate the 
defaultscientific 
defaultmeaning of 
defaultthe words 
default“uncertainty” 
defaultand “risk” because they differ
default 
defaultin subtle ways 
defaultfrom the
default 
defaultcommon-us
defaultes
default of the word
defaults, and indeed the words are used in subtly different ways in other fields such as 
defaulteconomics. 
defaultGiven this, it is always worth testing and evaluating whether statements have been interpreted as intended and exploring alternative ways of communicating. 
defaultThe 
defaultfull 
defaultAR5 
defaultreport including
default 
defaultthe summary for policymakers us

default”
default 
defaultbased around likelihood/confidence quan
defaulttifiers
default as described in the published guidance note on the consistent treatment of uncertainties.
default 
defaultWe note that a
defaultn assessment of “risk” would typically incorporate information that is beyond the scope of WG1, but within the scope of WG2 and WG3.
defaultDoes the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?default13
default. 
defaultThe R
defaulteport devotes 
defaultChapter 9 to 
defaulta comprehensive
default, balanced and realistic
default 
defaultevaluation of climate models
default which is based on the published literature and draws extensively on the results of the 
defaultCoupled Model 
defaultIntercomparison
default Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).
default As stated in the report
default (Chapter 9, final draft)
default c
defaultlimate models are based on physical principles, and they reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. We agree with the report when it states that both these aspects contribute to 
defaulta
default 
default“
defaultconfidence in the models’ suitability for their application in detection and attribution studies and for quantitative future predictions and projections
default”, and when it notes that “w
defaulthereas weather and seasonal climate predictions can be regularly verified, climate projections spanning a century or more cannot. This is particularly the case as anthropogenic forcing is driving the climate system toward conditions not previously observed in the instrumental record, and it will always be a limitation.”
defaultHas AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?default1
default4
default. T
defaulthe report summarised the scientific understanding of recent 
defaultglobal 
defaultaverage 
defaultsurface 
defaulttemperature change as described in the published literature
default up to the WG1 publication acceptance cut-off date of 15 March 2013
default. This outlined the factors 
defaultthought 
defaultmost likely to have contributed to recent changes. This
default is an 
defaulton-going and 
defaultactive area of research 
default(see for example 
default“
defaultCoverage bias in the HadCRUT4 temperature series and its impact on recent temperature trends” by 
defaultCowtan
default and Way in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society
default,

default.
defaultDo the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? default1
default5
default. 
defaultThe 
defaultscientific conclusions of the WG1 report 
defaultprovide an evidence base for input into economic 
defaultdiscussions
default. 
defaultI
defaultn the majority of instances, the 
defaultscientific 
defaultconclusions of the AR5 WG1 report are strengthened compared with 
defaultprevious reports
default in the sense that the conclusions have remained broadly similar but are now supported by more evidence.
default The WG1 report does not comment on the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change and this is outside the regime of expertise of the Royal Meteorological Society.
defaultIs the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientdefaultific knowledge? Or has it focusdefaulted on providing a justification for political commitment?default1
default6
default. 
defaultWe believe that th
defaulte IPCC process provides a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent
default assessment of the state of scientific knowledge.
default 
defaultWe note that 
defaultthe 
defaultprocess involves
default 
defaulta significant commitment from the scientific community with
default the voluntary contribution of many thousands of scientists worldwide
default. We argue that it is vital that this commitment acts to stimulate scientific research 
defaultrather than placing a burden that may hinder scientific progress
default and that the IPCC process, or a
defaultny modification to 
defaultit, must ensure this.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultIPCC 
defaultreports are neutral with respect to policy
default,
default being policy-relevant but never policy-prescriptive.
default 
defaultBy endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content.
default 
defaultWhat relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? default1
default7
default.
default 
defaultThe report concluded that “Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.” It also concluded “
defaultCumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.” We suggest that both these conclusions may be of relevance to the review of the fourth Carbon Budget.
