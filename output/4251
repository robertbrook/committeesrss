[normal]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis report?[bold]7
[normal]. 
[normal]The conclusions 
[normal]of the report 
[normal]are graded in terms of probability and confidence. 
[normal]We believe this provides a clear description of the robustness of the conclusions. 
[normal]The most robust conclusions are indicated by high levels 
[normal]o
[normal]f likelihood and/or confidence. Conversely the 
[normal]least robust 
[normal]are assigned low likelihood/confidence.
[normal] 
[normal]How much scope is there to question [bold]t[bold]he report’s conclusions? [bold]8
[normal]. 
[normal]The report draws on the published peer-reviewed literature and as such represents the current scientific understanding, with the conclusions being carefully graded in terms of likelihood/confidence, noting where appropriate the levels of uncertainty.
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range of views among climate scientists?[bold]9
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Given AR5 is a comprehensive synthesi
[normal]s of the published literature, our judgement is that
[normal] 
[normal]the report
[normal] accurately reflects the views of the vast majority of professional climate scientists who are actively working the field.
[normal]Can any of the areas of the science now be considered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?[bold]&#xa0;[bold] [bold]10
[normal]. 
[normal]This depends on how one defines “settled”
[normal].
[normal] In its purest interpretation, no area of science is ever settled since the scientific method 
[normal]always 
[normal]allows for new evidence to overturn previously established theories. 
[normal]To
[normal] 
[normal]provide readers with an accurate assessment of the state of scientific understanding
[normal], 
[normal]the report 
[normal]qualifies many of its conclusions with 
[normal]levels of certainty 
[normal]in the form of likelihood/confidence. 
[normal]The report 
[normal]also 
[normal]makes some unqualified statements when justified, for example, the Summary for Policymakers states that “Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the surface than any preceding decade since the 1850s” and “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal”.
[normal] 
[normal]What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?[bold]11
[normal]. 
[normal]Scientific research is an on
[normal]-going process that 
[normal]attempt
[normal]s
[normal] to reduce 
[normal]the levels of uncertainty in all
[normal] 
[normal]relevant 
[normal]area
[normal]s. I
[normal]t is important to note that in some instances it is reasonable to anticipate that further research may reduce the range of uncertainty, whereas in others the uncerta
[normal]inty is a fundamental property (
[normal]for example there will always be a 
[normal]50%
[normal] chance of 
[normal]tossing a “head” on an unbiased coin
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]There are on-going efforts to narrow the range of uncertainty
[normal], for example,
[normal] in a measure of the climate response with feedbacks to a change in atmospher
[normal]ic carbon dioxide concentration
[normal] known as the “climate sensitivity”. 
[normal]A key area of climate research where it is anticipated that further progress will reduce uncertainties is in the prediction of the regional detail of climate change
[normal].
[normal]How effective is AR5 and the summary[bold] for policymakers in conveying[bold]&#xa0;[bold]what is meant by [bold]uncertainty in scientific terms[bold]? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?[bold]12
[normal]. 
[normal]In general it is 
[normal]challe
[normal]nging to communicate the 
[normal]scientific 
[normal]meaning of 
[normal]the words 
[normal]“uncertainty” 
[normal]and “risk” because they differ
[normal] 
[normal]in subtle ways 
[normal]from the
[normal] 
[normal]common-us
[normal]es
[normal] of the word
[normal]s, and indeed the words are used in subtly different ways in other fields such as 
[normal]economics. 
[normal]Given this, it is always worth testing and evaluating whether statements have been interpreted as intended and exploring alternative ways of communicating. 
[normal]The 
[normal]full 
[normal]AR5 
[normal]report including
[normal] 
[normal]the summary for policymakers us
[normal]es
[normal] a standardised framew
[normal]ork for describing 
[normal]“
[normal]uncertaint
[normal]y
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]based around likelihood/confidence quan
[normal]tifiers
[normal] as described in the published guidance note on the consistent treatment of uncertainties.
[normal] 
[normal]We note that a
[normal]n assessment of “risk” would typically incorporate information that is beyond the scope of WG1, but within the scope of WG2 and WG3.
[normal]Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?[bold]13
[normal]. 
[normal]The R
[normal]eport devotes 
[normal]Chapter 9 to 
[normal]a comprehensive
[normal], balanced and realistic
[normal] 
[normal]evaluation of climate models
[normal] which is based on the published literature and draws extensively on the results of the 
[normal]Coupled Model 
[normal]Intercomparison
[normal] Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).
[normal] As stated in the report
[normal] (Chapter 9, final draft)
[normal] c
[normal]limate models are based on physical principles, and they reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. We agree with the report when it states that both these aspects contribute to 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]confidence in the models’ suitability for their application in detection and attribution studies and for quantitative future predictions and projections
[normal]”, and when it notes that “w
[normal]hereas weather and seasonal climate predictions can be regularly verified, climate projections spanning a century or more cannot. This is particularly the case as anthropogenic forcing is driving the climate system toward conditions not previously observed in the instrumental record, and it will always be a limitation.”
[normal]Has AR5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?[bold]1
[normal]4
[normal]. T
[normal]he report summarised the scientific understanding of recent 
[normal]global 
[normal]average 
[normal]surface 
[normal]temperature change as described in the published literature
[normal] up to the WG1 publication acceptance cut-off date of 15 March 2013
[normal]. This outlined the factors 
[normal]thought 
[normal]most likely to have contributed to recent changes. This
[normal] is an 
[normal]on-going and 
[normal]active area of research 
[normal](see for example 
[normal]“

[normal]Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change? [bold]1
[normal]5
[normal]. 
[normal]The 
[normal]scientific conclusions of the WG1 report 
[normal]provide an evidence base for input into economic 
[normal]discussions
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]n the majority of instances, the 
[normal]scientific 
[normal]conclusions of the AR5 WG1 report are strengthened compared with 
[normal]previous reports
[normal] in the sense that the conclusions have remained broadly similar but are now supported by more evidence.
[normal] The WG1 report does not comment on the economic case for action to prevent dangerous climate change and this is outside the regime of expertise of the Royal Meteorological Society.
[normal]Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scient[bold]ific knowledge? Or has it focus[bold]ed on providing a justification for political commitment?[bold]1
[normal]6
[normal]. 
[normal]We believe that th
[normal]e IPCC process provides a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent
[normal] assessment of the state of scientific knowledge.
[normal] 
[normal]We note that 
[normal]the 
[normal]process involves
[normal] 
[normal]a significant commitment from the scientific community with
[normal] the voluntary contribution of many thousands of scientists worldwide
[normal]. We argue that it is vital that this commitment acts to stimulate scientific research 
[normal]rather than placing a burden that may hinder scientific progress
[normal] and that the IPCC process, or a
[normal]ny modification to 
[normal]it, must ensure this.
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]IPCC 
[normal]reports are neutral with respect to policy
[normal],
[normal] being policy-relevant but never policy-prescriptive.
[normal] 
[normal]By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their scientific content.
[normal] 
[normal]What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the review of the fourth Carbon Budget? [bold]1
[normal]7
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The report concluded that “Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.” It also concluded “
[normal]Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.” We suggest that both these conclusions may be of relevance to the review of the fourth Carbon Budget.
