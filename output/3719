[normal]Written evidence [bold]from [bold] by[bold] James [bold]Derounian[bold] (CYS0013)[bold]Thank you for this opportunity to make a submission; it is appreciated.
[normal]I want to make a 
[normal]single,
[normal] and forceful point: I would like to see that the wearing of cycle helmets becomes 
[normal]compulsory[bold].
[normal]Having experienced a near-death experience, when a motorist crashed in to me from behind – causing me to be thrown in to a ditch – my cyc
[normal]le helmet split in 3 places (but fortunately I walked away with just a broken nose &amp; shock). I am certain that I would be dead, were it not for the fact that my helmet absorbed most of the impact.
[normal]Thank you for considering this.
