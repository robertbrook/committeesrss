[[[)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The British Heart Foundation (BHF) is the nation’s leading heart charity. We are working to achieve our mission of a world in which no-one dies prematurely of heart disease in the UK. We fund ground-breaking medical research, provide support and care to people living with heart disease and advocate for change. We rely on donations from the public to fund our life saving work. Although we are currently funding medical research that may one day render the need for heart transplants obsolete, until then a heart transplant is the only effective treatment available for people with end-stage heart failure. &#xa0;The BHF warmly welcomes the opportunity to respond to this Inquiry. We are currently calling for the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation. We believe that this will help address the UK’s organ donor shortage and better reflect the public wishes. We know that nine out of ten people support organ donation yet only three out of ten go on to sign the Organ Donor Register (ODR). Changing the way we register consent can help close this gap and consequently make more organs available for transplantation. However this is not a magic bullet. The introduction of a soft opt-out system must be accompanied by both investment in infrastructure and resources and a public awareness campaign. All three elements need to be undertaken together to first; secure more organs and second; accommodate additional organs and a subsequent rise in transplant operations. &#xa0;&#xa0;We welcome the strength of four ambitious targets set within the strategy, particularly the target of increasing familial consent rates from 57 per cent to in excess of 80 per cent. We are also pleased to see that the strategy states that having the conversation with your loved ones is vital to improving donor and consent rates. The BHF also calls for more people to make their wishes known to their loved ones, as this will help make a difficult decision at a difficult time easier for families, regardless of whether an opt-in or soft opt-out system is in place. We welcome NHS Blood and Transplant’s (NHSBT) plans to run an ambitious public awareness campaign focused on changing the behaviour of the nation towards organ donation. By encouraging the conversation it’s hoped that the perceived taboo around discussing organ donation will be broken down and that organ donation will become a normal part of life both inside and out of hospital. Again, we are pleased to see that the strategy also acknowledges that a review of the end of life pathway is needed to ensure that all opportunities to secure a donor are maximised in a sensitive and timely way. &#xa0;Similarly, another strength is the focus on the differing cultural barriers to donation that arise within Black and Minority Ethnic communities (BME).  BME communities make up 7.8 per cent of the UK population but only make up 2 per cent of the organ donor register.  We know that those from Black and South Asian communities are three times more likely to need an organ transplant. Research shows that common barriers to donation within BME communities include; religious beliefs, anxieties, traditions, myths and lack of information. Therefore the strategy’s focus on tackling these barriers in a specialised way is much needed and to be welcomed. &#xa0;Finally, the BHF also supports the review of the IT systems used across the donor network.  Anything that makes the process of donor and recipient matching faster and more effective is to be welcomed. &#xa0;However, the one significant weakness of the strategy is that is does not include or discuss the introduction of a soft opt-out system of organ donation. Instead the strategy is very cautious about discussing opt-out and instead notes that NHSBT will maintain a watching brief on what happens with the introduction of legislation in Wales. &#xa0;However, we believe a system change is much needed. Under the current system 466 people died last year because they did not receive an organ in time, with a further 766 removed from the list as their condition had deteriorated past the point of possible transplantation. The demand for heart transplants has risen by 89 per cent since 2004. International data shows that an opt-out system is associated with higher donation rates and several studies suggest that it would increase the numbers of organs available for transplantation by up to 30 per cent in the UK. Expanding this model and projection to the UK would see a potential increase of between 250 and 315 donors in the UK as a whole. Taking into consideration that one donor can transform up to nine lives, the potential number of lives saved or improved would be significant. Also, previous cost-benefit analysis of the introduction of a soft opt-out system shows it to be a cost-effective treatment. This takes into account the reduction in medical management of conditions for those waiting for organs and the significant psychological gains for patients that no longer have to receive on-going medical management and have of the chance of longer term survival.,&#xa0;The change in system would also prompt a step change in the way that the public talk about organ donation. We have already highlighted how important it is that people have the conversation with their families and loved ones to make their wishes known. However we hope that completely overhauling the system would prompt that conversation to take place on a wider scale. Publicity campaigns have run before across the UK, and yet we still do not have enough donors on the ODR. Therefore changing the way that we register consent should be a catalyst for this conversation.&#xa0;As noted this change must be accompanied by investment in infrastructure, In the BHF’s 2013 report ‘Making opt-out a reality in Wales’ we identified a number of areas for development that are key in maximising a soft opt-out system: staff training; increasing the numbers of transplant co-ordinators and specialist organ donation nurses; removing financial barriers to hospitals and effective management of donors through a national agency for transplantation. This would ensure that there is a system fit for practice to accommodate extra organs and transplant operations, as well as maximising the opportunity to  secure more donors in a timely and sensitive way. &#xa0;In addition, it is very welcome that NHSBT will be engaging the public in future ideas. However, the BHF strongly opposes the suggestion that those who are on the ODR would get priority treatment if they need a transplant, as suggested in the strategy as a possible option. The BHF strongly believes that donor organs should be distributed on clinical need alone.&#xa0;&#xa0;Although we must always express caution when making direct comparisons between countries which have different cultures and variables there is a great deal of evidence from countries such as Croatia, Norway and Belgium that show increases in donation rates following  a move to an opt-out system together with investment in infrastructure and raising public awareness of organ donation. For example in Norway, where an opt-out system has operated since 1973, there has been significant investment in the infrastructure – with Europe’s largest single transplant centre based in Oslo and five transplant co-ordinators to aid retrieval across the country. Norway’s rate of donation in 2011 was 24.5 per million population (pmp), which was well above the European average. In Belgium the rate of organ donation increased from 19 to 41 pmp three years after the introduction of opt-out legislation.  &#xa0;The Croatian model provides a clear example that a move to opt-out alone would not provide the much needed organ increase. In 2000, Croatia had one of the lowest donor rates pmp in Europe at just 2.7 pmp despite moving to an opt-out system 12 years previously. Yet after a period of significant investment by 2011 Croatia had one of the highest rates of donation in Europe of 33.6 pmp.  To achieve this, there was heavy investment in developing an ‘in-house’ transplant co-ordinator network in all hospitals which improved donor detection and management of potential donors. This approach also helped to reduce family refusal rate to 20 per cent, which is less than half of the UK’s current refusal rate. A 24 hour helpline was set up at the Ministry of Health to support transplant co-ordinators deliver a speedy and efficient donor-transplant process. Furthermore there has been significant investment in public awareness campaigns organised by the Ministry of Health and non-governmental organisations such as the Croatian Donor Network. There has also been continuous education and organ donor card promotion. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; NHS Blood and Transplant (2013) ‘organ donation infographics’ http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/campaigns/campaign-materials.asp   NHS Blood and Transplant (2013)  ‘Transplant Activity Report’ http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/statistics/transplant_activity_report/current_activity_reports/ukt/activity_report_2012_13.pdf  ACORN Statistics http://acorn.caci.co.uk/  NHS Blood and Transplant (2013) ‘organ donation infographics’ http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/campaigns/campaign-materials.asp   NHS Blood and Transplant (2013) Campaign materials. http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/campaigns/campaign-materials.asp   Sims, J et al.
