Importantly\n,\n even where testing is taking place\n,\n many patients are not achieving the recommended target range for risk factors\n.\n More must be done to address this\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA wide variation in the treat\nment and management of diabetes\n across England \nremains\n.\n \n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are geographical inequalities across the UK in CHD mortality and this is often worse in areas of highest deprivation\n. \n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAnother example of a national health inequality exists in the diagnosis and management of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) \nor ‘inherited high cholesterol’ across the devolved nations\n.\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent NHS Information Centre on the ‘Use of NICE appraised medicines in the NHS in England -2010 and 2011, Experimental Statistics\n’\n showed that there was a variation in utilisation of medicines for long-term conditions. For example\n,\n \nthe\n \nratio of observed to expected usage of a NICE-approved \nnon-statin \ncholesterol management therapy in the London SHA was approximately 0.6 in 2010 and 0.55 in 2011 versus nearly 0.9 in 2010 and nearly 0.8 in 2011 in the South East Coast SHA\n.\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess restrictions to NICE approved medicines remains a problem at local formulary level, which can lead to postcode prescribing which reinfo\nrces healthcare inequalities\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNHS spending on diabetes was almost £10 billion in 2011, which was 10 per cent of the NHS budget. 80 per cent of NHS spending on diabetes goes into managing avoidable complications. People with diabetes account for around 19 per cent of hospital inpatients at any one time, and have a three day longer stay on average than people without diabetes. Most of type 2 diabetes c\nosts are due to hospitalisation.\n3\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMore effective risk factor management in the community has the potential to reduce costs to the NHS\n, while \nimproving quality of care\n.\n3.2.1.\n \nEvidence into Practi\nce (\nEiP\n) is a\n clinical change manag\nement programme\n. The \nprogramme\n \naims to ensure that people with diabetes and those at increased cardio-metabolic risk receive \noptimal care\n through the effective implementation of national policy and guidelines, particularly NICE Type 2 Diabetes Guidelines\n. \nAn example of the success of this approach was demonstrated in Greenwich. R\nesults after one year show\ned\n that in practices who took up the programme \na\n significant improve\nment in patients achieving NICE-recommended\n risk factor targets \nwere\n achieved \nand substantial \noverall cost-\nsavings\n \nwere demonstrated \ndue to \na reduction in hospital admission rates\n. NICE have endorsed EiP as a proven case study for QIPP. NICE concluded that the programme scored 100% for evidence of change and 75% fo\nr both savings made and quality.\n \nThis approach e\nnabl\ned\n the delivery of higher standards of care at\n a lower overall cost to the NHS\n.\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, current national QIPP\n standards \noften\n focus on short-term drug budget savings \nthrough prescribing indicators \nrather than\n encouraging\n optimising medicines in line with NICE quality standards, guidelines and recommendations.\n3.3.1.\n \nFor example, although the NICE Type 2 Diabetes guideline (CG\n87\n)\n outlines a number of treatment pathways based on\n individual patient profile utilising older and newer therapies appropriately, the QIPP prescribing comparator for diabetes is \nsolely \nbased on the use of low cost drugs relative to newer therapies\n.\n3.3.2.\n \nMedicine optimisation is about ensuring the right patients get the right choice of medicine at the right time and how patients comply. \nNational measure of quality such as QIPP \nprescribing comparators \nand other outcome indicators \nshould be focussed around NICE\n quality standards and guidance\n \nrather than\n stand-alone\n \ncomparators that may encourage \nshort-term savings that \ncould\n have unintended\n costly\n consequences.\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInconsistencies exist in national guidance for treating patients and how GPs are incentivised\n,\n \n4.1.1.\n \nFor example, \nIn \nthe \nNICE \nType 2 Diabetes Guideline (\nCG\n \n87)\n11\n \nit\n states, “\nConsider intensifying cholesterol-lowering therapy (with a more effective statin or\n cholesterol absorption inhibitor) in line with NICE guidance\n if there is existing or newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease, or if there is an increased albumin excretion rate, to achieve a total cholesterol level below 4.0 mmol/litre (and HDL cholesterol not exceeding 1.4 mmol/litre) or an LDL cholesterol level below 2.0 mmol/litre.”\n4.1.2.\n \nHowever, the Quality Outcomes Framework \nthat incentivises\n GP states: The percentage of patients with diabetes, on the register, whose last measured total cholesterol (measured within the preceding 12 months) is 5 mmol/l or less and has an activity threshold of 40-75%\n.\n4.1.3.\n \nThe European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines are even more stringent than\n UK \nNICE \nguidelines \nfor very high risk patients\n,\n \nthey recommend \nan LDL-C goal of 1.8 mmol/litre and/or 50% reduction when target level cannot be reached\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe impact \nof factors \non quality of life &amp; productivity \n(such as \nthe \npotential \nimpact of \nhypoglycaemia in Type 2 diabetes) \nshould \nbe \nrecognised\n, researched\n and acknowledged within NHS measures \nof long-term condition management \nquality \nthroughout the system\n. \n4.2.1.\n \nFor example, \nDVLA guidelines\n \nstate \nfor people with \ndiabetes\n \nwhen treated with medication other than insulin which carries a risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (including sulphonylureas and gl\ninides), the following standard\n \napplies in order to retain a driving \nlicenc\ne:\n&#xa0;\nClass 2 Drivers (buses and lorries)&#xa0;\nClass 1 Drivers (cars and motorcycles)&#xa0;\nThe impact of hypoglycaemia on a person who is a professional driver or who drives regularly could be very significant on both quality of life and productivity\n if \nhypoglycaemia leads to losing\n their licenc\ne\n.\nSimilarly, \ni\nn the elderly\n e\nven a mild episode of hypoglycaemia may lead to adverse outcomes in frail elderly patients. For example, episodes of dizziness or weakness increase the risk of falls and fracture\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nNICE Quality Standard for Diabetes\n recognises the importance of hypoglycaemia and includes a measure that states:\n \n‘People with diabetes who have experienced hypoglycaemia requiring medical attention are referred to a specialist diabetes team’\n.\n&#xa0;\nQuality measures recognising factors such as h\nypoglycaemia monitoring \nand/\nor management\n, \nshould \nalso \nbe\n incentiv\nised in QOF and\n CCG Outcome Indicators\n.\n              5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nlthough testing, such as the 9 Key Care Processes for Diabetes\n, are important\n testing alone cannot make a difference to outcome, healthcare professionals need to ensure action is taken on the results of tests to ensure that people’s \nlong-term condition\n and risk-factors are being managed effectively\n3\n. Quality measures and outcome indicators throughout the NHS system \n(e.g. CCG outcome indicators) \nshould reflect this.\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example in diabetes,\n even where testing is taking place, many patients are not achieving the recommended target range for risk factors (e.g. although 90% of Type 2 Diabetes patients are having their HbA1c and cholesterol tested, only 60% are achieving target HbA1c levels and only 40% are achieving their target cholesterol level in England)\n3\n.\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to education of the patient\n \nand care planning \nis of paramount importance\n3\n.\n \nA patient should be informed and enabled to take a role in self-management of diabetes risk-factors and understand factors such as the importance of optimal blood glucose control in order\n to avoid serious complications.\n&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith the dissolution of NHS Diabetes, there is a gap in support &amp; education for development of commissioning for diabetes services at the very time when it is most needed. \n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere \nare\n a wide number of data sets available for CVD and diabetes but they are often difficult to interpret and support is required on how to utilise these and help in practical implementation of commissioning\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst Diabetes (Derbyshire) is a current of example of how integrated care can provide real improvements in care for diabetic patients, whist reducing admission rates\n.\n \n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSee \nearlier example of EiP\n9\n example, paragraph \n3.2.1\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiabetes cost approximately £ 23.7bn in the UK in 2010/2011: £ 9.8bn in direct costs (£1bn for Type 1 diabetes and £ 8.8bn for Type 2 diabetes) and £ 13.9bn in indirect costs (£ 0.9bn and £ 13bn). In real terms, the 2035/2036 cost is estimated at £ 39.8bn: £ 16.9bn in direct costs (£ 1.8bn for Type 1 diabetes and £ 15.1bn for Type 2 diabetes) and £ 22.9bn in indirect costs (£ 2.4bn and £ 20.5bn\n)\n. \n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is key that \nthere is \na shift in focus \nfrom short-term cost-cutting in the community-setting \nto more efficient use of NHS resources\n,\n \nby effective\n prevention,\n diagnosis and \nrisk-factor \nmanagement to avoid costly complications and hospital treatment\n.\n This should be supported by appropriate measu\nrement and outcome indicators.\n&#xa0;May 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/141273/9387-2900853-CVD-Outcomes_web1.pdf.pdf (last accessed 9 May 2013)\n http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60355-4/abstract (last accessed 9 May 2013)\n http://www.diabetes.org.uk/Documents/Reports/State-of-the-Nation-2012.pdf (last accessed 9 May 2013)\n www.rightcare.nhs.uk/index.php/atlas/diabetes (last accessed 9 May 2013)\n www.heartuk.org.uk/latest-news/article/cholesterol-and-a-healthier-nation(last accessed 9 May 2013)\n Saving Lives, Saving Families.
