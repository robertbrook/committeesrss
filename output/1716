defaultTo date, jointly with National Grid Carbon as developer of the transportation and sal

defaultThe project was on track to be operational and providing 900MW of new-build, incremental low-carbon power in 2016.

default technologies is ready to be deployed at scale today.  
defaultExperience of deployment of the technologies will be the best way to identify the areas that will benefit most from further research and development.

defaultFurther substantial volumes of CO

default&#xa0;
defaultAside from the environmental benefits of substantial reductions in CO
default2
default emissions, t
defaulthere are substantial potential benefits to the UK economy from the deployment of CCS technology:  CCS is not simply a cost
default.  CCS needs to be deployed widely around the world and although a few countries such as the USA and Canada are already proceeding with a small number of projects, the UK’s CfD mechanism offers 
defaultboth 
defaultsupport beyond single demonstration plants and the opport
defaultunity for the UK to 
defaultgain advantages from being an early mover.   
default&#xa0;
defaultThe benefits of CCS range from the opportunity to build domestically and in international markets, a global leadership in the CCS industry, which if deployed extensively globally cold rival
default the oil and gas industry in the sale of investment involved.   The employment and trade benefits to the UK would be extensive.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe USA has used CO

default for Enhanced Oil Recovery for more than 30 years and today some 6% of US oil production is produced this w
defaultay.  The UK’s North Sea oil industry has a large 
defaultnumber of oil fields that are at a point in their life where the use of CO
default2
default for EOR and storage could significantly increase the proportion of oil that can be recovered.   If widely used, this technology cou
defaultld deliver billions of pounds of incremental tax revenue to The Treasury and extend the life of oil fields with all the associated employment and security of energy supply benefits that flow from that.

default firms to be £3-6.
default5bn per annum in the late 2020s but the case for CCS would be better understood and appreciated if there was a comprehensive analysis of the economic, fiscal and social benefits of CCS.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principal barrier to the development of large-scale integrated CCS projects is the lack of the policy i
defaultncentives with sufficient long term certainty that will make what are multi-billion projects bankable.  The UK is addressing this with the creation of Contracts for Difference under the Electricity Market reform process.  However, EMR does not provided any
default clarity on longer term CCS objectives.  The draft Delivery Plan released in July includes scenarios which show anything from virtually no CCS projects through to a possible 12GW by 2030 whereas 
defaultgreater clarity exists for 
defaultrenewable technologies
default.
default 
default  The
default lack
default of clarity
default around support for CCS also extends to a lack
default of guidance on a CfD price setting and allocation process for CCS projects. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe technologies needed for the construction and operation of large scale CCS projects - carbon capture, CO
default2
default transporta
defaulttion and storage – are all proven at scale in different industries around the world and do not require further development to be used in the first large scale CCS projects.  It is the integration of these technologies to create a new CCS industry that is n
defaultovel.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default capturing, transporting and storage of CO
default2
default are all activities that are already carried out safely at scale in different industries around the world. 
default 
defaultThe 
defaultEU 
defaultCCS Directive, implemented by the UK, has already put in place the framework for the regulation of the industry.  The Directive may be
default review
defaulted and
default possibly revised as early as
default 2015. 
defaultWhile there are concerns in the industry about 
defaultonerou
defaults and unpredictable liabilities 
defaulton CO
default2
default storage 
defaultin saline formations in the EU, 2Co does not anticipate the issue causing the same concerns where the CO
default2
default is used 
defaultfor Enhanced Oil Recovery and storage.

default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe majority of CCS projects
default that are making the most progress
default share at least three of four aspects of what is an emerging business model for early stage CSS projects:-
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA capital grant to assist with project development and possibly as a contribution to capital expenditure (examples include the EU (EEPR and NER300 pr
defaultogrammes), UK, Canada and USA).
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEnhanced Oil Recovery 
defaultto reduce the overall costs of CCS by offering low, or zero, cost CO
default2
default storage.  In some onshore situations, such as the USA, 
defaultrather than acting as a cost to the project it is a commodity with a value 
defaultand can be sold.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment backed debt as an important source of funding and to reduce the costs of financing.  For instance, there have been Federal backed loans available in the USA and export credit agencies (such as Japanese and Chinese) are active.  
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA premium price for the cost of the low-carbon electricity that will support the operation of the plant.  The UK’s Contract for Difference
default is an example.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs both the original plans for a CCS project at Peterhead and the UK government’s first CCS competition failed to lead to the construction of the UK’s first CCS large-scale CCS project, industry is wary.  
defaultThe current government has also scale
defaultd back its ambition for support for four projects to a maximum of two.  
defaultThe approach in the roadmap also seems to lack pace and scale.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Commercialisation Programme and work on follow-on projects need to move in parallel.  If there is a hiatus after t
defaulthe commercialisation programme, the opportunities afforded by early mover advantage will be lost, companies will dis-band CCS teams and move activity overseas and it will take the UK years to re-establish the skills and experience that have been nurtured t
defaulto date.  In order to justify continued investment, the CCS industry needs a clear signal there will be a CCS market in the long term in the UK. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf project partners and investors are to be comfortable about committing additional funds in projects that are
default not part of the Commercialisation Programme, 
defaultthey will quickly 
defaultneed greater clarity around the process and timing of support under the CfD mechanism
default.
default  These projects need the EMR process to establish a predictable CCS CfD strike price setting and allocati
defaulton process that offers a bankable CfD for CCS.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf widespread deployment of CCS in the UK does not start now the costs of meeting UK 
defaultemissions reduction targets w
defaultill be significantly higher than
default would otherwise be the case.  Delaying deployment of CCS until the 2020s or 2030s and trying to deploy CCS at a faster rate would stretch supply chains and drive up costs considerably.  
defaultGiven t
defaulthe technologies used in CCS are all proven at scale around the world, 2Co does not foresee CCS failing 
defaulttechnically.
default  The company’s detailed estimates of costs also give 2Co confidence CCS is a cost competitive source of low-carbon power.  The 
defaultprincipal ris
defaultk to the success of CCS is a lack of pace and scale in CCS policy and whether the CfD for CCS will be fit for purpose.
defaultFossil fuels 
defaultstill account for the majority of power generated in the 
defaultUK and 
defaultare an important part of a robust and diverse electricity su
defaultpply for the country.
default  
defaultCCS is the only way to secure the future of the UK’s coal mining and coal power industries and also the longer term future for the natural gas power generation industry while also meeting the UK’s legally binding emissions reduction 
defaulttargets.  
defaultWith CCS
default,
default fossil fuels can fill an important role in meeting
default th
defaulte energy demands of a low-carbon future
default – both as baseload power and as flexible power to balance the intermittency of renewables
