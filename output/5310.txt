[[[Brake, the road safety charity]]]

[[[About Brake]]]Brake is an independent charity working across the UK to make roads safer, prevent road death and injury, and care for road crash victims. Brake carries out research into public attitudes, experiences and behaviour in relation to road safety, disseminates international research to road safety and fleet professionals, engages schools and communities to spread road safety education, runs public awareness and policy campaigns nationally and supports communities campaigning for road safety. It is also a national, government-funded provider of specialist support for people bereaved and seriously injured in road crashes, running a national helpline and providing information packs that are handed to bereaved families by police following every road death.

[[[Response]]]Increased levels of cycling and walking provide significant health, environmental, economic, and community benefits, but road danger poses a major barrier to active travel. Brake’s own research suggests 35% of people could be convinced to commute by bike if routes were safer. Road danger creates a barrier not only to people choosing walking and cycling as a transport choice to get from A to B, but also to people, particularly children and families, simply being able to ‘get out and about’ and walk and cycle in their neighbourhood for leisure, exercise and social reasons. A 2012 Brake survey found many children are prevented from walking and cycling due to parents’ fears for their safety . Conversely, studies show that where measures are implemented to offer greater protection and safe passage for people on foot and bike, it can lead to significant rises in walking and cycling,. &#xa0;If the government and local authorities want to increase levels of cycling, which is good for health and the environment, they must make improving safety for vulnerable road users a priority. Brake argues that improving safety for cyclists and pedestrians goes hand-in-hand, and advocates a holistic and ambitious approach from government towards safer streets, communities and routes for walking and cycling.&#xa0;Evidence shows that slowing down traffic makes cycling (and walking) on roads safer. It also shows that the safest way to cycle is on a path segregated from traffic. Brake therefore recommends that in towns, cities and villages, traffic should be slowed to a maximum speed limit of 20mph to allow people to get out and about and make journeys by bike and on foot (and by a combination of walking or cycling and public transport). Brake also calls for greatly increased provision of dedicated traffic-free or segregated routes for cycling (and walking), particularly on key routes linking residential areas with schools and colleges, places of work, shopping areas and leisure facilities, and linking neighbouring towns. Evidence from the Netherlands, London and elsewhere demonstrates the effectiveness of these measures in reducing casualties among people on foot and bike. Other studies have shown that effective implementation of area-wide 20mph limits, traffic-free routes, and other measures to make walking and cycling safer and more pleasant, can help bring about increased levels of walking and cycling. &#xa0;Brake believes 20mph is the most appropriate default speed limit for built up areas based on the huge difference in stopping distances between 20mph and 30mph, and the overwhelming evidence on the direct relationship between speed and road safety and our belief that everyone should be able to walk or cycle without fear or threat to their safety. Evidence on implementation of 20mph limits shows they bring about reductions in devastating and costly casualties for pedestrians and cyclists in particular, have widespread public support, and encourage greater levels of walking and cycling. Brake is part of a ‘GO 20’ coalition of 10 charities who all believe 20mph is the most appropriate default limit for towns, cities and villages. Until we achieve a lower default limit, we encourage more local authorities to follow the lead of Portsmouth, Bristol, London Borough of Islington and many others who have or are implementing widespread or town/city/area-wide 20mph limits.&#xa0;Alongside calling for 20mph limits, Brake recommends the use of segregated and traffic-free paths as widely as possible on key routes as outlined above. Brake warns that simply marking a cycle lane on otherwise normal roads, especially busy, fast roads with hazardous junctions, does not constitute provision of a safe route. Brake recommends continuous cycle paths, safe along their full length, including safe negotiation of busy and complex junctions, and using segregated and traffic-free routes as much as possible, or where not possible making use of quiet roads with lower speeds. There should also be a partnership approach taken by local authorities and police to encourage implementation of accompanying measures to make these routes safer where they are on or crossing roads, particularly 20mph limits, and wider enforcement, including through use of technology like average speed cameras for urban areas.&#xa0;However, because it is not possible to have safe, segregated routes connecting every home with schools, workplaces and colleges, it remains vital to lower our urban limit to 20mph, to make whole areas safer for cycling. Making cycling and walking the automatic choice for shorter journeys requires that people feel familiar and comfortable with walking and cycling in their immediate local area. Making whole communities welcoming for walkers and cyclists, rather than simply providing safe routes from A to B, will encourage people to get more active in their leisure time. By helping people to feel more confident and comfortable walking and cycling in their immediate local area for leisure and very short journeys, people (including children) are more able to build up the fitness, skills and confidence necessary to undertake other journeys like commuting on foot or by bike. &#xa0;If children are to be brought up with walking and cycling as the normal way to make short journeys, they need to be able to walk and cycle for school and leisure purposes, to get used to those activities safely. Children are safer where traffic is 20mph or slower, and where they can travel and play away from traffic entirely, such as on traffic-free routes and spaces. Children are not often allowed to choose how they travel to school, but if their local environment is safe, they are more likely to be allowed to travel actively and play outside, making them more likely to be fit and healthy, and more likely to choose active travel for their shorter journeys when they are older. In this way, 20mph limits and traffic-free routes are also important in allowing children to practice and get used to active travel.&#xa0;Brake argues that to bring about desired improvements in walking and cycling, we need a bold and determined approach from central government that ensures progress is made across the country, rather than a piecemeal localised approach where it is left up to local authorities to decide the level of priority they give this issue and what measures they implement. This should include lowering our urban default limit to 20mph, rather than leaving it up to authorities to decide whether to implement this evidenced and important measure, and to go to the expense of extra signage and other measures needed when switching a limit from the default. It should also include not only provision of additional funding for local authorities to implement safe walking and cycling facilities like traffic-free routes, but a requirement placed on local authorities to develop the network of safe routes and reduce risk for people on foot and bicycle. &#xa0;Finally, long-term change in the safety and extent of cycling needs to include awareness-raising and engagement work, geared at drivers in particular but also cyclists and potential cyclists. Research from Norway and the UK demonstrates that initiatives to increase levels of active travel and improve road safety are much more effective where they include educational and enforcement components. On the basis of this research, and our years of experience campaigning in road safety locally and nationally, we recommend the government undertakes to educate the public not only about the benefits cycling brings and steps cyclists can take to reduce their risks, but also, critically, the importance of drivers protecting cyclists and their responsibilities in doing so. &#xa0;January 2014
