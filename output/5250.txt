&#xa0;Written evidence from Charles Ellis (TWR0004)&#xa0;Dear Mr Stringer,I was watching the Select Committee meeting on 7th January 2013 where you were asking questions of Stewart Wingate CEO of Gatwick Airport - I didn't catch it all but at about 15:18, he claimed that he had over 500 of his staff dealing with the customers in the airport. &#xa0;&#xa0;As a witness on the check in desk side at Gatwick airport North terminal I can verify that he had only 4 of his staff at the check in desk area and 1 of his staff down below at the arrivals section, none of them had any useful information and could not contact anyone that was able to help. &#xa0;My father in law was trapped the other side of security and he told me that there were similar numbers that side. &#xa0;Not sure where the other 490 of his staff were but they were not dealing with customers / passengers. &#xa0;I would suggest calling one of those 4 assistants to give evidence they may be more accurate.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
