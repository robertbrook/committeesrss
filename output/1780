[normal]Written submission from Warwickshire County Council (LPG 16)[bold]Q1.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This Council believes that the current procurement landscape gives Local Authorities the flexibility they need to deliver VFM whilst having due regard to the social, economic and environmental objectives, including stimulating the local economy, which is so important to Council’s, their elected members, officers and citizens.
[normal]This Council’s concern is that central government policy and action don’t appear to be fully aligned. Government has challenged all Council’s to save money whilst at the same time challenging Council’s to take increasing account of socio-economic considerations. Councils are rising to both of these challenges but recent developments in relation to the Government Procurement Service (GPS) which appears to be wanting to consolidate all local government spend into national categories, managed nationally (or at best regionally through designated hubs) has the potential to remove Council’s flexibility to balance priorities. Whilst we would accept that the general rules relating to economy of scale can apply to some categories of local government spend, they do not apply to all. An example of this is Social Care where in the main the market is local and in most cases made up of niche suppliers. 
[normal]This Council has a track record of involving local residents in delivering value for money through their involvement in developing service specifications, undertaking tender evaluations and particularly in relation to services delivered to Adults and Children. The Council also has some high profile examples of innovative engagement which are outlined below: -
[normal]Community Re-Use Shops[bold]The Council transformed the operations of its Household Waste Recycling Centres to create a climate that empowers local people and communities.
[normal] 
[normal]The transformation utilises innovative collaborations with the voluntary sector to expand re-use centres, resulting in tonnes of material being diverted from landfill and generating income which is being invested in hundreds of grassroots community groups through a grant-making foundation. The scheme will save WCC £6.3 million over seven years and has already seen volunteers, staff and apprentices receive 6,000+ hours of accredited training.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Library Book Vending[bold]&#xa0;[bold]A pioneering partnership between Warwickshire County Council and the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton is making library books available around the clock for people working, visiting or are inpatients in one of Warwickshire’s busiest hospitals. Warwickshire Libraries have procured and installed a library book ‘vending’ machine in the hospital, effectively taking the library to customers. As far as we know the George Eliot machine is the first of its type in a community venue, in the UK. The Hospital has a large team of volunteers and some are working with local library staff to ensure that the machine is regularly restocked with new titles. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Community Libraries[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Library Service needed to restructure its service faced with a budget reduction of £2m. Proposals were drawn up to enable the service to operate at its reduced budget. For some libraries, the proposal included reducing opening hours and 16 libraries were no longer sustainable in their current forms. The Council consulted communities offering the opportunity to input into how library services could best be delivered in their localities. Following this consultation the Council helped to create and is continuing to support 12 community managed libraries.
[normal]There are no barriers to local authorities developing long term relationships however it would assist local authorities if the EU Procurement Regulations allowed for framework contracts to be let for longer than 4 years. The Council has implemented a number of long term relationships in waste, care, highways and will shortly be entering a long term collaborative relationship for elements of its property maintenance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q2.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This Council believes that it maximises the opportunities available from joint/collaborative procurement. The Council’s procurement strategy is built around the principles of effective collaboration and joint procurement. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Council’s contract standing orders have a clear preferred procurement route: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Within this overarching strategy, the Council believes that: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Opportunities from Central Government[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Council is aware of and makes use of the opportunities available from Central Government and particularly in relation to the ICT Category. The Council is
[normal] not only procuring under the G-Cloud contract, but our Head of ICT was the local authority representative on the G-Cloud Board and our legal and procurement teams helped develop the contractual
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]arrangements introduced. The Council led one of the six G-Cloud
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Foundation Partner Projects and contributed significantly to the establishment of the first G-Cloud Framework in terms of supplier certification. The Council is in the advanced stages of procuring its wide area network replacement via the Government PSN contract.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Formal Collaborations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Council participates in 2 formal procurement collaborations as well as a number of informal collaborations: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The key principles within the strategy include: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Building on the growing collaboration between the authorities Coventry/Solihull/Warwickshire signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 2nd March 2012 in support of collaborative working across the three authorities. The Council has a website 
[normal]http://cswsubregionalprogramme.wordpress.com/
[normal] 
[normal]to showcase its
[normal] sub regional working. This contains the first consolidated annual report (2012/13) as well as providing comprehensive information on current projects (e.g. 
[normal]SuperFast
[normal] Broadband) 
[normal]The sub region has recently launched a common E Tendering platform ‘CSW JETS’. 8 authorities in the sub region are now using this platform to advertise and manage their tender opportunities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case Studies[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The innovative procurement collaborations we are particularly proud of include: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recycling of Street Sweepings
[normal] – An innovative and award winning procurement on behalf of the CSW sub region and several other West Midlands authorities. This contract has diverted approximately 15,000 tonnes of street sweepings from traditional landfill generating savings in excess of £500,000. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Highways Maintenance (HMC 2011)
[normal] – To the best of our knowledge, the HMC 2011 is the first collaborative Local Government contract for the provision of Highway Maintenance Services. Let on behalf of the CSW sub region, this award winning collaboration will deliver savings approaching £1,500,000 per annum.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Traffic Signal Maintenance
[normal] – An example of a sub-regional collaboration expanded through professional contacts to include an additional partner from the East Midlands region to create a bespoke collaboration to procure Traffic Signal Maintenance services. All four partners will see savings totalling approximately £400,000 per annum.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Home Care[bold] [bold]– Not a traditional collaboration in the sense that a single procurement process could not be co-ordinated. However the procurements have followed behind each other with the learning from Coventry being used to inform Warwickshire’s procurement and the learning from Coventry and Warwickshire informing Solihull’s procurement. Savings in Warwickshire alone exceed £500,000 per annum. The procurement model that has evolved within the CSW sub region is now being replicated in other West Midlands authorities 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Collaborative Commissioning[bold] - Commissioning is undertaken in the context of how decisions will affect partners. Wherever possible, maximum benefit is sought for the sub region or the region if commissioning decisions align. Examples include the Coventry, Solihull, Warwickshire Fostering Framework and the Regional Children’s Residential Framework 2012. Joint commissioning across the sub region has become commonplace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Other Collaborations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Although the Council has formalised 2 strategic procurement partnerships, it does not restrict itself to these where more appropriate collaboration opportunities exist e.g.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council does not currently have any PFI contracts
[normal]Q3.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In order to access the skills, expertise and capabilities to implement effective procurement strategies, the Council has invested in its internal procurement resource and in the training and up-skilling of Officers across the Council.
[normal]The central procurement team has increased in size over recent years and the Council is providing financial support to a number of staff pursuing membership of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council has taken steps to increase skills, expertise and capability issue through its sub regional working agenda. The sub regional Memorandum of Understanding (referenced elsewhere within this response) states that: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]…….
[normal]The benefits we foresee from this way of working are from increased procurement power, 
[normal]reduction in the duplication of effort therefore increasing capacity[bold], the delivery of efficiencies, 
[normal]the sharing of good practice and particular expertise developed in individual authorities[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]MoU
[normal] goes on to say that 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Service (procurement) will be run on a Category Management basis 
[normal]with officers from individual Council’s reviewing the whole category of spend on behalf of all three authorities[bold].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council also has member access to the significant procurement resource of ESPO.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Following a skills audit, the Council (In collaboration with Coventry CC) developed a training programme for none procurement specialists. Called the Procurement Certificate of Competence the programme consisted of 5 Core Modules: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]And 6 Additional Modules
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In order to be awarded a ‘Certificate of Competence’ delegates needed to complete 5 core modules and any 2 of the additional modules. By the end of the programme: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council has a clear approach to the consideration of social and economic objectives in relation to procurements which are high risk and/or exceed the EU thresholds. Prior to any procurement commencing a ‘Procurement Plan’ is completed. This is a risk management and planning tool 
[normal]designed to provide a considered baseline from which an effective procurement strategy can be developed. Managers are required to consider and get approval to 31 criteria including: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The issues identified within the procurement plan follow through the procurement process to the final contract.
[normal]The Council has robust links with markets and infrastructure support organisations. The Council Leader recently signed a Small Business Charter with the local Federation of Small Businesses. The Charter addresses 15 of the characteristics from the FSB report 
[normal]‘Local Supply – Making the Most of Small Business – July 2012’. 
[normal]Signing this Charter is a clear 
[normal]commitment from the Council and it sets the agenda for how the Council will develop its procurement approach to maximise the benefits from the local small business sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Council has demonstrated its commitment to the Social value agenda by becoming a ‘Social Value Champion’.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council believes that understanding it’s expenditure and the markets in which it operates is a continual and on-going process. The Council has a growing understanding of its expenditure and is implementing system developments to enhance the quality and granularity of its data. The Council is also developing its general market knowledge and awareness through the transition to a Category Management approach.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]More specifically, the Council is changing its procurement focus by: -
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What Can be Done To Improve[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The main difficulty the Council faces is in keeping abreast of the market developments taking place across the wider public sector. There is an opportunity for central gathering and dissemination (via some form of market intelligence portal possibly) of market developments (new entrants to markets, key leavers from markets, new models of delivery etc.) that local Category Managers can access easily and efficiently.
[normal]Q4.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council’s approach to managing risk within procurement commences with the ‘Procurement Plan’ referred to earlier in this response. One of the elements of the 
[normal]Procurement Plan is the creation of an initial Risk Register. This initial Risk Register is reviewed by the Council’s Risk management team and interventions are made as appropriate. Once approved, this forms the risk baseline. Managers letting contracts are required to maintain a risk register throughout the procurement and life of the contract.
[normal]For 
[normal]saignificant
[normal] projects, the Council implements a formal governance structure with a Project Board and manages the project within a formal Project Management structure (usually PRINCE2). Where Project Boards are formed, a review of the Risk Register is a routine item on Board agendas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council has used an enhanced approach to risk (mainly engineering projects) so that all identified risks carry an assessment of the potential associated cost should the risk materialise. As mitigating actions are taken, milestones achieved or new risks identified, the Council understands the potential costs associated with each risks and can, if required, create a risk pot to accommodate these.
[normal]Contracts include clauses allowing the Council’s to reduce, alter or end contracts including on grounds of funding pressures. The Council is currently reviewing its contracts in order to make them more agile and flexible in order to accommodate changes to Services. 
[normal]Q5.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council has Contract Standing Orders (CSO) which lay down the minimum requirements for procurement and contracting and which are approved by elected members.
[normal]CSO provide a sound framework for procurement exercises which minimise the risk of impropriety. Managers are responsible for the prevention and detection of fraud, corruption and other irregularities and hence are required to have sound processes in place. When conducting audit assignments, Internal auditors are alert to opportunities such as control weaknesses that could allow fraud and report non-compliance. Allegations of impropriety are independently investigated and where weaknesses are identified by an investigation internal audit will provide advice on how controls should be strengthened. The Authority participates in the National Fraud Initiative which helps to identify procurement fraud.
[normal]The Council has a Scheme of delegation which allocates approvals to procure to various levels of officer and member. All procurements with an aggregate value in excess of £500,000 are subject to the Council’s Key Decision regime and are included in the Council’s Forward Plan of decisions. All procurements with an aggregate value in excess of £1,000,000 are subject to elected member approval prior to the procurement commencing. The reports produced to secure these approvals are publicly available via the Council’s website
[normal]The Council also has a Procurement Code which provides more detailed process, guidance and good practice in relation to the application of the Council’s Contract Standing Orders and Public Procurement Regulations. The following is an example
[normal]The Council publicises its spend above £500 monthly on its website 
[normal]http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/corporate
[normal]All officers and members are covered by a Code of Conduct, All officers and members are required to complete a declaration of personal interests on an annual basis. All Officers have 
[normal]been required to confirm that they have read, understood and will comply with the Council’s CSO.
[normal]Q6.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council’s procurement processes are fully transparent and undertaken fully in accordance with CSO and the EU Procurement Regulations.
[normal]The Council publicly advertises all opportunities with an aggregate value &gt;£50,000. The Council routinely advertises both Part A and part B Services on its website and within the OJEU to ensure maximum transparency.
[normal]The Council observes the mandatory standstill periods in relation to its EU procurement and provides detailed feedback to 
[normal]Tenderers
[normal] in line with its obligations under the Remedies Directive. Unlike the majority of Local Authorities, this Council still provides face to face feedback to those organisations requesting it.
[normal]The Council routinely advertises its ‘Procurement Programme’ and ‘Contracts Recently Awarded’ on its website.
[normal]Internal audit provides consultancy, focused on compliance with Council rules and the effectiveness of controls for significant procurement exercises. Periodically specific audits of compliance with contract standing orders are undertaken across the Council. In addition, contract management processes for those contracts assessed as high risk will be included in the internal audit plan. The results of individual audits, consultancy work and assurance statements from managers of corporate projects feed into the Council’s overall Annual Governance Statement which is a public document.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Council encourages employees and others with serious and reasonably held concerns about malpractice within the Council to come forward and voice these concerns. The Public Interest Reporting Code outlines how the Council will deal with any concerns and provides assurances to individuals raising any concerns. Although designed primarily for members of staff, the Code applies equally to suppliers and contractors to the Council. By agreeing to work for or supply to the Council, it is a condition that suppliers and contractors will adopt the principles of the code and report any concerns they or any of their employees may have to the Council in a timely manner.
