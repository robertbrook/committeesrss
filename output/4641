[normal]Written evidence submitted by WWF UK (IPC0054)[bold]Summary[bold]As a science-based conservation organisation working across the world, WWF greatly values the 
[normal]Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
[normal]’s
[normal] (IPCC)
[normal] 
[normal]periodic 
[normal]assessment report
[normal]s, the latest of which (AR5) saw its first instalment - the 
[normal]“
[normal]Physical Science Basis
[normal]”
[normal] (WG1)
[normal] - published on 27 September, 2013. 
[normal]There is no other similar science-based international process on any issue of global relevance than that undertak
[normal]en by the IPCC, which is 
[normal]both supported and mandated by 
[normal]the nations 
[normal]with
[normal]in the UN. 
[normal]The main activity of the IPCC is to provide, at 
[normal]six-year intervals, assessment r
[normal]eports 
[normal]detailing
[normal] the state of 
[normal]scientific 
[normal]knowledge on climate change. 
[normal]These 
[normal]extremely detailed, peer-reviewed 
[normal]reports, particularly the S
[normal]ummary for Policy Makers
[normal] (SPM)
[normal], are 
[normal]vital tool
[normal]s
[normal] in helping to inform 
[normal]the wider world about the 
[normal]body of scientific
[normal] knowledge
[normal] that underpins our current understanding of how 
[normal]anthropogenic
[normal] 
[normal]greenhous
[normal]e gas 
[normal]emissions are 
[normal]changing the planet’s climate, how this is likely to impact managed and natural ecosystems and 
[normal]human communities, and what 
[normal]the options 
[normal]are 
[normal]for adaptation and mitigation responses, both now and in the decades ahead
[normal].
[normal] The latest instalment
[normal] published in September – with its increased expressions of certainty - only serves to reinforce the scientific foundation upon which WWF is
[normal] calling for the urgent decarbo
[normal]nisation of the global economy.
[normal]An Introduction to WWF[bold]WWF is the largest 
[normal]environmental network in the world, with projects in over 100 countries.  One of our key aims is tackling climate change, and, as a result, we have been active in UK and global energy policy discussions for
[normal] more than
[normal] a decade. We are strongly committed as 
[normal]an organisation to helping prevent the worst impacts of climate change and
[normal],
[normal] in particular
[normal],
[normal] preventing temperatures from rising above 2ºC compared to pre-industrial levels.
[normal] WWF is an official “observer organisation” to the IPCC.
[normal] Based on their scientific ba
[normal]ckground, knowledge and experience, some WWF staff have also been nominated and endorsed by governments as either contributing authors or 
[normal]reviewers. This process followed
[normal] rigorous vetting by the IPCC secretariat, as is the case with all authors and reviewe
[normal]rs from any institution
[normal],
[normal] including business and industry. However, in the case of the AR5 
[normal]WG1
[normal], WWF was not involved as an author or 
[normal]an 
[normal]officially registered reviewer.
[normal]    
[normal]Committee questions[bold]How robust are the conclusions in the AR5 Physical Science Basis [bold]report? Have the IPCC adequately addresse[bold]d[bold] criticisms of previous reports? How much scope is there to question of the report’s con[bold]clusions?[bold]Overall, since its Nobel Prize-winning assessment report in 2007, the IPCC has strengthened its position as the world’s most 
[normal]authoritative
[normal], rigorous reference source for 
[normal]the science of climate change
[normal] and, therefore, remains 
[normal]the best 
[normal]available 
[normal]guide for policymaker
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]WWF sees no reason to 
[normal]question the report’s conclusions.
[normal] In addition, WWF is always open to new scientific evidence.
[normal]To what extent does AR5 reflect the range [bold]of views among climate scientists?[bold]Can any of the areas of the science now be cons[bold]idered settled as a result of AR5’s publication, if so which?[bold]&#xa0;[bold] What areas need further effort to reduce the levels of uncertainty?[bold]There are 
[normal]areas 
[normal]of climate science 
[normal]that 
[normal]merit
[normal] further research. For instance, the IPCC is cautious when assessing the negative feedback mechanism to the climate caused by the off-gassing of m
[normal]ethane or carbon dioxide
[normal] from the sea floor or permafrost soils as a result of continued warming under scenari
[normal]os other than RCP8.5 (the 
[normal]IPCC’s 
[normal]worst-case scenario). Also, 
[normal]further advances on
[normal] the methodology, data collection and analysis of future climate “extrem
[normal]es” would help to improve the IPCC
[normal]’s expressions of “low confidence” for “Increases of intensity and/or 
[normal]duration of droughts” and “increases in intense tropical cyclone activity” for the early 21
[normal]st
[normal] century. Such expressions of “low confidence” were not based on a plethora of contradictory 
[normal]data, but on the lack of data or representative sophisticated models. 
[normal]These are just some examples where further research would be beneficial
[normal],
[normal] but none provide a justification
[normal] for a lack of action
[normal] on reducing GHG emissions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]How effective is AR5 and the summary[bold] for policymakers in conveying[bold]&#xa0;[bold]what is meant by [bold]uncertainty in sc[bold]ientific terms[bold]? Would a focus on risk rather than uncertainty be useful?[bold]Does the AR5 address the reliability of climate models?[bold]Has AR[bold]5 sufficiently explained the reasons behind the widely reported hiatus in the global surface temperature record?[bold]However, the cut-
[normal]off for 
[normal]incorporating papers into 
[normal]AR5 
[normal]WG1 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]the deadline was 
[normal]31 July 2012 – meant 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]very 
[normal]latest scientific in
[normal]quiry
[normal] into this topic was not 
[normal]considered. For example, the Met Office
[normal], one of the world’s most respected climate science research centres,
[normal] published in July 2013 a 
[normal]report
[normal] examining the “potential causes”. 
[normal]It concluded that heat absorption by the world’s 
[normal]oceans
[normal] was likely to be an important factor: 
[normal]“
[normal]Observations of ocean heat content and of sea level rise suggest that the additional heat from the continued rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations has been absorbed in the ocean and has not been manifest 
[normal]as a rise in surface temperature. Changes in the exchange of heat between the upper and deep ocean appear to have caused at least part of the pause in surface warming and observations suggest that the Pacific Ocean may play a key role.
[normal]”
[normal]The Met Office adde
[normal]d in an accompanying report
[normal] that the “recent pause…
[normal]does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century. Nor does it invalidate the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific basis of climate models
[normal] and their estimates of climate sensitivity”.
[normal]The IPCC also put short-term natural variations in surface temperatures in the context of long-term anthropogenic GHG atmospheric forcings by stating that up to 40% of “emitted CO
[normal]2
[normal] will remain in the atmosphere
[normal] longer than 1,000 years.”
[normal]Do the AR5 Physical Science Basis report’s conclusions strengthen or weaken the economic case for action to pr[bold]event dangerous climate change?[bold]What implications do the IPCC’s conclusions in t[bold]he AR5 Physical Science Basis report have for policy making both [bold]nationally and internationally?[bold]Is the IPCC process an effective mechanism for assessing scientific knowledge? Or has it focussed on providing a justification for political commitment?[bold]To what extent did political intervention influence the final conclusions of the A[bold]R5 [bold]Physical Science Basis summary?[bold]Is the rate at which the UK Government intends to cut CO[bold]2[bold] emissions appropria[bold]te in light of the findings of the IPCC AR5 Physical Science Basis report? [bold]In part 
[normal]two
[normal] of the review, published in December 2013, the CCC concluded that in light of the latest climate change pr
[normal]ojections presented by the IPCC “i
[normal]n order to limit ri
[normal]sks of 
[normal]dangerous climate change and preserve close to a 50% chance of keeping temperature rise below 2°C, it is necessary that global emissions peak around 2020, with deep cuts through the 2020s and in the following decades. The currently legislated budget
[normal] is a minimum UK contribution to this global emissions pathway.”
[normal]WWF
[normal]-UK
[normal]’s view
[normal], in unison with a broad coalition of businesses, 
[normal]investors and 
[normal]civil society representatives
[normal],
[normal] is 
[normal]that 
[normal]the carbon budget targets 
[normal]set
[normal] by the Climate Change Act represent the absolute minimum in 
[normal]terms of emissions reduction
[normal] commitments
[normal] for the UK in light of the scientific evidence presented in the IPCC’s latest report.
[normal]What relevance do the IPCC’s conclusions have in respect of the revi[bold]ew of the fourth Carbon Budget? [bold]&#xa0;
