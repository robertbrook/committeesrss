[normal]Written evidence submitted by Andrew Reid [FBB0039[bold]][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Future of the BBC[bold]What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?[bold]If it is deemed necessary 
[normal]for the UK 
[normal]to have a 
[normal]national public service broadcaster
[normal],
[normal] it should be proportionate
[normal],
[normal] and focused on “core business” ie
[normal] providing it’s audience with high quality
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]balanced and impartial 
[normal]output on matters of 
[normal]national and public importance, which would
[normal] not otherwise 
[normal]be addressed
[normal] by the private sector. 
[normal]It’s news 
[normal]broadcasts 
[normal]should 
[normal]stick to 
[normal]reporting 
[normal]factual
[normal]ly 
[normal]accurate 
[normal]informa
[normal]tion, not
[normal] supporting
[normal] 
[normal]an institutional agenda 
[normal]overwhelmingly consisting of
[normal] 
[normal]opinion
[normal]s
[normal] from
[normal] it’s 
[normal]own 
[normal]approved 
[normal]“
[normal]talking heads
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving i[bold]ts mission and public purposes?[bold]The BBC has performed extremely badly in this regard, and continues it’s long decline. 
[normal]I 
[normal]travel
[normal]led
[normal] widely, internationally, 
[normal]in the eighties and nineties, 
[normal]and I was proud of the BBC
[normal] as a respected British institution
[normal]. Alas, no more. 
[normal]The BBC has become
[normal] 
[normal]self-serving, 
[normal]bloated and arrogant
[normal],
[normal] and out of touch with mainstream public opinion. A recent spate of scandals has revealed a disgrac
[normal]eful abuse 
[normal]of  licence payers
[normal]’
[normal] money
[normal],
[normal] awarding huge sums to surplus executives and managers
[normal]. M
[normal]any
[normal], like me, 
[normal]have been shoc
[normal]ked by 
[normal]the 
[normal]disgraceful
[normal] cover up of foul and criminal activities undertaken on BBC premises
[normal] over many years in the past.
[normal] In the recent Savile case, the “whistle-blowing” had ITN to thank, not the BBC itself.
[normal]I 
[normal]used to wake up routinely to the Radio 4 Today 
[normal]programme, but gradually became disillusioned
[normal] 
[normal]and irritated by
[normal] it’s content
[normal].  I 
[normal]find that I can no longer listen 
[normal]to 
[normal]or watch BBC News 
[normal]and current affairs 
[normal]programmes on a regular basis as they are exceedingly biased
[normal],
[normal] reflecting the BBC’s Metropolitan Libera
[normal]l Left agenda
[normal].
[normal]The BBC is required to be balanced and impartial, but it is 
[normal]too often 
[normal]neither. In any BBC phone in or discussion you quickly can assess the BBC’s position and what the outcome will be.  
[normal]Anyone who deviates significantly is interrupted, sneer
[normal]ed at or shouted down.
[normal]There is a clear BBC agenda/position on many major 
[normal]political 
[normal]topics, examples being;
[normal]The E
[normal]ur
[normal]opean Union (pro)
[normal]Immigration, m
[normal]ulti-culturalism and PC 
[normal](pro)
[normal]Global Warming (now metamorphosed into 
[normal]“
[normal]Climate Change
[normal]”
[normal]) – (pro)
[normal]The Labour
[normal] Party (pro)
[normal]The Middle East (pro Palestinian)
[normal]Re the USA, strongly pro Democrat 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although I have no religious affiliations, I note the BBC regularly criticises 
[normal]and mocks 
[normal]Christ
[normal]i
[normal]a
[normal]nity (ofte
[normal]n justifiably) but protects and promotes Islam
[normal], whilst generally i
[normal]gnoring other religions.
[normal]The BBC also 
[normal]seems 
[normal]over
[normal]-
[normal]obsessed
[normal] 
[normal]with “racism”
[normal], 
[normal]“equality” 
[normal]and “green” 
[normal]matters
[normal], so much 
[normal]so, 
[normal]that 
[normal]this 
[normal]c
[normal]an in effect 
[normal]be counter-
[normal]productive to 
[normal]their underlying aims
[normal]The BBCs flagship Newnight programme is, and has been
[normal],
[normal] dominated by senior people well to the left of the political spectrum.
[normal] 
[normal]It is obvious to any intelligent and aware person that BBC phone-in’s and programmes like Question Time/Any Questions are clearly carefully managed to ensure the right outcomes and out
[normal]puts for the BBC.
[normal]Other than for Sport, I no
[normal] l
[normal]onger use the on line BBC
[normal] 
[normal]site
[normal], prefe
[normal]r
[normal]r
[normal]ing 
[normal]to get my News from 
[normal]many other 
[normal]excellent 
[normal]on-line 
[normal]sources including 
[normal]newspapers
[normal] and blogs.
[normal]Complaints about the BBC’s bias
[normal],
[normal] once infrequent
[normal],
[normal] are now commonplace
[normal].  Howeve
[normal]r 
[normal]it’s 
[normal]complaints system is the metaphorical 
[normal]equivalent of scaling Everest. M
[normal]any people no longer bo
[normal]ther
[normal],
[normal] having 
[normal]being told that the BBC 
[normal]has considered their point
[normal], but
[normal], on reflection,
[normal] 
[normal]think that 
[normal]the BBC 
[normal]“got it just about right”
[normal] 
[normal]Are the public purposes [bold]in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?[bold]The Charter content seems reasonable in principle, but the BBC has rather focused on competing with the private sector, in producing what some might unkindly call 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]“
[normal]Trash TV
[normal]”
[normal] rather th
[normal]an core public service matters. The private sector is more than capable of meet
[normal]ing market demand for the former.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?[bold] 
[normal]To s
[normal]tick 
[normal]strictly 
[normal]to core public service broadcasting 
[normal]supported by 
[normal]a 
[normal]very 
[normal]small number of TV
[normal] and radio channels. 
[normal]In 2013 we do not need a “force-funded”, large State Broadcaster producing “Trash TV” and 
[normal]biased 
[normal]“News” any more than we need a similar State distributor and retailer of food, competing against the highly efficient major supermarkets.
[normal]Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As stated elsewhere 
[normal]the output of popular commercial programmes should be cut back
[normal],
[normal] as the
[normal]se
[normal] can, and will be covered
[normal] adequately by private 
[normal]broadcasters.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?[bold]With a smaller public service orientated BBC, much more would be covered in-house.  However, the 
[normal]exact 
[normal]balance
[normal] would be 
[normal]a matter for the 
[normal]senior management to decide.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence[bold] fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As stated 
[normal]already,
[normal] the wide-scale involvement of the BBC in commercial matters does not sit well with the remit o
[normal]f a public service broadcaster.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]What role should the BB[bold]C play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?[bold]Public sector organisations are ill-suited to 
[normal]effective 
[normal]and productive 
[normal]large scale 
[normal]research 
[normal]and development.  A good example was the recent major 
[normal]BBC 
[normal]IT project cancellation whereby £100M of licence payer’s money was wasted. The BBC does however need to employ smart
[normal],
[normal] commercially-aware people to ensure 
[normal]it keeps up with the latest developments, and 
[normal]adop
[normal]ts 
[normal]the best 
[normal]technology available
[normal],
[normal] as the media indus
[normal]try continues to 
[normal]rapidly 
[normal]transform. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?[bold] 
[normal]The anachronism of the current licence fee
[normal], often
[normal] enforced by 
[normal]threat of criminal sanctions 
[normal]must
[normal] be abolished. 
[normal]I was astonished to read of
[normal] the sheer 
[normal]numbers of people now find
[normal]i
[normal]ng
[normal] themselves in court for non payment.
[normal]The BBC should be cut down 
[normal]substantially
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]for example
[normal] with the sale of Radios 1, 5 
[normal]Live
[normal], 6Music
[normal] 
[normal]and a number of TV channels 
[normal]etc
[normal].  The role of it’s
[normal] local radio network should also be 
[normal]reviewed as it is 
[normal]duplicating and 
[normal]severely
[normal] stifling
[normal] local
[normal] competit
[normal]i
[normal]on.
[normal] 
[normal]Funding 
[normal]of a much slimmed down BBC 
[normal]should be through
[normal];
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]voluntary subscripti
[normal]on (like SKY – no pay, no play)
[normal]b)  
[normal]through advertising. 
[normal]Although the BBC is currently 
[normal]perceived to be 
[normal]“ad-free” it’s TV
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]especially 
[normal]radi
[normal]o 
[normal]channels
[normal] are awash with annoying, repeated ad’s for it’s own programmes
[normal].
[normal]By this mechanism the BBC could save greatly on the costs of evasion, 
[normal]plus 
[normal]it’s 
[normal]substantial 
[normal]funding 
[normal]of 
[normal](private) 
[normal]TVL–Capita
[normal] enforcement.  This would also 
[normal]re
[normal]move
[normal] the 
[normal]much criticised 
[normal]elements of public har
[normal]as
[normal]s
[normal]ment 
[normal]and threats, widely reported, and avoid 
[normal]people 
[normal]acquiring 
[normal]criminal records 
[normal]for simply avoiding or not 
[normal]want
[normal]ing
[normal] to pay for the BBC
[normal].
[normal]Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?[bold]I believe 
[normal]this has only become an issue 
[normal]because of the 
[normal]well publicised abuses involving
[normal] the BBC
[normal], plus 
[normal]it’s perceived size and power
[normal].
[normal]What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries?[bold]I have no significant 
[normal]recent 
[normal]experience of overseas broadcasters although I have found that I can often learn of factual news about the UK from broadcasters such as Russia Today, France24 etc on subjects which the BBC 
[normal]finds “uncomfo
[normal]r
[normal]table” and 
[normal]chooses to ignore, omit or play do
[normal]wn as they don’
[normal]t fit with the BBC’s
[normal] 
[normal]approved 
[normal]agenda
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?[bold]The BBC Trust is the ultimate oxymoron. It has proved itself, particularly in recent times
[normal],
[normal] to be not fit for purpose. It shou
[normal]ld be scrapped and repl
[normal]a
[normal]ced by Ofcom
[normal].
[normal]In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?[bold]Ten years is fa
[normal]r too long a period when we look at how much the BBC has declined and abused it’s position ov
[normal]er the current Agreement period plus the ongoing revolution in modern media.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BBC has become 
[normal]“unhealthy” 
[normal]for our democracy. Through it’s
[normal] TV and Radio News network it 
[normal]effectively controls 70% of the News. 
[normal]It’s sheer power can, I believe influence outcomes.  It has mounted vo
[normal]ciferous campaigns aga
[normal]i
[normal]nst those it sees as rivals
[normal] or enemies
[normal], and is in the vanguard of campaigning for State control
[normal] 
[normal]over 
[normal]of our free press. 
[normal]Sadly many politicians, especially 
[normal]those 
[normal]on the right
[normal],
[normal] seem to be afraid of 
[normal]standing up to 
[normal]the BBC
[normal].
