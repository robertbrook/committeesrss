"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) is\n a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering firms and the UK Government.\nWe carry out three key activities:\nOur mission is to \naccelerate the development, demonstration and eventual commercial\n d\neployment\n of a focused portfolio of energy technologies which will increase energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve energy and climate change goals\nIn the last five years, the ETI has invested over £210m in \n52 \nprojects across nine techno\nlogy programme areas\n.\n The technology project portfolio to 2017 \ntotals over\n £400m of investment with four key aims to reduce the costs of generating energy, demand reduction, increasing investor confidence and increasing public acceptance and engagement.\n \nOur industry and government partnership means we can share risk and create affordability for the development and demonstration of \nemerging \nnew technologies\n that have the potential to make a material impact on the future UK energy system\n.\nAlthough the ETI i\ns a stand\n-\nalone organisation\n, through our partnership operating model\n \nwe are able to bring together the collective knowledge, expertise and experience of our diverse member \norganisations, the \nproject partners\n that we collaborate with in delivering projects\n, and external stakeholders\n.\n This\n focused\n partnership\n model\n between the public and private sectors provides access to money, skills and market interests.\nPartnership and collaboration is key to the ETI and we \nhave \nwork\ned\n with \nover \n119 partner organisations\n \nto date\n, including 29 universities and research institutes\n.\nOur strategic \ntechno-economic \nanalysis of the UK energy system provides insights, policy support and investment that \nidentif\nies\n and prioritis\nes\n \nthe UK’s future\n low carbon\n energy \nsystem \ndevelopmen\nt \nrequirements\n.\n \n \nI\nt is also being used to identify credible, lowest-cost pathways to support \npolicy makers as they consider major \nfuture infrastructure \ndecisions. \n \nIn addition, \nour projects build knowledge\n and capability that will \nhelp \ncontribute to the \neffective \ndelivery of the UK’s low carbon future\n.\nRecognising the need to focus and target investments to ensure value for money and leverage from public sector investments, the ETI’s techno-economic \nmodelling and \nstrategic \nanalysis of the UK energy system\n is a critical tool supporting effective innovation delivery.  The system is termed ‘ESME’ and is now used by DECC and the Committee on Climate Change to aid with planning and effective investment targeting.\nThe development\n priorities\n we have identified\n ar\ne:\nThese priorities are \nclosely\n \naligned with the Government’s balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon sources.\nHowever, it is important\n that the right steps are taken to ensure the cost of carbon reductions are affordable in the context of sustaining UK economic growth and industrial development.\n \n Identifying and developing a series of options to support future energy system pathway decis\nions will be critical to delivering this. \nThe ETI is\n \na core member of the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG), which brings together the major public sector backed organisations that invest in low carbon innovation in the UK. \n \nThe LCICG’s aim is to enhance the focus, coordination and delivery of support for innovation in low carbon technologies.  \nAlthough each LCICG organisation has its own priorities for, and approach to, \nspecific \ninvestment\ns\n in low carbon innovation, \nthere is\n \nstrong alignment in terms of \nthe \ndesired outcomes\n and the emphasis on co-ordinated and targeted innovation investment across all parts of the\n energy\n innovation landscape\n. \n \nThis is expressed in the shared LCICG aim, which is to maximise the impact of UK pub\nlic sector funding for low carbon technologies, in order to:\nThe \nT\nechnology Innovation Needs Assessment (TINA) \npr\noject\n ha\ns\n provided \nfocus for LCICG innovation funding prioritisation\n,\n whilst recognising the differing rol\nes and remits of LCICG members. \nThe ETI’s ESME modelling toolset was used widely in development of the various TINAs.\nA well-coordinated funding lands\ncape also increases the UK’s attractiveness to inward investment.\nLow carbon technologies often take \na long time\n to successfully develop, and even then significant improvements in their performance and cost can still be achieved by feeding back \nlearning \non\n an ongoing basis \nto improve \ncomponent and system-level design\n.\n \n It is therefore important that the support \nlow carbon \ntechnologies receive is \ntargeted and \nsustained over the long term. \n \nLCICG members are working to improve the technology journey for developers and investors, making sure the right support is available at the right time and at the right scale to deliver a seamless progression, and to ensure that the balance of support is ap\npropriate between \nthe \ndifferent stages\n of the innovation chain\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n              \nPage \n3\n of \n3\n"
