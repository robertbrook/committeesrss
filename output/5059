defaultSdefaultummarydefault&#xa0;defaultGiven the difficulties of ensuring appropriate welfare standards for primates kept as pets, I am strongly opposed to such a practice.  
defaultP
defaultrimates 
defaulthave 
defaultvery specific
default housing and husbandry requirements given their 
defaultcognitive
default, social and emotional
default complex
defaultity. It
default is extremely difficult to
default 
defaultprovide appropriate levels of care to primates, and together with conservation concerns, and health risks to humans, I am strongly opposed to the keeping of primates as pets and
default in breeding 
defaultand trading for these purposes.
default&#xa0;defaultPositidefaultondefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1 The extent of the trade and keeping of primates as pets within the 
defaultUK;
default 
defaultRSPCA figures from 2009 indicate there are between 2500-7500 primates kept by private individuals in Great Britain. The range in figures i
defaults
default indicative that there is little regulation or understanding of the conditions in which pet primates are kept.
default 
default2.2 
defaultWhether the existing regulatory framework and Code of Practice offer adequate protection for the welfare of primates kept as pets  and are being applied effectively; and
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Code of Practice is too general – each speci
defaultes 
defaultof primate has specific needs
default, and combined with lack of regulation and inspection 
defaultthe Code 
defaultdoes not provide an acceptable mechanism for ensuring adequate welfare standards. 
defaultOwners need very specialist 
defaultknowledge and 
defaulttraining.
default2.3 Whether people should be allowed to keep primates as pe
defaultts and, if not, how a ban might be implemented
default. 
default2.3.1 
default              
defaultI personally support the
default defaultInternational Primatological Society Policy on Private Ownership of Nonhuman Primates
default default(
defaulthttp://www.internationalprimatologicalsociety.org/PrivateOwnershipOfNonHumanPrimates.cfm
default) which opposes the keeping of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educational or 
defaultnon-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in importation, breeding and trading for these purposes.
default2.3.2 Animals kept in captivity are reliant on humans for 
defaulttheir care and welfare. Enclosure design and choice of group mates as well as routine husbandry events such as feeding, cleaning, and health care are in the hands of human keepers
default. 
defaultTo provide adequate housing and husbandry to ensure good welfare, those res
defaultponsible need expert knowledge, training, and a network of individuals to ensure appropriate care is provided. For example, primate
defaults
default must be housed in socially compatible groups to ensure good welfare, but evictions or deaths may occur, leaving the unaccep
defaulttable possibility of single housing. Such 
defaultnetworks
default (as good zoos have) 
defaultare
default vital to ensure animals are placed in optimal captive conditions.
default2.3.3 
defaultPrimates have complex cognitive, social and emotional requirements
default and can suffer from boredom, lack of appro
defaultpriate social and physical stimulation and challenge. In particular, an appropriate early rearing environment is needed; primates can develop stereotypies, abnormal and self-injurious behaviours, if not properly reared. Several practices used in the pet tr
defaultade
default, such as hand-rearing,
default are likely to lead to psychological damage and suffering.
default2.3.4 
defaultOver 
defaulthalf of the 
default(around) 
default400 primate species and subspecies for which information on conservation status is available are threatened with extinction
default (t
defaulthe IUCN Red L
defaultist of Threatened Species
default).
default 
defaultEven though
default many primates currently held as pets will have been bred in captivity,
default they are not domesticated, like cats or dogs, and are inappropriate as pets. Unless curbed, the 
defaultcontinuing demand 
defaultof primates as pets may result 
defaultin
default 
defaultthe unacceptable practice of 
defaultillegal capture and trad
defaulte of individuals from the wild, with concomitant welfare and conservation consequences.
default2.3.
default5
default Primates can 
defaultpose a significant threat to humans, through bite wounds or disease (e.g. simian herpes B vir
defaultus). 
default2.3.

default  I strongly encourage a ban of keeping primates be put in place. It might involve:
