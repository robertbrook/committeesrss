[normal]The federation of Small 
[normal]Businesses thanks you for the opportunity to respond to your inquiry.

[normal]Small businesses depend on their car or van to operate their business - 
[normal]65 per cent of small firms[bold] s
[normal]aid their car or van is crucial to their business. 
[normal]Read More[bold]The FSB
[normal] have warned[bold] that more needs to be done to address the problem of congestion and the state of repair o
[normal]f UK roads, in order to get businesses moving and growing. A 
[normal]well functioning
[normal] transport system incorporating all modes of transport, rather than looking at each mode individually is crucial to small rural businesses. 
[normal]We argue that
[normal] more strategic planning and management of transport can help markets work more effectively. 
[normal]Rebalancing the funds collected from road users and the amount i[bold]nvested back into improving the road network[bold] would prevent the poor state of roads and high levels of congestion from costing small firms. Devolved decision making, with 
[normal]Our
[normal] research shows
[normal] that half of small businesses believe the poor state of the UK's roads has 
[normal]cost their business up to £5,000 in the past 12 months[bold]. This is a huge figure considering that the average turn
[normal]over for small firms is around £500,000. The survey showed that 66% of our members said that the state of repair of the roads has had a negative impact on their business and 61% businesses have been affected due to traffic congestion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the current stru
[normal]cture, the FSB in Coventry &amp; Warwickshire has concerns over who and how inter-regional or other major cross boundary transport infrastructure needs will be addressed in the future if 
[normal]LEPs receive a Single Local Growth Fund, from 2015 and presuming that 
[normal]DfT
[normal] and Highways Agency remits will be reduced.  At this stage we do not know if LEPs have views wide enough to consider regional/inter-regional needs and how this will be managed to ens
[normal]ure we have an integrated strategic road structure. 
[normal]              
[normal]The existing structure of a local transport body (LTB), although has private sector involvement it is heavily weighted to the priorities of local authorities, and therefore comes with the politics of h
[normal]aving 2 or more authorities, often of differing political parties, agreeing priorities within a LEP area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The competitive process of bidding against neighbouring LEP 
[normal]area’s
[normal] is not conducive to a joined up approach. For an area like Coventry &amp; Warwickshire
[normal] that is surrounded by a number of other LEPs and is impacted by a vast road structure, it is difficult to prioritise and to best make use of a limited budget.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As mentioned above we do not believe the current structure allows for clear guidance on how int
[normal]er
[normal]-regional or other major cross boundary transport infrastructure needs will be addressed. Small businesses are not interested in the politics (who and why is responsible), and instead would prefer the improvements to be made efficiently, on time and with
[normal]in budget.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We also feel that second tier road networks need reviewing. Our view is that there should be a fully dual carriageway network for major/non-motorway road journeys or where there are sizeable gaps in the motorway network. We also feel that accid
[normal]ent records should be given greater consideration when investing in transport and road improvements.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would also like to see (when/if LEPs receive a 
[normal]Single Local Growth Fund) 
[normal]how can we ensure that SMEs get their rightful dues as opposed to it being 'lo
[normal]st' within wider 'loose' local authority transport activities or ambitions. Possibly clearer guidance 
[normal]on  who
[normal] LTB’s or LEP priorities funding is required.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If constructed sensibly, we would see that one benefit of a more local delivery would be the emphasi
[normal]s on local 
[normal]'bottlenecks' where congestion extends beyond[bold]&#xa0;[bold]commuting times[bold]. In our region we have 
[normal]indentified
[normal] the following bottlenecks that we think need consideration and feel the LEP’s should give greater consideration too;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local bottle necks and small scale improvements, if improved would have a huge positive impact on local residents and businesses, but often get overlooked for the large scale developments. A more 
[normal]localised
[normal] approac
[normal]h would hopefully ensure this wasn’t the case. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our region feels that the lines of accountability are unclear. Despite the creation of an LTB, the local authorities and transport authority still take the lead on delivery and are accountable for the fundin
[normal]g.
