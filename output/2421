defaultLimiting legal aid to those with a strong connection to the UK will allow the government to violate the rights of migrants with impunity, ending Britain’s tradition of quality legal representation and justice for all.  Without access to legally aided repre
defaultsentation, migrants with overwhelmingly strong cases will not be able to bring them.  This undermines the rule of law, as public authorities will be able to violate rights with impunity.

defaultThe residency test discriminates against non-citizens.  Access to ju
defaultstice is a universal right
default and constitutional principle
default, which should not be limited to the lawfully resident.  In an adversarial immigration system, it is vital that there should be equality of arms between the government and individuals.  Public authorit
defaulties will continue to be represented in all litigation by lawyers, at public expense.  The integrity of the system requires that migrants have access to legal advice.  
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government has responded to criticisms of the impermissibility of removing legal ai
defaultd from migrants in detention by introducing an exemption for challenges to immigration detention.  However, this does not remove the risk of a culture of impunity, 
defaultin which
default irregular migrants
default’
default rights can be abused in a variety of ways without possibility o
defaultf legal redress.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMigrants in detention are placed in a highly vulnerable position, deprived of their liberty without time limit in a carceral
default environment, often administered by contracted private companies.  The recent allegations of sexual abuse of women detained at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre highlight this vulnerability.
default  The proposed changes would prevent victims of abuse from ac
defaultcessing legal aid to challenge failures to investigate or to seek compensation for harm done.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe most vulnerable migrants also frequently require legal aid in order to secure access to appropriate accommodation and support outside detention.  Migrants in
default detention have the right to “Section 4” bail addresses from the Home Office, in order to apply for bail and seek their release.  However, the Home Office frequently acts unlawfully in refusing to provide addresses, or delaying for periods of many months. 
default Without access to legal aid, migrants in detention could be unlawfully deprived of bail addresses, and the ability to challenge their detention, with impunity.

default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUnder the proposals, migrants who have been re
defaultleased from detention will no longer be able to challenge the lawfulness of their detention and make claims for compensation.  The Home Office has repeatedly been found by the High Court to have detained migrants unlawfully.  
defaultThe Home Office paid out £3 mi
defaultllion in 2008-09 and £12 million in 2009-10 in compensation and legal costs arising from unlawful detention actions.
default 
default 
defaultFor example, in the case of

default,
default 
defaulta
default migrant was found to have been detained unlawfully for the whole of his four years and eleven months
default in detention.  The proposals would leave migrants whose rights have been breached unable to access the courts.
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, the residence test is unworkable.  It will require solicitors in other areas of law to act as immigration officers and determine c
defaultomplex questions of lawful residence.  The Legal Aid Agency will face a significant administrative burden in determining whether lawful residence has been sufficiently evidenced.   In some cases, the question of whether the person is lawfully resident is p
defaultrecisely the issue at stake in the litigation.  This will lead to satellite litigation about whether someone is lawfully resident.  Lawful residents who are entitled to legal aid will be wrongly refused by risk-averse non-specialist lawyers who cannot affo
defaultrd the risk of not being paid.
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere will be an increase in litigants in person, at great cost in terms of court time and the efficient administration of justice.  The courts will be filled with poorly argued and prepared cases, which take significant add
defaultitional time to deal with.  The additional costs to the courts are likely to exceed the savings on legal aid. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on thedefault case if the Court grants permission.default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultJudicial reviews are a crucial safeguard against the unconstrained power of the state.  The proposals will make judicial review work financially unviable in the majority of cases, as large amounts of work will be ‘at r
defaultisk’.  Given the precarious financial situation of legal aid immigration firms even prior to these proposals, immigration judicial reviews will in general no longer be brought under legal aid.  As a result, people with strong cases will be unable to access
default justice.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Government has accepted that the original proposals would have targeted meritorious cases where permission is not granted because the case settles prior to reaching the court.  In response, it has introduced a concession whereby the Legal Aid Authority
default 
default(LAA) 
defaultwould have discretion to pay providers in certain meritorious cases where the provider has been unable to secure a costs order as part of a settlement.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis concession fails adequately to address the disincentive created by the proposals to brin
defaultg 
defaultmeritorious judicial reviews.  Pre-permission w
defaulto
defaultrk on judicial reviews remains ‘
defaultat risk
default’
default.  The criteria by which LAA are to assess whether to make a discretionary
default payment are narrow, and clearly drafted so as to minimise the number of such payments.  The
default inadequacy of a safeguard based on LAA discretion is highlighted by the assurances given during the passage of LASPO that LAA would grant exceptional funding where necessary in Article 8 cases
default.  
default  
defaultResearch shows that by July 2013 only 233 applications had
default been received, compared to an expected 5,000 to 7,000 applications, by July 2013 only 233 had been received, and only six had been granted.
default  Moreover, the substantial numbers of cases in which the defendant settles before the judicial review is issued wo
defaultuld not be eligible for discretionary payments for the, often substantial, work done.
default&#xa0;default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe concession also fails to address the objection that even strong judicial reviews correctly brought inevitably involve a risk of refusal of permission.  We frequently
default see important cases involving our clients refused permission initially, yet go on to succeed.  Given the narrow profit margins involved, solicitors will be unable to carry the risk of a significant proportion of their judicial review work going unpaid.  G
defaultiven that they will be unable to accurately determine in advance which cases will not be paid, the logical conclusion will be not to bring any of the cases.  Lawyers who continue to perform their professional duty to their clients, working to a high standa
defaultrd, will frequently go unpaid.  This is not a viable business model.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Ministry of Justice document “Judicial Review: proposals for further reform” contains new proposals to narrow access to judicial review, in particular by 
defaultaltering the approach to sta
defaultnding to prevent
default 
defaultcivil society organisations from bringing judicial reviews in the public interest.  
defaultThese proposals would effectively prevent the vast majority of civil society bodies from accessing the courts in the public interest.  This would be a grav
defaulte restriction on the effective functioning of a democracy.
default&#xa0;
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe consultation provides virtually no evidence to support the proposals; almost all evidence provided in fact undermines the case for the changes.  
defaultThe consultation notes that 
defaultj
defaultudicial reviews ha
defaultve a higher success rate than other judicial reviews, with a final allowed rate of 12%, against 1% overall.  They also amount to 0.05% of total judicial reviews.  Yet the consultation concludes, without evidence or statistics, that the wide approach to sta
defaultnding has tipped into allowing judicial reviews to be used to seek publicity.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe alternative approaches to standing suggested in the consultation document would all exclude the vast majority of civil society organisations litigating in the public interes
defaultt.  These include vital cases that test principles that cannot be considered through individual litigation.  For example, in 
defaultthe 
defaultMedical Justice
default case in 2010
default,
default the High Court quashed the Home Office policy whereby foreign nationals could be removed from the UK with little or no warning and without access to justice.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe consultation also proposes to prevent the courts from issuing Protective Costs Orders where 
defaultthe litigant has a private interest or stake in the case.  It also considers whether, if “political and campaigning” judicial reviews continue to be brought, there should be no availability of Protective Costs Orders.  
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe cumulative impact of these prop
defaultosals would be to prevent virtually all public interest litigation.  Organisations without a direct private interest in the case would be prevented from bringing judicial reviews, or alternatively 
defaultwould be 
defaultprevented from seeking Protective Costs Orders.  O
defaultrganisations with a private interest would be deprived of Protective Costs Orders.   Without Protective Costs Orders, only the largest charities and NGOs would be in a position to 
defaulteven consider bringing
default litigation.  Organisations of the size of Detention A
defaultction would be arbitrarily excluded from 
defaultgoing to the courts in the interest of their beneficiaries
default, as it would never be 
defaultfinancially v
defaultiable
default to take on liability for public authorities’ legal costs.
default&#xa0;defaultThe proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cadefaultses assessed as having “borderline” chances of success.default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe borderline category is important because it is frequently impossible to judge prospects of success before preparing the case.  These cases frequently involve particular importance to the litigant,
default including substantial injustice or suffering.  Solicitors issued contracts by the Legal Aid Agency should be considered to have sufficient professionalism to be able to use the borderline category correctly.
