defaultVerwood Town Council (TIC 081)
default&#xa0;
defaultVerwood is a dormitory town on the fringe of the SE Dorset conurbation which rapidly grew from a 
defaultvillage in 1980s &amp; 1990s. It has poor public transport connections resulting in almost total reliance 
defaulton private cars by those who are able to own &amp; drive a car and isolation for those who cannot; 
defaultprimarily the young and the very old.
default&#xa0;
default(All statistics are taken from the Verwood Town Plan survey (2010) unless otherwise indicated
defaultVerwood is the second largest town in East Dorset, with a population of over 14,000. It is 15 miles from Bournemouth and Poole and 30 miles from Southampton or Dorchester. The population of the 
defaulttown has increased significantly in recent years, placing a high demand on the existing road system.
defaultFuture development around the Town, such as Hampshire County Council's proposal for a quarry 
default(Purple Haze) to the south of Verwood, potential housing and employment sites and a new Upper 
defaultSchool identified in the Christchurch and East Dorset Core Strategy, will increase local traffic.
defaultThe vision of the County's Local Transport Plan is "a safe, reliable and accessible low carbon 
defaulttransport system...that assists in the development of a strong low carbon economy, maximises the 
defaultopportunities for sustainable transport and respects and protects the area's unique environmental 
defaultassets." However, the only confirmed benefits to the town are the Springfield Distributor Road to 
defaultease traffic problems to the Howe Lane school campus.
defaultNo other improvements to roads or bus services are proposed in the period to 2026.
defaultDue to the town's location, car ownership is very high, with 97% of households having one or more 
defaultcars. According to the Dorset County Council's 2005 statistics, 8.3% of households in Verwood &amp; 
defaultThree Legged Cross are without a car suggesting that non-car owners may be under-represented in 
defaultthe town plan survey results. The reliance on private transport is also demonstrated in that 7 out of 
default8 residents travel to work in their own car.
defaultFollowing a review of British Railways in 1963, the Verwood train station was closed, along with the 
defaultrest of the Salisbury &amp; Dorset Junction line and other lines north of Bournemouth. Buses are now the 
defaultonly form of local public transport available in East Dorset.
defaultCurrently there is an hourly bus service, up about 6pm, operating from Verwood to Bournemouth 
default(via Ringwood) from Monday to Saturday. There is also an hourly bus service between Verwood and 
defaultPoole (via Ferndown) from Monday to Saturday, although this also stops in the evening. Both 
defaultjourneys take about an hour, compared to around 30 minutes going direct by car. There is a very 
defaultlimited Sunday service (3 buses each way) between Bournemouth and Ferndown via Ringwood, 
defaultVerwood &amp; Three Legged Cross and no e
defaultvening bus service. 
defaultThere are no direct bus services to the
default 
defaulttwo local community hospitals at Wimborne and St. Leonards, nor to the centre of the East Dorset 
defaultDistrict at Wimborne.
defaultMore than half of respondents consider that public transport fails to meet their needs, with greatest 
defaultdissatisfaction felt by younger residents. While half of those using a bus do so for shopping, only a fifth use it to get to work. Just over a third find it suitable for accessing services such as the hospital 
defaultor for leisure purposes. This is possibly because shopping is more flexible and can fit around the bus 
defaulttimetable, whereas work, hospital appointments and many leisure activities have specific start and 
defaultfinish times.
defaultThe car is the most common mode of transport for all activities except for visiting the library where just over half walk. Many people also walk to the GP surgery, and around a third walk to school and 
defaultthe local shops. Very few people use the bus, even when going to the hospital (the most popular 
defaultdestination by bus).
