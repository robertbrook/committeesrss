[[[Written submission from Stephen Biddle (BRC 63)]]]&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]]I did some electrical work for a domestic customer, as part of a conservatory construction.  The builder to whom I was subcontracted did a substandard job and was replaced by the customer.  The replacement builder had all the work to date surveyed.  NAPIT were requested to survey the electrical work. NAPIT produced a report stating that the electrical work was not compliant with current safety standards.I found the NAPIT report to be incomplete and incorrect and took this up with NAPIT, who failed to respond to my phone calls and emails.  During one phone call I was told by a NAPIT employee that I should file an official complaint to which they must respond within three weeks.Â   I filed a complaint and had no response. After further repeated phone calls I made contact with a NAPIT director and explained the situation.  The director sent me an email acknowledging the defects in the report and committed to: 1 Send an apology to myself and the customer 2 Send a full refund to the customer 3 Issue a new report within 3 weeks None of these happened and I arranged to meet a NAPIT inspector at the customer site.  He stated that the installation was safe and that I could proceed to register it. I did not receive a new report or an apology.  The customer did not receive the refund. The customer refused to pay my bill using the NAPIT report as justification.  I took the case to the county court and the judge dismissed the report and ordered the customer to pay. NAPIT are refusing to re-issue the report and the refund on the basis that the director who made the commitment has left the company. 

[[[Conclusion]]]All this leads me to conclude that NAPIT are organisationally and technically incompetent and not fit to hold their status as a register of competent persons.  I would like to see their contract as such withdrawn. &#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
