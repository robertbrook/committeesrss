"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Ben Hardwick [OLS0022]&#xa0;\nI \nam\n delighted to hear of your committee’s laudable efforts to look into the subject of \nthe\n damage \nthat \ncan be done to the younger generation by uncontrolled internet access – thank you very much for \nlaunching \nthis\n enquiry\n.\n&#xa0;\nT\nhe ordered, peaceful and generally prosperous \noutward-looking UK society with its \nopportunities, comprehensively organised education, \nhealthcare, aid, inf\nrastructure and\n defence/security arrangements\n \nare a priceless result of the daily work of Government – something that is rarely recognised or valued like it should be.\n&#xa0;\nThese benefits also extend far beyond Britain’s shores and the UK i\ns still a beacon of tolerance and crucial lynchpin of global peace and security\n as well as \nbeing \nan example that is frequently followed by other Governments and States\n. \n&#xa0;\nLittle wonder then that Government is undoubtedly an instrument of God – \n1\nst\n Epistle \nof \nPeter\n, Chapter\n 2, V13\n;\n it is a ‘giver’ and ‘provider’ as well as a ‘controller’\n – again\n,\n the Bible states \nin the Epistle to the Romans Chapter 13 \n‘for \nhe\n bears not the sword in vain’\n along with a good deal else\n. \n&#xa0;\nGovernment’s first duty \nis\n the protection of its citizens\n – this is an area at which HMG excels whether in defence and intelligence matters or law-enforcement that stabilises and enhances the condition and experience of society and its citizens and the whole global community.\n&#xa0;\nI se\nek by these few paragraphs to set out simply how absolutely right it is for you to persist with better control measures \non internet viewing \nand that you may be encouraged \nand set forward \nin doing what is clearly your duty.\n&#xa0;\nI am a farther of 4 children fro\nm 3 \nto \n10 years old and revel in watching their rapid development and willingness to absorb knowledge at an apparently impossible rate. They are very impressionable and it is a very great responsibility as parents that my wife and I have in protecting and \nnurturing the next generation\n into responsible citizens\n.\n&#xa0;\nAffectionate\n control and unselfishness is absolutely critical in this and it is really tragic to hear figures from OFCOM that more than 75% of 14-16 year olds have accessed adult material.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nThis i\ns a situation that will cause permanent mind-scarring and a lack of fidelity and stable relationships on which true happiness is built in \nour \nsociety\n – to say nothing of the cost to \nGovernment and the taxpayer of broken homes because of so-called freedom t\no look at this \ncontent\n when in one’s tender teens.\n&#xa0;\nHMG should move forward fearlessly with comprehensive and efficient control measures of what is currently a lawless ‘wild west’ of media so as not to fail the potential of following generations.\n&#xa0;\nIt is \na\n most revolting and immoral \nthought\n that there are actually publishers and persons making millions out of degrading us and ruining the moral compass of the young in our society.\n&#xa0;\nI believe that there should be default blocking of all adult material on inte\nrnet enabled devices sold in the UK as soon as possible.\n&#xa0;\nI wish you all the best and courage in your deliberations on this vital subject.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
