"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the BBC [FBB0097]&#xa0;&#xa0;The BBC’s mission and value for money  &#xa0;\n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the opportunity\n to respond to the Committee’s i\nnquiry\n, which \nw\ne regard as\n an\n important contributio\nn to the debate about the BBC.\n \nIt will be for the Government to start Charter Review before 2016 and in this submission we have therefore been mindful of the danger of pre-j\nudging that \nprocess.\n \nOur submission \ntherefore \nfocuses on \nour \nrece\nnt \nand current \nperformance\n \nand \non \nour strategy to 201\n6, as well as answers\n the Committee’s specific questions. \nIt is accompanied by a comprehensive audience research pack and two recently \npublished papers on the value of Public Service Broadcasting (PSB).\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur starting-point is that t\nhe BBC exists to have a positive impact on society by bringing the best \nin \nmedia content to \neveryone. Our mission is to \ninform, educate and entertain; provide \nvalue to all audiences not just some; introduce audiences to things they love but otherwise might not have discovered; and focus on the quality and depth of impact, not just the quantity of consumption. While the primary purpose of the BBC is to serve audi\nences and society, \nwe are also \nan important \npart of\n Britain’s creative economy\n at home and globally\n, supporting innovation,\n \ngrowth and jobs\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe background to this inquiry includes the mistakes that the BBC has made over Savile, DMI and severance pay.  We\n acknowledge that these have raised questions about how the BBC is run and governed, which we look forward to discussing with the Committee.  In the meantime, we have put plans in place to learn the appropriate lessons, including through our review of gove\nrnance with the Trust and the cap on severance payments of £150,000.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite those mistakes, the BBC is in the middle of a period of genuine creative success, from the Olympics to Dr Who. That creative health reflects the underlying strength of the BBC’s \nmodel, \nbased\n on the principles of universal access, shared investme\nnt and ownership by the public – \nprinciples that are \nshared with many other public services. \nThe end result is the widespread availability of better, cheaper \nmedia \nservices for the public t\nhan could be achieved by the market alone. This is important because \nPSB \nis \na \nsocial \n‘primary good’ (like health and \neducation) which everyone has a right to access in order to participate fully in society. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThat model also delivers value for money\n.\n \nOver \nthe past 20 years, the BBC has worked hard to deliver more without costi\nng more. Twenty years ago, the Licence F\nee was over £147 \nin today’s money.\n We \nhad two TV stations, five national radio stations, and local and Nations radio. Today, we deliver four times more television channels, twice as many national radio stations, \nonline \nservices and the \niPlayer\n.\n \nAudience perceptions of BBC value for money have \nincreased during this Charter period.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTh\ne BBC’s mission feels as relevant as ever \nbut \nwill need to be \ndelivered \nin new\n \nand \ndifferent ways\n as technologies, markets and audience expectations evolve. In recent years the number of content providers, formats and platforms has grown rapidly; on-demand usage is rising; and audiences have come to \nexpect greater\n control, personalisation and particip\nation in media services. The \nscale of the BBC in today’s media market \nshould \nbe kept in perspective. Twenty years ago, the BBC accounted for around 40% of \ntotal \nbroadcast revenues. Today, we account for around \n25%. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst these changes bolster the value \nof \nPSB\n, such as in producing and curating high-quality content, they make delivering this value more \nchallenging\n. For example, growth in the number of gated platforms threatens the prominence of public service output, and globalisation of content market\ns\n a\nllows highly-funded international\n players\n to compete with suppliers of UK\n \noriginated content. \n&#xa0;The BBC’s strategy to 2016&#xa0;8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe BBC \nhas developed a \nstrategy to respond to these changes and to \ncontinue \ndelive\nr\ning\n its public service mission. \nTh\ne\n strategy was set out in a speech by the BBC Director General in \nOctober\n this year\n. \nIn summary, w\ne \nplan to\n: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe strategy is about \nre-inventing the BBC and \nmaximising the value \nwe \ndeliver\n to audiences,\n within \nour current\n \nbudgetary\n c\nonstraints\n.\n \nThe 2\n010 Licence Fee settlement saw \nfunding frozen in nominal terms and the addition of fu\nrther \nobl\nigations\n to be funded from core revenue\ns\n. In response\n,\n the B\nBC has set out plans to cut our \nexpenditure \nby 16% by 2016/17 plus 4% for re-investments.\n \nTo deliver the new strategic plans\n,\n set out \nbelow\n,\n an additional £100m annum will \nbe required by 2016/17\n. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nThese\n savings will be funded \nthrough \na combination of efficiencies and scope reductions. \nWe are \nplanning to \ndeliver efficiency savings at 3%-4% per year to 2016/17\n.\n \nTherefore, tough choices in content and services will be necessary in the years ahead. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0; \nAn \nimportant aspect\n of the new strategy\n is BBC \niPlayer\n,\n \nwhich will \nprovi\nde not just “TV, online” but increasingly\n “online TV” with \nthe \ncontent formats and modes of curation and consumption this allows. A key strand is the content proposition, where we will ex\ntend\n the catch-up window for public service content to 30 days; offer opportu\nnities to purchase material t\nh\nat\n is outside this window; and \ndevelop new ways in which online content and delivery can improve the way the BBC delivers its public service mission.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nTo further the Reithian mission\n,\n we will \nimprove a number of \nkey content genres\n.\n News will benefit from more long-term investigations, a refreshed online offer (including an emphasis on mobile delivery), and a target to double our global audience. Our arts coverage will be confident, with new commissions for television\n and\n \nregular bro\nadcast performances from significant artistic events and institutions\n.\n We will re\n-\nlaunch our partnership with Arts Council England – the Space – to pioneer the discovery of new kinds of digital art and talent. We \nplan to \nbring landmark arts and music serie\ns and \nevents to peak-time television \nand establish a public service position in digital music through \nPlaylister\n, a partnership with online music websites. \n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nBBC One will \nfocus on\n distinctive drama and entertainment, as wel\nl as public service events that\n \ns\nupport and widen the \nnational conversations. BBC Four will return to its role as a multi-genre channel tasked with finding the most innovative, high-quality material. BBC Two will have additional factual entertainment, comedy and features and will continue\n to bring distinctive content to a broad audience. BBC Two and BBC Four will work more effectively together as the BBC’s core channels for the arts, music and current affairs.  \n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nOverall, the BBC \nwould like to \nchange its \nrelationship with audiences – \nto \nevolve from an organisation that speaks to everyone at the same time, to one that also has direct relationships with individual licence fee payers.\n&#xa0;\nWe want to create a public service that is both universal and personal\n.\n The BBC is far f\nrom unique in this r\nespect: many other \npublic services are looking to personalise and be\ncome more responsive to users.\n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nWe will \nus\ne\n new technologies to enable \nall \nlicence fee payers to get \nmore\n out of BBC services and the \ntime they already spend with us: m\nore co\nntent they lov\ne, easier to find\n through, for example, recommendations\n; t\nhe di\nscovery of new things they did no\nt know they liked\n; and\n \ng\nreater audience interactivity \nand participation in programmes and services.\n \n&#xa0;\nBBC’s support for the British creative economy &#xa0;16.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nUK \nhas one of the strongest creative sectors in the world.\n \nThe sector \nbenefits from a \n‘virtuous circle’ \nof creativity, world-class talent and a digita\nlly savvy, active consumer base. \nIt is characterised by ‘competition for quality’ \n(not funding) \nbetw\neen \nstron\ng public institutions \nlike the BBC \nand a strong commercial sector\n, resulting in better programmes \nand greater innovation\n from all parties\n. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC occupies a ‘hub’ position at the heart of the complex network of \ntechnology, arts, design, music and broadc\nast sub\n-\nsectors that comprise the UK creative industries.  The evidence \nwould appear to suggest\n that\n \nwe \nstimulate\n private sector investment\n rather than \ncrowd it out\n.\n \nThe \nLicence F\nee \nand BBC have\n positive supply and demand-side effects \nacross \nthe creative economy, \nhelping to \ncreat\ne\n the conditions for \ngrowth in a range of\n ways\n,\n including\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Responses to specific questions from the Committee&#xa0;\nQ1) What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting? &#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0; \nIn the UK\n,\n there is strong and long-standing consensus in favour of public service broadcasting as a means of \npromoting social\n \nand cultural \ngoals\n that go beyond \ncorrecting ‘market failures’\n.\n \nThese goals\n include: reflecting and shaping the nation’s culture and value\ns through a breadth of UK-originated content; securing plurality of high-quality new\ns\n and information to help the public engage in the democratic process; and ensuring that content is universally available, easy to find, and free at the point of use\n. In o\nur view\n, PSB \nalso complement\ns\n and underpin\ns\n the editorial standards and risk-taking capacity of the rest of the market.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC is the cornerstone of \nthe \nUK\n’s\n \nPSB \nsystem\n.\n \nOur mission is to inform, educate and entertain all audiences\n with great programmes and services\n. \nFor us, serving the audience is an end in itself rather than \na \nmeans to revenue maximisation.\n The BBC’s contribution to British culture and society is captured in its Charter-defined public purposes.\n \n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0; \nIn summary, the B\nBC exists:\n \n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0; \nThe success of the BBC is not an accident. Our mission and the economics \nbehind this \ngo hand in hand. Because the public share the cost of the BBC, each licence fee payer benefits from one another’s investment.\n This means that there is universal access to better, cheaper programmes than would otherwise be the case. \n&#xa0;Q2) How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes? Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change? \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC has a strong track record of delivery over the current Charter period.\n \nWe have modernised our service portfolio to keep pace with audience demands, \nlaunching the iPlayer and new HD channels. \nWe have done this at a time when the BBC’s core funding\n up to 2012\n \n(excluding \nthe \nTV switchover allocation) broadly rose in line with inflation. \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0; \nOver the Charter period, t\nhe BBC’s reach has remained near-universal, with \n96% of UK adults using one or more\n of our services each week\n.\n The BBC is \none of \nthe most used public service\ns\n in the UK\n, being chosen by the public around 200\n million\n times every day\n. \nBBC One and \nRadio 2 \nare \nthe \nUK TV and radio services with the highest figures; and BBC Online \nthe only \nUK-owned website in the top ten most-used websites in the UK\n. We also deliver a substantial 19\n \nhours\n of time-spent per user per week on average\n, factors which reflect the quality and diversity of our output and are crucial to our success in bringing the \nnation together.\n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC also excels on quality, with more UK viewers reporting that BBC One and BBC Two show well-made, h\nigh-quality programmes than \nthe other UK PSBs\n. We outperform all international rivals too, with BBC One rated highest on quality out\n of 66 major TV channels examined globally and BBC Two in third place\n. \nThis year, the BBC has received the highest number of nominations of any broadcaster in the world at the Golden Globes.\n&#xa0;\n25.\n&#xa0; \nPublic trust in the BBC is crucial to our mission and an area \nwhere we strive to do better. Whilst the BBC’s rating is showing signs of recovery following Savile, and has been rising on a long term basis over the last decade, it is still someway short of pre-Savile levels\n. However, \nas scores have been rising over th\ne longer term, \ntrust scores are still higher than \nin \n20\n0\n9\n. The BBC is identified by\n \n58% of the public as their most trusted source of news in the UK, by \n58% as the most accurate and by 49% as the most impartial – far ahead of the nearest alternative, \nITV, \non 14%, 13% and 14%\n. \n&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC has made substantial efficiency savings in\n this Charter period \nand now costs only 4.3 pence per user-hour of content consumed\n, small in relation to the value of the\n \noutput \nproduced. Similarly,\n willingness to pay for the BBC is \nhigh\n.\n We perform \nwell by industry standards, costing only 40 pence per household \ncompared, for example, with Sky’s average revenue per user of £1.53 per day.\n \n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC Trust’s submission summarises its assessment of the\n \nBBC’s performance \nagainst the \nCharter-defined \npublic purposes\n, noting our satisfactory or strong performance in each of: education and learning; sustaining citizenship and civil society\n; bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK; and delivering\n the benefit to the public of emerging communications, technologies and services. \n&#xa0;\n28.\n&#xa0; \n \nUnder ‘creativity the cultural excellence’ they acknowledge the wide \nrange of \nhigh quality \n content we provide but that further progress is necessary on distinctiveness and the freshness of our ideas. These are key objectives for the BBC and areas which we will particularly target as we move to bolster the BBC’s linear channels \nand\n key genres su\nch as \narts, \nmusic and drama. Indeed we have ma\nde\n progress already, with the percentage of BBC TV programmes rated by audiences as ‘fresh and new’ up to 71% in 2012/13 from 68% in 2010/11\n.\n&#xa0;\n29.\n&#xa0; \nUnder \nthe \n‘nations, regions and communities’ \npurpose \nthe BBC has \na\ncted as the anchor tenant for new \n‘creative clusters’ in \nSalford, \nGlasgow and Cardiff, has ambitious plans for the Midlands, \nand \nis\n \nmaking many more TV programmes outside \nLondon –  having\n already met its Network Supply targets for \nTV\n and due to exceed \nthese\n by the end of the Charter. \nWe are also\n working to ensure that all demographic groups and areas of the UK are\n \ncatered for\n, innovating\n online \nto\n appeal more \nfully \nto younger audience\ns\n and targeting underserved audiences in\n our plans to bolster the BBC’\ns linear channels. The BBC’s Nations\n and local\n services are \nvalued by Licence Fee payers and remain crucial in allowing us to meet \nthis \npublic purpose, \nincluding\n through their focus on significant events, such as the\n \nreferendum\n on Scotland’s constitutional future\n, and by holding local decision makers to account, for example through local radio journalism. We are making progress on the representativeness of our output, with the BBC’s share of TV viewing in the North West \nnow \nclos\ner to the UK average and \nthe proportion\n of people\n there who \nfeel\n the BBC fairly portrays \ntheir region \nnow representative of the UK average\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3) What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? &#xa0;\n30.\n&#xa0; \nThe\n BBC\n’s remit\n \nrequires us to provide something of value for everyone and \nto \nprovide\n a wide range of programme\ns\n and services\n in order to do so\n.\n \nAu\ndiences \nsupport this \nremit\n, scoring 12 out of 14 genres as important areas for the BBC to \nserve when asked to consider the good of society as a whole\n. \nResearch consisten\ntly shows that the British public want a BBC that extends choice and brings them \nbreadth, discovery, depth and enjoyment\n. A ‘market failure’\n BBC would not meet audience \nexpectations or have the \ncultural \nimpact that our mission requires.\n&#xa0;\n31.\n&#xa0; \nIn addition, \nPSB is arguably at its most effective when it not only delivers high quality content \nbut also \nencourages \nthe market to do the same. \nWhilst it has occasionally been argued that \nthe BBC \ncrowds\n-\nout commercial investment, this misunderstands the \nsignificant impact \nthat \nPSBs can have on \naudience expectations\n of quality\n, \ncreating\n a \n‘\nvirtuous \ncircle\n’\n of competition\n \nbetween providers \nthat\n deliver\ns\n innovation and better programming f\nor\n all.\n \nN\nations with well-funded PSBs investing in high-quality, diverse new content tend \nalso \nto have revenue-strong commercial markets investing in these ways\n, \na\nnd the UK is a \nprime \nexample of this. \nThere is a strong argument that a ‘market failure’\n BBC would cause \nthe market to fail.\n \n&#xa0;\n32.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important to see the BBC’s scale in perspective. Over the last twenty years, the BBC has declined \nfrom c40% of all broadcas\nt revenues to c25%, with the growth of pay-TV and advertising markets.\n Moreover, audiences are benefiting as new companies offer them content and services which compete with traditional broadcasting. \n \nIn turn, that means that the BBC is by no means the bi\nggest player in these converged markets, with a licence fee income of £3.6 billion compar\ned\n to the revenues of companies such as BSkyB and BT at home (with revenues of £7.2 billion and £18 billion respectively in 2012/13), as well as \nhighly-funded US rival\ns such as Netflix, Lovefilm (owned by Amazon) and Google (£35.7 billion in 2012/13). \n&#xa0;\n33.\n&#xa0; \nWe believe the BBC’s scope should be to: provide linear and on-demand services (allowing creative and cost synergies between the two and providing for different usage pa\ntterns); on a wide range of platforms and devices by IP and broadcast means (catering for offline groups and those, particularly the young, for whom IP delivery is the most natural approach); serve as publisher and broadcaster (integrating the best of in-h\nouse and third-party content in a single experi\nence). The BBC’s competitors operate\n \nacross the value chain \nand the BBC \nshould be able to \ndo \nso too in order to deliver \nits public mission\n and serve audience\ns\n effectively\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nB) What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?&#xa0;\n34.\n&#xa0; \nThe right balance in the BBC’s supply base between in-house and external production \nshould \nbe determined by audience and public interest objectives. \nThe UK \nproduction sector is strong, second only to the US on \noverseas\n content sales\n. It is\n based on a mixed \nand competitive \ne\ncology\n \nof\n \ni\nndependent producers\n, \nin-house \nproduction arms (\ne.g. \nBBC) and broadcaster-owned production arms supplying various parties (e.g.\n ITV).\n Each element brings a complementary set of strengths to the mix.\n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0; \n \nOur goal is to ensure the best programmes for audiences and the creation of IP that promotes British creativity abroad. We believe that a \nstrong in-house production base is \nnecessary\n to meet these goals. \nBBC in-house production promotes a focus on quality and public service values; guarantees the cost-effective supply of a wide range of genres; \ncreates\n creative clusters across the UK\n; \nand provides the BBC with vital IP, facilitating \nexports, the launch of new services like iPlayer and operation at scale o\nverseas through BBC Worldwide\n. \nUK licence fee payers effectively own the pool of BBC IP created through fully-owned works. \nGiven the growing importance of IP in the media value chain,\n a scale position is essential if we are to build strong global brands and deliver an economic return to the UK creative economy. \n&#xa0;\n36.\n&#xa0; \nThe UK independent sector promotes competition\n, \nnew ideas and content formats, and has seen revenues grow from £120m in 1982\n to a substantial £2.3 billion in 2010\n – 25% \nof this \nfrom overseas commissions and sales. \nThe BBC benefits from a strong independent sector.\n&#xa0;\n37.\n&#xa0; \nThe\n Window of Creative Competition is effective in allowing the BBC to find the best ideas from in-house and \nindependent\n producers\n, and r\nights holders will \nalso \nsoon benefit from the permanent download-to-own window planned for BBC\n commissioned\n \ncontent. The BBC consistently meets its target of 25% external spend for \nBBC Online, and through its plans for iPlayer and Online to 2016/17 will likely increase this figure. \n&#xa0;\nQ4) How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?&#xa0;\n38.\n&#xa0; \nDespite limited access to capital BBC Worldwide has delivered a \nstrong\n financial performance, r\neturning\n over £1bn to the BBC since 2007\n, \nincluding\n £400m in dividend payments and £\n562m of content investment\n. It now\n \nprovides\n \nup to 75% o\nf \nthe \nfunding for some of the BBC \nprogrammes\n \nto which it\n contributes. BBC Global \nNews\n \nhelp\ns the BBC to fund \na \nglobal newsgathering \noperation of \nscale \nand to \ninvest\n in d\nigital platforms\n,\n \nreturning\n £38m p\ner annum \nto\n BBC News\n in recent years\n,\n \na figure \nexpected to rise over time. \nBBC \nWorldwide \nbalances\n \nshort-term \nreturns \nand\n \nlong term \ngrowth\n, and w\nhilst \nsmall in overall revenue \nterms \nit outperforms \nthe market \nin key t\nerritorie\ns, \nsuch as\n \nAustralia and New Zealand where \nrevenue\n \nhas\n grown\n \nat 3-4 times the market rate\n \nand \ni\nn the US where we have \nachieved a 5% growth rate\n, \nincreas\ning\n share\n. \n              \n39.\n&#xa0; \nBBC Global News\n and BBC Worldwide \ncontribute to the UK’s reputation and \nthe \ncomparative\n advantage \nof \nits\n \ncreative sector \noverseas, contributing in particular to the following public purposes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n40.\n&#xa0; \nAs outlined earlier, the BBC has \ncommissioned \nnew research among business leaders in key trading countries to assess\n&#xa0;\nthe eff\nect of culture on commerce. The research shows that the UK is regarded as one of the most attractive places to do business \nand that business leaders’ perceptions of UK culture, and of the BBC in particular, \nhelp \nshape these attitudes and behaviours\n.\n&#xa0;\n41.\n&#xa0; \nIn \nOctober 2013 BBC Worldwide launched a strategy to drive long-term success by building the BBC’s reputation for premium content delivered th\nrough global brands. It outlined\n plans for BBC Worldwide to increase content investment, \nbecoming the principal \nco-production partner of the BBC’s Natural History Unit\n; launch three new core consumer brands propositions, including BBC Earth\n;\n and deliver a greater focus on digital innovation to extend the company’s reach and routes to market. A global approach will \nenable the BBC to approach or match the budgets of leading global media companies, attract and retain talent, and secure distribution. The BBC’s objective is to double its global audience to 500m, partly funded through commercial income to manage the cost \nto licence fee payers. \n&#xa0;Q5) What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?&#xa0;\n42.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC’s role is to innovate \non behalf of audiences and ensure that the benefits of new \ndigital \ntechnologies are available to all. \n \n&#xa0;\n43.\n&#xa0; \nSet up by pioneers of the wireless in 1922\n,\n the BBC has \na strong track record in \ntechnology\n innovation\n, \nincluding \nFM radio, DAB, colour TV, NICAM sound, Ceefax, and interactive TV and driving international standards and hardware designs for \ndigital terre\nstrial television\n (DTT)\n. \nThis has been made possible by \na combination of \nour R&amp;D expertise, long-term perspective and access to stable funding. \nWe can be an early-mover where commercial risks may be too high\n for others\n, and can help in coordinating the ind\nustry to achieve collaborative initiatives and open standards – as, for example, our pan-industry work developing standards with groups such as the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) and our incubation of YouView (based on open standards and licensed\n to third parties). \n&#xa0;\n44.\n&#xa0; \nBack in 2002, DTT was in crisis. \nA coalition, led by the BBC, re-built the platform. \nToday, Freeview is the most popular TV platform in the UK, used in three-quarters of TV households\n, providing more choice for viewers, and a \nplatform for dozens of new commercial digital channels.\n The BBC often works through joint ventures and partnerships\n \nto make synergies across the industry, and in regional hubs to promote economic development across the UK\n \n. \n&#xa0;\n45.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC has a market leadersh\nip role to play in launching new services based on new technologies.  We can take the lead even where business models are unclear, thus helping commercial players to enter new markets when the opportunities become \nclearer. \nBBC Online \n(launched in 1997) \nwas\n a \n‘pull’\n factor\n for early adopters of the internet\n and \nBBC \niPlayer\n (launched in 2007) \nstimulated demand for on-demand TV, where the UK \nnow \nhas a leading position.\n \n&#xa0;\n46.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nfinal \npart of the BBC’s role is to ensure t\nhat the\n benefits of digital technologies are available to all not just ‘early adopters’. We \nuse our trusted brand and marketing capabilit\ny\n to \ninspire confidence, \npresent \nthe benefits of \nnew technologies\n,\n \nand signpost assistance\n. \nFrom 2015, we will play a similar role for digital creativity, launching a major project to promote coding and programming, just as we did for basic computing and software in the 1980s through BBC Micro. \n&#xa0;\nQ6) How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?               47.\n&#xa0; \nThis is an issue that\n will be considered at Charter R\neview and the BBC will make its case as part of this process. Based on the evidence today, w\ne believe \nthat \nthe Licence Fee \nis very likely to \nremain the most effective way to fund the BBC\n beyond 2016\n and we look forward to discussing this with the Committee\n. \nAt its simplest, \nt\nhe Licence Fee is a form of shared or pooled investment to fund a public service that everyone can \nand does \nuse\n. The \nadvantages of the licence fee include:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n48.\n&#xa0; \nThe Licence Fee works in practice too, \nwith 47% of the UK adults now backing it as the most ap\npropriate way to fund the BBC, \naround \ndouble the figures for s\nubscri\nption or advertising \nand up from 31% only a decade ago\n.\n \nE\nvasion \nand collection costs \nare \nalso \nstable\n \n– \nat\n 5\n.5\n%\n and 3.\n0\n% of income\n respectively\n, \nrelatively low by international standards\n.\n \nW\nillingness to pay\n \nfor the BBC is high\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n49.\n&#xa0; \nThe \nLicence\n Fee has \nalways \nadapted\n flexibl\ny\n to technology change\n over time\n, \nincluding\n through a \nrelatively simple change to \nthe \nregulat\nions\n \nin 2004 \nto\n \ncapture \nhouseholds watching\n linear \nTV\n over the interne\nt\n – a change which is now well understood\n. \n&#xa0;\n50.\n&#xa0; \nSome have raised \nthe impact \nof increased on-demand consump\ntion on the Licence Fee.\n The Licence Fee definition remains robust\n, with \nwell under 2%\n \nof households consum\ning\n \nexclusively\n on-demand content\n and so not requiring a Licence Fee.\n However, the definition could start to create perverse incentives, with a \nfee \npayable for some ways of consuming BBC TV but not others. \nWe would welcome discussing this issue with the Committee to consider whether and when the Licence Fee should be modern\nised again. \n&#xa0;\n51.\n&#xa0; \nAlternative methods of funding the BBC \nwould appear to \nhave significant drawbacks. Subscription would turn the BBC into a commercial operator with an incentive to provide services that maximise revenues and/or profits. The evidence suggests t\nhat a subscription model would be likely to reduce the payment base, increasing costs for consumers who remain and exclud\ning\n many in society who could not afford to pay\n. \n&#xa0;\n52.\n&#xa0; \nIf the objective of the BBC were to maximise advertising revenues, the BBC would shape its programming to maximise the benefits to advertisers rather than to audiences. \nIt is notable that audiences report the lack of advertising on our services as a key ch\naracteristic they value about the BBC\n. \nAn advertiser-funded BBC would \nalso \nhave significant consequences for commercial broadcasters and the revenue available for investment in content.\n&#xa0;\nQ7) Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?  \n&#xa0;\n53.\n&#xa0; \nAs argued above, the UK’s successful broadcasting model is characterised by competition for quality, not funding, between the BBC and commercial broadcasters\n. The unitary receipt of the Licence Fee by the BBC serves a number of public interest objectives:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n54.\n&#xa0; \nThe current Licence Fee settlement imposed a number of new obligations on the BBC that will be funded from core income. The financial cost is around £235\n.5\n million per annum from 2\n013/14 to 2016/17\n (excluding the World Serv\nice)\n, or 6\n% of Licence Fee income\n. As a result, we will have to make reductions to BBC content and services. \n&#xa0;\n55.\n&#xa0; \nThere will\n, of course,\n be further debate on this subject at Charter Review. It is important that funding models are properly tested to ensure value for money, \nincluding\n against the following criteria:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ8) What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? &#xa0;\n56.\n&#xa0; \nInternationally\n,\n PSB is at a crossroads, with\n&#xa0;\nsome PSBs in rude health and successfully adapting their services and funding to a converged environment and others facing considerable difficulties. Furthermore, the overall trend is that where PSBs are well-funded and strong\n – investing in original content, diverse schedules and quality and thereby driving ‘competition for quality’ – so too are commercial broadcasters.\n&#xa0;\n This is true, for example, in the UK, which has \na \nparticularly rich PSB and commercial ecosystem. It is in\n stark contrast to countries\n, such as Portugal\n,\n \nwhere PSB has faced major funding cuts and threats of privatisation, or Greece which witnessed the forcible closure of a PSB\n.\n \nSuch challenges to PSB suggest there is a \ntipping-point\n \nfrom which it is hard to r\necover.\n \n&#xa0;\n57.\n&#xa0; \nOther key lessons from international comparison include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ9) How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016? In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC? \n&#xa0;\n58.\n&#xa0; \nThe BBC’s governance model beyond 2016 will be considered as part of Charter Review and we do not wish to pre\n-\njudge that process. \nOur priority is to make the existing model work as effectively as possible, within the constraints \nof the current Charter. \n&#xa0;\n59.\n&#xa0; \nIn September\n 2013\n, \nthe Trust and Executive \nannounced \na joint \nreview \nof \nthe BBC’s internal governance systems and structures, and the culture that surrounds them. We did this in response to a number of events that prompted legitimate questions about the effectiveness of the BBC’s system of governance, both within and between t\nhe Trust and Executive. \n&#xa0;\n60.\n&#xa0; \nThe \noutcome of the \nreview, announced on 11\nth\n December\n, is that the respective responsibilities of the Trust and Executive Board will be clarified, within the terms of the Charter. The Trust will focus on its oversight and regulat\nory role, ensuring we are answerable to licence fee payers.\n&#xa0;\n The Executive will be responsible for running the organisation. \n&#xa0;\n61.\n&#xa0; \nThe role of the Executive Board will be strengthened.\n&#xa0;\n It will be responsible for all aspects of management and operations and th\ne main decision-making forum for the \nBBC.\n&#xa0;\n The role and number of non-executive directors on the \nExecutive Board \nwill increase, starting with the appointment of Sir Howard Stringer, previously CEO and chairman of Sony, from January 2014. We will also reduc\ne the number of pan-BBC boards by more than 60%. \n&#xa0;\n62.\n&#xa0; \nThese changes are designe\nd to deliver simpler \nstructures, bet\nter decision-making and proper \naccountability.\n&#xa0;\n They \nshould \nensure everyone in\nside and outside the BBC is \nclear about who is responsible for \nmajor decisions and projects. The BBC should also be able to make faster decisions and reduce the time senior managers spend in meetings and increase the time spent making output for audiences.\n&#xa0;\n63.\n&#xa0; \nAs with governance, the most appropriate constitutional model \nfor the BBC will be the\n subject of debate at Charter review\n. \nOur starting-point is that \na Charter and Agreement model safeguard the BBC’s independence and provide stability for long-term investm\nent.\n \n&#xa0;\n64.\n&#xa0; \nThe Charter model underpins the BBC’s unique governance structure and funding model, explicitly committing the Government of the day to respect the editorial and operational independence of the BBC. Charter terms are subject to extensive political d\neba\nte at the time of Charter review\n, ensuring appropriate parliamentary and public scrutiny, but \nwith a \nrelatively fixed period to provide room for the BBC to deliver on its commitments. The ten-year \nterm gives the BBC a sufficient horizon over which to pl\nan investment and helps to keep decisions on the BBC’s remit out-of-step with the electoral cycle. The Charter also has a symbolic value, we believe, emphasising for the UK public and stakeholders the special role and responsibilities which the BBC has as \nan independent broadcaster and trusted national institution.\n&#xa0;\n65.\n&#xa0; \nFurthermore, the model \nfits with \nan evolving communications environment, \nproviding flexibility for the BBC to develop in line with new technologies and audience tastes. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/bbc-20-years-comp.pdf\n Kantar Media for the BBC. c700 UK adults per month 2007-2010, c1000 UK adults per month thereafter\n \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2013/tony-hall-vision.html\n \n Specific proposals are subject to approval, where appropriate, by the BBC Trust under the BBC’s regulatory framework \n \nIncluding \nbroadband\n ring-fence, S4C and Local TV\n \n Equivalent to c3% of the BBC’s spend and s additional to \nBBC corporate reserves, \nany delivery through business-as-usual, and some reprioritisation of the 4% reinvestment fund.\n See for example Public and Private Broadcasters across the World – A Race to the Top (2013) for an empirical study\n Figures for 2010.
