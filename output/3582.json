"BRC19\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Richard Brooks LCGI, MIETI\n qualified as an electrician \nhaving studied\n in an FE college over 5 years attending evening classes\n as a mature student\n. This was\n supported by working in industry. \nI c\nompleted Electrical \nInstallation qualifications to\n Level 4 and hold\n a Licentiateship in Electrical Installation from the City and Guilds. Entered Further Education 15 years ago to train new electricians and have contributed to several national organisations involved in the in\ndustry. This submission represents my own \nview.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn summary \n– the current scheme allows the Part P certification \nscheme \nproviders to apply l\ness rigorous standards than those defined by the Sector Skills Council responsible for the industry\n. Having more the one scheme provider means that the level of standard required may be interpreted differently by these organisations with membership of some\n being far easier than others.  \nThis \ncan allow\n operatives who have not demonstrated sufficient competency or evidence of sufficient training to carry out electrical installation work. This can only lead to installations being installed that are inherently \nnot safe.\nEven the suggestion of an umbrella list/register that all persons registered with the various scheme providers automatically belong to will not address the issues raised by the committee. \n              \n16 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
