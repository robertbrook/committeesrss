[[[&#xa0;]]]The Deregulation Bill&#xa0;I understand that the Joint Parliamentary Committee is currently advising on the wording of the above Bill which, if certain views are taken into account, could result in the end of the current scourge of offroading in National Parks in this country.&#xa0;Being lucky to live in the Peak District National Park, I not only benefit from immediate access to beautiful landscapes, but also see at first hand, and suffer from, the constant intrusion and noise of parties of motorbikes, quadbikes and 4-wheel drive vehicles roaring through our small village to access an ancient lane which adjoins the top of the village street.  The problem became severe enough that around ten years ago we formed a group (Bradley Lane Action Group) and started to attend meetings in nearby villages which were suffering the same problems. We also went to public meetings held by the police, also attended by offroaders, Peak Park officials and Derbyshire County Council representatives. Many meetings over several years did not achieve anything for us, and seem to have died out now, probably due to cutbacks in the police budget.&#xa0;About nine years of letter writing, meetings, record keeping and reporting of incidents to the police finally resulted in a three-day Public Inquiry last autumn. Against all the odds we actually won at the Public Inquiry which would have the effect of making our lane a Restricted Byway. On advice we delayed celebrating our success as the opposition had to be allowed time to appeal. This they did, apparently successfully, and we now face another Public Inquiry.&#xa0;The amount of time and energy– not to mention money– which went into our relatively small local matter was considerable.  We know this is going on in dozens of parishes around us, and probably hundreds of areas nationwide.  We believe that if all green lanes could be re-classified as Restricted Byways, this would immediately put an end to the procession of claims going to costly and time-consuming Inquiries up and down the country.&#xa0;The main reason that I, and also many residents of this area, feel that the offroading problem must be dealt with is that these beautiful National Parks are there not only for the healthy recreation of us lucky few who live here, but also the millions who live around the boundary of our own Peak Park.  Visitors come for the visual beauty, the fresh air, and above all the peace and serenity to be found in the open spaces. What they do NOT come for is the opportunity to meet, on rounding a rocky outcrop in an isolated upland, the sight, sound and smell of a group of noisy motorbikes or a four­ wheel drive safari. Also it must be understood that down in the valleys and up the hillsides are many narrow bridleways where the motorised traffic has made use by any others –walkers or horseriders - completely impossible.The off-readers at our Inquiry claimed no-one else was using Bradley Lane anyway - and didn't accept that was because they had made it totally impossible for others to go there.&#xa0;The Peak Park and other National Parks have many miles of tarmacked side roads for motorised traffic to use it should use those roads and leave the green tracks for people on foot and horseback. My local paper this week carries two letters, from recent visitors to the Peak Park complaining of bad experiences on green lanes with off-road traffic, and saying they will not be returning unless "something is done about it".&#xa0;So, if something can be done during the making of this Deregulation Bill to end the awful cost to local councils of having to work through all the hundreds of claims by the off-roaders and the added cost of Public Inquiries which result, then this would seem like a heaven-sent opportunity to save both time, money, and most importantly the peace of our beautiful open spaces for everyone.&#xa0;Yours faithfully,&#xa0;(Evelyn Aris-Fowkes)Pilsley Resident and Secretary, Bradley Lane Action Group (BLAG)&#xa0;
