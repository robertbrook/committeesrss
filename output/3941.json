"&#xa0;\nAFS0012&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Keith Hamilton&#xa0;&#xa0;I wish to object to the application for the opening of a Sikh \nKhalsa\n Academy in \nHollybush\n Hill, Stoke \nPoges\n.\n&#xa0;\nMy \nobjections are based on the following concerns:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe logic of the Academy being located in Stoke Poges.&#xa0;1. The site is in a green belt area and the proposed alterations to the buildings and grounds would result in the erosion of the Green Belt. Additionally the site is within the Metropolitan Green Belt where there is a presumption against development, except \nfor a specified list of categories. This development does not fall within those categories. Any permitted exception to these restrictions would indicate a relaxing of these checks and must therefore increase the risk of further intrusion into the Green Bel\nt by other developments.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nT\nhe area has very poor transport provision and this development must therefore result in a large increase in traffic in order to accommodate the transportation of 850 pupils plus possibly 100 staff on a twice daily basis\n, plus \nevening and weekend activities.\n \n&#xa0;\n3. Stoke \nPoges\n is a small village numbering some 5000 residents. It is quite apparent that the vast majority of residents are totally opposed to the imposition of this school in the village.\n&#xa0;\n4. The intention, it would seem, was to apply to open the school in Slough, Be\nrkshire, and approval was given \nt\no proceed. This scheme, in my opinion, was the logical decision since the school is intended for \npupils\n \nresiding in \nBerkshire and West London \nBoroughs\n. There is no requirement for extra school places in the area of Stoke \nPoges\n, and therefore it is an illogical decision to site the school in this village where it will provide no benefits to the community \nwhatsosever\n.\n&#xa0;\n5. The decision to apply for\n the school in Stoke \nPoges\n and the subsequent decision to support that proposal seems to fly in the face of government’s efforts to control green house gases by reducing unnecessary travel by motor vehicles, when there ar\ne locations\n within\n Slough, Berkshir\ne and West London that could \naccomodate\n this school.\n&#xa0;\nConcerns regarding the flawed manner in which the Consultation was carried out&#xa0;The consultation would h\na\nve bordered on the farci\ncal if it were not for the fact that it consisted, for the most part, on \ndeceit and subterfuge.\n&#xa0;\n1. \nT\nhe school was \npromoted \neverywhere but in South Bucks. A meeting arranged for parents of both Slough and West London was not offered to South Bucks residents.\n2. The statutory 6 week public consultation started with a link \nto an \nonline form displayed on the \nKhalsa\n Secondary Academy \nFacebook\n. However, no notification was made to Stoke \nPoges\n Parish Council or any local South Bucks Residents\n.\n&#xa0;\n3. An Open Evening was held \nat Pioneer House for both local residents and prospective pare\nnts with differing consultation forms for residents and prospective parents\n&#xa0;\n4. The Sikhsangat.com website leaked possible consultation results before end date.\n&#xa0;\n5. A Public Meeting \nwas \nset up in response to a request by Mr \nKandola\n and SSET\n to have an opportunity to talk to residents and answer their questions. At the last minute both SSET and Mr. \nKandola\n declined to participate.\n&#xa0;\n6. Less than 36 hours before an SBDC Planning Committee meeting both the \nDfE\n and the proposer advised SBDC that \ntheir Planning Application would be withdrawn and they would rely on new Permitted Development rights.\n&#xa0;\n7. Mike \nAppleyard\n, Deputy Leader And Cabinet Member for Education stated that there was no requirement \nor need for a Secondary School and opposed the \nlocation of the school.\n&#xa0;\n8. Over 5000 named petitions from Stoke \nPoges\n residents opposing the school\n was \npresented to  Downing Street and \nDfE\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe question of democratic process.&#xa0;From the above factual summary I would have thought that there was \nsufficient reason to take into account the very strong protests of the majority of the residents of Stoke \nPoges\n, together with the statements of both Dominic Grieve MP and Mike \nAppleyard\n, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Education,\n that the School shou\nld not be located in Stoke \nPoges\n and as a result refuse this\n proposal.\n&#xa0;\nWe live in a country that is a world leader in advocating the pursuit of democracy. However, I am bound to say that the word appears to be open to varying interpretations depending on \nwho is advocating it. To me the word means that democracy is the legal exercise of the will of the people. In other words, where the people are consulted, a decision is made to act upon the wishes of the majority of those people. \n&#xa0;\nUnfortunately, it would appear that in the case of the Sikh \nKhalsa\n Academy application, the government is happy to pay lip service to the people by carrying out a consultation and then, regardless of the wishes of the people, carry out what they always int\nended to do. One cannot wonder whether the new Permitted Development rights are \nnothing but \na cynical\n ploy \nused by \ngovernment, its aim being the express intention of\n circumvent\ning \nthe normal rules of democracy.\n&#xa0;\nI am reminded of Chaucer’s words “One ear he\nard it, and at the other it went out”\n&#xa0;\nThe Gradual Erosion of the Green Belt&#xa0;\nFinally, recently on BBC Radio 4, it was interesting to hear that a number of respected Green\nOrganisations, which included those such as the Royal Society for the Protection of \nBirds, have accused the Government of failing to ensure the protection of Green Belt areas by permitting intrusions into protected Green Belt areas throughout the country.\n Perhaps this does not bode well for the Green Belt in Stoke \nPoges\n?\n&#xa0;\nWhat a brave New\n World we now live in!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
