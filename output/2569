defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
defaultOver recent years, educational inequality has risen up the political agenda, leading to Teach First being named as one of the most prestigious career choices for top graduates in the UK, and a number of successful initiatives including the London challenge. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNot only is this manifestly unfair, they also show that young talent is being wasted on an industrial scale. However, as research suggests, the prevalence of educational inequality is particularly apparent among white working class pupils.

default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore work to encourage white working class parents to have and support higher aspirations for their children – this included activities such as encouraging parents to read with their children and incentivising / requiring parents to attend parents’ evenings. 
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMore targeted support for children from white working class backgrounds – with incentives for schools to provide this activity
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEncouraging a greater use of social and community capital amongst children from white working class pupils. Recommendations included stimulating the economy of areas that are typically home to children from white working class backgrounds in order to ensure that there are opportunities outside of school for young people. Support for youth services was highlighted, enabling 
defaulthorizon-broadening opportunities and support for pupils outside of school/in holidays etc. Similarly, 
defaultthe suggestion was made that the national curriculum should aim to utilise more of the social and community capital that white working class pupils have in order to give students’ education a sense of context, and a sense that school can benefit them despite the fact that their parents may not have been successful at school.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFor example, within London 
defaultalmost half of London’s poorest white pupils get five good GCSEs with English and maths compared with the national average of 31% for white children on Free School Meals
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe performance of white working class children in inner-London reflects a broader advancement in the quality of schools and teaching within the capital. Over the last decade the capital’s schools have progressed from some of the country’s worst, to now being the second highest performing region – only behind outer-London.

defaultConclusiondefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have responded in this way as we recognise the diversity of educational inequality and the different experiences and views of our teachers.

defaultAppendixdefault default&#xa0;defaultTeach First is a charity with the vision that no child’s educational success is limited by their socio-economic background. It believes that the scale of change needed is so great it requires a movement of leaders to make a difference at a pupil, school and system level. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTeach First is working towards achieving its vision by enabling its participants and ambassadors in the classroom to raise the achievement, aspiration, and access to opportunity of children from low socio-economic backgrounds, whilst developing a network of leaders with a life-long commitment to ending inequality in education from both inside and outside the classroom.
default&#xa0;
defaultTeach First currently operates in Wales and nine regions across England: London, West Midlands, East Midlands, Yorkshire the Humber, North West and the North East, South East, South Coast and the South West. In 2014 we will open our operations in the East of England.
default&#xa0;
defaultTrainees commit to a minimum of two years at their partner school, where they teach an Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) timetable; and nearly three quarters choose to stay for at least a third year. Their 13 month Initial Teacher Training starts with the unique six-week Summer Institute which provides trainees with intensive preparation for teaching in their school. Trainees then complete both their PGCE training year and their first year as an NQT in their school.
default&#xa0;
defaultTeach First is raising the quality and profile of the teaching profession and has made teaching in schools in challenging circumstances one of the most prestigious options for top graduates. In 2013, Teach First was ranked 3rd in the coveted league of Times Top 100 Graduate Employers. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTeach First has built a national reputation for collaborating with schools, local authorities and business partners to help close the attainment gap. Working in eight regions across England, it knows that placing inspirational teachers in schools in challenging circumstances for a minimum of two years drives improvement in standards and results.
