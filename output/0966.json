"VEP 0001Written evidence submitted by Dr Susan Easton (VEP 0001)&#xa0;\nPlease find below my responses to the Draft Bill. I am responding as an individual with a particular research interest in this topic and relevant publications in this area\n.\n&#xa0;\nResponse to the three options in the draft Bill&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOption A disqualifying prisoner\ns \nsentenced to 4 years or more in prison from voting\n.\n&#xa0;\nOf the three options in the Bill, t\nhis is the option most likely to satisfy the Strasbourg Court. \nUsing \n4 years \nas\n the threshold\n would separate offenders \nin terms of\n the\n \nseriousness of the \ncrimes which they have committed. It would\n introduce an element of proportionality into the sanction and provide a rational distinction and one that will be clear to judges, prisoners and the general public.\n \nThe numbers enfranchised would be substantial compared to the other options and would make a genuine difference.\n \nIt is consistent with the practice in other European states which have already been seen as \nproportionate\n by the Court\n, \n(\nfor example\n 3 years in\n Italy – see \nScoppol\na v Italy\n \n App. No. 126/05 (22 May 2012)\n.\n \nIt would allow shorter term prisoners to retain an interest in the democratic process and \na stake in \nthe life of their communities of origin.\n \nAlthough I would favour extending enfranchisement \nto a much \nwider range of prisoners, I would consider option A the best of the three options in the Draft Bill.\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOption B: disqualifying prisoner\ns \nsentenced to 6 months \nor more in prison from voting\n.\n&#xa0;\nOption B has less merit. Although it is clearly an improvement on the present position\n,\n it would bring relatively few prison\ner\ns into the electoral process \nand is less likely to satisfy the\n Strasbourg\n Court\n than the first option\n.\n \nOther European states which have permitted voting have\n substantially\n exceeded this figure. It is also \na \nfairly arbit\nrary point \nand hard to justify 6 months rather than\n,\n say\n,\n one \nyear\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n \nDisqualifying all prison\ners serving custodial sentences\n from voting – a restatement of the current ban\n.\n&#xa0;\nThis is the least desirable option. It would certainly not be compatible with Art\nicle\n 3 of Protocol 1 of the \nEuropean\n Convention\n or comply with the Court’s ruling in \nHirst\n \nand is difficult to defend \nfrom a legal standpoint.\n \nAn\n argument in favour here is\n \nthe\n \n political/popu\nlist one that public opinion is mostly \nhostile to change\n and clearly within democratic context the public’s view is important\n. But \nthe Strasbourg \nC\nourt has made clear \nin \nHirst v UK (No.2)\n App No. 74025/01,\n (\n6 October 2005\n)\n \n \nthat public opinion may be one factor to consider but should not be\n the\n over\nri\nding factor \nwhen f\nundamental rights are infringed.\n \n&#xa0;\nAdditional questions&#xa0;1 What are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?&#xa0;\nIt is an a\nppropriate and additional punishment\n.\n&#xa0;\nPrisoners do\n not deserve\n the right to vote as they have breached the social contract.\n&#xa0;\nIt encourages \ncivic responsibility\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt preserves the purity of the ballot box\n.\n&#xa0;\nEach argument is \nproblematic\n: it is difficult to justify losing the vote as an additional punishment and even if this were accepted, it would not comply with the accepted \njustifications \nof punishment (see\n Q.\n3\n below\n)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe argument based on desert is problematic as\n the individual has already been punished by the loss of liberty and no additional punishments should be imposed.\n \nThe punishment for breaching the social contract is imprisonment so this should be sufficient. Moreover\n,\n fundamental human rights are universal and apply to all r\negardless of their moral status or deser\nt.\n&#xa0;\nIt is difficult to argue that civic responsibility is promoted through this denial as the prison\ner\n is excluded from the democratic process and treated as a second class citizen\n and the gap between offenders and the law-abiding majority is reinforced\n.\n&#xa0;\nIncluding prisoners would not undermine the integrity of the electoral process if appr\nopriate procedures are in place \n- see \nQ.8 below.\n&#xa0;\n2. Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?&#xa0;\nIt is one\n \nof the most fundamental rights enshrined in all major \ninternational Human Rights\n C\nonventio\nn\ns,\n for example,\n Article 25\n of the\n \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 21 \nof the \nUN Declaration of Human Rights and of course Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights.\n \nIt allows and empowers individuals to participate in the democratic process, to influe\nnce governments and to protect \nother key rights.\n \nLoss of the right to vote is the key \nsymbol of civic or social death and it is hard to justify\n the \nexclusion of specific groups in a modern democratic society.\n&#xa0;\n3. Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?&#xa0;\nNo.\n \nDisqualifying prisoners from voting should not be part of their punishment, unless the \nprisoner has committed electoral offences which violate the democratic process e.g. postal voting fraud or misfeasance in a public office. Here the punishment is linked to the crime and could have a rational basis\n for \na temporary ban\n. T\nhe Strasbourg Court has accepted\n this\n as a legitimate g\nround for a temporary ban in \nMDU v Italy\n App. No. 58400/00 (23 January 2003).\n&#xa0;\nBut \notherwise i\nt is \ndifficult to justify an additional punishment as the prison sentence is \nthe\n punishment. \nDisenfranchisement\n bears no relati\non to the ty\npe of crime or gravity of the crime.\n It is \ndisproportionate and it can be seen a\ns a\n degrading punishment reducing\n the \noffender to a state of civil death. \nIt is\n also an\n arbitrary punishment as it depends on the timing of the elections.\n It \nis\n \nunlikely to deter offenders or the general public from committing crimes.\n \nIt does not contribute to the rehabilitation of\n p\nrisoners. On the contrary\n,\n it reinforces their social exclusion. Conversely\n,\n allowing prisoners t\no\n vote might encourage prisoners to reflect on their civic obligations and ultimately have positive implications in reducing re\n-\noffending\n and \nr\neinforcing \ntheir sense of having a stake in their \ncommunity on release.\n Research by Uggen and Manza in the United States found differences between voters and non-voters in their rates of subsequent arrest, incarc\ner\nation and self reported criminal behaviour.\n \nIt is also not \nnecessary for public protection. There is no risk to the public in granting the vote\n \nto \nprisoners\n regardless of sentence length\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4. What are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?&#xa0;\nIn \nGreens\n and MT\n \nv UK \nApp.Nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08 (23 November 2010)\n \nthe \nStrasbourg \nCourt\n made clear\n that\n \na declaration of incompatibilit\ny \ncons\ntituted\n just satisfaction, and \ngiven that \nthe UK was in the\n \nprocess\n of conside\nring change, would not grant co\nmpensation\n at that time\n. \nThe court noted that there were ar\nound 2,500 applications pending\n. It said that it would \nnot award cost\ns\n or \nexamine applications registered prior to \nGreens\n raising similar complaints and that it would strike out these cases if compliance is achieved. However\n,\n it noted it could restore these applications if the UK does not c\nhan\nge the law to comply with \nHirst\n. \nA similar approach was taken by the domestic courts in \nTovey et al v Ministry of Justice\n [2011] EWHC 271 (QB). \n&#xa0;\nSo it is \nlikely \nthat if a blanket\n ban is retained\n,\n the \ncourts will make orders for com\npensation\n. There is \na backlog of 2\n,\n500 to 3000 cases\n in Strasbourg. In \nFirth and 2,353 Others v UK\n App Nos. 47784/09\n(\n26 March 2013\n)\n the \nhearing of these applications was adjourned by the Court until the end of September 2013.\n \nE\nstimates have been made of subs\ntantial costs.\n \nThe number of prisoners disenfranchised at the last election \nwas\n cl\nearly well in excess of \n3000 and if further applications are m\nade the consequences called be \nsubstantial.\n \nIn addition\n,\n the Strasbourg Court could \ninitiate infringement proceedings against the UK which could\n then result\n in\n further financial \npenalties\n.\n&#xa0;\nObviously this raises issues regarding whether or not the UK should remain a party to the Convention\n as well as constitutional issues over Parliamentary sovereignty\n which are being debated in the country\n and not yet resolved. However, \ni\nnsofar as the UK \ncurrently\n \nis\n a \nparty to the Convention then it may incur financial sanctions. But more importantly \nfailure to comply \nundermines its \nlegitimacy, p\narticular\nly\n when the UK government is (rightly) criticising other \nstates for abusing human rights and violating the rule of law.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIt is difficult to find an appropriate and coherent threshold to exclude some prisoners from re-enfranchisement but from a legal standpoint,\n sentence length is \na possible criterion. Sentence length does\n provide a rudimentary measure \nwith which to distinguish offenders and offending when considering entitlement to vote\n. \nThe courts \nwill take account of the harm caused and\n the culpability of the offender in determining the seriousness of the offending\n and\n any mitigating and aggravating factors\n.\n \nSentence length is used as\n a\n basis for prisoner enfranchisement in \nseveral states including Italy \n(see \nScoppola\n).\n \nThe four-year proposal \nwould\n \ninclude\n those \ngiven longer \nsentence\ns\n \nfor those \noffences which most concern the public.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nkeeping the law as it is?&#xa0;\nThis will no doubt lead to further legal challenges within the domestic \ncourts and the European Court of Human Rights\n.\n \nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe is scrutinising carefully the response and is unlikely to entertain any further \ndelays\n beyond this autumn. \nIn effect this will be seen as \na refusal to comply with international human rights law and standards.\n \nIt is accepted practice that the UK will and does comply with its international\n obligations. Keeping the law \nas it is with an i\nndiscriminate blanket ban would\n \nbreach the obligations and lead to infringement proceedings. \n&#xa0;\nb)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \npassing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?&#xa0;\nThe question \nhere is \nthe number of prisoners who would benefit. If \n6 months were used very few\n prisoners \nwould benefit and this may not pass\n a C\nonvention challenge.\n \nA\n r\nestriction\n based\n on 4 years\n is less likely to fa\ni\nl. \n&#xa0;\nc)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nseeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?&#xa0;\nThis would be sufficient to ‘head off’ legal challenges domestically and internationally.\n \nThe 4 year option is most likely to achieve this.\n \nThe discussion of the d\nraft bill and the parlia\nmentar\ny process of scrutinising\n and discussing proposed leg\nislation will also be important in showing that the UK has considered the matter in some detail.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNo. There are existing procedures in place for remand prisoners and th\ne\nse seem to work satisfactor\nil\ny and given the \nfrequency\n of elect\nions would not incur onerous bur\ndens.\n The current procedures used are \nset out\n in Prison \nService Order 4650 \nPrisoners’ Voting Rights.\n The Electoral Commission reviewed\n the\n proposals \nin the earlier Consultation Paper\n in 2009 \nand was \nsati\nsfied that th\ne proposed procedures were manageable and\n that \nthe integrity of the electoral process\n would be \npreserved\n.\n I would recommend postal votes to increase the level of control.\n \nProcedures need to be clear for all concerned.\n P\nostal voting is \nmore tightly controlled now and\n if properl\ny\n monitored allows a reduced risk of fraud. It is relatively easy to administer and there is an established \ns\nystem in place\n already for remand priso\nn\ners.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNo\n. If\n prisoners use their\n normal place\n residence\n outside the prison\n \nby making a decl\na\nration of local connection,\n the\nre is no danger of bloc voting \nand \nthe impact of \ntheir vote\ns\n will be diffuse\nd \nacross the UK.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe \nconcern that prisoner\n enfranchisement\n will undermine the purity of the ballot \nbox has been raised\n. The fear is that \nprisoners \nmay elect\n candidates who \nrepresent \ntheir\n interests rather than the community as a whole, \nbut\n \nthis would not be \na\nn issue in the model proposed for th\ne UK of allowing voting in the\n community of origin\n where they would normally reside\n.\n \nAllowing prisoners to regist\ner using the prison \naddress\n would \nbe \nun\ndesirable. \nThe example often give\nn is the Isle of \nWight where there is\n currently\n a relatively large number of prisoners within\n \na small constituency and w\nhere \nthe\nre\n may be a narrow margin between candidates. If \nprisoners \nare registered in the communities with which they have a local connection then it makes sense for them to express their view on who sho\nu\nld represent them as they\n may \nbe living \nt\nhere when released.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The available evidence sugge\nsts that \nit is not problematic. In other states it is accepted by the public and seem\ns\n to work\n satisfactory. The over\nall trend worldwide is towards re\n-\nenfranchisemen\nt\n. The issue has been considered by the Ca\nn\nadian Supreme Court, the High\n C\nourt of Australia, the South African Constitutional Court and numerous other \njurisdictions \nand these courts have failed to find a rational foundation for a blanket ban.\n The Republic of Ireland\n \nalso changed the law in response to \nHirst \nwith no apparent ill effects and \nthe change \nwas in force \nfor 2007 election\n.\n \nA clear cut \npr\nocedure is essential.\n \n In the U\nnited States there have been problems of under-registration of eligible voters\n because of the complexity surrounding entitlemen\nt and registration procedures. \nIt is \nalso \nbetter to avoid a discretionary system or the involvement of the judiciary as it will add to the burden on the courts\n.\n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n See S.
