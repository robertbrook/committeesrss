default Parish Council (TIC 27)
default&#xa0;defaultHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?default 
default&#xa0;
defaultBlanchland
default is a small rural parish with 124 adults on the electoral roll.
defaultPublic transport is allocated according to demand and cost per person per trip.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older pedefaultople, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?default&#xa0;
default An ADAPT bus comes to the village once per week to take elderly people with wheelchairs or walking aids to our market town for a short stay.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have a bus which services the village twice per day Monday to Friday but not at convenient times for younger people to travel to work or attend regular leisure opportunities.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and modefaultre consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?default&#xa0;
defaultPublic transport cannot operate without passengers and in rural communities young adults learn to drive as quickly as possible, gain their own transport o
defaultr move away.
default&#xa0;
defaultElderly people who no longer can drive or afford to run a car wish to move to where transport is more readily available. Rural transport tends not to fit in with Doctors, Dental and Hospital appointments! The majority of eldery people with 
defaultBus passes would be quite happy to pay towards the journey if this meant having a convenient bus service.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improvdefaulted?default&#xa0;
defaultTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?default&#xa0;
defaultAs above, 
defaultElderly people who no longer can drive or afford to run a car wish to move to where transport is m
defaultore readily available. Rural transport tends not to fit in with Doctors, Dental and Hospital appointments! These people should not have to rely on Taxis.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs regard to demand services if a resident books this in our village, a resident two miles away on 
defaultthe same route at the same time is refused even though seats are available as this would extend the journey time and it may not be able to keep to its next scheduled pick up time.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport defaultservices in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?defaultThe cost of running buses for the low number of passengers. Having transport at convenient times to fit the needs of the community.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe majority of elderly
default people with Bus 
defaultpasses would be quite happy to pay towards the journey if this meant having a convenient bus service.
