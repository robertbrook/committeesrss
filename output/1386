[normal]&#xa0;[bold]How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Blanchland
[normal] is a small rural parish with 124 adults on the electoral roll.
[normal]Public transport is allocated according to demand and cost per person per trip.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older pe[bold]ople, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal] An ADAPT bus comes to the village once per week to take elderly people with wheelchairs or walking aids to our market town for a short stay.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have a bus which services the village twice per day Monday to Friday but not at convenient times for younger people to travel to work or attend regular leisure opportunities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the main challenges associated with providing better and mo[bold]re consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Public transport cannot operate without passengers and in rural communities young adults learn to drive as quickly as possible, gain their own transport o
[normal]r move away.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Elderly people who no longer can drive or afford to run a car wish to move to where transport is more readily available. Rural transport tends not to fit in with Doctors, Dental and Hospital appointments! The majority of eldery people with 
[normal]Bus passes would be quite happy to pay towards the journey if this meant having a convenient bus service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improv[bold]ed?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As above, 
[normal]Elderly people who no longer can drive or afford to run a car wish to move to where transport is m
[normal]ore readily available. Rural transport tends not to fit in with Doctors, Dental and Hospital appointments! These people should not have to rely on Taxis.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As regard to demand services if a resident books this in our village, a resident two miles away on 
[normal]the same route at the same time is refused even though seats are available as this would extend the journey time and it may not be able to keep to its next scheduled pick up time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport [bold]services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable?[bold]The cost of running buses for the low number of passengers. Having transport at convenient times to fit the needs of the community.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The majority of elderly
[normal] people with Bus 
[normal]passes would be quite happy to pay towards the journey if this meant having a convenient bus service.
