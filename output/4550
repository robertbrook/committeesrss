defaultWritten evidence submitted by Arts Council England [FBB0094]default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultArts Council England’s mission is 'great art for everyone'. We work to achieve this by investing in arts and cultural experiences that enrich people's lives, enabling new artistic developments, realising talent, and championing culture in public policy. 
defaultBe
defaulttween 2010 and 2
default015, we are investing around £1.9 billion of public money from government and an estimated £1.1 billion from the National Lottery to help create these experiences for as many people as possible across the country. 
defaultThis investment supports a
defaultn arts and culture industry 
defaultwith a gross value added of £5.9 billion to the economy in 2011 alone.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultAs the national development agency for the arts, museums and libraries in England, we support a range of activities from theatre to music, reading to da
defaultnce, photography to digital art, carnival to crafts. We support and invest in high quality arts practice and the best emerging practitioners whom we believe are essential for underpinning a dynamic creative economy.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultThe Arts Council’s Creative Media p
defaultolicy, published in 2012, aims to increase the volume, range and quality of digital cultural content for the public. Between 2014 and 2018 we will be investing £25m in new strategic digital interventions. These will attract expertise and resource from the 
defaultwider technology and creative media industries to improve the digital capacity of the sector, and develop new models for the future digital production, distribution and promotion of art and culture. It will build on existing investment in publicly funded c
defaultontent, making it available to more people in different ways. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultAs the two largest promoters and funders of cultural activity in the country, creating publicly funded content and acting as venture capital for creativity and cultural excellence is a sha
defaultred aim for the BBC and the Arts Council. We share a strong commitment to public engagement in arts and culture, developing and supporting the best creative talent and contributing to the performance of the UK’s creative economy. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have provided respo
defaultnses to questions where it is appropriate and useful for the Arts Council to do so, grouping these into three sections reflecting on the current purpose, future role and governance of the BBC.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe purpose of the BBC and its contribution to culturedefault&#xa0;
default              
defaultWhadefaultt should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public default              defaultservice broadcasting?default&#xa0;default              defaultHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in default              defaultachieving its mission and public purposes?default&#xa0;default              defaultAre the public purposes in the current Charter the rightdefault ones? How default              defaultmight they change?default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultWe fully support the continuing and enduring role and public purposes of the BBC. The BBC is the cornerstone of public service broadcasting and media, going further than other broadcasters and complementing what others provide.  This is partly as a result 
defaultof its unique funding model, which provides a critical mass of investment that should allow proper risk taking.   As an invaluable cultural asset to the UK, it is an internationally recognised example of what British creativity and commitment can achieve. 
default Like the organisations and individuals that the Arts Council funds, the BBC can take risks that the commercial market cannot. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe original purposes of the BBC
default were to ‘
defaultinform
default, educate, entertain’
default. Lord Reith also spoke about ‘
defaultg
defaultiving the public somet
defaulthing slightly better than it thinks it wants’.  This aspiration is valid today and differentiates the BBC as a Public Service Broadcaster – and it also gives it something in common with the Arts Council. Our aim is not to provide the humdrum or the mainstr
defaulteam, but to create the conditions to allow the best, most innovative, 
defaultchallenging and surprising
default art to be made and to make it available to the most people. This aspiration is summed up as ‘Great 
defaulta
defaultrt for 
defaulte
defaultveryone’.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultTraditionally we have funded live ex
defaultperiences that people enjoy by attendance or live participation. But new means of receiving and experiencing arts and culture open up new possibilities.  That is why the mission of the Arts Council will require us to be partners in the future with organisa
defaulttions who have common interests and who can help us expand our reach.  The BBC is one such partner, and with whom we share many interests. Technology and its uses, as well as common aims, will draw us together as traditional ways of broadcasting become dis
defaultrupted and open up new possibilities. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultThe
default Arts Council are developing new ways to express why public support for culture matters
default:  a holistic case
default, which considers not just culture’s intrinsic worth, but also it’s crucial role in other fields. For example, in 
defaultbringing imagination and self-expression to the primary school and the lecture hall
default, arts and culture are essential at all levels of education
default. 
default I
defaultf we get the cultural product right, other benefits flow to the wider creative economy, society and education system.  
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultThere might be a useful analogy here for the BBC. The quality, creativity and integrity of what they 
defaultdo
default,
default and
default how they do it
default,
default s
defaulthould underpin everything.  If they do, it well they will b
defaultenefit society more generally. 
default 
defaultF
defaultrom the national moments that bring us together and
default speak volumes as to who we are,
default to their work locally – providing important social glue and connections with how
default people live.  Their educational role has grown explicitly over the years, and their role as part of the overall creative industry ecology needs to be better described and articulated. Articulating a ‘holistic case’ for the current and future role of the B
defaultBC could provide a rather broader definition of Public Service Broadcasting
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultWithin Public Service Broadcasting, the BBC is the most significant player in supporting cultural excellence and access. Channel 4 and ITV, are real contributors too with Sky
default making an important contribution through its increasing commitment to original drama and arts output.
default&#xa0;
default2.7
default              
defaultThe BBC’s contribution to music in particular has been and continues to be extraordinary and of vital importance to UK music industry and sector.  I
defaultt is a major investor in the arts with six professional performing groups totalling over £28 million every year and employing around 450 full time musicians in its five orchestras – three England based (BBC Concert Orchestra, BBC Philharmonic, and BBC Symp
defaulthony Orchestra) and the BBC Singers. Radio 3 continues to make an invaluable contribution to classical music and drama, driving excellence and access to the best.  It is important that the resources are there for this to continue. 
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default              
defaultAcross platforms, t
defaulthe BBC is a leading commissioner of new music, providing a range and diversity of music genres, and introducing new talent and music through initiatives such as 
defaultBBC Introducing
default to bring new unsigned music acts to radio, television and online.  
defaultThe 
defaultBBC Radi
defaulto 2 
defaultFolk Awards
default and 
defaultYoung Folk Awards
default provide platforms for a genre that is under-exposed and neglected by 
defaultother broadcasters
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultther
default notable
default initiatives include Radio 2’s 
defaultYoung Chorister of the Year / Young Brass Player of the Year
default and
default Radio 3
default’s
default 
defaultNew Genera
defaulttion Artists
default 
defaults
defaultcheme.
default&#xa0;
default2.9
default              
defaultThe BBC also invests substantially and develops new UK writing, directing, producing and acting talent alongside other arts organisations, broadcasters and independent production companies. The BBC is a primary commissioner of new
default writers for television and radio with sustained investment in BBC Radio 3 and 4’s original radio drama, readings and poetry, supported by the work of the Writers’ Room.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default              
defaultThe BBC has also embarked on a number of important strategic partnerships over t
defaulthe past charter period that have led to excellent and innovative cultural and educational programming to encourage wider public learning and engagement. 
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default              
defaultAn example is the BBC’s successful partnership with the British Museum and the two radio co-prod
defaultuction series for Radio 4 with Neil Macgregor and the British Museum: 
defaultA History of the World in 100 Objects
default and 
defaultShakespeare’s Restless World
default. This was an important moment of cultural reflection
default.
default 
defaultIn an intelligent way, this explored not just
default how we see ours
defaultelves revealed through historical artefacts,
default but also how the world sees us,
default with the series heard throughout the world. The effect on the non-broadcast world was to boost yet further the extraordinary visitor numbers to the British Museum and bringing its
default world class curatorship to BBC audiences. 
default&#xa0;
default2.12
default              
defaultThe Arts Council’s Public Value Partnership with the BBC (2009-12) has also led
default to many successful initiatives.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe seven year-long 
defaultRoots
default project buil
defaultt

defaultersity in arts and broadcasting,
default leading to new careers and opportunities for artists and new
default producers from BME communities.
default 
defaultMade in England
default in 2008/9 showcase
defaultd
default artists on loca
defaultl radio and regional television.
default 
defaultI
defaultn 2012,
default we launched
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Space
default, an innovation that has been widely praised by 
defaultDCMS, the public and commentators.  
default              
default2.
default13
default              
defaultThe Space is a joint venture between the Arts Council and BBC and represented a widening of the BBC’s engagement 
defaultwith
default arts and cultural organisations that were beginning to produce digital content. It operated in
default ‘beta’ form during the Cultural Olympiad in 2012 and will be re-launched in 2014 as a fuller and properly promoted service. Arts Council investment supported artists to 
defaultcreate their own content and the BBC supported mentoring and production training for p
defaultarticipating organisations, providing the technology platform and live service support – a model of partnership
default working.
default&#xa0;
default2.14
default              
defaultHowever, despite the BBC’s considerable contribution to culture in the ways described above, there may be greater possibilities in the future for the BBC to promote and work with the wider arts and cultural sector.  It remains true that currently only a fr
defaultaction of the publicly funded arts in England have featured or feature on BBC platforms. The BBC has often operated in parallel to the wider cultural and educational sector, and the emerging wave of cultural providers beginning to narrowcast and distribute
default their work digitally. In the past, opportunities to extend and increase the wider public value of this content, helped it reach larger audiences and to reflect our dynamic world class contemporary culture to UK citizens and to the world have been missed. 
default&#xa0;
default2.15
default              
defaultWe believe that with the appointment of Tony Hall as Director General and his new senior management team, this situation is set to gr
defaulteatly improve. 
defaultRecent speeches
default suggest both
default 
defaulta more central role for arts in mainstream
default commissioning and a new emph
defaultasis on the BBC’s enabling role and commitment to forging deeper and wider partnerships with the cultural sector. Together with the
default 20% increase in arts programming
default announced recently, these represent very positive developments.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.16
default              
defaultA new era of collab
defaultoration
default and innovation is possible
default, despite the financial and economic challenges we face. If this is combined with the already considerable investment the BBC makes in developing new writing and new music, as well as original drama, this will be a net gai
defaultn for the cultural power of the United Kingdom, with beneficial effects for the wider economy.
default&#xa0;
default2.17
default              
defaultThe
default BBC’s current principles and purposes are robust and do not need to fundamentally change.  The BBC plays a vital role in the cultural life of the count
defaultry. But we believe the way in which the BBC performs its role and delivers its mission and public purposes is changing in the face of new technology. The Corporation will have to find new ways of working in partnership during the next 
defaultC
defaultharter period 
defaultin ord
defaulter to continue to benefit from the privilege of the licence fee and to ensure maximum public value.

defaultThe future of the BBC and the importance of partnerships default&#xa0;default              defaultWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?default&#xa0;default              defaultWhat role should the BBC play in developingdefault technology and new default              defaultways of distributing content?default&#xa0;default              defaultIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content more default              defaultwidely beyond the BBC?default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultDigital technologies are transforming our society, economy and culture.  In the past, spectrum as the
default means of linear distribution was scarce, and making content was inherently expensive.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultNow many more people can create and share their own content, including   ar
defaulttists and arts organisations. This has been demonstrated by the National Theatre
default Royal Opera House and British Museum winning large audiences of their own in cinemas
default both
default here and around the world. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultFor the BBC, the digital era offers new opportunities to refresh its mission to inform, to educate and to entertain. As Tony Hall ha
defaults said: “The key challenge - the core of what we have to do - is to harness our power to create - our power to innovate”
default.  But it is also an opportunity to amplify, to connect and to support a far wider network of content providers, distributors and audie
defaultnces. With public expenditure rightly under more scrutiny than ever before, it is vital that the BBC works in partnership with a wider variety of organisations and individuals to fulfil its public service obligations. 
defaultWe are entering a different era and thdefaulte BBC’s role is now to engage with it and enable it.default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultIn a pressured public funding environment, the BBC should maintain its strong leadership role and scale of investment in key areas of its cultural and educational remit, and in ensuring its continui
defaultng commitment to the breadth of cultural services across its broadcast and digital channels.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultBut we believe that the next big shift is that, in return for the stability of the licence fee and the ability it gives the BBC to invest in depth and scale, 
defaultit should be able to point to partnerships it has forged where, most often, the result is a whole that adds up to more than the sum of the parts. This will enable the licence fee to be much more dynamic, providing a greater return than if it had simply bee
defaultn spent exclusively within the BBC
default,
default and works with investment from other sources. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultIn 2014, the BBC and Arts Council will sign a new three year 
defaultp
defaultartnership agreement. Through this partnership we aim to provide a stronger and more effective interface between the BBC, the Arts Council and arts and cultural organisations and artists throughout England to increase the value, reach and impact of public 
defaultinvestment in arts, culture and the BBC, to identify new talent and new work, to support training and talent and progression routes in regional centres such as Bristol, Birmingham and Salford and to use digital technologies to better connect publicly funde
defaultd arts content with audiences through BBC services and platforms, including the development of The Space. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultThe BBC should extend its scope and remit to ensure that it involves partners in the public space in the delivery of its mission and its cultura
defaultl, educational and creative purpose. To this end more should be done to encourage the BBC to work with a greater number and variety of partner
defaults – as exemplified by The Space. The BBC should
default not only to commission content
default from other public providers
default but act
defaultively host and promote
default. 
defaultThis is an important manifestation of the future BBC’s technology and innovation remit – leading on establishing technical standards, developing and backing open platforms and standards, and facilitating the greater reach of other p
defaultublic service content providers from the arts.
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultThe BBC also has an important role, alongside the Arts Council, in helping to build the digital and media capacity of the arts sector, sharing its skills, training and expertise in a more formal and struc
defaulttured way, such as the recent BBC Academy /Arts Council Building Digital Capacity in the Arts Programme. Initiatives such as this can in the mid to long term help to nurture a new ‘independent’ sector from the UK arts and cultural sectors as digital media 
defaultand broadcast producers, co-commissioners with and suppliers for the BBC. We are starting to see this movement take shape, in which more equitable partnership working benefits both the BBC and arts organization such as the recent successful collaboration b
defaultetween the BBC and National Theatre at 50 celebrations, live events and documentaries.  
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultWe believe that the BBC should also support the greater ‘discoverability’ of arts content using its unique reach, marketing and cross-promotion
defaultal power.
default 
defaultThis shou
defaultld both link
default to other public service content 
defaultand
default promote content that reflects high quality and distinctive public service characteristics. New models of acquisition and publishing in partnership with the cultural sector should be explored
default,
default a
defaults should digit
defaultal rights issues. 
defaultThe BBC’s editorial policies have in the past sometimes impeded partnership working and encouraged less equal relationships.  Greater compromise and collaboration has to happen in this space. 
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultWe believe that the BBC could engage in
default more joint editorial relationships without compromising independence and quality, and create shared spaces within existing BBC online platforms and channels to help to bring the arts to wider public attention. Even the largest arts organisations cannot ho
defaultpe to achieve this exposure on their own. The potential to link up individual artists and arts organisations with the BBC’s multiple platforms is huge, driving place-based and digital engagement, and thought should be given as to how this can be better ena
defaultbled. 
default&#xa0;
default3.11
default              
defaultWe also believe that a future BBC Charter could re-define its remit and fundamentally increase its partnership potential by extending to other public bodies and cultural organisations the special privileges it currently grants solely to the Op
defaulten University.  This could provide a useful model for future-proofing new cultural partnerships. The OU is exempted from the charge of sponsorship by being specifically named in the agreement which accompanies the Charter and Licence paragraph 75 (5) (b)
default.
default  It works with the BBC in a number of ways that could also benefit other organisations with clear public accountability structures and content that fits editorially within BBC guidelines
default.  Such an update and amendment to the BBC’s Charter and Licence cou
defaultld enable a far more ‘networked’ content ecology and address many of the current partnership barriers which 
defaultprevent equitable collaboration. 
defaultThis would be an alternative to distributing the licence fee to other players 
default&#xa0;
default3.12
default              
defaultIn fact, the way in which the 
defaultBBC is beginning to engage with the wider arts today provides an exemplar for a future, more collaborative way of operating. We are encouraged that the Corporation is moving in the right direction on this, especially its senior leadership level, and we hop
defaulte this positive approach will become imbued in the BBC’s modus operandi. 
default&#xa0;
default3.13
default              
defaultT
defaulthe most important shift the BBC must make if it is to remain the sole recipient of the licence fee 
defaultwould be
default to share it much more widely and better partner with the wider publ
defaultic service content ecology.  It should fully embrace the spirit of partnership with those other players – arts and cultural organisations amongst others – who contribute so much to the UK’s public service ethos and to growing the creative economy.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultGovedefaultrnance  default&#xa0;default              defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable default              defaultbeyond 2016?default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultMany views have been expressed in recent months regarding the desirability of various alternative forms of governance that the BBC should adopt. 
defaultWhatever the 
defaultoutcome, the
default paramount
default concern should be finding a solution
default 
defaultwhich
default 
defaultbest
default represents the interests of the licence
default-
defaultfee payer.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultThe core financial model and constitution of the BBC allows it to be funded without political interference and stresses the prima
defaultcy of independent operation and commissioning. This has proven to be a hugely valuable and successful model, and any diminution would be undesirable. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultThe BBC must be accountable to licence-fee payers, as the Arts Council should be to tax-payers – but
default the arms-length principle is vitally important, as is the ability to set its own budget. It is this which allows proper independence for decisions to be taken free from political pressure, real or perceived.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default4
default              
defaultWhile the BBC should be alive to the context in which it operates, decisions on operations and commissioning should be made independently. There has 
defaulthistorically been a broad consensus that this is beyond question, and it should remain so. Such independenc
defaulte constitutes a fundamental tenet of the values underpinning public service broadcasting, and is especially important in the fields of arts and culture.  In making the case for the continuation of the licence fee, the BBC should be bold and clear about the
default role of a Public Service Broadcaster in the 21st century, and restate and reanimate the Reithian ideals on which it is founded.
