[normal].
[normal]Q386 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Good afternoon.  You are all welcome to this
[normal] sixth evidence session on local government procurement
[normal].  
[normal]For our records, could you say who you are and the organisations you represent?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]:[bold] My n
[normal]ame is Mark 
[normal]Wardman
[normal].  I am a Senior M
[normal]anager in the information and analysis group at the Audit Commission.
[normal]Alan Bryce:[bold] I am Alan Bryce, Head of Counter-F
[normal]raud for the Audit Commission.
[normal]Keith Davis:[bold] I am Keith Davis, Director of Cabinet Office and Cross-Government S
[normal]tudies at the National Audit Office.
[normal]Q387 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] 
[normal]Thank you very much for coming to give evidence
[normal].  
[normal]In taki
[normal]ng evidence, we have talked to quite a few local authorities.  I suppose the feeling always is that the ones who come to give evidence and speak to you are those who are doing things best, and that is why they want to tell you about it.  How do we get a real feel about whether local authorities in general are using best practice in the area of
[normal] procurement
[normal]?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: There is a slight problem for the Audit Commission now in answering a question like that, because we no longer have the route into understanding auditor assessments and judgments that perhaps we did in the past.  I have come along today in part because I have done some work recently with the Local Government Association, which 
[normal]looked at contract management in councils, and from that I have picked up some evidence of their procurement practice, too.  
[normal]Q388 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] But don’t they talk to the people who are doing things best as well?  They also talk to the authorities who are doing things best.
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: The Local Government Association?
[normal]Chair:[bold] Yes.
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: In the case of that particular piece of work, we were talking to councils that we felt had shown good practice in that area, that is true, but the councils were keen to explain how they had gone on a journey, overcome some of the barriers to poor procurement and contract management and improved.
[normal]Q389 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] If the Audit Commission has not got the ability now, has the National Audit Office taken over so it can give us all the information?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: I fear that my answer may slightly frustrate the Committee’s question on this one as well.  I am here as one of the authors of the recent National Audit Office work on central Government contracting.  There are a lot of lessons and principles we can draw out from our experience of looking at that which are equally relevant to local government.  
[normal]On your specific question, one of the keys perhaps is transparency.  It was certainly a big theme of the work we did on central Government that we need a much better understanding of who is spending what, what revenue a contractor is getting, what level of profit a contractor is getting and what level of performance is being delivered on individual contracts.  That might be one of the keys to getting a better understanding of what is happening in the local government landscape.
[normal]Q390 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] But as soon as we got anywhere near those sorts of issues the contractors say it is a matter of commercial confidentiality and they cannot release the information because their competitors will have an immediate advantage in seeing what they are doing.  Can you have commercial confidentiality but somehow get a release of useful information in these matters?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: You can.  That was not our recent experience.  One of the reports we published a couple of weeks ago was based on the portfolio of work that Serco, Capita, G4S and 
[normal]Atos
[normal] do across the public sector.  We engaged with them and asked them for information on revenue broken down by different public sector clients.  We asked them for information on their profit, and whether they have open book accounting.  We even cheekily 
[normal]asked 
[normal]whether they paid 
[normal]UK
[normal] tax.  In all cases, we got pretty comprehensive answers.
[normal]Q391 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Answers to you.
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: Yes, and we were able to put the answers and data they gave us into our published report.  It is all in here.  Contractors might often be willing to go a lot further with this than we sometimes think.
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: It is clear that councils have been on a journey on procurement over the last 10 to 15 years.  There has been a huge effort to improve guidance for councils on procurement, and a growth in shared services and contracting out.  It would be surprising if councils were not improving in this area in that context, but they vary enormously.  They 
[normal]have been procuring goods and services for a very long time—as long as they have been in existence—and the fact they have such a wide variety of contracts within each council means there will be variable practice across the piece.  My sense is that it is probably improving, but some will be much better at it than others.
[normal]Q392 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] As a general comment, all local authorities are under enormous pressure to be as efficient as possible and try to make savings on their procurement.  
[normal]On the other hand
[normal], the issue of social value is probably coming to the fore in a way it was not 10 years ago.  How do local authorities deal with the potential conflict between getting prices down but also adding social value to contracts at the same time?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: You are alluding to a tension in council procurement, and that existed before the financial crisis and the recent austerity programme to reduce their income.  Councils have always had to balance aggregating their demand to get the lowest possible price through economies of scale and fostering a healthy local economy through their procurement.  
[normal]From the latest research with the Local Government Association on contract management, I am picking up the fact that, of the various social value areas in which councils are interested, they are particularly interested in economic regeneration—perhaps prioritising that over environmental regeneration.  For example, through their procurement and contract management they are looking for suppliers who provide apprenticeships for local people, and using local firms in their supply chain, perhaps bringing other things from contractors where they have had difficulty.  I think 
[normal]Birmingham
[normal] persuaded the directors of some companies to act as school governors, for example.  They are tying in some of the social value they want in their area to economic regeneration in particular in their contracts.
[normal]Q393 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]James Morris:[bold] Both the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office have pointed to the value of collaboration between local authorities.  How effective do you think local government is being in collaborating on procurement?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: We did some joint work with the Audit Commission back in 2010 where we made general comments about the scope to go further with collaboration.  For our part, we have not looked at local authorities in any way since.  It is not part of our remit.  
[normal]The one thing we have looked at quite recently is police procurement, and certainly we argued there that there were pretty significant missed opportunities around collaboration.  Police forces were taking a too localised approach.  About half of them still had their own dedicated procurement teams; there were lots of barriers to collaboration around police forces wanting their own particular specification for a uniform or boot and that was getting in the way.  If you could move to a place where there is a standard specification for uniforms, to use that example, they would be much more effective in being able to get the benefits of aggregating demand.
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]:[bold] 
[normal]I
[normal] absolutely agree. That report did set out how standard specifications, economies of scale and fewer tenders would lead to reduced admin costs.  Those things showed that aggregating your demand in a market works.  
[normal]There is an example in the contract management report which draws on the experience of London councils, led by the London Borough of Camden.  It shows how sharing information can make a really big difference.  They asked councils how much they were spending on IT procurement, broadly from the same supplier, and found, to everyone’s surprise, how much 
[normal]variation there was.  Using that information and given that transparency, they were able to negotiate with the supplier, approaching a saving of £2.5 million in one year.  Given the success of that initiative, the LGA now wants to roll that out nationwide, or certainly in England.
[normal]Q394 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]James Morris:[bold] One of the tensions that has come out in evidence in our inquiry is about whether the Government should mandate in some way a centralised way of local government procuring services, or whether local autonomy should still be an important factor.  What is your view, Mr 
[normal]Wardman
[normal]?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: Representing the Audit Commission, I think 
[normal]mandation
[normal] is an issue for the Government rather than us.
[normal]Q395 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]James Morris:[bold] Do you think it would enhance the savings which you are pointing to, in terms of collaboration, if there was to be a mandate that said, “We’re going to move towards a more centralised procurement process”, on the basis of the savings your reports have identified?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: I preface my response by saying that councils need to be very clear
[normal] why they do not collaborate
[normal].  
[normal]They
[normal] need to be sure they are getting better value than would be the case, certainly for things like IT, stationery, vehicles, possibly travel and subsistence and consultants, but they could argue that it depends on the scope of 
[normal]mandation
[normal] and the consequences of failing to comply.  There might be very local and specific issues related to contracted-out care for some very vulnerable individuals, for example looked-after children.  We need to be careful.  
[normal]G
[normal]iven the range of services
[normal] councils provide, 
[normal]mandation
[normal] might be
[normal] seen by them as a r
[normal]ather crude weapon, if that is the right expression, to make sure 
[normal]they get the
[normal] best possible price. They will
[normal] argue,
[normal] 
[normal]with some justification
[normal], that they need to protect their local requirements and understand their local objectives, but that is not to say 
[normal]everyone shoul
[normal]d go off and do their own thing.  Centralised procurement carries powerful weight.
[normal]Q396 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]James Morris:[bold] Mr Davis, what do you think about that idea?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: It would not be our place to say yes or no to 
[normal]mandation
[normal] in local government.
[normal]Q397 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]James Morris:[bold] In principle, in terms of trying to achieve the objective of collaboration, do you think it needs to be more than just a good idea for local authorities, police authorities or whoever to collaborate, and there needs to be some other mechanism put in place to make sure that happens?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: It is certainly the case that in central Government there have been some benefits from 
[normal]mandation
[normal].  
[normal]The idea of the Cabinet Office mandat
[normal]ing the main central Government Departments to buy through particular routes has led to 
[normal]savings
[normal].  
[normal]If you are weighing up whether
[normal] or not to mandate
[normal], 
[normal]as Mark hinted at, 
[normal]there is a complicated set of factors to take into account
[normal] when you go into local government, not least local accountability and what it means.  
[normal]There is also the behavioural side of it.  As human beings, 
[normal]i
[normal]f we are forced to do something
[normal] that may not
[normal] always get the best response from us; if we are persuaded to do something because we see some data that show us
[normal] it is bet
[normal]ter value for money to go down this rather 
[normal]than that route, we will probably buy in more to collaboration as a principle, so quite a subtle judg
[normal]ment 
[normal]is 
[normal]to be made.
[normal]Q398 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]James Morris:[bold] Mr Bryce, presumably this does not cover your area.
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: It does not cover my area of expertise.
[normal]Q399 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] While 
[normal]mandation
[normal] to collaborate may not always be right and there will be real problems around it, trying to ensure best practice is passed on to other authorities must, surely, always be right.  How are you going to do that? The Audit Commission is no longer there to do it.  I am not quite sure what the National Audit Office will be doing in this area, so who is going to do it?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: 
[normal]I can answer
[normal] a little bit about what the National Audit Office is going to be doing.  
[normal]We are 
[normal]picking up some aspects of the Audit Commission role, as you know, one of which is around the code of audit practice, but perhaps more relevantly here are some aspects of the national studies that the Audit Commission does.  
[normal]We will b
[normal]e doing a small number of those each year.  They will not be about making judg
[normal]ments on individual local authorities; 
[normal]they will be about looking across the whole picture and explicitly drawing out good practice as a 
[normal]vehicle for di
[normal]sseminating it.  We will be able to make a contribution.  Clearly, we are not the only actors in this space; there are a
[normal] number of
[normal] other parties, which Mark can probably talk about better than I can, who are well placed to do some of this.
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: T
[normal]he L
[normal]ocal Government Association 
[normal]comes to mind as an organisation that will collect good practice, but I suppose your question points to the fact 
[normal]that one of the previous roles for the Audit Commission’s national studies was to 
[normal]collate information centrally about what auditors
[normal] and earlier performance specialists had found.  It could use that
[normal] not only 
[normal]to map the terrain—
[normal]what
[normal] we felt was the variability of performance—but also 
[normal]hig
[normal]hlight good practice.  It was a
[normal] means of spreading good pract
[normal]ice.  With us going, we would like to see some means of collating the assessments that 
[normal]auditors ma
[normal]ke in an easily understandable and digestible way.
[normal]Q400 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] That is not a role for the National Audit Office, is it?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: We do not have current plans to do exactly that, as far as I understand.  I am not close to our group that is taking in parts of the Audit Commission work.  I work in a team that leads on work around the Cabinet Office and central Government agenda, but I am not aware of anything there.
[normal]Q401 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] If I were to ask you whether the National Audit Office was going to have a proper ongoing dialogue with the LGA about how to work together on this area, what would you say?
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: I am certain that is the case.  We already have a significant dialogue with the Local Government Association and 
[normal]lots of other parties around
[normal] local government, and I am certain that will include this as a topic.
[normal]Q402 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs [bold]Glindon[bold]:[bold] Mr 
[normal]Wardman
[normal], earlier you said that councillors 
[normal]had been on a journey over the last
[normal] 10 years on procurement, but 
[normal]both your organisations have been re
[normal]ally damning about the lack of skills in central 
[normal]Government 
[normal]and local government to manage complex procurement.  
[normal]What
[normal] measures should the Government and 
[normal]the local government sector as well be taking to 
[normal]address this deficit in skills?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: What measures should local government be taking?
[normal]Q403 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs [bold]Glindon[bold]:[bold] At both national 
[normal]Government 
[normal]and local government level.
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: 
[normal]Local government can draw on a range
[normal] of sources to help them improve their procurement skills, but,
[normal] going
[normal] back to my earlier point, 
[normal]there will be
[normal] variable practice.  For example, some small district councils might find it
[normal] hard to recruit the specia
[normal]list procurement expertise 
[normal]they would need
[normal].  Broadly, I suppose you can define this.  I know y
[normal]ou
[normal] will hear from others about what that skill would involve, but, from our point of view, based on our past work,
[normal] it is certainly a commercial outlook
[normal].  
[normal]Understanding procurement means understanding
[normal] costs, prices, supplier business models, and the creation of an
[normal] effective business case t
[normal]hat looks at costs and benefits of different options.  
[normal]It 
[normal]is about understanding markets.
[normal]Based on my own experience—I 
[normal]cannot give you quantitative data
[normal]—I know that not all councils have exactly the same levels of skills in those areas.  It would be 
[normal]interesting to see whether local government could draw on people with expertise as and when they need
[normal]ed
[normal] it
[normal].  The ways they can do that are: they can employ people with a commercial or procurement background; they can
[normal] use consultants from time to time, althoug
[normal]h, from the work we did recently,
[normal] 
[normal]they have different views about the value of consultants, certainly in contract management; they can bring people in to train their staff, but i
[normal]t may well be they just need to bring in some other organisation tha
[normal]t might provide specialist help when it is needed.  I am not saying I know what that is.
[normal]Q404 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs [bold]Glindon[bold]:[bold] How could national Government move this along? We are talking about a time of cuts in local council budgets, and making use of consultants and extra training would be very onerous.  While it is about how to get the best procurement, the culture is changing because of what has been forced on to councils.  Is there anything the Government can do to provide guidance or help?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: If you take the view, as I would
[normal], that the principl
[normal]es of good procurement and 
[normal]contract management apply
[normal] probably not just across all parts of the public sector but more widely,
[normal] initiatives like the Commissioning Aca
[normal]demy, run by the Cabinet Office, mean that a body of expertise is developing on which councils might be able to draw.  
[normal]A
[normal]necdotally, I know that some councils have spoken to the Cabinet Office about that.  I am not party to those discussions; 
[normal]I do not know what has taken place, but 
[normal]it seems to me there is a line of communication opening up that could be quite 
[normal]useful.
[normal]Q405 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mrs [bold]Glindon[bold]:[bold] Do you know how much the lack of skills is costing the taxpayer locally or nationally?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: 
[normal]I do not think I would be willi
[normal]ng to put a figure on it.  Lack of skills means you are much more likely to encounter the risks that good procurement seeks to manage, essentially buying 
[normal]the wrong things
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]buying 
[normal]the right things 
[normal]at the wrong price, or buying them at the right price but for the wrong level of quality.  It might be too high a 
[normal]quality, 
[normal]depending on your needs.  
[normal]All those so
[normal]rts of risks could be mitigated by having access to expertise.
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: That is right.  It is 
[normal]very dif
[normal]ficult to get an overall sense of how much lack of skills might cost.  There are some case examples from things that have
[normal] gone wrong in contracts
[normal].  
[normal]I agree with Mark that the key area where there is a significant 
[normal]skill 
[normal]shortfall is 
[normal]contract management.  The problems that the Ministry of Justice has had with its electronic monitoring contracts are well publicised.  We know that the cost 
[normal]has run into tens of millions of pounds
[normal].  
[normal]T
[normal]he Ministry of Justice has not yet settled with the two contractors, but there will certainly be a very significant cost to the taxpayer.  It may well be that the contractors
[normal] pay
[normal] back
[normal] some or 
[normal]all of that money, but it 
[normal]show
[normal]s the potential scale or cost of not necessarily having the right contract management skills.
[normal]Chair:[bold] You were talking about your discussions with 
[normal]Atos
[normal], G4S and Serco.  You were probably trying to find out how not to do things in terms of contracts, but we will move on.
[normal]Q406 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] I want to ask about how effective 
[normal]local authorities are at managing contracts, 
[normal]in particular how effective they are at managing risk.  One of the risks to local authorities in the running of contracts is fraud.  Mr Bryce, I am not sure we have heard from you yet.  Could you tell us your view on how effective 
[normal]local authoritie
[normal]s are at managing risk, and the risk of fraud occurring in contracts in which they are involved?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: S
[normal]peaki
[normal]ng from the evidence base that the commission collects, Mark made the point that our evidence base has changed.  W
[normal]e do collect data on all fraud com
[normal]mitted against local government and publish this in our annual report 
[normal]Protecting
[normal] the
[normal] Public Purse
[normal].  
[normal]We published the 2013 version only a couple of weeks ago.  I suggest it has some very
[normal] intere
[normal]sting messages in relation to how we interpret the fraud detection activities, compared with the total amount of fraud and the risks out there.  
[normal]For example, in 2013
[normal] all of local government
[normal]—local government as a whole submits the data—203 cases of procurement fraud to a value of £1.9
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]million were detected.  To put that into context, nationally all the fraud detected and committed against local government amounted to 107,000 cases, so we are talking about 0
[normal].2%
[normal].  
[normal]That is probably not unexpected in terms of the 
[normal]cases, because generally procurement frauds tend to be higher value cases but of lower volume compared with the traditional cases of fraud that local government face.
[normal]Some interesting trend data are starting to emerge.  If I take you back to 2011, there were 145 cases of detected procurement fraud, so that is a 40% increase in only a couple of 
[normal]years
[normal].  
[normal]That would tend to indicate 
[normal]a greater focus on this issue, which many organisations such as the Commission have been encouraging, but, given the potential scale of loss due to procurement fraud, it would indicate there is still some distance to go.  A number of reasons sit behind that.  
[normal]The most common explanation we have seen from local government investigators tends to fall around the specific problems of trying to identify and investigate 
[normal]procurement fraud
[normal] itself.  It is generally far more complex in more traditional areas such as housing benefit fraud.  Many of the
[normal] traditional
[normal] techniques, for example data matching and data analytics, 
[normal]d
[normal]o not apply,
[normal] and that
[normal] puts a lot of emphasis particularly on 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] initially to identify and investigate those frauds, and that 
[normal]start
[normal]s
[normal] to create issues around capa
[normal]bility.  Fifteen or 20 years ago most large internal audit teams in local government would have a contract audit
[normal] specialist, for example
[normal].  
[normal]Very few have that now, so do they necessarily
[normal] have the capability to tackle this type of fraud and investigate it properly?
[normal]There is also a
[normal]n issue of capacity
[normal] in relation to tackling procurement fraud, partic
[normal]ularly going forward.  Right now, many of the smaller local government bodies rely on the investigative capacity they already have in dealing with housing benefit fraud investigations.  It is an in-house team, but not entirely; some have corporate fraud teams and some have contract audit specialists.  Going forward, even though there are relatively few cases of detected fraud in relation to procurement that we are seeing, compared with the
[normal] totality
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the capacity 
[normal]of 
[normal]local government to investigate this type of fraud
[normal] is likely to fall away consid
[normal]erably with the advent of the single fraud investigation service next year.
[normal]Q407 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] Were the figures you cited cases identified by the local authorities themselves or by auditors?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: It would be a mix of all fraud detected.  The other thing that might be of interest to the Committee—the data bring this out quite clearly—is that, if we rewind a couple of years, the average value of the detected fraud case committed against local government was just over £100,000 per case.  If we go forward two years, it is just under £10,000.
[normal]Q408 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] What do we deduce from that?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: I would suspect that a significant proportion of this is due to the fact we are now starting to see the impact, from a couple of years ago, of one particular type of procurement fraud arising from changes to bank mandate details, which the Committee might well be aware of, and the way in which the transparency agenda and tackling corruption have helped facilitate fraudsters to use publicly-available information to commit fraud.  I suggest that local government is responding very well by putting in place the prevention arrangements to stop those types of fraud happening now.
[normal]Q409 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] You are saying there are more cases but on average each case is significantly smaller in size, and therefore the total amount of fraud committed against local authority procurement is less than it was previously?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: Not committed but detected.
[normal]Q410 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] Are local bodies good at detecting fraud?  I suppose that the judgment call I am asking you to make is how much people are getting away with.
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: At the start, I 
[normal]alluded
[normal] to the fact that 
[normal]detecting this 
[normal]type of fraud is very difficult.  Short of 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal], it is very hard to find these types of fraud
[normal], despite the 
[normal]fact that there has been a lot of guidance about good practice to
[normal] assist authorities
[normal].  
[normal]There is no academi
[normal]cally robust and statistically significant estimate of the scale of procurement fraud against local government.  An estimate has been made by the National Fraud Authority.  It estimates that £876 million is the likely scale of risk of annual fraud loss in local government procurement.  
[normal]Therefore, by comparison
[normal] £1.9 million of detection in total would appear very small, but a
[normal] couple of points
[normal] are to be made here.  
[normal]One is that it suggests that even more can be done by local government.  When I talked about the amount detected
[normal] in one year, that could be
[normal] running back several years.  Therefore, the £1.9 million of detected fraud in local government in the last year is not just the total amount committed in that year.  However, when the National Fraud Authority talks about the total annual loss, that is just for one year, so it suggests that in terms of value an awful lot more can be done.
[normal]I would put down a marker in respect of that 
[normal]estimate
[normal].  That estimate is based
[normal] on an analysi
[normal]s of procurement fraud in the MO
[normal]D
[normal], not local government.  Without being an expert in procurement in the MOD, I do not know how directly comparable that is with the fraud prevention arrangements that local government have, so it might be more of an indicator at the top level, but certainly it is difficult to say how true a reflection that is.
[normal]Q411 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] In terms of management of risk
[normal], what steps could local authorities take
[normal] to improve their performance
[normal]?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: 
[normal]Fraud can happen anywhere within the process of procur
[normal]ement.  Maybe I should explain that every single case of fraud committed against local government valued at over £10,000 crosses my desk.  Most of the fraud cases being detected tend to be at
[normal] the contract implementation stage
[normal].  
[normal]There are important 
[normal]issues more generally about the controls in place to prevent and detect fraud, for example 
[normal]traditional issues around segregation of duties
[normal].  
[normal]We have seen an 
[normal]ups
[normal]urge in the number of cases where the absence of supervisory controls and segregation of duties has enabled these 
[normal]fraud
[normal]s to occur.  A review of the controls fundamental to preventing and detecting fraud is required.  N
[normal]ot all local authorities
[normal], as part of their review of controls more generally, are necessarily considering 
[normal]the key controls to prevent a
[normal]nd detect fraud, and I would encourage them to do so.
[normal]T
[normal]he
[normal] pre-tendering side of fraud risk is even more problematic.  In very few of the cases 
[normal]we have seen 
[normal]does detection
[normal] occu
[normal]r at that stage, which
[normal] suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that
[normal],
[normal] if there is to be a proportionate response 
[normal]to tackling this type of fraud, the deterrence aspect probably needs to be considered much more widely.  
[normal]I can suggest a couple of ways to aid local authority investigations.  One is around 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal].  The other one, which I am told about consistently by colleagues who are investigating these cases, is that often they feel stymied b
[normal]y the difficulty of ob
[normal]taining access to information from the organisations providing the service.  This has prevented many of the fraud investigations from proceeding.  As a result, 
[normal]I understand t
[normal]hat many councils often treat what we would probably consider to be procurement fraud as a 
[normal]case of weak contract managemen
[normal]t.  Our message has always been to treat fraud as fraud.  That is perhaps changing a little, but there is still that within the system.
[normal]Q412 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] When that fraud occurs, that causes reputational damage to the body involved.  The other two types of fraud that the Audit Commission identified were: the dangers of 
[normal]supplier 
[normal]insolvency, where too onerous a contract may push the supplier out of business, and service failure.  All of that damages the reputation of the procuring body, in this case the local council.  We have heard quite extensively from Mr Bryce about fraud, but, on those other two risks, are councils sufficiently adept at managing risk, picking up the point made by Mrs
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Glindon
[normal] about whether they have the skills to manage it?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: In some cases, the councils we spoke to that have developed collaborative arrangements with suppliers, for example Solihull, have brought other councils into those arrangements so they can take advantage of the savings.  Not just Solihull but others in that report are very alive to the idea 
[normal]of supply fai
[normal]lure.  
[normal]There have been some very high-profile failures, not least in social care, so an organisation like Trafford will, as part of its
[normal] annual market management
[normal],
[normal] have extensi
[normal]ve dialogue with 
[normal]councils.  That produces some benefits to them when they come to the vexed question about whether the supplier
[normal] 
[normal]can share their 
[normal]pain as well a
[normal]s the gains, hopefully, in good times.  
[normal]They have managed to negotiate 
[normal]that, because they understand their supplier market and the business models of different suppliers.  Councils are increasingly 
[normal]alive to the idea that you can ask too much of your suppliers.
[normal]Q413 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Mark [bold]Pawsey[bold]:[bold] To take the example you have just given, does pressure on budgets encourage councils to be at greater risk than they might otherwise be in terms of to whom they give a contract?  Are they less diligent or cautious in letting a contract because they are under pressure to deliver at a lower price?
[normal]Mark [bold]Wardman[bold]: 
[normal]I cannot give you a picture of what is going on, but
[normal] that has to be a risk.  One point I wanted to make earlier, which is also relevant to this point and also to fraud, is that w
[normal]e have just published a report called 
[normal]Tough Times
[normal].  
[normal]Th
[normal]at shows that councils are broadly managing within their budgets and set managed budgets, but th
[normal]ey are doing tha
[normal]t primarily by making savings.  About half of the savings councils are having to make are by reducing
[normal] staff numbers
[normal].  
[normal]Fi
[normal]gures from the ONS suggest that since 2009
[normal] councils ha
[normal]ve shed about 19% of their full-time equivalent headcount.  In that case
[normal] the question is
[normal]: who are they letting go?  In the same way as the old days, if councils contract out their 
[normal]se
[normal]rvice and technical expertise along with the contract, they find that perhaps they are at a loss when it comes to contract management, change of control or 
[normal]re-letting the contract
[normal].  
[normal]There is an issue here a
[normal]bout skills which it is important for councils to address.  They are having to make savings and predominantly they are doing it by letting people go as well as outsourcing contracts.  Those two things together present a risk for them if they are not on top of it.
[normal]Q414 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Heyes[bold]:[bold] Mr Bryce has anticipated the line of questioning I was going to pursue on fraud in the very comprehensive and helpful responses we have had so far.  You briefly mentioned whistleblowers.  Would you say that 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] is the main source of identification of fraud? What proportion is it?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: I would not have the specific statistics.
[normal]Q415 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Heyes[bold]:[bold] Give us a feel for it.
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: It is probably the single most common way of identifying procurement fraud.
[normal]Q416 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Heyes[bold]:[bold] That poses two obvious questions.  What can we do to make that more likely?  How can we be more supportive of potential whistleblowers to create a more open environment?  What other things should councils be doing to open up other sources of identification of fraud?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: As to 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal], this really comes down to a fundamental issue in terms of who is doing the 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal].  
[normal]As we have recognised in other areas,
[normal] it is important to ensure that the organisations you deal with and the staff involved, who will be the people who blow the whistle, are aware, in a local government context, of to whom they can blow the whistle, not just in their own organisation but the local authorities concerned.  I know that as part of contract arrangements some consideration is often given to what the 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] arrangements of the provider organisation are, but I think we could go a lot further than that.
[normal]In the end, the danger of that approach is ticking a box that virtually everybody will be able to tick—“I have some 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] arrangements, or a policy as such.” Any organisation would be able to say that.  What is more important is the extent to which that is embedded; the culture of staff in a private sector organisation, of which care homes are a very good example; and whether those providing the care—this goes further than fraud—would feel confident to blow the whistle to the council rather than their own organisation if they saw something of concern, and there are detrimental aspects to this for them individually.  Strengthening the requirement around that and putting greater emphasis on assurance around the 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] arrangements in provider organisations would be very helpful.
[normal]This Committee might not have had the chan
[normal]ce to consider it yet, but the leading 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] charity, Public Concern at Work, published its 
[normal]Whistleblowing
[normal] Commission report last week.  T
[normal]hey make a number 
[normal]of very helpful recommendations that address that specific point, which is wider than just fraud, and include a 
[normal]code of practic
[normal]e.  That is something 
[normal]privat
[normal]e bodies might want to consider in the future.
[normal]Keith Davis[bold]: That 
[normal]echoes wh
[normal]at we said about 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] in our report a couple of weeks ago.  We framed it in terms of public sector procuring authorities seeing it very much as part of the dialogue they are having with contractors, saying to them, “If you want to 
[normal]do business with us, we want to see your 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] policy; we want to
[normal] understand how that works in practice; we want you to convince us that there is a
[normal] culture within the organisation where 
[normal]whistl
[normal]eblowing
[normal] is not trampled down
[normal] and is genuinely encouraged.
[normal]”  
[normal]We would look almost for third-party reviews of 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] policies to give public sector customers 
[normal]extra confide
[normal]nce in these contractors.  I agree with everything Alan said.  
[normal]W
[normal]histleblowing
[normal] is absolutely crucial
[normal] to combating fraud.
[normal]Q417 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]David [bold]Heyes[bold]:[bold] There is perhaps an irony in this.  If you depend so heavily on 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] to identify fraud, you almost depend on the fraud taking place for the 
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal] to be effective.  What 
[normal]other things should be happening to nip the fraud in the bud before we become so dependent on whistleblowers?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: There are other very effective
[normal] techniques
[normal] to identify fraud.  I go back to my earlier response.  Probably the 
[normal]one consideration we really should be 
[normal]giving thought to is around deterrence.  
[normal]There is relatively little
[normal] deterrence from the perspective of fraud currently in the system, by which I mean that to have effective deterrence you must have a
[normal] reasonable capaci
[normal]ty to identify and detect fraud initially;
[normal] and
[normal], more importantly, there should be an investigator who would be able to investigate this and the local authority
[normal] would take action appropriately, including
[normal] potentially criminal sanction.
[normal]Looking at the data we have right now on detection, if an organisation really wanted and was encouraged to attempt some form of procurement fraud, currently
[normal] th
[normal]ere is a very good chance that they would not be identified.  One gets back to the point made earlier in the Committee.  How do we start to address the capacity and
[normal] capability
[normal] to investigate this?
[normal] 
[normal] Most important
[normal] of all
[normal], if you are to have deterrence there must be a change of mindset.  
[normal]As the public sector, we should be 
[normal]shouting f
[normal]rom the rooftops every time we find a procurement fraud and celebrate that fact, because the only thing that aids fraudsters if we all
[normal] keep quiet abou
[normal]t it.  There is a cultural aspect here, and, to get to the h
[normal]eart of your question
[normal], tackling fraud culture and the way we talk about the issue would be a 
[normal]very significant step forward.
[normal]Q418 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Mr Bryce, you made a point about the resistance of service providers to co-operate in this.  H
[normal]ow can we ensure that more pressure is put on
[normal] them
[normal] to do so?
[normal]  Should things be written into contracts to ensure that service providers do thoroughly co
[normal]&#x2011;
[normal]operate?  Indeed, when somebody 
[normal]whistleblows
[normal] in a private sector organisation should there be a requirement to release that information automatically to the public sector body that is paying for the service
[normal]?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: I have not given consideration to the legal requirement to 
[normal]whistleblow
[normal].  The 
[normal]appr
[normal]oach we have always taken is to encourage a strong culture.  Consideration could be given to that aspect, and i
[normal]t is such an im
[normal]portant source of information.  On
[normal] the principal issue you asked me about, which is the
[normal] contractual side, if you really want to investigate these matters and tackle it across the sector
[normal] all local authorities
[normal] should be looking for their investigators to have access to the necessary financial information that these provider companies have.
[normal]Q419 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] That would be written into the contract to make it absolutely clear from the beginning.
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: That would certainly
[normal] be the most effective way.  What I am hearing from the sector is that that is variable.  Some local authorities do require that; others do not, and that lack of consistency means that the local government sector as a whole is finding it more difficult to tackle this type of fraud.
[normal]Q420 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Chair:[bold] Would you like to think about the “
[normal]whistleblowing
[normal]” point and whether something could be written in, and perhaps come back to us on that?
[normal]Alan Bryce[bold]: Indeed.
[normal]Chair:[bold] Thank you all very much for coming and giving evidence to us.
