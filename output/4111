defaultQ386 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Good afternoon.  You are all welcome to this
default sixth evidence session on local government procurement
default.  
defaultFor our records, could you say who you are and the organisations you represent?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault:default My n
defaultame is Mark 
defaultWardman
default.  I am a Senior M
defaultanager in the information and analysis group at the Audit Commission.
defaultAlan Bryce:default I am Alan Bryce, Head of Counter-F
defaultraud for the Audit Commission.
defaultKeith Davis:default I am Keith Davis, Director of Cabinet Office and Cross-Government S
defaulttudies at the National Audit Office.
defaultQ387 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much for coming to give evidence
default.  
defaultIn taki
defaultng evidence, we have talked to quite a few local authorities.  I suppose the feeling always is that the ones who come to give evidence and speak to you are those who are doing things best, and that is why they want to tell you about it.  How do we get a real feel about whether local authorities in general are using best practice in the area of
default procurement
default?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: There is a slight problem for the Audit Commission now in answering a question like that, because we no longer have the route into understanding auditor assessments and judgments that perhaps we did in the past.  I have come along today in part because I have done some work recently with the Local Government Association, which 
defaultlooked at contract management in councils, and from that I have picked up some evidence of their procurement practice, too.  
defaultQ388 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But don’t they talk to the people who are doing things best as well?  They also talk to the authorities who are doing things best.
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: The Local Government Association?
defaultChair:default Yes.
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: In the case of that particular piece of work, we were talking to councils that we felt had shown good practice in that area, that is true, but the councils were keen to explain how they had gone on a journey, overcome some of the barriers to poor procurement and contract management and improved.
defaultQ389 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If the Audit Commission has not got the ability now, has the National Audit Office taken over so it can give us all the information?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: I fear that my answer may slightly frustrate the Committee’s question on this one as well.  I am here as one of the authors of the recent National Audit Office work on central Government contracting.  There are a lot of lessons and principles we can draw out from our experience of looking at that which are equally relevant to local government.  
defaultOn your specific question, one of the keys perhaps is transparency.  It was certainly a big theme of the work we did on central Government that we need a much better understanding of who is spending what, what revenue a contractor is getting, what level of profit a contractor is getting and what level of performance is being delivered on individual contracts.  That might be one of the keys to getting a better understanding of what is happening in the local government landscape.
defaultQ390 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default But as soon as we got anywhere near those sorts of issues the contractors say it is a matter of commercial confidentiality and they cannot release the information because their competitors will have an immediate advantage in seeing what they are doing.  Can you have commercial confidentiality but somehow get a release of useful information in these matters?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: You can.  That was not our recent experience.  One of the reports we published a couple of weeks ago was based on the portfolio of work that Serco, Capita, G4S and 
defaultAtos
default do across the public sector.  We engaged with them and asked them for information on revenue broken down by different public sector clients.  We asked them for information on their profit, and whether they have open book accounting.  We even cheekily 
defaultasked 
defaultwhether they paid 
defaultUK
default tax.  In all cases, we got pretty comprehensive answers.
defaultQ391 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Answers to you.
defaultKeith Davisdefault: Yes, and we were able to put the answers and data they gave us into our published report.  It is all in here.  Contractors might often be willing to go a lot further with this than we sometimes think.
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: It is clear that councils have been on a journey on procurement over the last 10 to 15 years.  There has been a huge effort to improve guidance for councils on procurement, and a growth in shared services and contracting out.  It would be surprising if councils were not improving in this area in that context, but they vary enormously.  They 
defaulthave been procuring goods and services for a very long time—as long as they have been in existence—and the fact they have such a wide variety of contracts within each council means there will be variable practice across the piece.  My sense is that it is probably improving, but some will be much better at it than others.
defaultQ392 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default As a general comment, all local authorities are under enormous pressure to be as efficient as possible and try to make savings on their procurement.  
defaultOn the other hand
default, the issue of social value is probably coming to the fore in a way it was not 10 years ago.  How do local authorities deal with the potential conflict between getting prices down but also adding social value to contracts at the same time?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: You are alluding to a tension in council procurement, and that existed before the financial crisis and the recent austerity programme to reduce their income.  Councils have always had to balance aggregating their demand to get the lowest possible price through economies of scale and fostering a healthy local economy through their procurement.  
defaultFrom the latest research with the Local Government Association on contract management, I am picking up the fact that, of the various social value areas in which councils are interested, they are particularly interested in economic regeneration—perhaps prioritising that over environmental regeneration.  For example, through their procurement and contract management they are looking for suppliers who provide apprenticeships for local people, and using local firms in their supply chain, perhaps bringing other things from contractors where they have had difficulty.  I think 
defaultBirmingham
default persuaded the directors of some companies to act as school governors, for example.  They are tying in some of the social value they want in their area to economic regeneration in particular in their contracts.
defaultQ393 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Both the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office have pointed to the value of collaboration between local authorities.  How effective do you think local government is being in collaborating on procurement?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: We did some joint work with the Audit Commission back in 2010 where we made general comments about the scope to go further with collaboration.  For our part, we have not looked at local authorities in any way since.  It is not part of our remit.  
defaultThe one thing we have looked at quite recently is police procurement, and certainly we argued there that there were pretty significant missed opportunities around collaboration.  Police forces were taking a too localised approach.  About half of them still had their own dedicated procurement teams; there were lots of barriers to collaboration around police forces wanting their own particular specification for a uniform or boot and that was getting in the way.  If you could move to a place where there is a standard specification for uniforms, to use that example, they would be much more effective in being able to get the benefits of aggregating demand.
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault:default 
defaultI
default absolutely agree. That report did set out how standard specifications, economies of scale and fewer tenders would lead to reduced admin costs.  Those things showed that aggregating your demand in a market works.  
defaultThere is an example in the contract management report which draws on the experience of London councils, led by the London Borough of Camden.  It shows how sharing information can make a really big difference.  They asked councils how much they were spending on IT procurement, broadly from the same supplier, and found, to everyone’s surprise, how much 
defaultvariation there was.  Using that information and given that transparency, they were able to negotiate with the supplier, approaching a saving of £2.5 million in one year.  Given the success of that initiative, the LGA now wants to roll that out nationwide, or certainly in England.
defaultQ394 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default One of the tensions that has come out in evidence in our inquiry is about whether the Government should mandate in some way a centralised way of local government procuring services, or whether local autonomy should still be an important factor.  What is your view, Mr 
defaultWardman
default?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: Representing the Audit Commission, I think 
defaultmandation
default is an issue for the Government rather than us.
defaultQ395 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Do you think it would enhance the savings which you are pointing to, in terms of collaboration, if there was to be a mandate that said, “We’re going to move towards a more centralised procurement process”, on the basis of the savings your reports have identified?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: I preface my response by saying that councils need to be very clear
default why they do not collaborate
default.  
defaultThey
default need to be sure they are getting better value than would be the case, certainly for things like IT, stationery, vehicles, possibly travel and subsistence and consultants, but they could argue that it depends on the scope of 
defaultmandation
default and the consequences of failing to comply.  There might be very local and specific issues related to contracted-out care for some very vulnerable individuals, for example looked-after children.  We need to be careful.  
defaultG
defaultiven the range of services
default councils provide, 
defaultmandation
default might be
default seen by them as a r
defaultather crude weapon, if that is the right expression, to make sure 
defaultthey get the
default best possible price. They will
default argue,
default 
defaultwith some justification
default, that they need to protect their local requirements and understand their local objectives, but that is not to say 
defaulteveryone shoul
defaultd go off and do their own thing.  Centralised procurement carries powerful weight.
defaultQ396 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Mr Davis, what do you think about that idea?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: It would not be our place to say yes or no to 
defaultmandation
default in local government.
defaultQ397 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default In principle, in terms of trying to achieve the objective of collaboration, do you think it needs to be more than just a good idea for local authorities, police authorities or whoever to collaborate, and there needs to be some other mechanism put in place to make sure that happens?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: It is certainly the case that in central Government there have been some benefits from 
defaultmandation
default.  
defaultThe idea of the Cabinet Office mandat
defaulting the main central Government Departments to buy through particular routes has led to 
defaultsavings
default.  
defaultIf you are weighing up whether
default or not to mandate
default, 
defaultas Mark hinted at, 
defaultthere is a complicated set of factors to take into account
default when you go into local government, not least local accountability and what it means.  
defaultThere is also the behavioural side of it.  As human beings, 
defaulti
defaultf we are forced to do something
default that may not
default always get the best response from us; if we are persuaded to do something because we see some data that show us
default it is bet
defaultter value for money to go down this rather 
defaultthan that route, we will probably buy in more to collaboration as a principle, so quite a subtle judg
defaultment 
defaultis 
defaultto be made.
defaultQ398 default&#xa0; 
defaultJames Morris:default Mr Bryce, presumably this does not cover your area.
defaultAlan Brycedefault: It does not cover my area of expertise.
defaultQ399 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default While 
defaultmandation
default to collaborate may not always be right and there will be real problems around it, trying to ensure best practice is passed on to other authorities must, surely, always be right.  How are you going to do that? The Audit Commission is no longer there to do it.  I am not quite sure what the National Audit Office will be doing in this area, so who is going to do it?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: 
defaultI can answer
default a little bit about what the National Audit Office is going to be doing.  
defaultWe are 
defaultpicking up some aspects of the Audit Commission role, as you know, one of which is around the code of audit practice, but perhaps more relevantly here are some aspects of the national studies that the Audit Commission does.  
defaultWe will b
defaulte doing a small number of those each year.  They will not be about making judg
defaultments on individual local authorities; 
defaultthey will be about looking across the whole picture and explicitly drawing out good practice as a 
defaultvehicle for di
defaultsseminating it.  We will be able to make a contribution.  Clearly, we are not the only actors in this space; there are a
default number of
default other parties, which Mark can probably talk about better than I can, who are well placed to do some of this.
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: T
defaulthe L
defaultocal Government Association 
defaultcomes to mind as an organisation that will collect good practice, but I suppose your question points to the fact 
defaultthat one of the previous roles for the Audit Commission’s national studies was to 
defaultcollate information centrally about what auditors
default and earlier performance specialists had found.  It could use that
default not only 
defaultto map the terrain—
defaultwhat
default we felt was the variability of performance—but also 
defaulthig
defaulthlight good practice.  It was a
default means of spreading good pract
defaultice.  With us going, we would like to see some means of collating the assessments that 
defaultauditors ma
defaultke in an easily understandable and digestible way.
defaultQ400 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That is not a role for the National Audit Office, is it?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: We do not have current plans to do exactly that, as far as I understand.  I am not close to our group that is taking in parts of the Audit Commission work.  I work in a team that leads on work around the Cabinet Office and central Government agenda, but I am not aware of anything there.
defaultQ401 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default If I were to ask you whether the National Audit Office was going to have a proper ongoing dialogue with the LGA about how to work together on this area, what would you say?
defaultKeith Davisdefault: I am certain that is the case.  We already have a significant dialogue with the Local Government Association and 
defaultlots of other parties around
default local government, and I am certain that will include this as a topic.
defaultQ402 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default Mr 
defaultWardman
default, earlier you said that councillors 
defaulthad been on a journey over the last
default 10 years on procurement, but 
defaultboth your organisations have been re
defaultally damning about the lack of skills in central 
defaultGovernment 
defaultand local government to manage complex procurement.  
defaultWhat
default measures should the Government and 
defaultthe local government sector as well be taking to 
defaultaddress this deficit in skills?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: What measures should local government be taking?
defaultQ403 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default At both national 
defaultGovernment 
defaultand local government level.
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: 
defaultLocal government can draw on a range
default of sources to help them improve their procurement skills, but,
default going
default back to my earlier point, 
defaultthere will be
default variable practice.  For example, some small district councils might find it
default hard to recruit the specia
defaultlist procurement expertise 
defaultthey would need
default.  Broadly, I suppose you can define this.  I know y
defaultou
default will hear from others about what that skill would involve, but, from our point of view, based on our past work,
default it is certainly a commercial outlook
default.  
defaultUnderstanding procurement means understanding
default costs, prices, supplier business models, and the creation of an
default effective business case t
defaulthat looks at costs and benefits of different options.  
defaultIt 
defaultis about understanding markets.
defaultBased on my own experience—I 
defaultcannot give you quantitative data
default—I know that not all councils have exactly the same levels of skills in those areas.  It would be 
defaultinteresting to see whether local government could draw on people with expertise as and when they need
defaulted
default it
default.  The ways they can do that are: they can employ people with a commercial or procurement background; they can
default use consultants from time to time, althoug
defaulth, from the work we did recently,
default 
defaultthey have different views about the value of consultants, certainly in contract management; they can bring people in to train their staff, but i
defaultt may well be they just need to bring in some other organisation tha
defaultt might provide specialist help when it is needed.  I am not saying I know what that is.
defaultQ404 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default How could national Government move this along? We are talking about a time of cuts in local council budgets, and making use of consultants and extra training would be very onerous.  While it is about how to get the best procurement, the culture is changing because of what has been forced on to councils.  Is there anything the Government can do to provide guidance or help?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: If you take the view, as I would
default, that the principl
defaultes of good procurement and 
defaultcontract management apply
default probably not just across all parts of the public sector but more widely,
default initiatives like the Commissioning Aca
defaultdemy, run by the Cabinet Office, mean that a body of expertise is developing on which councils might be able to draw.  
defaultA
defaultnecdotally, I know that some councils have spoken to the Cabinet Office about that.  I am not party to those discussions; 
defaultI do not know what has taken place, but 
defaultit seems to me there is a line of communication opening up that could be quite 
defaultuseful.
defaultQ405 default&#xa0; 
defaultMrs defaultGlindondefault:default Do you know how much the lack of skills is costing the taxpayer locally or nationally?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: 
defaultI do not think I would be willi
defaultng to put a figure on it.  Lack of skills means you are much more likely to encounter the risks that good procurement seeks to manage, essentially buying 
defaultthe wrong things
default,
default or 
defaultbuying 
defaultthe right things 
defaultat the wrong price, or buying them at the right price but for the wrong level of quality.  It might be too high a 
defaultquality, 
defaultdepending on your needs.  
defaultAll those so
defaultrts of risks could be mitigated by having access to expertise.
defaultKeith Davisdefault: That is right.  It is 
defaultvery dif
defaultficult to get an overall sense of how much lack of skills might cost.  There are some case examples from things that have
default gone wrong in contracts
default.  
defaultI agree with Mark that the key area where there is a significant 
defaultskill 
defaultshortfall is 
defaultcontract management.  The problems that the Ministry of Justice has had with its electronic monitoring contracts are well publicised.  We know that the cost 
defaulthas run into tens of millions of pounds
default.  
defaultT
defaulthe Ministry of Justice has not yet settled with the two contractors, but there will certainly be a very significant cost to the taxpayer.  It may well be that the contractors
default pay
default back
default some or 
defaultall of that money, but it 
defaultshow
defaults the potential scale or cost of not necessarily having the right contract management skills.
defaultChair:default You were talking about your discussions with 
defaultAtos
default, G4S and Serco.  You were probably trying to find out how not to do things in terms of contracts, but we will move on.
defaultQ406 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default I want to ask about how effective 
defaultlocal authorities are at managing contracts, 
defaultin particular how effective they are at managing risk.  One of the risks to local authorities in the running of contracts is fraud.  Mr Bryce, I am not sure we have heard from you yet.  Could you tell us your view on how effective 
defaultlocal authoritie
defaults are at managing risk, and the risk of fraud occurring in contracts in which they are involved?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: S
defaultpeaki
defaultng from the evidence base that the commission collects, Mark made the point that our evidence base has changed.  W
defaulte do collect data on all fraud com
defaultmitted against local government and publish this in our annual report 
defaultProtecting
default the
default Public Purse
default.  
defaultWe published the 2013 version only a couple of weeks ago.  I suggest it has some very
default intere
defaultsting messages in relation to how we interpret the fraud detection activities, compared with the total amount of fraud and the risks out there.  
defaultFor example, in 2013
default all of local government
default—local government as a whole submits the data—203 cases of procurement fraud to a value of £1.9
default&#xa0;
defaultmillion were detected.  To put that into context, nationally all the fraud detected and committed against local government amounted to 107,000 cases, so we are talking about 0
default.2%
default.  
defaultThat is probably not unexpected in terms of the 
defaultcases, because generally procurement frauds tend to be higher value cases but of lower volume compared with the traditional cases of fraud that local government face.
defaultSome interesting trend data are starting to emerge.  If I take you back to 2011, there were 145 cases of detected procurement fraud, so that is a 40% increase in only a couple of 
defaultyears
default.  
defaultThat would tend to indicate 
defaulta greater focus on this issue, which many organisations such as the Commission have been encouraging, but, given the potential scale of loss due to procurement fraud, it would indicate there is still some distance to go.  A number of reasons sit behind that.  
defaultThe most common explanation we have seen from local government investigators tends to fall around the specific problems of trying to identify and investigate 
defaultprocurement fraud
default itself.  It is generally far more complex in more traditional areas such as housing benefit fraud.  Many of the
default traditional
default techniques, for example data matching and data analytics, 
defaultd
defaulto not apply,
default and that
default puts a lot of emphasis particularly on 
defaultwhistleblowing
default initially to identify and investigate those frauds, and that 
defaultstart
defaults
default to create issues around capa
defaultbility.  Fifteen or 20 years ago most large internal audit teams in local government would have a contract audit
default specialist, for example
default.  
defaultVery few have that now, so do they necessarily
default have the capability to tackle this type of fraud and investigate it properly?
defaultThere is also a
defaultn issue of capacity
default in relation to tackling procurement fraud, partic
defaultularly going forward.  Right now, many of the smaller local government bodies rely on the investigative capacity they already have in dealing with housing benefit fraud investigations.  It is an in-house team, but not entirely; some have corporate fraud teams and some have contract audit specialists.  Going forward, even though there are relatively few cases of detected fraud in relation to procurement that we are seeing, compared with the
default totality
default,
default 
defaultthe capacity 
defaultof 
defaultlocal government to investigate this type of fraud
default is likely to fall away consid
defaulterably with the advent of the single fraud investigation service next year.
defaultQ407 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Were the figures you cited cases identified by the local authorities themselves or by auditors?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: It would be a mix of all fraud detected.  The other thing that might be of interest to the Committee—the data bring this out quite clearly—is that, if we rewind a couple of years, the average value of the detected fraud case committed against local government was just over £100,000 per case.  If we go forward two years, it is just under £10,000.
defaultQ408 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default What do we deduce from that?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: I would suspect that a significant proportion of this is due to the fact we are now starting to see the impact, from a couple of years ago, of one particular type of procurement fraud arising from changes to bank mandate details, which the Committee might well be aware of, and the way in which the transparency agenda and tackling corruption have helped facilitate fraudsters to use publicly-available information to commit fraud.  I suggest that local government is responding very well by putting in place the prevention arrangements to stop those types of fraud happening now.
defaultQ409 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default You are saying there are more cases but on average each case is significantly smaller in size, and therefore the total amount of fraud committed against local authority procurement is less than it was previously?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: Not committed but detected.
defaultQ410 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default Are local bodies good at detecting fraud?  I suppose that the judgment call I am asking you to make is how much people are getting away with.
defaultAlan Brycedefault: At the start, I 
defaultalluded
default to the fact that 
defaultdetecting this 
defaulttype of fraud is very difficult.  Short of 
defaultwhistleblowing
default, it is very hard to find these types of fraud
default, despite the 
defaultfact that there has been a lot of guidance about good practice to
default assist authorities
default.  
defaultThere is no academi
defaultcally robust and statistically significant estimate of the scale of procurement fraud against local government.  An estimate has been made by the National Fraud Authority.  It estimates that £876 million is the likely scale of risk of annual fraud loss in local government procurement.  
defaultTherefore, by comparison
default £1.9 million of detection in total would appear very small, but a
default couple of points
default are to be made here.  
defaultOne is that it suggests that even more can be done by local government.  When I talked about the amount detected
default in one year, that could be
default running back several years.  Therefore, the £1.9 million of detected fraud in local government in the last year is not just the total amount committed in that year.  However, when the National Fraud Authority talks about the total annual loss, that is just for one year, so it suggests that in terms of value an awful lot more can be done.
defaultI would put down a marker in respect of that 
defaultestimate
default.  That estimate is based
default on an analysi
defaults of procurement fraud in the MO
defaultD
default, not local government.  Without being an expert in procurement in the MOD, I do not know how directly comparable that is with the fraud prevention arrangements that local government have, so it might be more of an indicator at the top level, but certainly it is difficult to say how true a reflection that is.
defaultQ411 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default In terms of management of risk
default, what steps could local authorities take
default to improve their performance
default?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: 
defaultFraud can happen anywhere within the process of procur
defaultement.  Maybe I should explain that every single case of fraud committed against local government valued at over £10,000 crosses my desk.  Most of the fraud cases being detected tend to be at
default the contract implementation stage
default.  
defaultThere are important 
defaultissues more generally about the controls in place to prevent and detect fraud, for example 
defaulttraditional issues around segregation of duties
default.  
defaultWe have seen an 
defaultups
defaulturge in the number of cases where the absence of supervisory controls and segregation of duties has enabled these 
defaultfraud
defaults to occur.  A review of the controls fundamental to preventing and detecting fraud is required.  N
defaultot all local authorities
default, as part of their review of controls more generally, are necessarily considering 
defaultthe key controls to prevent a
defaultnd detect fraud, and I would encourage them to do so.
defaultT
defaulthe
default pre-tendering side of fraud risk is even more problematic.  In very few of the cases 
defaultwe have seen 
defaultdoes detection
default occu
defaultr at that stage, which
default suggest
defaults
default that
default,
default if there is to be a proportionate response 
defaultto tackling this type of fraud, the deterrence aspect probably needs to be considered much more widely.  
defaultI can suggest a couple of ways to aid local authority investigations.  One is around 
defaultwhistleblowing
default.  The other one, which I am told about consistently by colleagues who are investigating these cases, is that often they feel stymied b
defaulty the difficulty of ob
defaulttaining access to information from the organisations providing the service.  This has prevented many of the fraud investigations from proceeding.  As a result, 
defaultI understand t
defaulthat many councils often treat what we would probably consider to be procurement fraud as a 
defaultcase of weak contract managemen
defaultt.  Our message has always been to treat fraud as fraud.  That is perhaps changing a little, but there is still that within the system.
defaultQ412 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default When that fraud occurs, that causes reputational damage to the body involved.  The other two types of fraud that the Audit Commission identified were: the dangers of 
defaultsupplier 
defaultinsolvency, where too onerous a contract may push the supplier out of business, and service failure.  All of that damages the reputation of the procuring body, in this case the local council.  We have heard quite extensively from Mr Bryce about fraud, but, on those other two risks, are councils sufficiently adept at managing risk, picking up the point made by Mrs
default&#xa0;
defaultGlindon
default about whether they have the skills to manage it?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: In some cases, the councils we spoke to that have developed collaborative arrangements with suppliers, for example Solihull, have brought other councils into those arrangements so they can take advantage of the savings.  Not just Solihull but others in that report are very alive to the idea 
defaultof supply fai
defaultlure.  
defaultThere have been some very high-profile failures, not least in social care, so an organisation like Trafford will, as part of its
default annual market management
default,
default have extensi
defaultve dialogue with 
defaultcouncils.  That produces some benefits to them when they come to the vexed question about whether the supplier
default 
defaultcan share their 
defaultpain as well a
defaults the gains, hopefully, in good times.  
defaultThey have managed to negotiate 
defaultthat, because they understand their supplier market and the business models of different suppliers.  Councils are increasingly 
defaultalive to the idea that you can ask too much of your suppliers.
defaultQ413 default&#xa0; 
defaultMark defaultPawseydefault:default To take the example you have just given, does pressure on budgets encourage councils to be at greater risk than they might otherwise be in terms of to whom they give a contract?  Are they less diligent or cautious in letting a contract because they are under pressure to deliver at a lower price?
defaultMark defaultWardmandefault: 
defaultI cannot give you a picture of what is going on, but
default that has to be a risk.  One point I wanted to make earlier, which is also relevant to this point and also to fraud, is that w
defaulte have just published a report called 
defaultTough Times
default.  
defaultTh
defaultat shows that councils are broadly managing within their budgets and set managed budgets, but th
defaultey are doing tha
defaultt primarily by making savings.  About half of the savings councils are having to make are by reducing
default staff numbers
default.  
defaultFi
defaultgures from the ONS suggest that since 2009
default councils ha
defaultve shed about 19% of their full-time equivalent headcount.  In that case
default the question is
default: who are they letting go?  In the same way as the old days, if councils contract out their 
defaultse
defaultrvice and technical expertise along with the contract, they find that perhaps they are at a loss when it comes to contract management, change of control or 
defaultre-letting the contract
default.  
defaultThere is an issue here a
defaultbout skills which it is important for councils to address.  They are having to make savings and predominantly they are doing it by letting people go as well as outsourcing contracts.  Those two things together present a risk for them if they are not on top of it.
defaultQ414 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default Mr Bryce has anticipated the line of questioning I was going to pursue on fraud in the very comprehensive and helpful responses we have had so far.  You briefly mentioned whistleblowers.  Would you say that 
defaultwhistleblowing
default is the main source of identification of fraud? What proportion is it?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: I would not have the specific statistics.
defaultQ415 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default Give us a feel for it.
defaultAlan Brycedefault: It is probably the single most common way of identifying procurement fraud.
defaultQ416 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default That poses two obvious questions.  What can we do to make that more likely?  How can we be more supportive of potential whistleblowers to create a more open environment?  What other things should councils be doing to open up other sources of identification of fraud?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: As to 
defaultwhistleblowing
default, this really comes down to a fundamental issue in terms of who is doing the 
defaultwhistleblowing
default.  
defaultAs we have recognised in other areas,
default it is important to ensure that the organisations you deal with and the staff involved, who will be the people who blow the whistle, are aware, in a local government context, of to whom they can blow the whistle, not just in their own organisation but the local authorities concerned.  I know that as part of contract arrangements some consideration is often given to what the 
defaultwhistleblowing
default arrangements of the provider organisation are, but I think we could go a lot further than that.
defaultIn the end, the danger of that approach is ticking a box that virtually everybody will be able to tick—“I have some 
defaultwhistleblowing
default arrangements, or a policy as such.” Any organisation would be able to say that.  What is more important is the extent to which that is embedded; the culture of staff in a private sector organisation, of which care homes are a very good example; and whether those providing the care—this goes further than fraud—would feel confident to blow the whistle to the council rather than their own organisation if they saw something of concern, and there are detrimental aspects to this for them individually.  Strengthening the requirement around that and putting greater emphasis on assurance around the 
defaultwhistleblowing
default arrangements in provider organisations would be very helpful.
defaultThis Committee might not have had the chan
defaultce to consider it yet, but the leading 
defaultwhistleblowing
default charity, Public Concern at Work, published its 
defaultWhistleblowing
default Commission report last week.  T
defaulthey make a number 
defaultof very helpful recommendations that address that specific point, which is wider than just fraud, and include a 
defaultcode of practic
defaulte.  That is something 
defaultprivat
defaulte bodies might want to consider in the future.
defaultKeith Davisdefault: That 
defaultechoes wh
defaultat we said about 
defaultwhistleblowing
default in our report a couple of weeks ago.  We framed it in terms of public sector procuring authorities seeing it very much as part of the dialogue they are having with contractors, saying to them, “If you want to 
defaultdo business with us, we want to see your 
defaultwhistleblowing
default policy; we want to
default understand how that works in practice; we want you to convince us that there is a
default culture within the organisation where 
defaultwhistl
defaulteblowing
default is not trampled down
default and is genuinely encouraged.
default”  
defaultWe would look almost for third-party reviews of 
defaultwhistleblowing
default policies to give public sector customers 
defaultextra confide
defaultnce in these contractors.  I agree with everything Alan said.  
defaultW
defaulthistleblowing
default is absolutely crucial
default to combating fraud.
defaultQ417 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultHeyesdefault:default There is perhaps an irony in this.  If you depend so heavily on 
defaultwhistleblowing
default to identify fraud, you almost depend on the fraud taking place for the 
defaultwhistleblowing
default to be effective.  What 
defaultother things should be happening to nip the fraud in the bud before we become so dependent on whistleblowers?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: There are other very effective
default techniques
default to identify fraud.  I go back to my earlier response.  Probably the 
defaultone consideration we really should be 
defaultgiving thought to is around deterrence.  
defaultThere is relatively little
default deterrence from the perspective of fraud currently in the system, by which I mean that to have effective deterrence you must have a
default reasonable capaci
defaultty to identify and detect fraud initially;
default and
default, more importantly, there should be an investigator who would be able to investigate this and the local authority
default would take action appropriately, including
default potentially criminal sanction.
defaultLooking at the data we have right now on detection, if an organisation really wanted and was encouraged to attempt some form of procurement fraud, currently
default th
defaultere is a very good chance that they would not be identified.  One gets back to the point made earlier in the Committee.  How do we start to address the capacity and
default capability
default to investigate this?
default 
default Most important
default of all
default, if you are to have deterrence there must be a change of mindset.  
defaultAs the public sector, we should be 
defaultshouting f
defaultrom the rooftops every time we find a procurement fraud and celebrate that fact, because the only thing that aids fraudsters if we all
default keep quiet abou
defaultt it.  There is a cultural aspect here, and, to get to the h
defaulteart of your question
default, tackling fraud culture and the way we talk about the issue would be a 
defaultvery significant step forward.
defaultQ418 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Mr Bryce, you made a point about the resistance of service providers to co-operate in this.  H
defaultow can we ensure that more pressure is put on
default them
default to do so?
default  Should things be written into contracts to ensure that service providers do thoroughly co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperate?  Indeed, when somebody 
defaultwhistleblows
default in a private sector organisation should there be a requirement to release that information automatically to the public sector body that is paying for the service
default?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: I have not given consideration to the legal requirement to 
defaultwhistleblow
default.  The 
defaultappr
defaultoach we have always taken is to encourage a strong culture.  Consideration could be given to that aspect, and i
defaultt is such an im
defaultportant source of information.  On
default the principal issue you asked me about, which is the
default contractual side, if you really want to investigate these matters and tackle it across the sector
default all local authorities
default should be looking for their investigators to have access to the necessary financial information that these provider companies have.
defaultQ419 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default That would be written into the contract to make it absolutely clear from the beginning.
defaultAlan Brycedefault: That would certainly
default be the most effective way.  What I am hearing from the sector is that that is variable.  Some local authorities do require that; others do not, and that lack of consistency means that the local government sector as a whole is finding it more difficult to tackle this type of fraud.
defaultQ420 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Would you like to think about the “
defaultwhistleblowing
default” point and whether something could be written in, and perhaps come back to us on that?
defaultAlan Brycedefault: Indeed.
defaultChair:default Thank you all very much for coming and giving evidence to us.
