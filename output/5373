defaultWritten evidence submitted bydefault the CLAdefault&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefaultThe 
defaultCLA
default represents over 33,000 members in England and Wales. Our members both live and work within rural areas; they operate a wide range of businesses including residential, agricultural, tourism and commercial ventures – at the last count the CLA represents some 250 different types of rural businesses. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have been looking after the interests of our members, as well as promoting the positive aspects of land ownership, land management and rural business activities for the past 100 years. CLA members own or manage approximately half the rural land in England and Wales including edge of settlement locations and some urban portfolios. The quality of the countryside, and its natural resources, is of vital importance to our members. Most objectives for the countryside - economic, social and environmental - rely on landowners and managers for their success.
default&#xa0;
defaultCLA has a long-standing interest in the prevention and containment of Invasive and Alien Species (IAS), in particular the grey squirrel, Muntjac deer, Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam, pennywort, signal crayfish and Asian long-horned beetle, as these cause a significant amount of damage to woodlands and waterways. Other impacts of IAS include loss of crops, damaged buildings and loss of ecosystem services. The land manager bears the cost of tackling IAS.  While effective prevention can avoid entry of IAS in the first place, we should not lose sight of the importance of the containment of IAS already in the UK. With the significant cost of control and eradication set to rise further, such activity is regarded as a priority for land managers.  Funding needs to be provided to ensure work is affordable for land managers, and that the programme of containment and eradication is of sufficient quality.

defaultQuestion 1default:default defaultThe proposed size of the list of species of concerndefaultThere are approximately 1500 known i
defaultnvasive alien species (IAS)
default within the EU. CLA is concerned by the proposed cap of 50 species of EU concern, which would cap the number of priority species to the top 3% of the list. Each member state will draw up their own list of 50 top IAS concerns from which the EU will put together an EU level list of 50 top IAS concerns. We assume that funding will be available to address the EU top 50 IAS list. The proposal for a five year review, and possible extension of this list, while welcome, may not be soon enough to help combat the entry of IAS in the meantime.  Emergency measures, including bans, can be implemented by Members States on the basis of preliminary scientific evidence; however, if this concerns a newly identified, rather than a known IAS, this could prove challenging. 
defaultAccording to the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat (NNSS), there are 2,000 IAS established in Britain, with 10 new species established a year, almost half (48%) of which come from Europe. Under Article 10, Member States are able to ban the intentional release of IAS, on top of the IAS of EU concern, based on scientific evidence. This means that action must be adequately resourced and relevant at a national level. The Commission proposes that Member States risk assess invasive species in their countries, with the results being used to draw up a list of species of ‘union concern’. The CLA are concerned that due to the isolation of the UK and resulting differentiation in habitats and species, that a Union list collated from all Member States will not adequately represent the UK, for example, grey 
defaultsquirrels. Consequently, this may result in less financial support for the IAS of UK concern, and therefore inefficient action. 
defaultCLA strongly recommends 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultEU institutions duly consult all stakeholders when it comes to the adoption of the list of Invasive Alien Species of 
defaultEU 
defaultConcern, as this is as much a biodiversity issue as it is economic and social.
defaultQuestion 2: defaultThe criteria that should be used to identify the species of most concern, including the weightings to be given to biodiversity, human health and economic considerations and the ‘precautionary principle’defaulta) b) and c) of paragraph 2 of article 4 of 
defaultCOM(2013) 620 final
default (repeated below) are all sensible, given the aim of the directive. 
defaultInvasive alien species shall only be included on the list referred to in paragraph 1, if they meet all of the following criteria:
default(a)  
default 
defaultthey are, having regard to scientific evidence available, found to be alien to the territory of the Union excluding the outermost regions;
default(b)  
default              
defaultthey are, having regard to scientific evidence available, found to be capable of
default 
defaultestablishing a viable population and spreading in the environment under current or foreseeable climate change conditions anywhere in the Union excluding the outermost regions;
default(c)  
default              
defaultit is demonstrated by a risk assessment performed pursuant to Article 5(1) that action at Union level is required to prevent their establishment and spread.
defaultHowever, we again note that the Union list may not adequately support the invasive species framework in the UK. 
defaultWe agree European Union level emergency measures would help to equip the EU with a mechanism to act swiftly, in case of imminent danger of entry, in accordance with the precautionary principle. 
defaultIAS policy and regulation is aligned with policy and regulation for plant and animal pests and diseases, as some plant and animal pests will also be IAS. The criteria and weightings for IAS in the UK should be the same as those already adopted, and agreed with stakeholders for the UK plant health risk register.
defaultThe IAS risk register should then become the tool that underpins and prompts action. It must include species currently not present in the EU, but which have the potential to be invasive if introduced. This is vital if the policy’s emphasis on prevention is to be credible.
defaultThe risk register must be an easily accessible, publically available document. It must be a living document, able to be updated as new threats or potential threats become apparent.  
defaultQuestion 3default:default defaultThe balance between the different strands of the response to invasive species: detection, prevention, containment/adaptation or eradicationdefaultThere should be a balance between prevention and containment. 
defaultContainment is important, not least to bring spiralling costs under control. Whilst it is reasonable to put more effort and resources into the prevention of further IAS into the EU, the €12 billion a year costs of damage relates to IAS already present. Effort and resources must be allocated to managing or controlling those IAS already present to reduce their impact; in the UK there is a real issue about control of grey squirrels. These enormous costs 
defaultare a consequence of the failure to take action in the past. For species where the impact costs will continue to rise, effective action should be undertaken
default 
defaultnow. 
defaultIn 2010, the CABI report on 
defaultThe Economic Cost of Invasive Non-Native Species on Great 
defaultBritain
default 
defaultestimated
default the annual cost of IAS to the British economy was £1.7 billion. The report also revealed an exponential increase in the cost of control as an invasion progresses, and demonstrated the benefits of intervention at an early stage, as well as the long term cost savings if eradication is undertaken early in the invasion process.  The GB NNSS has since quantified the cost (damage and control) to the UK economy at £2.1 billion a year, with the UK Government supporting the management of about 25 species.
defaultPrevention is internationally recognised as the most effective way
default 
defaultof avoiding the IAS problem. Measures focusing on prevention need to be accompanied by an
default 
defaulteffective early warning system to take prompt action on species eluding the prevention
default measures  
defaultMoreover
default,
default it is difficult to predict which non-nati
defaultve species will become invasive;
default it can take decades. Japanese Knotweed was introdu
defaultced to the UK as a garden plant;
default it now costs more that £150 m
defaultillion
default a year to remove.
defaultDetection seems a lower order priority than prevention and containment, as does eradication.  With some 1500 known IAS in the EU, detection appears to be happening.  
defaultThe finances for responding to IAS should be re-examined. It is difficult to see that a policy that is implementing stronger control measures and regulations will not have a greater additional financial burden than the Commission proposal of €26-40 million a year, on top of the existing annual cost of €1.4 billion. Given the increasing number of IAS entering the EU, the cost of damage can only rise; thus there must be an argument for greater investment in control measures.
defaultMember States lack the necessary means
default to implement the recommendations 
default, which could place undue burdens on land managers
default. This suggests that greater discussion is required about how the various control measures are to be financed.
default 
defaultGiven that action in one Member State is for the benefit of all Member States, there must be a case for actions to be funded from a central/ EU pot.
defaultIn conclusion, once the financial resource required has been thoroughly assessed, it will be clearer where the finances will be best spent. Prevention is better than a cure
default,
default and there is valuable work to be done to eventually reduce t
defaulthe amount of resource spent on IAS. 
defaultHowever
default,
default those already causing harm do so at a huge cost to the economy
default,
default as outlined above. 
defaultThrough the UK framework, progress has already been made on all stages of action outlined 
defaultbelow:
defaultQuestion 4: defaultThe relative pros and cons of the Commission’s approach of a list of harmful species to tackle, rather than a list of safe species which would not be restricteddefaultThe first priority should be to develop a system based on a list of IAS of EU concern with legal obligations regulating the import, keeping, sale, purchase and exchange of high risk IAS. This work could then be supplemented with a list of low risk/ safe IAS that could be released into the environment.  Any IAS not on this low risk/ safe list would not be approved for release. While  high risk/ ‘black lists’ are quite common in EU animal and plant health regimes, they would not pick up on IAS such as Japanese knotweed, which no one anticipated would be a problem; low risk lists involve additional bureaucracy and may conflict with World Trade Organisation measures to facilitate free trade.
defaultThe focus must be on which species are harmful; this will help facilitate a consistent, coordinated and cross border approach to stopping IAS entering the EU in the first place. It would also enable the pooling of knowledge and resources. Rather than designing a new method of classifying priorities, government should focus on the work that has already taken place in England (as set out in our response to Question 3) and build on it. 
defaultQuestion 5default:default defaultAny conflicts between the need to tackle invasive species and other environmental obligationsdefaultAfter habitat loss, IAS are recognised as the next most important driver of biodiversity loss. IAS
default are responsible for damage to biodiversity, ecosystem services, economies and human well-being. It is estimated that the damage caused by IAS in the EU is more than 
default€
default12 billion 
defaulta year
default. 
defaultIn the UK alone, IASs threaten red squirrels, Tansy beetles
default,
default water voles and a variety of tree species.
defaultThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 calls for: “
defaultBy 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment
default”. The EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 incorporated this objective in Target 5.     
defaultT
defaulthe problem of IAS is not limited to
default 
defaultEurope, but found throughout the world. Unlike some of its trading partners, the European
default 
defaultUnion currently lacks a comprehensive framework to address the threats posed by IAS
default. 
defaultFew IAS are
default 
defaultaddressed by EU legislation.
default The CLA
default 
defaultw
defaultould be supportive
default of 
defaulta coordinated international framework 
defaultto tackle IAS 
defaultthat is effective at EU and national levels.
default 
defaultDisease agents and pests of animals and plants and their products
default 
defaultare covered respectively by the animal health regime (various regulations and directives) and
default 
defaultby the plant health regime (2000/29/EC). The Wildlife Trade Regulation (338/97) restricts
default 
defaultimports of endangered species, including imports of seven IAS. The Regulation on the use of
default 
defaultalien and locally absent species in aquaculture (708/2007) addresses the release of alien
default 
defaultspecies for aquaculture purposes. The regulations on plant
default protection products (1107/2009) 
defaultand on biocides (528/2012) address the intentional release of micro-organisms as plant
default 
defaultprotection products or biocide respectively. Finally, the Birds Directive (2009/147/EC) and
default 
defaultthe Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and the
default 
defaultMarine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) require the restoration of ecological
default 
defaultconditions and refer to the need to take IAS into consideration. Nevertheless, existing 
defaultEU 
defaultaction leaves most IAS unaddressed.
defaultThe benefits of working at an EU level include learning from actions and effective measures taken in other countries for species which may have only recently become an issue nationally. We do, however, feel that any ‘top 50’ list drawn up at EU level will not adequately represent our situation, due to the difference in habitat type and species found. Therefore, the CLA believe that each Member State should be given the opportunity to target their top invasive species, in order to ensure that support is evenly spread.
defaultGiven the level of damage caused by invasive species, it is difficult to see any significant environmental conflicts with other environmental obligations. That said the main conflict 
defaultbetween the need to tackle invasive species and other environmental obligations
default is likely to be over the allocation of finite funds to address different environmental priorities.  
defaultThere may be a suggestion that we should take a different approach to species that are currently rare or endangered in their native range. For example, in the UK, the population of Chinese water deer is small but expanding, and has the potential to become invasive. Current management strategy is influenced by the fact that it is rare in its native range. It is questionable whether this is the correct response to that situation.
defaultIt is important that obstacles are not put in the way of efforts to manage IAS. The inability of a landowner to identify IAS should not result in direct penalty. Individuals concerned are likely to need a high degree of knowledge, and in all likelihood a non-native invasive species will be unfamiliar to a significant proportion of the population; as such it would be unreasonable to impose an obligation dependent on them being able to identify IAS. An objective should be included to not add further red tape to the agricultural industry. An illustrative example of a flawed process is that surrounding the licensing of Warfarin, the most effective control measure for grey squirrel (sciurus carolinensis) in the UK. It will be illegal to use Warfarin for this purpose from April 2014, due to the exorbitant cost or re-registering the product for such use. This is a classic case of unintended consequences of EU regulation that must be reversed.
defaultQuestion 6: defaultWhat the UK’s strategy should be and where, if at all, the UK should diverge from, or go further than, the proposed EU approachdefaultThe UK is an island and in some instances, at least theoretically, this offers the potential to put measures in place to build a stronger defence against the incursion or export of some IAS. This difference between ourselves and other Member States that share a land border, which is much harder to defend, should be recognised and taken into consideration when considering both EU wide and UK specific measures.
defaultAs set out in our response to Question 1, the CLA believes the UK will be put at a disadvantage if considered with Europe, and that Member States should highlight their own threats for support. The UK’s last non-native species framework was produced in 2008 and is due a revision in 2014.
defaultThe CLA is 
defaultanxious
default that the UK’s strategy should not impose more red tape on the agricultural industry. It is 
defaultt
defaulto
defaulto often expedient to
default try and impose further rules through agricultural policy, which would result in penalty if an invasive species was not under active management for removal. However, due to their very nature, such programmes will require high inputs of time and financial resource and any strategy must work to provide support
default,
default as opposed to regulation.
defaultQuestion 7default:default defaultThe need for specific measures for promoting sustainable domestic production of plants, vegetables and animals in the UK which minimises the risk of importing invasive non-native speciesdefaultThis is an area that demonstrates the requirement for this policy to align with plant and animal health policies.  It is an attractive initial proposition, and a measure that is being considered and promoted to try and reduce the threat from plant pests and diseases. It also has potential economic benefits for some UK businesses, but may have cost implications or others.
defaultIt is questionable whether it will be legal to introduce measures that exclude products from outside the UK, specifically for the purpose of promoting domestic production, but could well be beneficial to other measures that encourage more domestic production.
default 
defaultSpecific measures to minimise the risk of importing invasive non-native species will have to be addressed with reference to any free trade legislation.
defaultIt will only have relevance to the production of plants and animals or products, where there is a real possibility of IAS being inadvertently imported along with those plants, animals or products, and
default 
defaultwhere those products that are acting as potential vectors to the importation of IAS can be grown or produced in the UK.
defaultQuestion 8: defaultThe case for any change in the law regarding invasive speciesdefaultExisting regulations appear to have been inadequate to prevent the incursion, and spread of many very serious IAS. This suggests there is a need for a strengthening of both EU and UK regulation in this area.  
defaultThe CLA believes it is necessary to be able to react rapidly to any new development
default 
defaultregarding IAS; there should therefore be a mechanism allowing for the emergency listing of IAS, with the emergency listing being of limited duration, i.e. a year. This should allow sufficient time for the IAS to move from emergency listing to normal listing, having gone through the appropriate procedure.
defaultThere are good reasons why the keeping of any IAS (whether categorised as high or low risk) may be permitted, e.g. they may be used in research or in a zoo.  However, the risk posed by different activities and the specific IAS themselves will vary considerably.  CLA thus supports the use of licences for activity for IAS.
defaultQuestion 9default:default defaultAny lessons for England and Wales from the experience of Scotland’s invasive species legislation and controlsdefaultCLA supports, in principle, that the power to make species control orders on the same model as under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011 should be adopted in England and Wales. However, we would need to see an appropriate system of checks and balances in place to protect the landowners’ interests.
defaultWe also believe it is useful to review Scottish experience of releasing IAS within their natural range and see what can be learned for the wider UK and the EU.
