defaultIntroduction
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultpdefaulttegdefault represents the six Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) which between them serve more than eleven million people in Tyne and Wear, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and the West Midlands. Leicester and Nottingham City Counci
defaultls, 
defaultBristol and the West of England, 
defaultTransport for London and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport are associate members, though this response does not represent their views
default.
default2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe rationaledefault is that making decisions locally about local transport 
default(national transport networks and policy sh
defaultould remain the job of national government) 
defaultwill be more effective than taking decisions by remote control from Whitehall
default,
default which lacks the local knowledge or the direct accountability for those decisions. The evidence that a devolved approach to local deci
defaultsion-making on transport is more effective is all around us. Transport in London has been transformed since powers over London's transport network were transferred from Whitehall to the Mayorality, with significant investment in giving London one of the be
defaultst bus services in the world, Oyster ticketing, overhaul of the London Underground, transformation of mainline terminals, the creation of the London Overground, and significant investment in cycling. Other real world examples of the benefits of devolution 
defaultinclude the transformation of the performance and passenger satisfaction levels on the Merseyrail Electrics rail network since control was transferred from DfT to Mers
defaulteytravel (Merseyside PTE) in 2003
default, and the significantly higher levels of investment in S
defaultcotland's rail network (including new trains, line re-openings and electrification) since responsibility for Scotrail was transferred to the Scottish Executive. 
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese transformations have occurred because devolved authorit
defaulties consistently give 
defaultlocal trans
defaultport investment more priority than was the case with national government because locally accountable politicians see how important transport is to achieving wider economic, environmental and social goals.
default They are also held directly accountable to local el
defaultectorates for the quality and performance of local transport.
default 
defaultThe positive experience of devolution is not restricted to the UK. Elsewhere in Europe cities and regions have far more influence over their local transport networks in terms of planning, managi
defaultng, developing and running those networks than is the case in England outside London. The ability of French Mayors to stand on a mandate of delivering a tram in their first five year term is one example of why so many more cities in France are benefitting 
defaultfrom modern urban transit systems than is the case in Britain.
default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe
default do not see any over-riding 
defaultdisadvantagesdefault in moving arrangements in England to the next stage of
default devolution, especially given that city regions and LEP areas 
defaultin some cases represent economies
default larger than Wales or Northern Ireland. 
defaultOne of t
defaulthe key risks asso
defaultciated with this change that is most frequently cited is 
defaultthe willingness of Government to devolve the necessary levels of funding to 
defaultenable effective devolution. L
defaultocal bodies can only achieve
default the opportunities on offer -
default and be expected to bear the responsibili
defaultty for performance and outcomes -
default if funds are matched to powers. We believe that Government understands this in principle, through the advice it has received from Lord Heseltine in part
defaulticular. However, the level of funding that will be made available through 
defaultmechanisms such as the Local 
defaultG
defaultrowth 
defaultF
defaultund
default is only a small proportion of that suggested in the Heseltine Review, and the Committee is encouraged to explore how this may be accelerated 
defaultto maximise the future impact of devolution. 
default2.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of other models
default,
default there is devolution or centralisation and various points between the two - there are no 
defaultalternative modelsdefault to being somewhere on the scale between the two.
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResponsibilities for local tran
defaultsport planning are complicated, and getting more complex, 
defaultin England outside London 
default(
defaultwhich is one reason why we produced a short and concise guide 
defaultto how transport works outside London
default)
default. 
default 
defaultHowever
default in the six largest urban conurbations outside London (Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear and West Midlands) for many years there have been Passenger Transport Executives
default.
default 
defaultThese bodies have been respons
defaultible to Integrated Transport Authorities (and predecessor and successor bodies) made
default up
default of elected representatives. Their areas
default provide a generally good match with journey to work patterns
default,
default and the economic footprints of these conurbat
defaultions
default,
default which between t
defaulthem serve eleven
default million people. 
default2.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernance is changing in the city regions with most areas adopting the Co
defaultmbined Authority model to which
default PTEs will become either part of, or responsible to (the arrangements will vary in different areas). However, the pri
defaultnciple holds that the strategic planning and oversight of transport in complex conurbations is best done at the city region level. PTEs (for simplicity we will describe PTEs and any successor bodies as PTEs) have the 
defaultscale and capacity to assess and prioridefaulttise local transport schemes in a way that meets clear criteria as well as democratic oversightdefault. A recent report for 
defaultptegdefault by JMP sets out how this is done in more detail
default.
default2.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultoptimum bodydefault depends on local circumstances (especially given the complex politi
defaultcal, economic and transport geography of England outside London) however for strategic 
defaulttransport decisions 
default(though not necessarily for all local transport decisions) it should be a reasonable fit with journey to work patterns and with functional local 
defaulteconomies. It should have adequate capacity to be able to carry out its planning and oversight functions in an efficient and professional way and it should also have a clear element of democratic oversight. We believe that for the city regions
default,
default in the evol
defaultving role of the PTEs, these criteria have
default,
default and will be
default,
default met. 
default2.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are challenges in two key areas. 
defaultFirstly, 
defaultPTEs lack sufficient powers and influence over the main forms of public transpo
defaultrt. Secondly,
default 
defaultas with the rest of local government
default,
default resource spend
defaulting is being squeezed to such an extent that the capacity to plan and deliver capital schemes is being compromised. 
default2.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the former there
default is a need for responsibilities 
defaultfor local rail networks to be devolved (as has already happened successfully in Scotland
default, on Merseyrail Electrics and on London Overground). 
defaultBus services (the main form of public transport outside London and the South East) are deregulated outside London which means that PTEs can only provide services where commercial services have not been p
defaultrovided. PTEs (and local government elsewhere outside London) have t
defaultherefore very limited control over
default fares and service levels. There are powers in the Local Transport Act 2008 which strengthen the role of PTEs in a deregulated environment (and which are 
defaultbeing deployed)
default,
default and also powers to introduce the franchising of bus services (the same system that is used to provide bus services in London) whic
defaulth Nexus (Tyne and Wear PTE) has
default triggered. Having limited abilities to plan public transport sets the PTEs ap
defaultart from TfL and counterparts for European cities. 
default2.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, this could be changed if national government worked with the city regions in partnership and in a consistent way over a concerted period to devolve and enhance the powers that PTEs have o
defaultver publ
defaultic transport and 
defaultto crack the obstacles that stand in the way of providing integrated public transport for the city regions. 
default2.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn one area the DfT is doing thi
defaults - through a joint programme of
default work on smart and integrated ticketing which is focussed primaril
defaulty on the six PTE areas and three next largest urban areas (Bristol, Nottingham and Leicester). However this approach is not r
defaulteplicated for bus and rail where the DfT
default still 
defaulttend
defaults to operate in silos and is
default reluctant to either properly 'let go' of local publ
defaultic transport provision or to move beyond a 
default‘
defaultone size fits all
default’
default approach to devolution
default 
defaultrather than 
defaultmove towards 
defaultadopt
defaulting
default different approaches which reflect the varied economic geography of England outside London and the capabilities and aspirations of the l
defaultocal transport authorities that serve it.
default 
default2.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs set out above
default,
default one of the obstacles to devolution of transport decision maki
defaultng in England outside London is its complex economic and social geography. The best way of dealing with cross boundary schemes
default,
default or schemes with major
default cross-boundary
default impact
defaults,
default is therefore to some extent determined by local circumstances
default,
default however there are some factors to consider. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultdifferent types of transport decisions may be best devolved to different tiers of sub-national governance. So for example decisions on local roads may be best dealt with at a relatively low level tier of local 
defaultgovernment. Other decisions - for example in a city region - on local public transport netw
defaultorks are best dealt with at the city region
default level. However
default,
default there are other issues that may best be dealt with at a higher tier - such as is proposed on a devolved N
defaultorthern Rail service. The principle is to devolve where possible to the most appropriate level of governance for the nature of the decision to be taken. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultwhatever arrangements are made for decision-making ther
defaulte
default will always 
defaultbe boundary issues 
defaultas boundaries 
defaulthave to be drawn somewhere and there will still be journeys made across those boundaries. Although these boundary issues cannot be eliminated
default,
default they can be minimised if sensible and rational decisions 
defaultare taken 
defaultabout devolving the right decisions to the rig
defaultht level of governance
default. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultif relatively low levels of local transport funding are devolved to small units of local government then there is a danger that no single area will have sufficient funding to build more expensive and significant schemes (where 
defaultthey
default are justified). This 
defaultcomes back to devolving to the appropriate tier of governance. Again the PTEs are an example of t
defaulthis as they are able to pool and prioritise expenditure across a meaningful area.
default2.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the city regions
default,
default the emerging model is for Combined Authorities (or District Leader-led bodies with similar characteristics) to determine the overall transport strategy; for them to del
defaultegate more detailed oversight and po
defaultlicy development to successor 
defaultbodies o
defaultf
default the Integrated Transport Authorities
default (made up of elected members)
default; and for 
defaultstaff at the 
defaultPTEs (or successor bodies) to implement these policies and deliver improvements on the groun
defaultd. This 
defaultemerging model 
defaultbuilds on the strengths of the existing model whilst providing strong
defaulter and more cohesive leadership at the top.
default 
default2.14.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe PTEs work effectively together through the 
defaultptegdefault network to 
defaultshare good practice, co-procure and make a collective ca
defaultse for better transport for their areas. By doing things once
default,
default rather than six times
default,
default the savings for each PTE are considerable. 
defaultptegdefault is also now a wider professional network which brings
default together 
defaultNott
defaulti
defaultngham, Leicester, Bristol and the West of England, Strathclyde and London. In terms of working with national government there is a good level of constructive contact between individual PTEs / 
defaultptegdefault and the
default DfT but
default:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultprogress on devolution is fitful, slow and
default when it does come usually has many strings attached. This is true of both t
defaulthis
default,
default and the previous Government
default;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthere is still too much of a silo approach within DfT (on 
defaultbus and rail in particular) 
defaultwhich means the benefits of an integrated approach to the de
defaultvolution of local transport provision is not realised
default;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe significant cross-sectoral benefits of investment in transport are not sufficiently recognised. 
defaultFor example buses get the workless to work, young people into education and training, older and disab
defaultled pe
defaultople out of isolation (with 
defaultlong term health impacts), patients to ho
defaultspital appointments and provide
default links to new gr
defaultowth-promoting developments.
default Yet these hard benefits to othe
defaultr Government departments 
defaultare
default not properly recogn
defaultised by those departments 
defaultand are
default not reflected in the way that buses are funded (indeed funding is in decline). Although there has been some progress made recently on cross-departmental work (for example the £1m
defaultillion Department of Health contribution to national government’s cycl
defaulte ambition grants
default) there is a very long way to go. 
default2.15.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of national agencies
default,
default there is good contact with key national bodies and agencies (like Network Rail, the Rail Delivery Group, Senior Traffic Commissioner) but again these bodies
default,
default perhaps unsurpr
defaultisingly
default,
default are strongly focussed on the dynamics of their own industries and become somewhat producer-led as a result. The benefits that devolution can bring in terms of ensuring these industries deliver the best outcomes on local transport can become an aft
defaulterthought as a result. 
default2.16.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultptegdefault has been concerned that local transport spending outsi
defaultde London has fared poorly when compared with the three other major areas of DfT funding (London, National Rail and National Roads). Indeed in the 2010 Spending Review capital spend on local transport was the biggest loser of the four categories of spendin
defaultg
default with, for example, the main form of funding for local small to medium transport capital investment (the Integrated Transport Block) halved
default. 
default 
defaultFollowing concerted work by 
defaultptegdefault to improve and articulate the evidence b
defaultase
default,
default 
defaultlocal transport spending outside 
defaultLondon did much bet
defaultter in the 2013 Spending Review
default.  
default2.17.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultH
defaultowever the DfT 
default(relative to other Government departments) 
defaulthas contributed a disproportionate amount of this 
defaultenhanced funding to the
default Local Growth Fund
default. We do not therefore currently know how much of Df
defaultT
default's local transport capital budget wil
defaultl be spent on local transport because we do not know what the Local Growth Fund bids will be made up of, or the criteria for bidding. 
defaultPlus given DfT made the largest contribution to the pot all other things being equal
default it’s unlikely that the relatively modest contributions from other Government departments will go to transport measures - more likely it will be the other way round. 
default2.18.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResource spending is 
defaultalso 
defaulta major concern. For transport in the PTE areas the vast 
defaultmajority of our resource budget (not including ring fenced rail funding
default from DfT
default) comes from constituent Districts, whose funding in turn comes from the CLG. The CLG cuts are also most severe in the areas we serve.
default 
defaultFalling resource funding will have a maj
defaultor 
defaultimpact in particular on a) bus service provision
default and b) the ability of local transport authorities to bid for, and deliver, capital schemes. We are already aware of cases where local transport authorities are not bidding for DfT capital funding competi
defaulttions due to no longer having the officers to do the work.
default2.19.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe also note that there remains a substantial funding gap with London with HMT figures showing that the total public spend per head on transport in London is 2.3 times greater than the spend per he
defaultad for the North of England 
defaultand 
defaultthe West Midlands combined
default. 
default2.20.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe further note that the Core Cities recent growth prospectus called for a dedicated funding stream for transport
default.
default 
defaultGiven the scale of CLG resource 
defaultfunding reductions, the current disparate capi
defaulttal DfT funding streams, and the disproportionate contribution of DfT local transport funding to the Local Growth Fund, 
defaultthe case for a dedicated 
defaulttransport funding stream is something the Committee may wish to consider.
default Especially if such 
defaultfunding could give
default a 
defaultdegree of medium to long term certainty - given the timescales for delivering transport capital programmes or achieving behaviour change (such as increasing cycling)
default.
default2.21.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe deal with the impact of the Growth Fund in our response to Q
default5 above. Local Transport Bodies 
defaultare one part of what is a complex environment for decision-making on local transport in the Metropolitan are
defaultas. Players include DfT, Highways Agency, the rail industry (in all its many post-privatisation manifestations), bus 
defaultoperators, local transport bodies
default, one or more mayors, PTEs, ITAs, Combined Authorities, one or more LEPs, District
default counc
defaultils.
default 
defaultIn our areas 
defaultit is the Combined Authority (and leader body with some similar characteristics in the West Midlands) that is the most significant development and will subsume the role
default of the Local Transport Bodies
default. The CA is significant on transport because unlike some o
defaultf the other new enti
defaultties (like Local Transport Bodie
defaults) it has democratic accountability, legal status, resources (via its constituent Districts and PTEs), 
defaultand 
defaultis a good fit with the way economies and transport networks work in the city regions. 
default2.22.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is scope to realise both private and alternative
default funding streams
default,
default and indeed it is devolution that will make this more likely to happen because local decision-makers are better placed than Whitehall to identify potential private sector partners as well as any new local funding streams that have a chance
default of being politically and electorally viable given local circumstances. Examples include the workplace parki
defaultng levy in Nottingham 
defaultand the Transport Funds in Greater Manchester and West York
defaultshire. 
default2.23.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, we note with concern that having made the West Yor
defaultkshire Transp
defaultort Fund a centrepiece of the Leeds City Region City Deal, 
defaultthe CLG then went onto jeopardise the Fund through its proposals 
defaultto include the council tax levy for the Fund within the wider 2% increase on council tax which would trigger a referend
defaultum. A levy increase is
default a key element of the West Yorkshire Transport Fund and the possibility of a refer
defaultenda defeat effectively undermines
default what the Government had previously lauded. 
default2.24.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main way in which the Government could enhance the potential 
defaultfor 
defaultreal
defaultising new funding streams for local t
defaultransport is to 
defaultrecognise the major challenges there are in raising new funding (particularly if it involves new forms of local taxation to pay for transport) and thus seek to maximise the funding freedoms available, so 
defaultthat local government has a fighting chance of finding the particular form of funding that will work in their areas given local circumstances and politics. 
default2.25.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCu
defaultrrently PTE decision
default-making is highly accountable. 
defaultIt is a
defaultccountable 
defaultto ITAs (made of representatives of District Councils) and their successor bodies, and to current and emerging city region governance entities (most notably the Combined Authorities). The
default DfT also holds PTEs 
defaultto account through its assessment and evaluation requirements and processes for capital spending funding streams.
default 
defaultWe would argue that at present the DfT's organisational and technocratic hold over local transport decision-making in Eng
defaultland outside London is over-riding the accountability of local transport decision making to the local electorate to too great a degree. 
default2.26.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWinston Churchill 
defaultsaid that democracy is the 
defaultworst 
defaultform of government
default,
default other than all the others that have been tried
default, 
defaultand of course, as the least
default-
defaultworst system decisions are sometimes made that might be questi
defaultonable.
default But the overall record of the benefits of putting greater faith in local democratic accountability, over remote
default and technocratic
default control from the central stat
defaulte
default,
default is very strong as is demonstrated by
default:
default 
defaultthe vitality and quality of transport provision in
