[normal]Supplementary [bold]written evidence submitted by [bold]the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [bold](WSC0105)[bold]Q 172-173[bold]:  Could the Government confirm who is responsible for gathering data on gender diversity in STEM? [bold]There is no single body tasked with pulling together all dat
[normal]a
[normal] on gender diversity 
[normal]in STEM
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Diversity within STEM is an issue which is of interest across government with specific areas of responsibility resting with individual departments
[normal] and sponsored bodies
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It should be noted that, unlike for academic subjects, there is not an agr
[normal]eed classification of jobs as STEM or non-STEM.  Some judgement has to necessarily be used in analysing data to build up a picture of the 'STEM workforce', and different classifications can give slightly different results
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As part of the BIS-
[normal]funded STEM diversity programme, the Royal Society 
[normal]is
[normal] carrying out a study 
[normal]of the 
[normal]diversity of the STEM workforce
[normal].  This study draws on data from several sources to build a comprehensive picture. 
[normal] It will outline a new categorisation of the STEM workforce.
[normal]  
[normal]Their report 
[normal]will be published early in 2014 and will help us to understand further where women
[normal],
[normal] and other underrepresented groups, go when they leave STEM education or careers. 
[normal] The Royal Academy of Engineering has also carried out analysis of the engin
[normal]eering workforce 
[normal]as
[normal] part of the STEM diversity programme.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Q 174-176[bold]: Does the Government have any data on where women go when they leave academic STEM research careers?[bold]There is no single source of data for people leaving academic research careers as this
[normal] information would be held by the HEIs individually and would require evidence from exit interviews being collated.
[normal]There is information available on people leaving academic study, and
[normal] 
[normal]the HESA Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) Survey is the most authoritative source of data of where people go on completing first degrees and post graduate degrees.

[normal]Although it is currently unclear where women go once they leave research careers, we do know that once people leave academic careers and take a career break it is difficult for them to return. 
[normal]The Daphne Jackson Trust supports women and men who take career breaks from academic research and then wish to return. This scheme has been shown to be highly effective. To date they have supported 250 fellows (8 of whom were men). 
[normal] 
[normal]7 out of 10 fellows con
[normal]tinue in research for at least 2 years after the end of their fellowship and many continue with research well after this time.  If fellows move out of research after their fellowship they often continue working in a STEM related field, such as teaching or 
[normal]scientific publishing and these are people who were not actively using their STEM qualifications during their career break, so they have been pulled back into the STEM workforce. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q 198-199: Could the Government confirm the timetable for the new teaching [bold]capital fund, including when the competition will be designed (by HEFCE) and when the first awards will be made?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]On 30 September David Willetts
[normal] announced a Spending Review commitment to provide a competitive £200 million STEM capital teaching fund for inv
[normal]estment in Higher Education Institutions.
[normal]  
[normal]This new funding will be allocated to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in the 2015-16 Financial Year, for distribution to institutions during that year. In practice, this means funding will
[normal] begin to flow to successful institutions towards the end of the 2014/15 academic year.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The details of how we want HEFCE to operate this funding pot will be outlined in the annual HEFCE Grant Letter that is due to be published by the middle of January 2
[normal]014. HEFCE will then provide guidance to higher education institutions in 
[normal]S
[normal]pring 2014 on how to bid for the funding available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The broad criteria that we will ask HEFCE to apply when administering this funding are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Q: [bold]We would like a consistent time series showing total government funding for initiatives to increase diversity and equality in the workforce in [bold]STEM in each year of the current and previous spending review period.  Could you please provide us with figures on total government funding in each year from 2008-09 to 2014-15 for initiatives specifically aimed at promoting diversity and equality in STEM [bold]careers funded Government, including those administered or funded by NDPBs such as the national academies and research councils.[bold]In line with the Government’s approach to mainstream equality and diversity
[normal],
[normal] many of our programmes contribute to the aim of in
[normal]creasing the diversity of the STEM workforce.  Table 1 below shows the funding for equality and diversity specific projects.  Table 2 shows funding for our wider programme to stimulate the STEM pipeline and which contributes to the equality and diversity i
[normal]ssue.  The tables include BIS funded programmes and those of some partner bodies including those specifically listed by the Committee.   It should be noted that the National Academies are not NDPBs.  
[normal]They are independent, self-governing bodies
[normal] that receive
[normal] Government funding for specific programmes and projects
[normal].  
[normal]The Higher Education Funding Council for England
[normal] 
[normal](HEFCE) allocates funding to promote widening participation in higher education, some of which supports outreach to students
[normal] from disadvantaged bac
[normal]kgrounds
[normal] who will go on to study STEM subjects.
[normal]The Research Councils support for promoting equality and diversity in STEM careers is embedded within the Vitae® Programme
[normal] and its focus on the implementation of the Concordat to Support the Career Developme
[normal]nt of Researchers.
[normal] 
[normal] Vitae is funded by RCUK and the UK Funding Bodies.
[normal]The Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers sets out a vision of working practices, roles and responsibilities that the signatories believe will further the attractiv
[normal]eness and sustainability of research careers in the UK, and thus ensure the continued provision of well-trained, talented and motivated researchers that is essential to the continuation of our research excellence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 'Every researcher counts'
[normal] 
[normal]resources 
[normal]to improve equality and diversity for research staff within the HE sector was funded by HEFCE with support from
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the other HE funding bodies and is being delivered by Vitae. This project has developed a network of equality and diversity champions; produced 
[normal]resources and case studies for staff developers to embed in training materials for PIs and supervisors and disseminate resources and case studies through national and regional events. The next stages of the project are now also embedded within the Vitae pr
[normal]ogramme
[normal].
