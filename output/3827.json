"Written evidence submitted by Rights Watch UK (JRR 0009) &#xa0;Our Mission: Promoting human rights and holding governments to account, drawing upon the lessons learned from the conflict in Northern Ireland. \n&#xa0;\nOur Expertise and Achievements: Since 1990 we have provided support and services to anyone whose human rights were violated\n as a result of conflict. Our interventions have reflected our range of expertise, from the right to a fair trial to the government’s positive obligation to protect life. We have a long record of working closely with NGOs and government authorities to shar\ne that expertise. And we have received wide recognition, as the first winner of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Prize in 2009 alongside other honours.\nOur Judicial Review Experience: We have substantial experience as a th\nird party intervener in a number of judicial review applications before the courts of England and Wales and Northern Ireland.  We have intervened as both a sole third party intervener and as a co-intervener with other NGOs.  Our interventions have included\n a range of human rights engaged issues including the length of pre-charge detention in terrorist cases\n and\n the certification of trial without jury in Northern Ireland\n.  In addition we intervened in an application engaging minority language rights \nregarding\n the \nreasonable \nexpectation to speak Irish in the courts in Northern Ireland.  We have also intervened in applications before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).  Our most recent co-intervention before the ECtHR was in \nA\nl-Saadoon and Mufdh\ni v UK\n [61498/08] following litiga\ntion before the domestic courts on the issues of the jurisdiction of the European Convention of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.  We are in the process of developing a human rights strategic litigation policy.\nR\nights watch (UK) has responded to both the Consultations of the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial review.  Our submissions to the Joint Committee on Human Rights are limited to the issues arising from the latter Consultation paper “Judicial Review \n(CM\n 8703) encompassing questions of standing and intervention and costs.\n”\n \nStanding and InterventionsWe see\n no \nproblem in a judicial review application \nbeing \nmade\n by a claimant with no direct interest in the matter\n.\n \n In particular\n when the case involves issu\nes encompassing human rights, the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA98)\n,\n which partially incorporates the European \nConvention\n on \nHuman\n Rights 1950 (the Convention)\n,\n and the powers invested in the judiciary to strike down aspects of policy and legislation which are found to be incompatible with the Convention\n. The purpose of \na \njudicial review \nby the judiciary \nis to hold the \ne\nxecutive to account\n in the exercise of its \npower\n \nwhen engaged in \ndecision making\n on the implementation of legislation or policy. \n  \nI\nn\n matters\n relating to the exercise of executive power\n \nwhen human rights are engaged\n, it is in the public interest\n that \nthe exercise of these powers\n,\n which raise \nhuman \nrights based \nchallenges\n,\n can \nbe \nbrought to the attention of the \njudiciary \nfor review \nT\nhe public has an interest in the operation of this process, as well as in th\ne substantive issues concerned specifically when there has been a\nn\n actual or possible\n human ri\nghts violation, an issue of incompatibility \nbetween domestic law and the Convention \nor \nthe possibility of \nderogation\n from an Article of the Convention. \nIn terms of specific problems that would arise from a more restrictive test for standing, we are concer\nned about the impact this would have on \nhuman rights \nNGO\ns in particular and their\n ability to engage in the judicial review process. An NGO \ncan hold an\n important position \nin civil society \nthat bridges the gap between a particular legislative \ninstrument or p\nolicy \nproposal\n,\n and those \ndirectly or potentially \naffected by it. It is \npossible\n that in some situations members of the public would be unaware of particular legislative details that would affect the\nir human rights, a\nnd an NGO plays an important role in re\npresenting \nand assisting individuals and \ngroups to ensure they are not \ndetrimentally affected by any such proposals\n which interfere with their human rights, and by extension the rights held within wider society. \n&#xa0;\nRights Watch (UK) understands \nthat the \npolicy motor driving \nthe proposed \nreforms\n to standing\n \nin judicial review \ninterventions\n is the incorrect assumption put forth in the \nC\nonsultation that “Parliament and the elected Government are best placed to determine what is in the public interest” (\np\narag\nraphs 79-80). We\n consider\n this \n to be\n fundamentally wrong in the context of judicial review \nand human rights\n, specifically\n \nwhen it is \nthe operation of executive\n \npowers \nthat are being scrutinised\n and challenged to remedy or prevent human rights \nviolations\n.\n \n This may be\n directly by the state\n,\n  through \na \nfailure of the state to protect human rights\n,\n or through a failure to comply with the Convention or under the HRA98\n. \nThe present Consultation \nmisunderstands the purpose of judicial review and \nthe need for \npubl\nic scrutiny \nof \nexecutive decision\n-making\n.   This is particularly important when \nhuman rights issues (broadly defined and interpreted) are engaged\n given the primacy of the Convention and its effect under the HRA98\n and the powers of the judiciary to make dec\nlarations of incompatibility. \n \n \n&#xa0;\nA similar concern can be seen in the context of the proposals \nregarding access to \nlegal aid, where the assessment of \nfinancial eligibility \nis \nin \npart based on the prospects of success \n(merits) \nof the case. In our opinion, the mere process of investigating and reviewing \nparticular executive \nactions is essential to \nthe process of \neffective public scrutiny and this is placed in danger if the process is amended \nalong the lines proposed by the govern\nment. \nIt may be that in other areas the \ng\novernment\n’s\n superior expertise would be a convincing argument, but we do not \nconsider\n that it is justified in th\ne\n context\n of what is fundamentally a constitutional challenge\n. The proposed \n restriction \nhas the effect\n of \nreducing scrutiny and\n \naccountability\n on issues of huma\nn rights\n which have possible supranational consequences\n. It would also impact on the powers vested in the judiciary to strike down as incompatible \nlegislation and \npolicy \nwhich offends the Convention\n. \n&#xa0;\nA \nmore \nrestrictive test for standing would place \nboth \nthe effectiveness and \nthe \npotential benefits of judicial review in an even more vulnerable position by limiting those who could challenge to individuals or groups that are\n,\n in the \ng\novernment’s persp\nective\n,\n most \nengaged\n. \n Assuming that \njudicial review \nis\n a \nconstitutional \ntool for accountability\n exercised by the judiciary in relation to the executive\n, the whole of society has an interest in ensuring it is used to its full \nextent and \npotential and a \nmore restrictive test for standing misunderstands\n \nthis. \nOf particular concern is the issue of when a human rights based challenged needs to be made when \nthe effect of \ndomestic policy or legislation is potentially incompatible with the Convention\n.  \nJudicial\n review remains the primary vehicle through which such a human\n rights challenge can be bought and this should be protected. \n&#xa0;\nWe stress\n judicial review in relation to human rights \nis not a campaigning \ntool \nbut \nis an issue of assistance and representation, \ngovernment \naccountability\n and human rights compliance\n. \nFurthermore, it is not clear what issues may arise in the future and a more liberal approach to standing\n,\n such as \nexists presently\n,\n \nallows for such flexibility as issues evolve. \n The presence of an NGO\n adding value to a judicial review application or as claimant asserts the importance of civil society in the litigation system and enables a broader consideration of factors introduced by those with expertise and knowledge to be taken by the judiciary in i\nts consideration of the challenge made in the application. \n&#xa0;\nA more restrictive test for standing not only misunderstands the nature and purpose of judicial review as a constitutional tool, but also may mean in specific cases that there is no \nindividual or\n group \nclaimant to challenge a decision\n in the exercise of power or policy\n when human rights issues are engaged\n. For example, there may be cases where a particular policy has not had a direct effect on an individual yet or the individual is unable to bring\n a challenge.\n \nThe standing of a human rights \nNGO would therefore ensure that these human rights concerns are \nventilated\n before the courts ensuring the executive does not escape its human rights obligations\n or avoid human rights compliance\n. \n&#xa0;\nIn our view, the \ng\novernment has failed to explain why the current test for standing is unsatisfactory. There is no evidence to suggest that the courts misapply the current test in a way that leads to problems asserted by the \ng\novernment such as “to seek pub\nlicity” or “hinder the process of proper decision-making” (\np\naragraphs 79-80)\n (however ‘proper’ decision-making is defined)\n. Therefore\n,\n we do not \nconsider\n that any of the proposed alternatives would be more reasonable. \n \nThe current test for standing allows \nfor flexibility that depends on context and issue whilst at the same time recognising the importance of judicial review in assessing \nthe exercise of executive powers\n specifically when h\numan rights issues are engaged and where human rights compliance is in \nquestion. \n&#xa0;\nCosts and Permission &#xa0;The government has suggested \nthat providers should onl\ny be paid for work carried out in\n an application for judicial review in cases either where permission is granted or where the LAA exercises its discretion to pay the provider in a case where proceedings are issued but the case concludes prior to a permission decision\n.\n \nWe do not agree with\n the above \ngovernment \nproposal. \nSpecifically in relation to human rights challenges through judicial review i\nt would discourage\n public\n lawyers from \nundertaking\n \napplications for judicial review as the financial risk\n,\n if the case does not proceed beyond \nthe \npermission \nstage\n,\n \nwill lie with them\n and permission stage is inevitably challenged by the government through the Treasury Solicitors\n. \nPublic l\nawyers \ncannot \nbe expected to bear \nthis\n financial burden\n on matters as urgent as human rights \nas it would mean that\n the focus of the application would be the financ\nial risk\n as opposed to the benefit to the cl\naimant\n whose human rights are in issue\n or the potential \nwider public interest \nimportance of the application.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nThe \ngovernment’s \nproposal would lead to judicial re\nview cases being restricted to those who could bear the financial risks associated with proceeding to \nthe Administrative \ncourt, thus reducing the ability of many members of the public and \ncivil society \norganisations\n such as human rights NGOs\n to challenge important policy decisions of the executive\n which have implications for human rights\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nFor example\n the important recent Supreme Court judicial review judgment in\n \nOsborne and Booth v The Parole Board; In the application of James Clyde Reilly \nfor Judicial Review (Northern Ireland)\n [2013] UKSC 61\n might not have been taken if the current funding proposals had been in place because public lawyers instructed on behalf of the claimants would have been deterred by the financial risk incurred in under\ntaking preliminary work before the permission stage. \nThis case engaged human rights principles articulated in both common law and under the Convention. \n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, the proposal undermines the purposes of judicial review and legal aid. \n \nJudicial review s\nhould enable members of society to challenge \nthe actions and decisions of the \nexecutive and this ability should be based on the importance of the policy and \nthe merits of the challenge\n,\n \nnot the ability to fund such a challenge. Legal aid should enable thos\ne who cannot afford legal assistance to engage in the judicial review process and obtain the legal representation that is necessary to ensure fair legal access irrespective of finances\n.  This is with the safeguard that the judiciary determines standing and\n that the public interest should be defined within the context of the balance and the separation of powers between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive\n. \n When human rights issues are engaged then this demand for open access to justice becomes a\nn imperative. \n&#xa0;\nThe proposal \nundermines \nth\nese principles \nby distinguishing which stages of the process \nmerit \n financial assistance, i.e. only if it satisfies the permission stage. \nThis \ndistinction \noffends the equality of arms principle\n which is \nenshrined\n in the Convention jurisprudence\n.  \nHowever, the preparatory stage \nof a judicial review application \nis \nimportant in the \nprocess and \nlegal service \nproviders should not be expected to bear the costs themselves. The proposal also means that a decision about wh\nich cases are the most deserving is determining the availability of legal assistance. Legal representation is fundamental to the whole process\n of judicial review \nand should not be dependent on the case reaching a certain stage\n, contested by the government\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nRestricting funds \nuntil\n after the permission stage would discourage many\n public \nlawyers from engaging in the process at\n the preliminary s\ntage, further reducing the number of judicial review applications. This reduction would be based on \nthe \ninability to\n meet the costs, which would have a detrimental \ne\nffect on the most vulnerable members of society. Far from meeting the \ng\novernment’s objectives of reducing judicial review to cases that are the most important (a judg\ne\nment that is based on a flawed presumpti\non that the \ng\novernment is \nalways \nbest placed to decide who is most deserving) it would only serve to skew judicial review applications to those with greater financial resources and exclude members of society who are most vulnerable in the face of the propo\nsals that require challenge. \nThese are the members of society whose human rights will often b\ne\n the subject of the application. \n&#xa0;\nProtective Cost Orders &#xa0;The government has asked \nwhether it is appropriate to stipulate that PCOs will not be available in any\n case where there is an individual or private interest regardless of whether th\nere is a wider public interest.  \nWe oppose the restriction of the availability of PCOs. We do not \nconsider\n it is suitable to prevent PCOs being available in a case where there i\ns an individual or private interest in the case. The public interest in the case is the most important \nform of \ninterest and it would not be appropriate to restrict PCOs just because there is also a private or individual interest at stake. \n&#xa0;\nThe proposals w\nould generate greater uncertainty for claimants who may be \ndeterred \nby the costs they may \nincur\n if their \napplication\n is unsuccessful. It would create a chilling effect by placing financial barriers on those who w\nant\n to engage in the \njudicial review \nprocess\n. NGOs and vulnerable individuals who would not be able to bear the financial risk that would be associated if the availability of PCOs was limited would be discouraged from bringing claims which might be important to bring in the public interest. This wou\nld especially be true for NGOs whose role involves bringing cases to the attention of the court and the public even if the policy has not had a direct effect on an individual \nor group as of \nyet. \n&#xa0;\nThere is a link between the importance of bringing the case\n into the public attention by NGOs who may take on the responsibility if the policy is not publicly known yet, and the consequent chilling effect because they are hindered by the potential costs. Sometimes, it is important for issues to be brought to the a\nttention of the public and the courts, even if in the particular case is not successful as it\n is \n  the process of challenge\n in itself\n that must be preserved, and this should not depend upon financial resources. \nNGO funding is reliant on a mixture of philan\nthropy or other form of \nmembership\n subscription.  Those funding NGO work in terms of strategic litigation would also be deterred from funding if they were to be co-joined as potential bears of litigation risk costs\n,\n as would corporate sponsors (for example\n pro bono units of commercial law firms) who might be exposed to unacceptable unquantifiable costs in public interest litigation.\n&#xa0;The government asks h\now could the principles for making a PCO be modified to ensure a better balance a) between the parties to litigation and b) between providing access to the courts with the \ninterests of the taxpayer? \n \nWe do not \nconsider\n that the principles for making a PCO \nshould be modified. The public interest at stake in bringing certain cases to the attention of the courts should not be dictated to by the financial security of the parties. It not only restricts access to the legal process itself, but also jeopardises the\n purpose of judicial review as it may mean that cases that are in the public interest (yet \nmay \nalso involve \nindividual\n or group\n \ninterests) are not brought to the attention of the court and the policy would go unchallenged. \n&#xa0;Further, w\ne do not \nconsider\n tha\nt the source of funding should be relevant to the consideration of a PCO. The principles that currently govern the availability of PCOs are sufficient to achieve their purpose of protecting claimants from undue financial burdens and the source of funding i\ns not relevant for that purpose. \n For example, \nNGOs are sponsored either through public subscription (membership) or by private philanthropy.  To require disclosure beyond what is available in the public domain through the Charity Commission is an unnecess\nary and pervasive invasion into the fund\ning\n arrangements of these civil society organisation\ns\n.\n&#xa0;Costs arising from the involvement of Third Party Interveners&#xa0;\nThe government asks whether third parties who choose to intervene in judicial review claims\n can\n be responsible in principle for their own legal costs of doing so, such that they should not, ordinarily, be able to claim those costs from either the claimant or the defendant? \n&#xa0;\nWe do not \nconsider \nthat a\nn NGO\n third party intervener should be \nliable \nfor \ntheir own legal costs. We are concerned that the proposals relat\ning\n to third party interveners would have a detrimental impact on the role of NGOs and other important actors in the judicial review process. This is because making a\nn NGO\n third-party interven\ner liable for their own costs not only impacts negatively on the quality of the decision b\ny\n dissuading parties who may add substantive and significant arguments from intervening, but would also have a disproportionate effect on the ability of NGOs and char\nities to engage in the judicial review process, insulating the executiv\ne further from proper scrutiny and accounta\nbility in the exercise of power and demonstrating human rights compliance.\n&#xa0;\nThird party interventions can be extremely beneficial to the quali\nty of the decision making process in the \napplication\n. They may be able to bring additional expertise and arguments, particularly if they are an interest group that represents a particular group \nwithin \nsociety or \nan \nissue. The rules on costs might therefore\n discourage those who could bring something significant to the case due to their inability to bear the financial burden, particularly if they are an NGO with \nrestricted \nfinancial resources. This would consequently \nlimit\n the ability of NGOs to engage in the\n judicial review process in general as the costs would prove a practical hindrance. This would furthermore affect the effectiveness of the judicial review process by limiting those who can engage in it to the financially stable and resourceful. Such a poli\ncy would again misunderstand the role of judicial review as a tool for the public to \nchallenge the decision making function of \nexecutive power\ns\n by dictating the process along the lines of costs rather than the importance of \nthe public interest/human rights\n issues in play.\n&#xa0;From a practical perspective, the quality of the decision making process may be hindered if certain arguments or opinions are excluded. It may lead to an increase in subsequent costs because of the need for further litigation if important\n points are not raised or clarified in the original case due to a costs barrier. There is no real evidence to support the assertion that third party interveners greatly increase the costs in the first place, and their participation at the outset may lead t\no a more efficient and thorough consideration of \nthe \nissues in the \napplication\n. \n&#xa0;The intervention of a third party \nNGO \nmay bring an important \nperspective to \nthe \napplication \nthat would not have otherwise been considered. The benefits that they can bring mean they should not \nbe responsible for any additional costs that may be incurred. Furthermore, any intervention is at the discretion of the court who are in the best position \nto restrict the involvement if it may not add anyt\nhing of value to the process. \nA key consideration in deciding whether to apply to make a third party intervention in a judicial review is whether the intervention will add value to the application\n, and thus\n appropriate safeguards are already in place.\n \n&#xa0;27 November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;"
