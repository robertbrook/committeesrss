defaultAll the major policy affecting food security in this c

defaultis
default decided at EU level, 
defaultthe Common Agricultural Policy
default (CAP)
default, t
defaulthe EU Common External Tariff (i.e. trade policy) and 
defaultmany other 
defaultEU directives
default, governing almost all environmental policy
default. This means Defra must provide leadership in Europe to shape emerging EU policy on 
defaultfood 
defaultsecurity.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default The CLA pressed for the
default 
defaultimplemen
defaulttation of the 
defaultlatest reform of the 
defaultCAP
default 2014-2020
default to ensure 
defaultthat European agriculture is in a position to produce as much food as it can, sustainably, and in response to market signals. 
defaultThe CAP also
default 
defaulthas a role in providing
default incentives and mechanisms to encou
defaultrage farming that uses less water and fossil fuels, produces less greenhouse gas emissions, does not degrade soils and manages nitrogen use better. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultLand is a limited commodity; 
defaultthe 
defaulttotal size of the UK is 24 million hectares, 76% of which is dedicate
defaultd to agriculture.  
defaultLand conversion is a large source of greenhouse gas
default emissions
default, and perhaps the greatest source of biodiversity loss. 
defaultThe optimal land use mix for any given area will depend on local conditions.
default 
defaultIt wouldn’t be feasible or environmentally beneficial to plough up UK uplands to try and grow grains and vegetables. Instead, this land could be used for low input livestock systems or converted to woodland. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultClimate change is likely to mean a reducti
defaulton in agricultural land, through processes such as sea level rise and changes in rainfall patterns. We need to understand better how efficient different food types are in terms of their land use. 
defaultWe know that 
defaultin the UK, as in most of northern Europe,
default 
defaultorgan
defaultic crop yields can be 40%–50% lower than conventional farming, and labour use can be 10%–25% higher. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5 Producing
default sufficient food is only part of the challenge the world faces, the implications of the way in which it is produced are equally important. T
defaulthe only acceptable form of food production is that which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
default S
defaultustainable production
default is not the preserve of any one method of farming
default&#xa0;
default1.6 
defaultM
defaultaximising food
default production does not rely solely on agriculture; there will be knock on impacts along the food supply chain, e.g. on infrastructure-transport systems 
defaultand
default food storage. How
default 
defaultthis
default will
default be managed
default needs further consideration
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.7 
defaultUK public-sector research into food and farming is still world-class in some respects. However, there is an urgent need to: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultThe market price of food reflects commercial supply and demand factors.  However, it is the intention of the retail sector to ensure that the cost of food products to the consumer is kept 
defaultas 
defaultlow
default as possible
default. This necessarily will have an impact on the ability of producers to match the demands from supermarkets.  
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultProducers wish to see higher food prices in order to maintain viable margins. For 
defaultfarmers, where input prices have often risen at a rate above
default inflation, static pricing or even reduced returns
default,
default 
defaultmakes it harder for farmers to compete.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultIn this sense
default,
default the issue to resolve is essentially that between the producer and the retailer. 
defaultT
defaulthis should not exempt the impact of other parties in the food s
defaultupply chain, such as processors or packagers. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4 
defaultThe CLA believes it is incumbent
default on the retail sector to ensure
default the relationship between the producer and the retailer is both fair and equitable. To make farming more sustainable, there needs to be an eq
defaultuitable share of risk and profit along the food supply chain, and some form of investment from the larger retailers in the producer’s business
default,
default to help secure the ability to supply. Whilst it is accepted that a cheap food policy is being pursued by the Gov
defaulternment, there has to be a realisation that the increasing costs of producing food will lead to many exiting the industry
default,
default which is a threat to food security.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 The Groceries Code Adjudicator must enforce the Groceries Supply Code of Practice.  This sho
defaultuld ensure that retailers do not transfer excessive risk and unexpected costs to their direct suppliers. This would otherwise impact 
defaulton suppliers’ willingness to i
defaultnvest, quality and innovation, 
defaultleading to potential consumer detriment
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 
defaultConsumers need t
defaulto be encouraged to think more about the environmental consequences of where and how their food is produced. The public need to be provided with information to enable them to make responsible choices. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultFood is a global, not
default national
default, market. Demand for food is rising rapidly.  By 2050, the world will need to feed 9 billion people on about the same land area as we use today, 
defaultusing limited fertiliser, water and 
defaultpesticides and in the context of a rapidly-changing climate.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default  The CLA
default believe
defaults
default the prime factors that influence global markets and food prices are:
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultBy concentrating production in a few large countries, the risk of a significant disruption to the world’s food supplies increases. If
default, as forecast, 
defaultBraz
defaultilian chicken exports were
default 
defaultto account for 89.7% of the global volume by 2018, the consequences if a problem were to occur with their production could be substantial.
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultLand-rich countries
default and regions
default, such as Brazil
default and Africa
default, have great potential to boost global food supplies, but neither their ability to realise this potential, nor a well-functioning global market, can be taken for granted. 
defaultWe also have to deal globally with limited water; not just depleting aquifers, but al
defaultso droughts that
default, due to climate change, 
defaultare expected to strike with increasing intensity
default 
defaultin the agricultural heartlands of continents the UK imports food
default from
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 
defaultWhile a healthy domestic agriculture is an essential component of a secure food system in
default the UK, a balance is needed.  Total self-sufficiency would make the UK’s food supplies less secure rather than more secure.  If the UK refocused solely on domestic production and ignored external trade, there could be an unforeseen catastrophic event, suc
defaulth as a major crop failure or disease epidemic in livestock, which would leave the UK needing to rapidly source food from global markets. Diversity of supply is the key to resilience.
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultTrading relationships themselves ar
defaulte
default a source of risk.
default In 2006, 26 c
defaultountries, including the UK, accounted for 90% of the UK’s food supplies, up from 22 countries in 1996.  In 2009, 34 countries each supplied the UK with at least 0.5% of its food imports. The Netherlands accounted for the highest share with 13%. According t
defaulto Defra
default,
default the vast majority of our food (69% in value) comes from trading partners in the EU. But, 
defaultthere is no guarantee that even our EU trading relationships will always remain stable. In
default 
defaultthe event of severe shortages of basic food stuffs, it is questiona
defaultble whether intra-EU trade would continue to operate smoothly.  While this may seem unlikely, there might be a need to consider contingency plans for dealing with the breakdown of the single market.  If EU countries did attempt to take protectionist action
default in a time of severe food shortages, the Commission would seek to ensure that the rules of the single market were upheld. But it may not be able to apply sanctions with sufficient speed.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultIt is very difficult to make an accurate forecast of what value GM technology could bring to the UK food sector. This is because the current regulatory framework is so restrictive that the possibility for companies to develop GM products is very limited. A
defaults a result, UK food producers do not 
defaultcurrently 
defaultengage with the potential of such technologies
default,
default as it 
defaultis not commercially viable.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultGM techniques, used as part of a wider approach to food se
defaultcurity, can make a significant
default positive impact to food productio
defaultn in the UK. This is not just in how we can produce
default more from existing resources; 
defaultit also concerns how we can protect biodiversity, improve natural resource provision, and make contributions to animal welfare. It is therefore vital that food security, howe
defaultver it is defined, takes into account the indirect challenges that come with needing to produce more. 
defaultIn our view,
default the livestock and woodland sectors have arguably more to gain from such GM technologies, and subsequently more to contribute in food security
default policy.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultT
defaulthe net global economic benefits at farm level added by cultivating GM crops
default,
default rather than conventional varieties of crops
default,
default have been estimated at $14billion in 2010, and by 2011, almost 17 million farmers around the world planted GM crops, up from 15 million in 2010
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultIt is estimated that without GM, additional plantings of 5.1 million hectares of soybeans, 5.6 million h
defaultectares of corn, 
defaultand three
default million hectares of cotton and 350,000 hectares of rape seed would have been globally required in 2010 to maintain existing output.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultIn 2013, supported by national governments and UNESCO, the International Service for the Acq
defaultuisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) calculated the effects of GM crops on the environment. It concluded that GM crops alone saved the equivalent of 473 million kilograms of pesticides in 2011, saved 109 million hectares of new land being ploughed
default up and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 23 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
defaultThe growth of yields worldwide has stagnated for many major 
defaultconventional 
defaultfood crops, as research published in Dec 2012 in the journal 
defaultNature Communications
default 
defaultshowed. If yield growth 
defaultdoes not get 
defaultback on track
default,
default 
defaultthe UK is 
defaultgoing to have trouble keeping up with population growth and resulting 
defaultfood 
defaultdemand, and prices will rise
default,
default as well as more land being converted from nature to agriculture.
default Development of higher yi
defaultelding and 
defaultimproved 
defaultdrought 
defaultand pest 
defaultresistant non-GM plant varieties would help
default, 
defaultas well as selection of positive genetic traits in the livestock sector
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultIt 
defaultwould be
default difficult to legislate or 
defaultundertake policy intervention
default in this area without potentially compromising the market. Previous Government policy has 
defaultsought
default to make the UK food chain more market orientated
default, e.g.
default with its s
defaulttrict decoupling policy approach under direct payments. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultSome sectors have been able to build better resilience as a result
default 
default– larger arable sectors have benefitted from area based payments, whilst livestock producers have
default 
defaultsuffered
default 
default– simply because 
defaultof 
defaultthe average size of
default their holdings
default. In a market of varying input costs and market returns, it has remained one of the key constant sources of regular income for farmers. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3 
defaultIntensive sectors, such as pigs and poultry have been forced t
defaulto become hugely re
defaultsilient, 
defaultas they receive no effective support payments.  However, this has come at a price – coupled
default with
default high welfare standards imposed by the Government, the number of intensive producers have reduced notably as sizes of pig holdings have increased. Such
default economies of scale are becoming more common in agriculture (especially the livestock sector) in response to market forces and Government policy. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4 
defaultDepending on the product in question, supply chains vary. Fresh produce will tend to have shorter chains
default, whilst component products will have longer and potentially more complicated supply chains. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5 
defaultWhere there are longer supply chains, the ease of providing clear traceability and labelling to the consumer is potentially jeopardised. This was made clear 
defaultwith beef products that contained traces of both horse meat and pig meat, in early 2013. To gain consumer confidence, these supply chains need
default to show greater transparency, arguably through labelling. H
defaultowever
default,
default where this inevitable cost is placed remains c
defaultontentious. 
defaultIt should rest with the retailers at point of sale to the consumer, and not be passed onto the food producer. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6 
defaultWe can be confident that robust traceability for some sectors is quite easy; however
default, for others
default it will be expensive and arguab
defaultly administratively complex
default,
default and may add further costs to bu
defaultsinesses, 
defaultpotentially compromising resilience. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default The CLA supports 
defaultfully 
defaultthe need for traceability systems that ensure the safety of food products. 
defaultW
defaulte believe that the emergence and success of 
defaultthe 
defaultf
defaultarm assurance schemes in the different agricultural sectors have gone some way in ensuring that food is safe
default,
default and produced to a high quality
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1 
defaultIn the UK
default,
default the C
defaultlimate Change Act has been the 
defaulttrigger to 
defaultobtain
default better information about climate impacts and risks in a 
defaultformat that
default allows businesses to plan. The Climate Change Risk Assessment process for different sectors, including Agriculture and 
defaultForestry, will be updated every five years
default,
default and so offers the opportunity to continually refine and update.
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
defaultThere are some key ris
defaultks for agriculture that require
default different levels of resilience building
default,
default as well as adaptation
default,
default depending on the farming 
defaultsystem
default,
default and their current 
default&#xa0;
defaultability to make changes. The risks are drought, flooding, disease and pests. The changes that can be initiated are not just limited to financial or business related
default,
default but migh
defaultt also be geographical location
default, topography, soil type.
default&#xa0;
default6.3 
defaultAgricultural producers that rely on irrigated water will need to plan ahead to ensure that they have enough water during times 
defaultof 
defaultless availability. This will mean planning their water 
defaultuse efficiently
default,
default as well as investment in infrastructure
default, such as
default on farm reservoirs to improve their resilience. The growing of more drought resistant crops will also help reduce risks to water stress.
default&#xa0;
default6.4 
defaultFlooding events will become more frequent and will require a range of responses
default,
default from improved drainage to embrac
defaulting more natural solutions, like 
defaultflood alleviation. B
defaultut importantly
default,
default&#xa0;
defaultit will need improved forecasting to allow local decisions to be made. Changes to cropping systems and land use will need to be carefully made to fit changing local conditions.
default&#xa0;
default6.5 
defaultRenew
defaultables have a role to play in managing UK food security and supporting British farming.
default  They 
defaultcan help reduce costs of production whilst providing environmental benefits.
default These benefits include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1 
defaultThe CLA is concerned by the levels of regulation in agriculture. 
defaultMany find that the administrative burdens do not make 
defaultfood productio
defaultn
default 
defaultworthwhile.
default 
defaultThis is why many mixed farm holdings are dropping certain aspects of their business and focussing 
defaultonly 
defaulton the most profitable aspect. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.2 
defaultEven for small producers who are seeking to set up a specialist business outright, the amount of regu
defaultlation and red tape is very high. The key issue is that producers will have to deal with a multiplicity of agencies and bodies who often duplicate areas of competence
default,
default and very rarely share information with one another. An example would be sm
defaultall livestock 
defaultproducers who wish
default to slaughter and sell products from their holding. The number of relevant bodies who they would have to deal with would include the FSA, Defra, Valuation Offices, Trading Standards, Local Authorities, AHVLA, the Environment Agency and Na
defaulttural England. 
default&#xa0;
default7.3 
defaultT
defaulthe red tape 
defaultinvolved is stifling
default businesses
default;
default it is often only larger businesses that have the resources to undertaken the compliance and administration.

default&#xa0;
default8.2 
defaultAgricultural produce
default,
default such as milk and dairy products, given the climatic advantages the 
defaultUK enjoys for grass growth, would suggest a greater focus should be afforded. However, expansion of the sector has been curtailed through the quota system
default,
default and th
defaulte latest milk deliveries figures suggest that production is significantly under quota. With milk quotas being removed in 2015, there is a real concern that the sector no longer has the capacity to expand as it might

default&#xa0;
default8.3 
defaultThe CLA believes 
defaultthere has to be recognition that production is necessarily geared to price. If food security is to actually mean something
default,
default it has to recognise that farmers have to receive a fair
default return for their labours. Unfortunately, the current situation
default 
defaultmeans that there is no equitable balance in the supply chain.
