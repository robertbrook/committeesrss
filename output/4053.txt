[[[Future of the BBC]]]

[[[What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]If it is deemed necessary for the UK to have a national public service broadcaster, it should be proportionate, and focused on “core business” ie providing it’s audience with high quality, balanced and impartial output on matters of national and public importance, which would not otherwise be addressed by the private sector. It’s news broadcasts should stick to reporting factually accurate information, not supporting an institutional agenda overwhelmingly consisting of opinions from it’s own approved “talking heads”.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving i]]]

[[[ts mission and public purposes?]]]The BBC has performed extremely badly in this regard, and continues it’s long decline. I travelled widely, internationally, in the eighties and nineties, and I was proud of the BBC as a respected British institution. Alas, no more. The BBC has become self-serving, bloated and arrogant, and out of touch with mainstream public opinion. A recent spate of scandals has revealed a disgraceful abuse of  licence payers’ money, awarding huge sums to surplus executives and managers. Many, like me, have been shocked by the disgraceful cover up of foul and criminal activities undertaken on BBC premises over many years in the past. In the recent Savile case, the “whistle-blowing” had ITN to thank, not the BBC itself.I used to wake up routinely to the Radio 4 Today programme, but gradually became disillusioned and irritated by it’s content.  I find that I can no longer listen to or watch BBC News and current affairs programmes on a regular basis as they are exceedingly biased, reflecting the BBC’s Metropolitan Liberal Left agenda.The BBC is required to be balanced and impartial, but it is too often neither. In any BBC phone in or discussion you quickly can assess the BBC’s position and what the outcome will be.  Anyone who deviates significantly is interrupted, sneered at or shouted down.There is a clear BBC agenda/position on many major political topics, examples being;The European Union (pro)Immigration, multi-culturalism and PC (pro)Global Warming (now metamorphosed into “Climate Change”) – (pro)The Labour Party (pro)The Middle East (pro Palestinian)Re the USA, strongly pro Democrat &#xa0;Although I have no religious affiliations, I note the BBC regularly criticises and mocks Christianity (often justifiably) but protects and promotes Islam, whilst generally ignoring other religions.The BBC also seems over-obsessed with “racism”, “equality” and “green” matters, so much so, that this can in effect be counter-productive to their underlying aimsThe BBCs flagship Newnight programme is, and has been, dominated by senior people well to the left of the political spectrum. It is obvious to any intelligent and aware person that BBC phone-in’s and programmes like Question Time/Any Questions are clearly carefully managed to ensure the right outcomes and outputs for the BBC.Other than for Sport, I no longer use the on line BBC site, preferring to get my News from many other excellent on-line sources including newspapers and blogs.Complaints about the BBC’s bias, once infrequent, are now commonplace.  However it’s complaints system is the metaphorical equivalent of scaling Everest. Many people no longer bother, having being told that the BBC has considered their point, but, on reflection, think that the BBC “got it just about right” 

[[[Are the public purposes ]]]

[[[in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?]]]The Charter content seems reasonable in principle, but the BBC has rather focused on competing with the private sector, in producing what some might unkindly call commercial “Trash TV” rather than core public service matters. The private sector is more than capable of meeting market demand for the former.&#xa0;

[[[What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?]]] To stick strictly to core public service broadcasting supported by a very small number of TV and radio channels. In 2013 we do not need a “force-funded”, large State Broadcaster producing “Trash TV” and biased “News” any more than we need a similar State distributor and retailer of food, competing against the highly efficient major supermarkets.

[[[Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?]]] &#xa0;As stated elsewhere the output of popular commercial programmes should be cut back, as these can, and will be covered adequately by private broadcasters.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?]]]With a smaller public service orientated BBC, much more would be covered in-house.  However, the exact balance would be a matter for the senior management to decide. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence]]]

[[[ fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?]]]&#xa0;As stated already, the wide-scale involvement of the BBC in commercial matters does not sit well with the remit of a public service broadcaster.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[What role should the BB]]]

[[[C play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?]]]Public sector organisations are ill-suited to effective and productive large scale research and development.  A good example was the recent major BBC IT project cancellation whereby £100M of licence payer’s money was wasted. The BBC does however need to employ smart, commercially-aware people to ensure it keeps up with the latest developments, and adopts the best technology available, as the media industry continues to rapidly transform. &#xa0;

[[[How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?]]] The anachronism of the current licence fee, often enforced by threat of criminal sanctions must be abolished. I was astonished to read of the sheer numbers of people now finding themselves in court for non payment.The BBC should be cut down substantially, for example with the sale of Radios 1, 5 Live, 6Music and a number of TV channels etc.  The role of it’s local radio network should also be reviewed as it is duplicating and severely stifling local competition. Funding of a much slimmed down BBC should be through;a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; voluntary subscription (like SKY – no pay, no play)b)  through advertising. Although the BBC is currently perceived to be “ad-free” it’s TV, and especially radio channels are awash with annoying, repeated ad’s for it’s own programmes.By this mechanism the BBC could save greatly on the costs of evasion, plus it’s substantial funding of (private) TVL–Capita enforcement.  This would also remove the much criticised elements of public harassment and threats, widely reported, and avoid people acquiring criminal records for simply avoiding or not wanting to pay for the BBC.

[[[Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?]]]I believe this has only become an issue because of the well publicised abuses involving the BBC, plus it’s perceived size and power.

[[[What comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries?]]]I have no significant recent experience of overseas broadcasters although I have found that I can often learn of factual news about the UK from broadcasters such as Russia Today, France24 etc on subjects which the BBC finds “uncomfortable” and chooses to ignore, omit or play down as they don’t fit with the BBC’s approved agenda.&#xa0;

[[[How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?]]]The BBC Trust is the ultimate oxymoron. It has proved itself, particularly in recent times, to be not fit for purpose. It should be scrapped and replaced by Ofcom.

[[[In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?]]]Ten years is far too long a period when we look at how much the BBC has declined and abused it’s position over the current Agreement period plus the ongoing revolution in modern media.&#xa0;The BBC has become “unhealthy” for our democracy. Through it’s TV and Radio News network it effectively controls 70% of the News. It’s sheer power can, I believe influence outcomes.  It has mounted vociferous campaigns against those it sees as rivals or enemies, and is in the vanguard of campaigning for State control over of our free press. Sadly many politicians, especially those on the right, seem to be afraid of standing up to the BBC.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
