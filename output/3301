defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultThis submission draws on the research conducted by Middlesex University as part of the Innovation Research Initiative funded by ESRC, BIS and NESTA, running from 2011-2013. The key findings for this inquiry are:
default&#xa0;
defaultProgress in setting up defaultmutualsdefault as effective ways of delivering servicesdefaultInnovative ways to deliver better public services – examples default1. defaultIntroductiondefault1.1 
defaultWe respond to the inquiry by drawing on early findings from a 2-year research project that has examined the innovative activity of 30 mutual spin-outs. In this submission we review initial data on the scope of mutual 
defaultspin-outs
default, and present initial findings related to the extent of 
defaultinnovation.
default 
defaultWe give the voices of some of the leaders, staff and others using or supporting these mutual 
defaultspin-outs
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultOur research focuses on health and social care provision which has seen increasing numbers of public sector 
defaultspin-outs
default and mutual forms in recent years through the facilitating action of the Department of Health’s Right to Request Policy (
defaultDoH
default, 2008) and other more recent policy actions to encourage 
defaultmutuals
default. While there were mutual spin-outs in the years prior to this policy starting in 2008, recent policy seeks to significantly increase the number and scale of spin-outs. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultInterviews were conducted with people at all levels of each case study organisation, including directors/leaders, managers, staff, trustees and users with an emphasis on those who had been particularly involved in change and innovation processes.
default 
defaultExternal stakeholders linked to each case study were also interviewed and included commissioners of public services, partner organisations and other providers of support. The qualitative interviews were recorded and fully transcribed.
default 
default&#xa0;default2. defaultWhat is the changing landscape of mutual defaultspin-outsdefault?default&#xa0;default2.1 
defaultAs part of our research we have compiled a comprehensive database of mutual spin-outs providing health and social care services in England, comprising 52 organisations (a further 19 organisations provide other types of services, including leisure, social work, education and housing). The vast majority of these 
defaultmutuals
default (41 of 52) were established in 2011 as part of the Right to Request process and availability of Social Enterprise Investment Fund grants. Some earlier social enterprises were also part of the Right to Request. Since 2011 there has been reduced activity in health and social care with an estimated 12 further 
defaultspin-outs
default, although our data only covers two of these.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultThere is a relatively even distribution of mutual organisations across the regions of England, with a slightly higher concentration in the East of England (12 of 52) and only one organisation in the North East. Many of the organisations (35%) are small, with fewer than 50 employees, although 19% of the organisations have over 1,000 employees. Annual turnover information is not readily available for all organisations, but ranges from the smallest organisations with turnover of less than £500,000 to the largest at over £43 million.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultAmongst the health and social care providing 
defaultmutuals
default, the types of services provided are highly diverse, with 15% providing general practice or primary care services, 23% providing mental health services, and 23% providing various specialist services (e.g. audiology, 
defaultlymphedema
default, drug addiction services). 38% of mutual spin-outs provide multiple community health services, many of which represent the large organisations (over 1,000 employees) with multimillion pound turnovers.
default&#xa0;default2.4 
defaultA small number of further 
defaultmutuals
default have been started since then in a diverse range of sectors beyond health, although at a much slower pace.
default 
defaultThis is partly as a result of
default: 
default&#xa0;
default2.5 
defaultFurthermore, the policy rhetoric around a looser idea of '
defaultmutuals
default' has created less trust and local support than the previous approach of supporting social enterprise models with asset locks.
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultAre mutual spin-outs more innovative than the public sector?default&#xa0;default3.1 
defaultThe results show that innovation can be faster and easier in spin-out social enterprises compared to the public sector, although many of the most innovative elements identified had been initiated and sometimes developed by social entrepreneurial leaders and key staff while within the public sector. The CEOs of the case study social enterprises were reported to be acting entrepreneurially, with reference to these leaders as disruptors, mavericks and ‘pushing the boundaries’
default. 
default&#xa0;default“[Our pre-spin-out innovative service] 
defaultexisted because we didn't ask permission.
default 
defaultAll the best things I've ever done in the health service, we've done under the radar 
default[…].
default 
defaultWe haven't explicitly looked for permission.” 
default(CEO case 6)
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultMost cases demonstrated strengths in change management led by entrepreneurial and inspirational leaders, staff engagement and building a more ‘open climate’ for new ideas and innovation.
default 
defaultIn many cases, successful innovation was found to be part of a wider learning culture, with staff and users involved in key meetings, and with senior management being open and receptive to new ideas and alternative approaches. Greater engagement is also supported by staff having a stake in the organisation.
default&#xa0;
default“…as shareholders, we’ve actually got a say in what happens.”
default (Exec PA case 4)
default&#xa0;
default3.3 
defaultRather than providing evidence of a radical cultural change in staff orientations and motivations, the evidence points to a process of evolutionary change and adaptation.
default 
defaultAdvantages of becoming a social enterprise were presented as:
default 
default&#xa0;
default“being able to use your initiative, to actually develop things that people want and need without the red tape” (
defaultNurse in Case 4).
default&#xa0;
default“…as an NHS trust it was very, very set in stone that these are our boundaries and this is how we’ll behave and this is where we’re going.
default 
defaultBut, as a social enterprise, staff are […] really empowered to have a massive part in the decision making” 
default(Projects manager, Case 5)
default&#xa0;
default3.4 
defaultHowever, the process of engaging staff as shareholders often took some time to evolve, with some organisations having limited staff involvement on boards. While most organisations had a majority of staff shareholders, others had more limited staff shareholdings and were still trying to encourage staff to opt in. In one large organisation they had found that only half of staff had decided to be shareholders. :
default&#xa0;
default“there are particular staff groupings who are very conservative and don't particularly like change. They tend to be the ones who haven't opted in. …. it tends to be more community nursing staff who tend to be a different generation. Whereas physical therapists and people like that are very open mind
defaulted and they join quite quickly. 
defaultThere's an awful lot of them on the governing body, for example. They're much more adaptable to change”
default (CEO of case 3).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default4. defaultWhat are the types of innovation in mutual spin-outs?default&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultDrawing on case study evidence from organisations in health and social care, innovations in four main areas are examined: 
default&#xa0;
default(4.1.1) 
defaultOrganisational – new forms to facilitate democratic governance and decision making
default 
defaultThe new social enterprise/mutual forms have involved specific mechanisms that give greater power and voice to staff and user communities, such as staff councils, user forums, and community asset locks.
default 
defaultSuch mechanisms have also been important in enabling specific innovations in services and processes (as will be discussed further below), as well as related organisational innovation.
default 
defaultFor example, a large provider of community services had developed its own charitable arm that was used to disperse a surplus that had been generated through delivering service contracts. These organisational innovations contribute to the process of cultural change which in turn can lead to further innovations in services.
default 
default&#xa0;
default(4.1.2) 
defaultNew treat
defaultments and services
defaultInnovations in this category involved more effective treatments and therapies, often inspired by a more holistic understanding of the relationship between individuals’ physical and mental health and well-being, including with respect to social interaction and work
default 
defaultintegration/
default 
defaultemployment needs. In one case a new eating disorder service and residential facility had been specifically designed to help address the needs of a particularly vulnerable target group
default. 
defaultOther services focused on rehabilitation have involved activities and support to help young people with disabilities in transitioning from special needs schools and support for independent living and employment
default&#xa0;
default(4.1.3) 
defaultNew forms of outreach for
default particular demographic groups
defaultInnovations in services have been focused on meeting under-addressed health and well-being needs and related preventive activity.
default 
defaultThis has involved new forms of outreach and engagement within a variety of local community settings including homes and community-based buildings and for particular demographic groups (i.e. in terms of age, race, gender etc
default.
default).
default 
defaultIn one particularly striking example, frontline health workers had developed a novel approach to promoting sexual health, safe drinking and personal safety messages to young people in the bars and nightclubs of the local area.
default 
defaultAnother community health provider had introduced a mobile health unit used for alcohol awareness raising, diabetes awareness in the town centre and an event at a local mosque.
default 
default(4.1.4) 
defaultIncremental improvements to organis
defaultational systems and processes
defaultFinally, most cases reported more incremental improvements to pre-existing services, organisational systems and processes, often driven by efficiency and cost-effectiveness considerations and the more competitive context and ability of organisations/employees to respond more flexibly. Examples include systems of procurement, staff working conditions, and recruitment approaches. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultHow can innovation in public services be supported?default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultCreating the space for innovation in the public sector and in alternative providers
defaultInnovation involves experimentation and risk, with a need for a climate of tolerance and readiness to learn from failure.
default 
defaultAnalysis of case studies show that spaces for learning and experimentation can involve mechanisms such as innovation awards, an ideas box, or the provision of time/space and support to those with innovative ideas to develop a business case.
default 
defaultThe organisational culture can also allow spaces for experimentation and risk taking. This may have occurred in the public sector, with a majority of the case studies referring to actively creating spaces to take risk while in the public sector. However, when having more independence they are able to explore and experiment
default 
defaultwith more freedom. 
default&#xa0;
default“We’d always being trying to exploit our opportunities… playing the system a bit. I can be more open and free about it now… so sometimes it feels that there is lot less personal risk … I used monies in my budget in ways that was stretching the boundaries.
default 
defaultIf someone wanted to 
defaultarsey
default about it, I could have probably had my wrist slapped”.
default 
default(CEO of case 1).
default&#xa0;
default5.1.1 
defaultThe concept of risk was shown to be different for those leaving the public sector. An innovation that involved novel therapies by providing service users with portable computers shows how this has changed, and opened up new spaces for social innovation: 
default&#xa0;
default“The NHS tends to be overly secure for all sorts of right reasons
default…
default The initial response from our IT provider which is the NHS said, ‘You can't do that.’… And we were like, ‘Let's just do it and see what happens’. There is something in-built in these people, and you'd have to say, if you're green, hide in the grass... People worked in the NHS not because they were risk takers. So it was a cultural change that you need to do to change them to say, ‘I can take a risk and do something differently.’ ”
default (CEO of case 3)
default&#xa0;
default5.1.2 
defaultSpaces for experimentation and risk were therefore found to be both opening up with the move to social enterprise, but at the same time the new commercial pressures of a social enterprise brought other risks for senior managers. 
default&#xa0;
default5.1.3 
defaultWhere there is resistance to innovation, there is need for leaders with entrepreneurial approaches and determination. This was found to be particularly important when pursuing ideas even when others are opposed. For example one CEO of an organisation offering counselling services stated: 
default&#xa0;
default“I told them I wanted a consultant psychologist, they said no.
default 
defaultSo I set the charity up to raise the money to pay for him, and then persuaded them to employ him, so he kept his benefits.
default 
defaultAnd everybody told me it would not be possible, and it took nearly five years to pull it all together, but we did”
default (CEO of case 2).
default&#xa0;
default5.1.4 
defaultA number of organisations identified the importance of bringing in ‘new blood’ in order to fill competency gaps and to drive innovation:
default 
default&#xa0;
default“So we rely very much on people, clinicians in particular, coming up with ideas. We brought in
default 
defaultnew blood to the organisation. I brought in a director of nursing who’s come from a different background. I brought in a commercial director who never worked for the NHS before in his life. Worked for 
defaultthe pharmaceutical industries… 
defaultSo we created a commercial team which was about being much more outward looking”
default (CEO of case 3)
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultEncouraging involvement of users and other stakeholders in service design
defaultInnovation can be driven by being responsive to user needs and an ‘open’ approach to learning from new knowledge from various sources, as well as the need for partnership working (with public, third/social and private sector organisations).
default 
defaultThe most striking example of user involvement was that of
default 
defaulta provider of mental health care services (Case 5) where the board of directors was entirely composed of people with disabilities (
default“experts by experience… 
defaultputting the users in the driving seat”
default) supported by an oversight committee involving sympathetic local people.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.2.1 
defaultThe new, more autonomous/independent situation was also found by some to be more enabling of relationships with other organisations such as private sector businesses (e.g. offering employment opportunities
default 
defaultand relationships with pharmaceutical companies), as well as with NHS partners
default 
defaultin the public sector and voluntary sector agencies.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.3 
defaultFunding and commissioning innovation
defaultInnovation is not without costs and risks and there is a need to fund the learning and piloting of new activities.
default 
defaultSocial innovations were found to be funded from four sources: 
default5.3.1 
defaultThe social enterprise cases were found to have a degree of freedom with their budgets that they did not have while in the public sector. Where they had been able to generate a surplus, this was used for new services and experimentation, allowing risk taking without jeopardising the financial position of the organisation
default 
defaultor damaging relationships with the public sector commissioners. In some cases
default 
defaultstaff were involved in voting on where the surplus was being spent. This was focused on those service areas that
default 
defaultthe public sector contracts were not covering. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3.2 
defaultPhilanthropic sources can be accessed through a fundraising team or by setting
default 
defaultup a charity in order to channel its surplus and be able to apply for charitable funds.
default 
defaultOne case study referred to the benefits of
default 
defaultcharitable funding as 
default“It just frees your head up”
default (CEO Case 2), and allows new ideas to be developed. Collaborations with other organisations can also allow smaller social enterprises to access resources, particularly those that have skills in accessing research and development funding and bidding for larger contracts or grants.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.3 
defaultCommissioners were found to play a key role in each of the case studies. The process of social innovation was therefore driven by their interest in new ideas or their willingness to fund developing innovations. While commissioners are often cautious and can be risk-averse, in some case commissioners were willing to fund pilots and also fund the research that was need to provide evidence of the impact.
default 
defaultIn one case, they were benefitting from a national programme of Commissioning for Quality and Innovation that aims to reward innovation. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3.4 
defaultWhere there was greater involvement of commissioners, interviewees noted the continuity
default 
defaultof the commissioning team, and the extent to which the commissioner is under financial pressure. The importance of personal relationships with commissioners was noted by one case:
default&#xa0;
default“Commissioners like the things like this that help keep their paymasters off their back, and look good. If you do that and provide the service, they see you as an ally. I suppose you call it a collaborative approach.”
default 
default(CEO of case 1).
default&#xa0;
default5.3.5 
defaultThere was a perception found amongst both commissioners and social enterprises that with austerity measures, short-term financial savings are being prioritised over experimentation and innovation that may have potential long-term benefits. One commissioner stated: 
default&#xa0;
default“Our ability to fund things outside of a competitive process in the future are going to be severely restricted by the government’s proposals.
default 
default[…]
default 
defaultsometimes when you go out to tender, it’s the bigger organisations who’ve got the capacity to actually do those huge tender processes.”
default(Commissioner)
default&#xa0;
default5.3.6 
defaultIn a public service commissioning context that is increasingly competitive, there are tensions around the need for co-operation and sharing of innovative ideas. The balance between being open to sharing learning and innovation with other organisations and a 
defaultperceived need to protect Intellectual Property in a competitive environment poses a growing challenge for many social enterprises.
default&#xa0;
default5.3.7 
defaultContributions to social value are difficult to quantify and represent within existing commissioning frameworks.
default 
defaultUnder conditions of public sector austerity, there is a danger that short-term financial savings are prioritised over longer term learning, experimentation and innovation with potential durable benefits.
