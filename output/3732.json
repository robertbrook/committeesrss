"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Neil Taylor (CYS021)\n&#xa0;\nI am a keen and experienced cyclist (about 7000 \nmiles \nper year). My wife and I have ridden tandem in 29 countries. Probably the most hostile and aggressive driving we have encountered is from a minority of drivers in this country.\n&#xa0;\nSuch drivers do not \ntake seriously their duty of care to vulnerable road users (cyclists and pedestrians).\n&#xa0;\nThe situation is different in many continental countries where there is \na  ‘rebuttable\n presumption’ in favour of the vulnerable party \nie\n the motorised vehicle driver is\n held to be responsible\n for a collision\n unless they can prove otherwise.\n&#xa0;\nAdopting this measure here would make far more motorists pay due care and attention.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
