"&#xa0;\nOAR0017Written evidence submitted by Newham College&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCause for optimism\n; Ofsted’s capability\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDoes Ofsted believe it now has the in-house capability and capacity to understand that FE sector as fully as it should (and as it does the schools sector)?&#xa0;Does Ofsted acknowledge that the FE sector has been subject to great change, which takes time to settle into? Does Ofsted believe that – either alone, or working with the new Commissioner – it could do more to support and challenge the sector in a productive way?&#xa0;&#xa0;\nDoes Ofsted support the development of a ‘learner premium’ to support students who have been eligible for the pupil premium to ensure that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds achieve in FE?&#xa0;Preparation for employment\n; English and maths\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHas Ofsted raised the “burdensome and bureaucratic” passing of information between schools and colleges with the DfE? What can it do to support colleges on this issue?&#xa0;&#xa0;\nDoes Ofsted support calls by the Committee and others for improved CPD and training for teachers, including critically those in FE? Does Ofsted believe this would improve the rates of success in English and maths amongst FE students?&#xa0;Labour market intelligence\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCould Ofsted find means to support colleges’ understanding of the labour market and its needs, for example by publishing a ‘best practice’ guide examining colleges making impressive steps in this area?&#xa0;Could Ofsted consider a similar guide on local planning in this area, its importance, and examples of good practice, to encourage LEPs in other areas to replicate?&#xa0;&#xa0;Can Ofsted confirm what it looks for in judging colleges’ ‘local’ delivery and knowledge?&#xa0;Apprenticeships\n; careers guidance\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDoes Ofsted believe that more should be done, by Government or other avenues, to improve young people’s knowledge of Apprenticeships as a viable pathway?&#xa0;Does Ofsted share the concerns of the Committee Chair that teachers and schools are reluctant to advise young people into FE, even when that path is right for them? What can be done to improve that situation?&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;\n \nThe role and performance of Ofsted\n: second report of the Education Committee, Session 2010-12, esp. paragraphs 66-69, and chap\nter 4\n See \nGreat Teachers: attracting, training and retaining the best\n, ninth report of the Education Committee, Session 2010-12\n \nhttp://w\nww.standard.co.uk/news/education/pupils-not-told-about-vocational-college-courses-8885889.html\n \n"
