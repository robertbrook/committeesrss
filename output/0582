[normal]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This memorandum contains written evidence submitted by PHS Space Ltd to the Science and Technology
[normal] Committee
[normal] inquiry into the European and UK Space Agencies.
[normal] R
[normal]esponses are provided to five of the six categories of information requested by the c
[normal]ommittee. However,
[normal] th
[normal]e focus of the
[normal] 
[normal]evidence relate
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] the space debris problem.
[normal] Some concerns
[normal] about the level of funding 
[normal]available 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]are ide
[normal]ntified, particularly with regard to the development of 
[normal]innovative 
[normal]debris mitiga
[normal]tion / remediation technologies
[normal]. 
[normal]B
[normal]udgetary
[normal] pressures are also observed 
[normal]to 
[normal]be jeopardizing
[normal] the UK’s long-standing 
[normal]participation at important international 
[normal]debris mitigation 
[normal]committees.
[normal] 
[normal]It is noted that the UK cannot afford to ignore the debris problem if it is serious about growing the space sector to achieve a £40 billion turnover by 2030
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Indeed, part of this turnover c
[normal]ould come from th
[normal]e development 
[normal]and use 
[normal]of 
[normal]technologies
[normal] that address the debris problem
[normal].

[normal]Written Evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1/[bold]              [bold]What are the strengths and weaknesses of the funding, organisation, and work of the European Space Agency?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal].1
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he greatest strength of ESA is its 
[normal]technical 
[normal]staff, whos
[normal]e breadth and depth of
[normal] knowledge across the organisation is significant. 
[normal]This expertise, which has brought about
[normal] many successful space 
[normal]missions, s
[normal]hould be
[normal] developed as much as possible.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, more opportunities could be provided for the 
[normal]s
[normal]econdment of 
[normal]ESA 
[normal]staff to industry
[normal],
[normal] national space agencies
[normal] or
[normal] the EU
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]2/
[normal]              
[normal]In terms of
[normal] organisation, ESA has a rigid
[normal] hierarchical structure 
[normal]which is similar in many respects to a large civil service department
[normal]. 
[normal]A flatter organisation with a matrix management system, if implemented correctly, 
[normal]would
[normal] allow greater flexibility in moving staff 
[normal]both 
[normal]within 
[normal]and outside 
[normal]the organisation
[normal]. 
[normal]It would
[normal] also provide a closer relationship between senior management and the technical staff. 
[normal]This should improve
[normal] upward communication flow of importa
[normal]nt advice from technical staff.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]3/
[normal]              
[normal]One
[normal] area requiring attention
[normal] in ESA
[normal] is t
[normal]he 
[normal]process 
[normal]that industry has to follow when 
[normal]biddi
[normal]ng for relatively low-value 
[normal]competitive tenders, 
[normal]i.
[normal]e. those less than 500k euros. At present t
[normal]he process
[normal] is too costly, time-consuming and complicated. This can act as a barrier 
[normal]to SMEs
[normal] bidd
[normal]ing, since t
[normal]he size of the investment that must be made, and risk taken, may be a substantial proportion of the SME’s overall business.
[normal] Therefore
[normal], SMEs are 
[normal]forced to consider bidding only for 
[normal]those ESA 
[normal]contracts 
[normal]that they have a significant chance of winning. 
[normal]By contrast, large organis
[normal]ations can absorb the 
[normal]high 
[normal]bidding costs much more readily, and therefore they can afford to 
[normal]be more speculative when
[normal] bidding for work. Thus the complexity and cost of the 
[normal]ESA bidding 
[normal]process has an inherent 
[normal]bias in favour of large organis
[normal]ations.  
[normal]This clearly has a couple of
[normal] (perhaps unintended) consequences. First, the 
[normal]organis
[normal]ation that wins a contract may not necessarily be the best one to undertake the work. Second, 
[normal]the potential 
[normal]for 
[normal]SMEs 
[normal]to grow 
[normal]could be
[normal] hindered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]4/
[normal]              
[normal]An
[normal] aspect of the ESA 
[normal]bidding process that remains a cause for concern is 
[normal]“
[normal]juste
[normal] retour”
[normal]. The existence of a
[normal] geogra
[normal]phical return requirement can force
[normal] a bid consortium to include 
[normal]some weaker partners in order to spread the geographical loading. Therefore, it seems inevitable that bid consortia will be sub-optimal in their make-up. 
[normal]As a consequence, o
[normal]ne must 
[normal]also presume that some of the resulting contract deliverables from a winning consortium will not be of the highest standard
[normal] achievable
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2/[bold]              [bold]In light of the European Commission’s recent Communication on relations between ESA and the EU (COM 2012 671), what relationship between ESA, the EU and the UK would provide the most effective governance regime? Why?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]ESA has accomplished much since its inception. There have been notable achievements across all of the space acti
[normal]vity domains. However, given its
[normal] budgetary cons
[normal]traints, and the emergence of EU
[normal] funding of space-related activities, perhaps now is the time for ESA to focus on certain key areas. There should be a clear demarcation between ESA’s activities and those of the 
[normal]EU
[normal]. 
[normal]The greatest
[normal] 
[normal]technological risk and 
[normal]challenge comes from 
[normal]science missions, 
[normal]interplanetary missions and human spaceflight. 
[normal]It could be argued that 
[normal]ESA’s undoubted technical expertise would be put to best u
[normal]se by concentrating on these particular
[normal] areas. Where synergies and economies of scale exist, 
[normal]ESA 
[normal]projects 
[normal]sh
[normal]ould be pursued in collaboration with national space agencies within Europe
[normal], such as the UK Space Agency,
[normal] or 
[normal]agencies outside of Europe.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]To complement this approach
[normal], the 
[normal]EU
[normal] could assume respo
[normal]nsibility for 
[normal]unmanned, Earth orbital missions since these provide the most immediate 
[normal]and obvious 
[normal]societal benefits to European citizens.
[normal] 
[normal]In recent years the 
[normal]EU
[normal] 
[normal]has demonstrated its commitment to Earth orbital space, both in terms of use (e.g. GMES) and in terms of preservation of the environment for future generations (e.g. addressing the space debris problem).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3/[bold]              [bold]How effective is the EU’s support for research and innovation in the space sector? What effect have changes to the Multi-Annual Financial Framework had on ESA and support for the space sector from the Horizon 2020 programme?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]EU support for research and innovation has provided a significant 
[normal]boost to the 
[normal]European 
[normal]space sector
[normal], and
[normal] has filled in some sizeable funding gaps
[normal]. This is particularly evident in an area such as space debris
[normal] research
[normal]. Over the past 
[normal]three years several large debris projects have been funded within FP7 to address a variety of important needs. These include the development of methods to mitigate the growth in 
[normal]orbital 
[normal]debris and technologies for 
[normal]actively removing
[normal] debris 
[normal]from the 
[normal]environment. 
[normal]In the light of concerns about the Kessler syndrome taking hold, i.e. the onset of an irreversible collision cascade in low Earth orbit
[normal] (LEO)
[normal], the 
[normal]EU
[normal] has approached the debris problem with a sense of urgency. This is lauda
[normal]ble. 
[normal]EU
[normal] funding 
[normal]has helped many European companies, especially SMEs, to develop promising ideas and technologies. In so doing, the competitiveness of European industry has also been improved. The upcoming Horizon 2020 programme looks set to continue that trend.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]O
[normal]ne problem that the 
[normal]EU
[normal] currently appears to suffer from is a lack of staff to oversee the 
[normal]space-related 
[normal]research being undertaken. 
[normal]At present the 
[normal]EU
[normal] has limited in-house technical expertise
[normal], and therefore it has to invite outside experts to act as project reviewers. This can work quite well if there is a go
[normal]od match between the aims of a project
[normal] and the knowledge of the expert. However, experience shows that this is not always the case.
[normal] Some projects have been
[normal] reviewed by 
[normal]experts who are not sufficiently qualified to provide meaningful inputs. If the 
[normal]EU
[normal] is to provide effective oversight of research within Horizon 2020, then it needs to address this problem. One possible solution would be for ESA to provide a number of technical staff to the 
[normal]EU
[normal]. This could be on a secondment basis or as a permanent transfer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4/[bold]              [bold]How effective has the UK Space Agency been and what improvements could be made? Is the UK effectively exploiting opportunities for growth in the space sector or could more be done?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he UK Space Agency’s National Space Technology Programme (NTSP) has 
[normal]giv
[normal]en much-needed assistance to
[normal] the development of innovative technologies within the UK space sector. However, the level of investment would seem to fall short of that 
[normal]necessary to satisfy
[normal] the 
[normal]aspiration
[normal] of 
[normal]creating a 
[normal]£40 billion
[normal]-
[normal]turnover 
[normal]space industry 
[normal]within the UK 
[normal]by 2030.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, c
[normal]alls for proposals need to be more frequent and regular to ensure that promising new ideas can be
[normal] developed quickly and retained by
[normal] the UK
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]The relationship between funding offered by the NTSP and that offered by the Technology Strategy Board
[normal] (TSB)
[normal] is unclear. It is presumed that there is coordina
[normal]tion between these funding programme
[normal]s regarding the technical 
[normal]requirements in
[normal] calls for proposals. However, an outsider to the process can have poor visibility and understanding of this. For example, it is not clear under what circumstances a proposal should be submitted to the NTSP rather than the TSB.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5/[bold]              [bold]How resilient is the UK’s space-based infrastructure? Are threats from space debris or solar activity being appropriately mitigated? What role do, or should, ESA and the UK Space Agency play in addressing these issues?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]/
[normal]              
[normal]One of the leading international organisations for addressing the space debris problem is the Inter Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC). This is 
[normal]an international governmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities related to the issues of man-made and natural debris in space. Recently 
[normal]IADC has studied the stability of the debris population in low Earth Orbit and found that the population is likely
[normal] to increase by approximately
[normal] 30% in the next 200 years. This projection assumes 90% implementation of mitigation measures in the design and operation of spacecraft (which is not currently achieved). 
[normal]In view of this result, the IADC observes that t
[normal]wo key elements 
[normal]are 
[normal]required for the long-term sustainability o
[normal]f the future LEO environment.
[normal] 
[normal]The first defence is to encourage greater compl
[normal]iance with mitigation measures (
[normal]such as those contained in the IADC’s space debris mitigation guidelines or 
[normal]the 
[normal]ISO 24113
[normal] standard)
[normal]. 
[normal]Secondly, active debris rem
[normal]oval (ADR) should be considered.
[normal] The IADC study concludes that 
[normal]“
[normal]the international community should initiate an effort to investigate the benefits of environment remediation, explore various options, and support the development of the most cost-effective technologies in preparation for actions to better preserve the near-Earth environment for future generations
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]2/
[normal]              
[normal]Active debris removal brings with it many challenges. Aside from the technical difficulties in 
[normal]safely 
[normal]removing debris, there are also political, legal and financial hurdles to be overcome.
[normal] The UKSA should make a 
[normal]meaningful contribution towards finding solutions to all of these problems. For example, on the technical side, the UK has 
[normal]significant 
[normal]expertise in a number of areas, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]3/
[normal]              
[normal]The UKSA should encourage 
[normal]and support 
[normal]the dev
[normal]elopment of promising new 
[normal]debris mitigation / remediation 
[normal]ideas, particularly those emerging from SMEs
[normal]. Otherwise there is
[normal] a risk that other countries will
[normal] benefit from the UK’s innovations. At least one such idea is on t
[normal]he verge of being lost
[normal] from
[normal] the UK because of a lack of
[normal] 
[normal]funding
[normal] opportunities
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]4/
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] UK Space Agency
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]has 
[normal]a long-standing obligation
[normal] to participate in international forums addressing the space debris problem. It h
[normal]as satisfied this obligation
[normal] with the help of a small number of experts who have provided the UKSA with technical support and advice on space debris matters for a number of years. 
[normal]As a result the UKSA has been able to take a leading role in the development of international debris mitigation guidelines and standards, such as those published by the IADC, UN and ISO. This work is on-going, and has now been expanded to include recommendations relating to active debris removal (ADR). To ensure the UK can continue to have a positive influence on these activities, and therefore protect the commercial interests of 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]space 
[normal]industry, it is very important that such representat
[normal]ion is maintained. However
[normal], budgetary pressures within the UKSA in recent years have reduced funding for the expert support to a point where meanin
[normal]gful participation has been
[normal] jeopardized.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]5/
[normal]              
[normal]The UK cannot afford to w
[normal]alk away from its obligations in
[normal] 
[normal]these 
[normal]international debris mitigation forums if it is serious about g
[normal]rowing the space sector to achieve a £40 billion turnover by 2030
[normal]. Activities such as monitoring and modelling the debris environment, and standardizing 
[normal]spacecraft design and operations to mitigate debris are inseparably bound with this economic aspiration. The UKSA should therefore reaffirm its commitment to international space debris mitigation efforts via the IADC, UN and ISO, and take immediate measures to reverse the decline in funding support for expert participation in these forums.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]6/
[normal]              
[normal]ESA’s 
[normal]funding of the space debris problem has been variable during the past decade
[normal]. Approximately 10 years ago, a
[normal] 
[normal]management 
[normal]decision was made to 
[normal]curtail
[normal] funding of 
[normal]space debris 
[normal]resear
[normal]ch
[normal]. The rationale for the decision is unclear. Since no serious collisions had happened up to that point, perhaps there was a perception that debris was not a significant problem that deserved funding. 
[normal]In contrast,
[normal] 
[normal]ESA
[normal] debris experts
[normal] at that time were predicting that 
[normal]collisions would be likely to start within a few years (based on 
[normal]simulat
[normal]ions from long-term debris environment evolution models). As it happened, the first major 
[normal]accidental 
[normal]collis
[normal]ion took place in February 2009
[normal] and the environment has deteriorated substantially since then. It is worth noting that ESA funding of 
[normal]space debris research has increas
[normal]ed
[normal] noticeably
[normal] in the past coupl
[normal]e of years
[normal]. This is a welcome development. 
[normal]However, given the level of concern about the debris problem
[normal] now
[normal], perhaps there is
[normal] 
[normal]scope for further improvement
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]7/
[normal]              
[normal]Finally, w
[normal]ithin ESA, technical experts are currently studying options for actively removing the 
[normal]Envisat
[normal] satellite from orbit. 
[normal]Envisat
[normal],
[normal] one of the la
[normal]rgest spacecraft to be launched,
[normal] orbits in a very popular and populous region 
[normal]of
[normal] 
[normal]low E
[normal]arth orbit
[normal]. After 10 years of operation i
[normal]t suffered a 
[normal]sudden and irrecoverable
[normal] failure last year
[normal] and, as a result, became 
[normal]one of the
[normal] most hazardous debris objects in LEO.
[normal] 
[normal]Unfortunately, 
[normal]Envisat
[normal] will now remain in orbit for well over a century unless 
[normal]ESA can find some method 
[normal]to remove it
[normal] safely
[normal].
[normal] Space debris experts in the UK are also considering possible solutions to this problem.
