"&#xa0;\nHealth \nCommittee\nOral evidence:\n \n2013 accountability hearing with the Nursing and Midwifery Council\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published on \n8\n October 2013.\nWritten evidence from witnesses:\n–\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNursing and Midwifery Council\nWatch th\ne\n meeting\nMembers present: \nMr Stephen \nDorrell\n (Chair); Rosie Cooper; Andrew George; Barbara \nKeeley\n; David \nTredinnick\n; Valerie \nVaz\n; Dr Sarah Wollaston\nQuestions\n 1\n–\n100\nWitnesses:\n \nMark Addison CB, Chair, and \nJackie Smith, Chief Executive and Registrar, Nursing and Midwifery Council, gave evidence.\nQ1 &#xa0; \nChair:\n Good \nafternoon and thank you for coming. We are somewhat depleted this afternoon because some of my colleagues want to participate i\nn question and answer on the F\nloor of the House on press self\n&#x2011;\nregulation\n—\nsays he, choosing his words carefully\n—\nso would ask to present their apologies. Could you very briefly introduce yourselves? I think you have both been before the Committee before.\nMark Addison:\n \nIndeed. My name is Mark Addison. I am the chair of t\nhe NMC and this is Jackie Smith, \nthe chief executive.\nQ2 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you very much. You are probably aware that we saw the Professional Standards Authority in July and their assessment suggested that the NMC was making some progress toward\ns\n an improved registration/regulation service\n,\n which gives you some external view \nof progress being made, b\nut I wondered how you rate your own progress. Self\n&#x2011;\nassessment\n might be more demanding than external assessment.\nMark Addison: \nThank you\n.\n \nT\nhat gives me a good cue\n \nto say the first few words I thought I might say\n—to do a bit of scene setting—\nat the beginning. Then, if it is acceptable to the Committee, the\nre are two specific areas \nI think it would be helpful if Jackie could flag up initially and then we can move on to the more specific areas you may want to cover. It will be very brief.\nChair: \nPlease, yes.\nMark Addison: \nThe first piece does play exa\nctly to that, I think, Chair. \nThe points I want to make are about the progress we have made, which will play to the news I hope t\nhat you have heard from the PSA, and\n the challenges in the year to come and beyond. \nI\nt also might be sensible to clear up right at the outset my own and indeed Jackie\n’\ns position. It was a specific recommendation that the Committee made last year and I thought it might be useful to get that out on the table up\n \nfront. \nOn progress\n we are just over halfway through the two\n&#x2011;\nyear timetable, effectively, that\n \nthe PSA\n, as it is now, \ngave us to get our act together. We are 14 months into that period. My view is that we have delivered some sound an\nd solid progress against all \nthe recommendations in that initial report. The areas I would highlight particularly \nthat\n the PSA dealt with concern clarity of purpose, the governance of the organisation\n—\nwe have, of course, a new slimmed\n&#x2011;\ndown\n council\n—\nthe performance on some \naspects but by no means all \naspects of fitness to practise, which we will no doubt come on to in more detail, financial stability and capacity. The culture of the organisation and the mood of the staff I\n think have improved—\nJac\nkie will say a word about that—\nand we have also strengthened relationships with external stakeholders. Those are all things that the PSA mentioned where we have made some solid and sound progress. That has enabled us to begin to think about getting beyond the engine\n&#x2011;\nroom\n fixing stage that I described last year to thinking more generally about the protection of the public and how that can be strengthened \nand what our role is in that. \nThe \n“\nchallenges ahead\n”\n moves on absolutely seamlessly from that analysis, I think. First o\nf all there is still \nvery clearly unfinished\n \nbusiness around some aspects of performance. On the FTP front that is essentially around the adjudication timetable. We have a target of getting that down to six months, as you know, by the end of the next calendar year; that remains a big challenge. There is still a mountain to climb in relation to adjudication. We also have work to do to complete the review, \nand the \ndevelopment of new policy on and ensuring compliance with registration processes, which we are well advanced on but there\n is still further work to do. \nM\nore substantively, \nbeyond that, we have a big agenda around public protection\n,\n which is linked to the Francis report. So in the coming year we will be focusing very much on revalidation, the review of the code and the standards, the strengthening of coll\naboration with other regulators and on\n developing a more proactive presence across the four countries out there\n,\n closer to the front line and to employers\n.\n \nT\nhat agenda\n, I think, \nwill \nnot just \noccupy us for \nthe following year but \na good deal beyond \nthat. \nIf I may, I will finally say a word about my own and Jackie\n’\ns position\n,\n to set out where we have got to. My original appointment was for 18 months, which would have taken me up to the middle of March next year. Following a discussion with the council and then with the Department, the current intention is that my appointment would be extended until the end of the next calendar year, so until the end of 2014. There would then be an open competition to find a successor\n,\n which would start up effectively in the second half of next year, to complete and find a successor by the close of the calendar year. As to Jackie\n’\ns position, when we were last before \nyou \nshe was the substantive chief executive. She is now the permanently appointed substantive chief executive of the NMC, I am delight\ned to say. If Jackie could \nhave a couple of minutes of your time on two items\n—\n  \nJackie Smith: \nI promise not t\no take up too much time, Chair, if I can just \nraise two points. As Mark said, the Committee understandably probed us last year on the culture of the organisation. We have done quite \na bit in the last year. We \ncarried out a staff survey which I \nthink underlines that the organ\nisation understands its purpose:\n 94% of staff responded saying they understood the ai\nms and objectives of the NMC. \nThe second thing\n is in relation to revalidation. I hope the Committee will have seen that council approved the proposals for the model for validation in September\n. O\nbviously we will answer questions.\nQ3 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWe will certainly come on to revalidation. I want to start, if I may, by going back to some of the discussion of last year about the fitness\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\npractise\n process. The Royal College of Nu\nrsing has talked to individual m\nembers of the Committee and submitted evidence to the effect that some cases are still taking up to five years to resolve. \nI am not suggesting there are\n large numbers, but any number that takes that long I assume you would agree is unacceptable. \nJackie Smith: I think we \nsaid in evidence previously that we had 1,589 cases that were opened before January 2011. We had a target to complete those by December 2014. We currently have 44 left, 41 of which have be\nen scheduled for a hearing. T\nhe case load, aside from that, came into existence after January 2011. \nT\nhe cases that we have been dealing with in recent months have been the most difficult because they are the oldest and I completely accept that is too long, but I think we can demonstrate that we have improved significantly in clearing the historic case load.\nQ4 &#xa0; \nChair: \nApart\n from that 44, you have no case from before the beginning of 2012. \nJackie Smith: \nExcept where there are \nthird-party investigations. I\nf there is a police investigation being carried out, we will wait until that concludes. There will be some cases, but not very many.\nQ5 &#xa0; \nChair: \nDo you know how many?\nJackie Smith: \nI can certainly update the Committee afterwards with that figure.\nQ6 &#xa0; \nChair: \nGiven the history, in terms of confidence building, apart from anything else, as well as performance management, it would be helpful to be able to say, \n“\nWe know every single case that exists from before 2012,\n”\n which is now nearly two years away.\nJackie Smith: \nI can certainly update the Committee afterwards on that figure\n, but I \nassure you it is small.\nQ7 &#xa0; \nChair: Then we go on to what is acceptable \nfor the future. Could you c\nlarify to the Committee \nyour current thinking about acceptable performance for \nboth investigation and decision,\n because if y\nou are an individual registrant\n the key thing is t\nhe length of time to a decision?\nJackie Smith: \nAbsolutely. At the moment, on average, it takes us just over eight months to investigate a complaint. Two years ago it was taking us 22 months. On average, at the moment it is taking us just over seven month\ns\n to adjudicate a case. That has not changed hugely, although it has come down. That partly reflects the sheer volume that we have in the adjudication stage. \nOn\n average at the moment it is taking us just over 15 months. With the introduction of case examiners, thanks to the Department of Health helping us with our legal framework, the investigation stage should be quicker\n, but I am afraid that, \nuntil we get the Law Commission \nat the table\n and are able to dispose o\nf cases other than at a hearing,\n we are not going to do a great deal to shorten the adjudication part.\nQ8 &#xa0; \nChair: \nTaking the two stages separately, what do you think is a reasonable objective in terms of an adjudication time scale?\nJackie Smith: \nA reasonable objective is six months. We would like to get it down from that position, but we cannot bring it down until we have alternative methods of disposing of cases.\nQ9 &#xa0; \nChair: Focusing for a second on that small word \nyou used, \n“\naverage\n”\n, averages conceal a lot of evils. What is the maximum period of time that it should take you to investigate a case?\nJackie Smith: \nWe want to get to 15 months by the end of 2015.\nQ10 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThat i\ns the maximum for investigation.\nJackie Smith: A\nnd adjudicatio\nn—from start to finish.\nQ11 &#xa0; \nChair: M\naximum, not average? The reason I am pushing you is that some of the papers that have been presented to us, I think, have confused \n“\nmaximum\n”\n and \n“\naverage\n”\n.\nJackie Smith: \nYes.\nMark Addison: \nAbsolutely. We were rather conscious of that. The Committee\n’\ns recommendations last year were couched largely in terms of timetables in terms of averages\n,\n with the important proviso that no case should take longer than a certain amount, which is one way of doing it. In fact, the way we have set targets is a combination of those two notions and requires us to complete 90% of cases within a certain time\n \nframe. These averages and 90% figures are quite hard to compare. Jackie has been using the language that the Committee used around averages, but it does leave open the risk that you can have a very long tail, which is why, in a sense, it is quite helpful to thin\nk of the target that Jackie \nmentioned of 90%, or the vast majority of cases, being within 15 months, which we think is achievable\n—\nperhaps I could just clarify this\n—\nwith the benefit of the \nsection 60 \nchanges that we have been promised by the Department\n, which\n will allow us to introduce case examiners as well as the right to review investigation decisions. That is what we think we can achieve with the current policy commitments. What we can achieve with the other changes \nthat\n may come with the Law Commission is a different matter and will enable us to get within striking distance, if not achieve, the sort of average timetable that the Committee was talking about last year.\nQ12 &#xa0; \nChair: What I would \nfind helpful\n—\nand I hope my colleagues\n on the Committee would—is \nto receive from you a statement of what you think is a reasonable definition\n \nof key performance indicators for fitness\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\npractise\n procedures\n,\n given the state of the current law and \nrecommendations for the future, \nhow you think that KPI should be formulated, reflecting what I think would be the Committee\n’\ns view that it is one thing to have an average or a 90% indicator but if you are an individual nurse the thing that matters most is the guarantee that the case will be disposed of, on a worst case, within a given time scale. \nMark Addison: \nYes, understood. We are very happy to do that and we will try and make it clear when we are talking about averages, when we are talking about 90%, when we are talking about everything\n,\n and we will also try and be clear about what is achievable under different policy envi\nronments currently planned and, \naspiration\nally\n, \nwith the \nLaw Commission.\nChair: \nThank you very much. That would be very helpful.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nCan we move on to the Francis report? Your organisation published a full response in July 2012, including a series of actions and time scales\n:\n \n“\nTo evaluate our education standards,\n”\n \n“\nTo raise our profile,\n”\n and, third\nly\n, \n“\nTo strengthen our collaborative work with other regulators.\n” \nWhich of Francis\n’\ns recommendations are you implementing, please?\nJackie Smith: \nWe are implementing the ones \nthat\n directly impact on the NMC. You have touched on\n those—profile and \nproactivity\n \nparticularly. We will evaluate our pre\n&#x2011;\nregistration\n nursing standards, which we launched in 2010, in 2014\n,\n and we are reviewing the code in readiness for our revalidation proposals.\nQ14 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nBut do you feel you have addr\nessed those three basic points—\neducation standards, getting your profile up so that people know you exist and \nthe \nstrengthening of collaborative work with other regulators?\nJackie Smith: \nI think we have started to address them. I do not\n—\n \nQ15 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: You \ntalked about nursing standards.\nJackie Smith: \nI am sorry, I did not hear that.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nYou referred to some other points, but I wondered if yo\nu had managed yet to tackle th\ne core points that were in your response in 2012.\nJackie Smith: \nYes. We responded in July this year\n—\n2013. That was the response that went to council. We have just started to scope what improved profile and \nproactivity\n would look like and we have set out a timetable for the code and our standards.\nQ17 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nDo you think you can deliver within the resources you have?\n Is there a resources issue? D\no you feel you have enough money to do the work? Surely you are going to say no\n;\n everyone always does.\nMark Addison: \nIt is a very big question.\nJackie Smith: \nWe have evaluated the cost of the Francis recommendations that impact directly on the NMC. We have been clear about the cost of revalidation to the NMC. There is a different discussion around fees. I have no doubt that this Committee will want to come back to that, but we are happy to remind the Committee of the decision that council took last October when it made the very difficult decision to increase fees from £76 to £100 with, obviously, support from the Gove\nrnment. Our current priorities—\nwhat we h\nave said we will set out to do—\nare affordable.\nQ18 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nYou have set out your stall and the various actions you are taking, but what overall can the NMC do to prevent another Mid Staff\ns\n?\nJackie Smith: \nI think there are many things that we can do better. We have to \nwork alongside nurse directors. O\nne of the proposals we are making\n is\n to have regional officers. We have to work better with the CQC in England\n, and\n the system regulators in the other countries too. We need to make better use of our data and we need to identify areas that represent a high risk. All those things will help us identify if there is another Mid Staff\ns. T\nhere is plenty the NMC can do, is doing or is working towards doing.\nMark Addison: \nCan I add to that list one thing that we have been \naddressing \nrecently, which is other registrants being prepared to raise concerns and encouraging them to come forward? One of the striking \nthings for me about Mid Staff\ns was the number of cases that went through our fitness\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\npractise\n regime \nthat\n we ourselves referred rather than them coming from the trust or colleagues there. It is an interesting and concerning point\n,\n and we are \ntrying to place\n a lot more emphasis on encouraging and enabling nurses and midwives to see that part of their responsibility is to alert employers and, if necessary, us to failures of practice out there.\n That should help resolve it.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nTalking of failures of practice, how many cases from Mid Staff\ns\n do you still have ongoing?\nJackie Smith: \nThe precise number I do not have to hand, but I can provide the Committee with it. We have a number that are in the queue for\n a hearing. There are some which\n have been adjourned and are coming back for a decision in November.\nMark Addison: \nThere have been 55 in total.\nQ20 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nWith this new regime you have, how are you going to get the information out about the lessons that have been learned? Do you have a plan to disseminate the lessons that come out of these cases?\nJackie Smith: Recently we \nlooked at our FTP data over the last 18 months, looked at the cases that were closed by an investigating committee and closed or dealt with at a final panel and said, \n“\nThis needs to feed into the code. This is part of the code review.\n”\n If there are areas where our registrants are falling foul of the code, we need to strengthen the code and make it clear. That is part of the lessons learned work.\nQ21 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nMay I as\nk a question about revalidation? \nPlans for revalidation of nurses have been ongoing for a very long time. What are your plans for revalidation? Are you confident that delivering this model\n—\nI think there is a model, is there not,\n \nfor revalidation\n—\nby 2015 will not jeopardise your ability to deliver your core function of regulating fitness to practise?\nJackie Smith: I would say that o\nur core function is continuing fitness to practise, which in effect is what revalidation is proposing to deliver. We have proposed that we build on the existing structure\ns—appraisal—\nas a way of assuring continuing fitness to practise\n,\n and I think that is a sensible model for the NMC, with the size of its register, to take forward.\nMark Addison: \nI would simply add the point that, essentially, your concern and the questio\nn you ask is a fair one for an \norganisation that is struggling to do some of its basic processes adequately and \nI quite understand why you \nraised it. The council\n’\ns judgment, when \nit\n looked at the revalidation proposals, was that the organisation had got itself into a position\n—\nhad achieved a sufficient degree of recovery, if you like\n—\nto begin to take on some new responsibilities as long as they were carefully prioritised\n and\n thought through. The council clearly will watch very carefully to see how that process rolls out to the end of 2015. But you are right\n—\nI think I made the point when I made my opening remarks\n: \no\nur capacity and capability need\n to be at \na\n point where we can begin to take on new work\n,\n and there are new things now on our agenda.\nQ22 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nFine. \nBut w\nhen I asked about resources, you certainly did not say, \n“\nYes, we need more money.\n” You seemed—dare I say it?—\nalmost \ncomplacent about your funding.\nMark Addison: \nI do not quite know what to say in response to that, given that\n—\n \nDavid Tredinnick: Well, c\nomment on what I have said.\nMark Addison: \nResources are a huge and important issue for us. Maybe I could say a word about our financial strategy, which I think is the framework within which we work. The council last year agreed a financial strategy for three years\n,\n which was based on a certain level of income from fees. It factored in the £20 million grant from the Department and it made an assumption that the fee level would be such as to generate, effectively, £120\n&#x2011;\nworth of fee income a year over the next three years. That is the assumption on which it is based. Within that envelope, every commitment we have made \nh\nas been \ncosted\n and added. \nE\nvery time the council is asked to consider a proposal, the executive have to satisfy the council that it is affordable within that financial envelope. That is the discipline that we are working to \nat present and it is very clear. It is very\n well set\n out and very well understood, s\no you can be assured that any of the commitments that we have publicly committed to are affordable within that cost envelope. But that does only take us to 2015\n&#x2011;\n16.\nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you very much.\nQ23 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan I jog you back a stage to when you were discu\nssing your response to Francis—\nthat you are going to evaluate your\n education standards? Do you have\n any comment to offer on the Government\n’\ns view that before nurses go on a degree course they should have experience on the ward?\nJackie Smith: \nWe know that most applicants or students who want to be nurses and midwives have prior experience\n,\n and we encourage universities to take account of prior experience. I cannot produce evidence to say\n, “T\nhis is the number who have had prior experience,\n”\n but from what we know a good proportion do.\nQ24 &#xa0; \nChair: \nAre you engaged with the Government on the evolution of this policy?\nJackie Smith: \nYes.\nQ25 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThey are runnin\ng\n pilots, as I understand it.\nJackie Smith: They are. T\nhat is right. We are a member of the steering group and we are very keen to see what develops.\nQ26 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou envisage being involved in the crystallisation of this proposal as part of your thinking about your own education requirements presumably.\nJackie Smith: \nIndeed. It is a statutory responsibility for us and we are very keen to play an active part.\nMark Addison: \nCould I add a \n“\nfour country\n”\n po\nint here because it is relevant? One of the things that we \nneeded to address is that most of the reviews, of which there have been a large number in the last year, are England\n-\nbased. We set standards across the UK and therefore we need to be very much aware that \nif we are to change \nour requirements or standards \nthey \nare \ngoing to have to work in all of the four countries of the UK, not just England. That puts us in a slightly different position when we are evaluating pilots in relation to an England\n exercise from\n some of the other folk around the table.\nQ27 &#xa0; \nChair: \nDoes it follow \nthat \nyou have to have exactly the same arrangements for education, fitness to practise, registration and revalidation in all the four home countries?\nMark Addison: \nIt might be implemented and interpreted in different ways, but the basic standards are UK\n&#x2011;\nwide\n.\nJackie Smith: \nYes. \nQ28 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: While we are o\nn the Francis report, your \nrole is to take up \nthe individual cases, which David asked you about a moment ago, and you said you have 55 that are currently at various stages of investigation. Having looked at the report itself and recognising that in many cases nurses were reporting issues of concern, \none of the themes you \npicked up is the need to make sure that, in their professional role, they should feel \nconfident\n to be able to report to their em\nployers. In terms of \ntaking that forward, are you content that nurses have that confidence\n and—\none of the outcomes of the work you have done on Francis\n—\nthat they are reporting more than perhaps they have in the past? Are you picking \nthat up\n where there are concerns?\nJackie Smith: T\nhat is very difficult to quantify. One of the reasons why we decided to \nrelaunch\n our guidance \non raising concerns was that \nwe felt there was a need to remind nurses and midwives of their responsibility to raise concerns where they see them. We need to look at what comes our way\n,\n take stock and see if i\nt does actually make a difference\n. The guidance is very important and we need to continue talking about the important role that registrants play.\nQ29 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nTaking that a stage further, if they are reporting those concerns, are you able to distinguish in your role as the NMC in maintaining and keeping watch on professional standards between where there is a failure of clinical practice of them as professionals and where\n—\na clear theme running through the Francis report time and time again\n—\nit is a resource issue, in other words, where there are insufficient nurses on the ward? The complaint was that nurses felt th\ney were being left unsupported—\nnot that their colleagues were being unprofessional but that there were not enough of them in certain circumstances. Are you able to distinguish between\n them\n, and is it appropriate that you should keep an eye on, as it were, the resource itself rather than the failure to meet professional standards?\nJackie Smith: \nIf I may say so, the whole issue of staffing levels and resources and what is an appropriate number is an interesting question. Our role, as you know, is protecting the public\n.\n \nT\nhe code says, \n“\nIt is your duty to put the care of your patient first.\n”\n Where you are not able to do that, or where you feel you cannot do it or are not being listened to, we are encouraging those individuals to raise those concerns, for employers to take a look at what is acceptable locally. It is very difficult for \nus as a regulator to enter \na territory where, frankly, we may be completely unsighted on what the issues are.\nQ30 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: This leads to my \nquest\nion; \nit is all runn\ning together, I think. You \nmentioned the guidance, but there is a balance to be achieved between cases that should be resolved locally and those which need regulatory action. Yet the guidance that you have just referred to is published on raising concerns mainly with employers rather than directly with \nyourselves. Going back to Francis, how can you help a nurse in Helene Donnelly\n’s position in Mid Staffs? S\nhe tried to raise concerns locally but she was not listened to\n.\n How is it helpful if you are putting out guidance to say \nto people in that position, as\n she was, \n“\nComplain to your employer,\n”\n and then your employer does not listen to \nyou? There is a difficulty\n, is\nn’t there\n, if the failure extends to a failure to listen \nto people, as was the case\n? It is not enough, is it, to say, \n“\nRaise it first with your employer,\n”\n because people may be in a position of \ntrying for \nmonths and failing to get anywhere with\n their employer, or they just give up.\n That is the worst case. They may think, \n“\nNobody is listening to me and I am not going to persist with it.\n”\nJackie Smith: \nAbsolutely\n,\n and that was the case in Helene Donnelly\n’\ns position.\n What we are trying to say \nis that there will be many situations where you can resolve it locally. It may not represent a patient safety issue but where it does and you feel you are not being listened to, escalate it. Where we come in is in supporting nurse directors.\nQ31 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nHow do you do that? That is the point.\nJackie Smith: \nIt is the regional adviser model, so working alongside, understanding where the low\n&#x2011;\nlevel concerns are and tackling them before they become an issue \nthat\n it is too late to deal with.\nQ32 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nIf we take the other aspect of this, the public being involved\n—\nthe public who Francis described as \n“\nthe prime and most valuable source of information about the conduct of nurses\n,”\n clearly the people on the wards with their family members who can see failures in nursing\n—\nyou are talking about \nrelaunching\n your website next year with guidance for the public, but is that information about your role going to be made available to patients as well as it is to others\n? That is what Francis recommended.\n \nH\now are you going to measure whether you become more visible to patients and to the public? Otherwise, you are missing that valuable source of information\n,\n which he stressed was a good source of information about the conduct of nurses.\nJackie Smith: \nI do not think we are at the point where we could say that our visibility is such that members of the public \nwould be\n aware of what our role is. I think we have a way to go.\nQ33 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nHow will \nyou measure it once you start\n? Obviously \nthere are actions \nyou are taking next year. How will you be able to measure it?\nJackie Smith: If we see a\nn increase in referrals \nit \nwill indicate that we are having an impact\n,\n and that is what I expect will happen. When we are based locally and we are supporting nurse directors and others, I think what you will find is that our visibility will be increased and it may well lead to an incr\nease in referrals, as it did \nat the GMC when they ro\nlled out affiliates locally. \nI think that \nis one measurement\n. I am sure there will be others, but it is in the early stages of our thinking at the moment.\nMark Addison: \nI suppose there will also be feedback from patient groups\n,\n \nand that could be valuable. I \nhope that the regional officers\n—\nthey are a plan, by the way\n; they\n are not in place yet\n—\nwould have access to local patient networks that would also provide us with s\nofter intelligence\n about the effectiveness of that strategy. Maybe it is jus\nt worth saying that \nin two weeks\n’\n time, on 24 October, \nthe council will \nspe\nnd \na day thinking about our forward strategy over the next five years: what we should be prioritising, how we should be beginning to put some measures around it and assessing our own progress. We have been focused on fixing the basics so far. We now need to start thinking a bit longer term about the forward direction \nfor the organisation. \nI\nssues around how we determine what our priorities should be and how we assess and measure progress against them will be very much something that they will want to have in their sights on the 24th and beyond. We are aiming to come up with a product from all this work to coincide with the beginning of the next planning year.\nQ34 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nBefore I ask my question, can I pose a question fol\nlowing on from what Barbara \nsaid about local resolution? What would\n you say to nurses, for example\n in Liverpool\n,\n complaining about the senior management of their trust \nand \nwho, therefore, would be complaining\n—\nand have done\n—\nto the very people they are complaining about? I unders\ntand the Royal College of Nursing\n and Unison are taking a joint grievance. What would you say to those nurses who are very concerned? I will not go into the detailed medical bit, but, for example, they cannot get investments in certain wards, yet the trust have just moved into the most plush headquarters\n. We would be very envious of tho\nse and we will find how much they cost in due course. \nU\nsing your regulatory purpo\nse, these nurses have concerns—\nthe practi\nce of the trust, the Liverpool c\nommunity \nt\nrust and t\nheir wards and everything else—so h\now would \n“\njust complain locally\n”\n sort that out?\nJackie Smith: I\nf nurses are seeing a system operating \nthat\n is impacting on patient safety, \nwe would say \nthat is an issue for us. We try to reflect in the guidance that there are different levels of concern\ns \nand we hope that the vast majority that\n a nurse or a midwife encounters\n can be resolved locally\n; where they\n cannot\n \nand patients are being put at risk, \ni\nt is a regulatory matter.\nQ35 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nBut we want nurses to speak up\n—\nJackie Smith: \nWe do.\nQ36 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nAnd \nnot just about \n“\nat risk\n”\n incidents. In fact, I was involved in what would have been an untoward\n incident, had it happened—\nit was that close\n. M\ny dad spent a month in hospital this summer and they did not have his notes; they e\nnded in 2007, so six years \npassed for an 88\n&#x2011;\nyear\n&#x2011;\no\nld man and nobody knew. There we\nre some serious things, but that did not become an untoward incide\nnt because I sorted it out. W\nhere staff are concerned\n—\nwhat we now have too is the Royal College and other people\n—\nI think you have a role and I wonder how you are really connecting with the people out there\n,\n because they are not compla\nining about individual nurses; t\nhey are saying, \n“We are really worried.”\n \nD\no you think you have a role there?\nJackie Smith: \nWe have to encourage individuals to speak up. I think that is the point you are making. We have to do that. We cannot simply say that it is not a matter for us. If there are issues that impact on public protection, then we have a role to play and we have to work alongside the other playe\nrs in the field. We \nneed to do that, but fundamentally we cannot erode our primary function, which is protecting the public.\nQ37 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nI will stop on that, but let me tell you that some people have been moved on, some feel bullied and some feel that if they make further complaints their jobs will be in jeopardy and nobody once ever mentioned the NMC. I put it to you that that is something to be concerned about.\nJackie Smith: \nI agree.\nQ38 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nNow I can go to \nthe question I should be asking—\nit almost \nimp\ninges on tha\nt—which is\n the NMC \n“\nshould not have to wait until a disaster has occurred to intervene.\n”\n You rejected that recommendation and I wonder why you did that\n. D\no you think you need to be a more proactive regulator?\nJackie Smith: I\nn fact we accepted entirely what Robert Francis said and that is a quote from his report. We entirely accept th\nat we need to raise our profile and\n be more proactive \nin \npromoting what the NMC does. I am sorry if we have left you with the impression that we\n rejected that. I\nt is absolutely not the position of the NMC.\nQ39 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nYou rejected the recommendation that the NMC should be better equipped to investigate situations where concerns about nursing fitness to practise appear across the health system.\nJackie Smith: \nI think what we\n rejected was stepping into \nterritory which is for the CQC, but that does not mean to say that we would not want to work alongside the CQC where we see systemic problems.\nQ40 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nDoes the fact that the CQC does not have a director of nursing affect how you operate in the liaison with the CQC?\nJackie Smith: \nI do not think their personalities or positions affect the way in which we are operating with them. We are about to sign another MOU with the CQC. We are doing a significant amount of work with them. We are in the middle of visiting the trusts that are on the Keogh list, so our relationship with the CQC is better than it has been. I do not think their positions there affect our relationship.\nQ41 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nBut in response to Francis you say that you will improve the memoranda of understanding between the regulators, but the Professional Standards Authority says that is not enough\n,\n and good communication across each level must exist\n—\ncase managers and staff teams. How would you des\ncribe your main channels of day-to-\nday communication with the other regulators?\nJackie Smith: It is at various levels. S\nometimes it is at the highest level\n,\n when Mark and I meet with the chair a\nnd chief executive of the CQC. B\nut it operates at a local level and it is sometimes the regional inspectors; it is sometimes staff below that level. All sorts of different staff are involved in \nthe CQC \ninspections and we have daily contact with them.\nRosie Cooper: \nWhat we are really looking for almost is that the information flow just happens automatically at each of those levels.\nQ42 &#xa0; \nChair: Can I develop tha\nt \nfor \na moment? The area that we are interested in is the extent to which the NMC is developing a proactive professional regulator role of the \nkind\n that the GMC is in the process of developing. I am not suggesting they have got it right or perfect, but for various reasons they seem further down the road of developing networks to give them the necessary information to be an effecti\nve preventa\ntive regulator rather than simply waiting till the case is presented for investigation.\nJackie Smith: \nThat is exactly the position that we are in. The GMC are further down the road. They have been operating the model of affiliates for some time now. We are only just about to launch that next yea\nr, but it does not stop us \nhaving conversations with the CQC \nand sharing information, which is what we are doing. \nW\ne are trying to move to the position that the GMC is in and has been in for a while, but we are not there yet.\nMark Addison: \nThe relationship between the professional regulators and the systems regulators in the form of the CQC in \nEngland\n is clearly a critical one. To go back to the point about why we were reluctant to get drawn into assuming powers of inspection and so on\n, we think \nbroadly \nthere is a \nclear distinction between our own focus on individuals and the CQC focus on systems. \nW\ne have to make sure between us that there are no gaps between the two and that, as you say, the collaborative arrangements work at every level. \nMy strong sense over the last year is that those linkages are getting stronger all the time and there are practical results now, as Jackie says, around the way we are visiting Keogh sites and providing the CQC with intelligence and they are providing us with intelligence\n,\n which I do not think would have happened pre\n&#x2011;\nFrancis\n. So there are steps being taken in that direction. We will \nprobably \ngo\n rather more carefully\n and \nmodestly initially\n around developing proactive capability simply because we are an organisation coming out of a troubled and challenged past and we do not want to start taking on r\nemits and setting targets \nwe think we might not be able to meet. We have been very clear that we are only going to adopt ambitions if we are confident they can be delivered. But there will be a serious programme of pilot activity, as Jackie says, for these regional offices with a view to completing the roll\n&#x2011;\nout\n of that in 2015. That will be a significant development for us.\nQ43 &#xa0; \nChair: \nLinking that to the discussion we were just having with Andrew George, do you agree with the proposition that in a better developed world it simply is not a defence for a nurse, a doctor or any other registered professional to say, \n“\nThe staffing here was inadequate,\n”\n if they knew the facts and did not raise the concern before the event?\nJackie Smith: \nAbsolutely.\nMark Addison: \nAbsolutely.\nQ44 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou said \nthat\n quietly, but \nthe word\n \n“\nabsolutely\n”\n \nis very important—\na fundamental part of what it means to be a professional in a modern hospital.\nMark Addison: \nYes, and it goes back to the raising concerns point and the routes available to people to r\naise issues—\nif not with their employer, with us directly\n—\nand their willingness to do so.\nRosie Cooper: If I may come in\n, it is really important that I recount to you\n—\nnot necessarily which executive\n—\nthat I had a discussion with a chief executive of a hospital recently about Salford hospital\n’s record on\n saying whatever number of staff they need for the case mix on ward\ns\n each day. I asked the chief executive about it and he said, \n“\nWhat do you want me to do\n—\nfrighten everybody by letting them see\n”—\nthis is the chief executive\n—“\nthat we do not have enough nurses on each of those wards every day?\n”\n And there you are saying what you have just said and a chief executive can acknowle\ndge to an MP that he knows \nthose wards do not \nhave enough nurses, he hasn’t\n got them and is not going to get them, \nsaying, “\nDo you want\n me to actually tell everybody? \nI will only frighten them.\n”\n How many hospit\nals is that happening in today? \nI say that because it is very complacent to talk about what we think is going on when, on the ground, that is the reality. The absolute answer was, \n“So what do you want me to do? W\nhat?\n”\nChair: What the Committee \nsaid in its most recent report is, \n“\nYes, it is his job to publish that information because, without it, nurses and doctors cannot discharge their professional obligations.\n”\n It is a very straightforward answer: yes.\nRosie Cooper: \nAbsolutely, but the reality is that that is what is going on out there.\nQ45 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nAt the risk of us having a conversation among ourselves and not asking you a question, I would like to know this. You said \n“\nabsolutely\n”\n, that of course nurses should be reporting their concerns about understaffing \non wards\n, but you \nknow that presupposes there is not a culture that\n actually discourages them from doing that. Do you acknowledge that there may be a culture, in some hospital settings especially, which discourages them from raising those issues\n—\nindeed, the Francis report identified this as well\n—and \nwhere there is a culture of bullying for those nurses tha\nt in fact do attempt to do that?\nJackie Smith: \nI cannot sit h\nere and say I know that a hospital there or there\n is doing that but Francis makes it absolutely clear that there are cultural problems that need to be tackled. Being open and transparent about those sorts of issues, which may well impact on patient safety, is very important, so I agree with the Chair that \n“\nyes\n”\n is the answer.\nAndrew George: I\nn a theoretical world, though.\nChair: \nNo. It is real patients.\nQ46 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nYes, but who is going to do it? \nForgive me. Y\nou are the regulator. \nJackie Smith: \nWe need to work alongside people. The point I am trying to make is that this is a serious problem.\n It is not just for the NMC. I\nt is for everyone to say, \n“\nThere is an issue here. What is it and what is the best way of tackling it?\n”\n Our remit is public protection. If that impacts on public protection, then \nobviously \nthere are responsibilities at every level in that organisation to deal with it and that is what we would expect.\nRosie Cooper: \nBut this is like when we had Jane Cummings \nsitting\n where you are and\n—\nI cannot remember which organisation\n—I think it was\n \nthe \nCQC who said that 14 hospitals did not have enough nurses and I asked her what she\n,\n the chief nurse\n,\n was doing about it. \nShe was waiting for reports. Hello? Waiting for reports?\n \nShe is the chief nurse. F\norgive me, you are the regulator and we are going to have lots of other different people. I have read this and I hear that you do not have a great financial base to do all this investigation, but\n—\nthis is reality\n—\nwhen the next Francis comes, each of these regulators or people are going to be in the dock looking at each other waving flags and saying, \n“\nWe all knew a little bit, but nobody knew it all.\n”\n That is what I am trying to get across. If a chief executive absolutely knows he needs to have that number of nurses but financially he cannot or will not, or whatever you want to say, and his view is, \n“\nWell, look, are you telling me that every nurse in that hospital does not know?\n”—\nof course they know\n—\nwho is going to make that chief executive deliver the right number of nurses?\nQ47 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThe question, therefore, for the NM\nC is how should the nurse \nwho is working in that hospital\n react\n?\nMark Addison: \nYes.\nQ48 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWhat is the answer?\nJackie Smith: \nI am going to sound like a broken record. The answer is\n \nif they see that patient safety is being compromised, we would expect them to raise it\n.\nRosie Cooper: \nForgive me, when you \nsay\n things like that, it is like the TSA in housing saying, \n“We have only got two options\n—\nnuclear or we will just keep a watchful eye on it.\n” What they would say is,\n \n“\nIt is just the very fact that we are doing what we are doing, trying to make sure that patient safety is maximised.\n”\n But if you said, \n“Itemise each incident,” and they say they are just short of staff,\n the end result is \nthat\n they are not going to be able to write down a list. \nThat is why p\neo\nple do not come forward; \nthey cannot sit and itemise each of those untoward or potential\nly\n untoward incidents.\nQ49 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nCan I put it as a question? Do you have a concept that there may be circumstances \nthat\n make it difficult for nurses to report inadequate staffing levels and do you accept that in some circumstances nurses are not reporting when they should be reporting the understaffing of hospital wards\n,\n and why that may be?\nJackie Smith: \nAs I said earlier, I think, I am not in a position\n—\nI do not have the evidence\n—\nto say that there is a problem here and a problem there.\nAndrew George: \nNo.\nJackie Smith: No. \nSo I cannot say that that is my view. Staffing levels is clearly a very important issue but, fundame\nntally, i\nt is not an issue for the NMC. The NMC\n’\ns role is protecting the public. If staffing levels impact on public protection and patient safety, then\n clearly\n there is an issue that we need to be concerned about. But we are not here to determine staffing levels.\nQ50 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nI appreciate that, so you will purely take each case on its own professional merits\n, if that nurse fails in their duties.\nJackie Smith: \nIndeed.\nQ51 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: E\nven if that failure in duty may be because they are overstretched becau\nse they could not fulfil all \nthei\nr requirements because there were\n insufficient staff.\nJackie Smith: \nIt is about individuals and their responsibilities.\nQ52 &#xa0; \nChair: \nW\ne can have a final shot on this\n otherwise we are going to get stuck.\nMark Addison: \nThere is no escaping the fact that our entry point into this argument is around the nurse\n’\ns or midwife\n’\ns ability to comply with the code. If they find there are circumstances, whatever they may be\n—\nwhether they are resource driven or something else\n—\nwhere they cannot comply with the code, then they have an obligation to raise it. That would be a relevant factor in any fitness\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\npractise\n hearing. If you want to put it into a legal context, it would be a factor to surface in that context. The Helene Donnelly story is quite interesting. You may well have heard from her personally about her own story and how she \nactually \ndid go home a\nnd itemise all the issues \nsh\ne had spotted on the wards that\n were preventing her and her colleagues from complying with the code. That was the basis on which she finally gave evidence to Francis and others. It also led her, in the end, in despair to leave the trust. But it is possible to itemise.\nQ53 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYour view, if I may put words into your mouth, is that the right way of doing that is to raise it locally first and\n if there is no response\n to raise it direct with you.\nMark Addison: \nYes. \n“\nFirst\n”\n is a key word.\nQ54 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: Do you mean i\nn the \nDatex\n report on a daily basis then?\nMark Addison: \nI am sorry?\nQ55 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: I said i\nn the \nDatex\n report, which is what Helene Donnelly was doing on a regular, daily basis.\nMark Addison: \nYes, okay.\nQ56 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nWe will move on a little. Francis was clear in his view that no nurse should be \n“\ntoo posh to wash\n,”\n and repeatedly expressed concerns about the erosion of compassion and basic caring skills in nursing. You have stated that changes to nursing education and standards will address this, but, in essence, what do you do to audit whether that is translated \nin\nto actual improvements on the ground? Francis also argues that being an observer or a supernumerary on the ward does not substitute for actual experience. To go back to the question the Chairman asked\n—\ntacking it on at the end\n—\ndo you agree with the policy that people should be on the wards as part of that education process?\nJackie Smith: \nI think there is a misunderstanding about what our education standards\n actually\n deliver. The pre\n&#x2011;\nregistration\n nursing standards, which we launched in 2010, test for care and compassion. There are a number of points during the cycle that a student nurse has to go through\n,\n and care and compassion is tested as part of that process. \nT\nhat is set out in our standards. \nW\ne need \nto evaluate those standards—\nwhich we\n are proposing to do next year—\nto try and deal with the issue that what is being produced at the end is a nurse or a midwife \nwho\n fails to display the necessary care and compassion. The second point is that 50% of their learning is spent on wards. It is not 100% of the time in a classroom\n;\n 50% is spent delivering hands\n&#x2011;\non care. I think there is a misunderstanding as to what our standards deliver.\nQ57 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nThis is about the regulation of healthcare support workers, as a resu\nlt of the Francis inquiry,\n and the potential future role of the NMC with regard to expanding its responsibility to cover those professions that are coming in\n. S\nupporting nurses is very critical in taking on a number of nursing roles. Where do you see your role in the future with regard to the potential regulation of healthcare support workers in hospital settings?\nMark Addison: \nPerhaps I could say a word about that. It was obviously an important recommendation in the Francis report\n, and it\n was not accepted initially by the Government. The Government\n’\ns position is that that is not the right way forward, as you know. Francis recommended registrat\nion rather than regulation, but,\n be that as it may, the position that we adopted in front of you last year remains \nour position: t\nhe decision on regulation or registration is one for the Government\n,\n and if the Government decided that they wanted to pursue regulation or registration of healthcare support workers\n,\n the NMC would not be in a position at present to take it on. That was what we said to you last year. We are grateful\n,\n by the way\n,\n for your recognition of the force of that argument. \nSo here we are a year on and where are we on those issues? It remains the case that that is a decision for the Government and they are producing their final response to Francis, I think, \nin November. \nM\ny own view\n—\nand I have not put this to the council\n—\nand Jackie\n’s view is that, as things stand at \npresent, the absorption of that additional responsibility, which would be for at least the registration of several hundred thousand support workers\n,\n would be a step too far for the NMC given where it is on the recovery curve. However, we are on a strengthening trend. We are a year on. We have more confidence in ourselves\n \nand the outside world has more confidence in us as a regulator who is able to at least get on top of the basic responsibilities\n,\n and we are beginning to look more broadly, for all the reasons we have talked about, at the forward agenda. \nSo I do not think \nthat \nwould be our position for ever\n—that we would never be in a position to absorb that responsibility—\nbut it remains the case that we are not there yet. We would like to leave the possibility open at some future date, if that policy decision were taken by the Government, to have a good practical conversation with them about whether we were yet in a position to absorb that extra work or not.\nQ58 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nDoes it concern you, neverthel\ness, that registered nurses, whether from professional choice\n or as a result of the circums\ntances they find themselves in, are—\nadmittedly\n,\n in a supervisory role with regard to healthcare support wo\nrkers—\nrequiring or asking healthcare support workers to increasingly undertake functions \nthat\n previously were solely undertaken by registered nurses? Do you not think that it is those functions that you should be looking at rather than necessarily those registered to perform those duties?\nJackie Smith: \nThe code is clear about delegation, taking responsibility for delegating to someone who has the skills to do what you are asking them to do. On that front it is very clear. I am not sure there\n is much more we can add\n.\nMark Addison: \nWe are, of course, looking at the code, as we have explained, next year in the context of revalidation but more generally following on from Francis and the standards alongside it. One of the issues that we will be thinking about when we review the code is to make sure that it is as clear as it needs to be about delegation responsibilities and approaches. There are a number of other things we will\n want to look at carefully post-\nFrancis as well, but that will be one of them. We are not expecting to want to make major changes\n,\n but that would be a focus of the council\n’\ns attention when it comes to looking at the code.\nQ59 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: O\nn that\n—\nand it does play out to other themes\n—\na lot of your answers are based on seeing your role as policing the regulated sector and those who are registered. \nT\no what extent \nis \nthere a theme developing here in the same way \nas we were discussing \nstaffing levels earlier\n?\n Given the fact that you are looking at a s\nystem when it fails—or at least allegedly fails \nand\n,\n therefore\n,\n \na \ncomplaint is made and it reaches the NMC\n, so it must be quite significant—do you not pick up themes \nyou feel that you can then convey\n? Y\nou are in a far better position than many other people\n—\nMark Addison: \nAbsolutely, yes.\nQ60 &#xa0; \nAndrew George: \nYou can \nconvey patterns or developments that are happening within the nursing profession or across hospital settings, for example, \nbut\n it seems that you are kind of standing away from \nthat \nand simply seeing your role as\n the policeman or woman for\n those registered nurses.\nMark Addison: \nCan I say a coupl\ne of things in response \nan\nd then Jackie will want to come in? \nFirst of all, as to the policing role, it is important to look beyond fitness to practise. \nFitness to practise was described as our core function earlier. I think we have a number of core functions, one of which is the setting of education standards.\nAndrew George: Yes, of course.\nMark Addison: \nWe are working with the HEE in that territory to make sure that those responsibilities are clearly understood, as well as registration. Policing is, if you like, the FTP bit of that tripod. On the point about intelligence and analysis and making the best use of the information we have, which I think is the general territory your question was in\n—\nAndrew George: \nAbsolutely, yes.\n \nMark Addison: I\nt is a big question for the NMC. It is a big question for all the\n regulators, but it is a big question\n for us. \nI\nt is fair to say that we have lagged behind some of our fellow regulators in taking that seriously. We do have access to information and intelligence\n,\n and we can commission focused work to bolster that intelligence. We have not done a lot of that in the past. We have done some of it, but we have not done a lot. Jackie and I certainly share\n \na view that there is more we can do to use the information we have intelligently to inform our policy and practice into the future. \nI\nt will be something \nthat the council will want to think about \non \nthe\n \n24 October strategy \nday that I referred to earlier\n. I’d\n be a bit surprised if one of their major preoccupations over the next few years \nwas not \nto strengthen our capacity to analyse information and make informed decisions using the information, as I say, that we have ourselves\n—\nand only we can have\n—\nand also is available out there more generally\n,\n in order to make sure we set the right prioritie\ns and get the right results. \nI would accept the general point but I have probably made it a little wider than the original question. \nAndrew George: \nOkay, yes. That is helpful. I can see you have taken on the point about gathering intelligence for your own purposes. I was thinking more of gathering intelligence and providing an annual commentary, or whatever, in terms of the\nmes that \nare developing\n.\n \nW\nhere you see a \npattern of activity going on—\nobviously it is very much a debating point about whether staffing levels are an issue or not\n, and \nwhether the interface between nurses and healthcare workers is a potential risky fault line\n \neme\nrging in the healthcare system—\nit would be an important role of the NMC, if you have identified that as a theme developing, \nto then report\n \nit \nto other policy \nmakers, including Ministers. \nI really am urging you to see your role as reporting back not just intelligence to yourself to help you develop your work but also reporting to us.\nChair: \nBut do not write the report for them, Andrew.\nAndrew George: \nI am walking the tightrope about whether there is an issue there or not.\nJackie Smith: \nCan I say\n—\n \nQ61 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nBefore you do that, I want to strengthen that point because it goes back\n to the discussion about \nonce you become more visible to the public\n. Y\nou made the point that you might start getting referrals, but you could possibly see a stressed \norganisation in those reforms.\n \nJackie Smith: \nAbsolutely.\nQ62 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: You could possibly see the \npublic saying to you, \n“\nThe nurses on this ward were run off their \nfeet and never had time to talk or\n breathe,\n” and that\n sort of thing. You would see that first and that is pretty important.\nJackie Smith: I want\n to say in response that I hope we have created the impression here\n—\nbecause it is absolutely the case\n—\nthat we are with you. T\nhat is where we want to be, but,\n as Mark said earlier, we are an organisation that has emerged from a crisis. We have stabilised, we are making progress and we want to do the things you are saying\n—a\nbsolutely.\nQ63 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan I bring you on to talk again about revalidati\non and how you see that working?\n You are committed to a process of revalidation by the end of 2015, which is a year of some significance to Members of this House. Do you envisage that you will\n be able to\n implement revalidation without impacting on the political world?\nJackie Smith: \nYes. I am confiden\nt that we can deliver the form—the model—\nthat council has a\ngreed to by the end of 2015\n. As I hope is clear, we are building on existing systems so we are using appraisal. I know that there is a view that appraisal is not consistent, that it is patchy, but that is not a reason not to do revalidation: it is a reason to do it.\nQ64 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWe have heard a very similar argument from the GMC. I want to probe what the concept of confirmation by a third party means in the context of your view of revalidation and how that is different from the report of the responsible officer.\nJackie Smith: \nIt can be given by a number of individuals in different positions. The confirmation is that that individual is up to date and fit to practise.\nQ65 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThe confirming individual does not have to be a registrant.\nJackie Smith: \nThat is right.\nQ66 &#xa0; \nChair: \nSo it can be the local solicitor or family and friends.\nJackie Smith: \nIt needs to be in the employment setting.\nQ67 &#xa0; \nChair: What is the definition? W\nho is an acceptable confirmer?\nJackie Smith: \nThat is som\nething \nwe want to try and tease out during the early pilots.\nQ68 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWhat is the purpos\ne of the confirmation\n?\nJackie Smith: T\nhat they have had an appraisal, that they have talked to the individual, that they have\n—\nQ69 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThat it is a formal appraisal process.\nJackie Smith: \nYes, absolutely.\nQ70 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIn which case, why would it not be the person who has done the nurse\n’\ns appraisal?\nJackie Smith: \nThe expectation is that it will be the person who has done the appraisal\n,\n but we need to test this out because nurses and midwives work in a very diverse environment and we need to make sure that this is something that will wo\nrk for the vast majority of th\ne nurses and midwives on our register. We need to tease that out \nwith\n the early adopters.\nQ71 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIf it is normally the appraiser, that individual is taking a significant responsibility, are they not, when they sign the certificate that says, \n“\nI confirm this nurse has do\nne what they say they have done”\n? \nJackie Smith: Yes. We are suggesting \nthat appraisal and revalidation is owned by that individ\nual—the person who is being \nappraised. They are taking responsibility for ensuring, according to the guidance and the standards that we set, th\nat they have kept themselves up to \ndate, that they are\n continuing to demonstrate \nthey are fit to practise, and the person conducting that appraisal has the information to be able to say that is a suitable registrant to be on the NMC\n’\ns register\n,\n and \nthereafter\n we will conduct random audits.\nQ72 &#xa0; \nChair: \nHow much \nof this has been road-tested\n?\nJackie Smith: It will be road-\ntested through the review of the code, the review of our standards\n,\n and the early pilots. At the \nmoment it has not been road-\ntested.\nQ73 &#xa0; \nChair: \nI am mindful that it took the GMC 10 years to get to a workable model. You are saying \nyou are going to have\n a full process of revalidation\n,\n presumably starting over a rolling three\n&#x2011;\nyear period.\nJackie Smith: \nIndeed. We are not saying \nthat \nat the end of 2015 we will have revalidated 674,000 registrants, no.\nMark Addison: \nYou said it will start by the end of 2015.\nQ74 &#xa0; \nChair: \nOkay, fine. It starts, effectively, on 1 January 2016.\nJackie Smith: \nOn 31 December 2015.\nChair: Okay. \nWe are not going to quibble.\nMark Addison: \nI agree with the general proposition that there is a huge amount to do in order to get to that point and there will be a number of consultations. The first consultation exercise is now gearing up\n,\n and at every point some questions will be answered and mor\ne questions will be raised. T\nhe next phase of work will be designed to address those questions and take the whole project further on. Some people have criticised us for taking too long and some \npeople have criticised us \nfor doing it too quickly. We think the end of 2015 is deliverable on the model that we have adopted. It is a \n“\nno legislative change\n”\n model. It would not be possible if legislative change were a requirement.\nQ75 &#xa0; \nChair: I\nt is no legislative change. The current law, you are saying, allows you to remove somebody from the register if you are not satisfied.\nJackie Smith: Yes. At the renewal point, \nthey would lapse.\nMark Addison: \nWe have a renewal process already. It just does not work very well.\nQ76 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWho pays the £1.50 per nurse?\nJackie Smith: Sorry\n?\nChair: \nA witness has told us that the GMC revalidation process costs £6 per registrant\n,\n and your process is intended to cost £1.50. You do not recognise either of these numbers.\nMark Addison: \nI have not come across that number myself.\nJackie Smith: \nNo, I am sorry.\nMark Addison: \nIf the general question is who is going to pay, the costs fall on two parties. Essentially, they fall on the system and \nthey fall \non the NMC. Part of the whole process of working up these proposals will allow us to be clearer and sharper about what both those costs are. We have made an allowance in our financial strategy for the initial costs to the NMC which are affordable within that envelope\n,\n and they are not very great. The more significant cost is likely to fall on the system, but given, as Jackie says, \nthat \nwe ha\nve come up with proposals that are essentially with the grain—\nwith the existing regime that good emplo\nyers will already be providing—we hope \nthe additional costs will be acceptable. But clearly that is an issue. It is an issue for employers and it is an issue for the Government as we go forward, which is why we will be working very closely with the employers and, indeed, with the Government to identify what those costs are\n,\n to produce a fully worked\n&#x2011;\nup\n business case and to make sure it stacks up and is acceptable before we put final proposals to the council for endorsement.\nQ77 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBut you do not intend \nthat \nthere would be a cost on the registrant.\nMark Addison: \nNo. We have said that this will be within the current fee\n plans—\nI forget our exact words. This would be funded\n,\n and it will be funded essentially because there will be an additional cost to the NMC\n,\n but it will be funded as part of the savings and cost reductions that Jackie and her team are making at present and over the next few years. That is how we intend to fund quite a bit of the work that we are embarking on.\nQ78 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nI would like to change tack and ask you about some of the remarks that the Professional Standards Authority made about you. The PSA state that it is likely that different groups on your register present different types and levels of risk, but that your proposals \n“lack a robust evidence base...\naround risk.\n”\n How will your risk\n&#x2011;\nbased\n targeting system work to identify nurses for early audit?\nJackie Smith: \nWe can draw on existing data. \nWe can draw on fitness-to-\npractise data that we already have at our disposal. We can take account of high\n&#x2011;\nrisk settings. We can use the information and intelligence that we are gathering through visits and the work that we are doing with the CQC in England and\n the other systems regulators, s\no we are no\nt starting from a zero base\n.\nQ79 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nAr\ne you going to have some model—\nperhaps a com\nputer model—\nto assess risk on a points system?\nJackie Smith: \nWe were not proposing a computer model, no. We are proposing to build on data that we already have at our disposal\n,\n and using the intelligence that we are gathering and taking account of practice settings. \nT\nhat gives us a pretty good starting point. Clearly the risk model will develop and evolve once we roll out revalidation; it will change over time. But I think that is a pretty good starting point.\nQ80 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nI have one other question. What safeguards can you introduce to stop this being perceived as discriminatory\n—\nfor example, if you are identifying all nurses of a certain age, or from a certain area? How do you avoid discrimination in assessing the risk\n? That is the key question.\nJackie Smith: \nI probably would go \nback to my earlier answer\n. We need to look at the data that we already have available to us and identify from that where the highest risk groups are. It is not intended to be discriminatory, but it is intended to target areas of risk.\nQ81 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nDo you think there is a danger that \nyou might end up making policy in\n how you assess different groups\n?\n Rather than trying to follow guidelin\nes, is there not a danger \nthat you might be tempted into policy decisions on risk with different groups?\nMark Addison: What we are talking about \nis \nprobably \nthe way in which the audi\nt process would be targeted. T\nhe commitment we \nhave \nmade is that there would be a random component to the audit and there would be a risk\n&#x2011;\nbased\n component to the audit. \nT\nhat is a fairly standard way of making sure that you cover the right territory with a sample audit of this sort. As we drew up the risk framework for that audit we would clearly need to be sure that it was \nproperly \nequality\n&#x2011;\nproofed\n and did not have any obvious\n discriminatory components\n. I am not sure that that would involve setting policy in some way. \nT\nhat \ndoes not strike\n me as a risk \nwith \nthe approach. \nT\nhe bigger issues with the audit approach are\n,\n \n“\nWill we have our risk framework sufficiently developed at the point of launch? Will we have been able to invest enough in it and have \nwe \ngot a clear enough idea of how the sample frame should be drawn?\n” Secondly, “H\now big a sample should it be and how much will that cost?\n”\n A \nlo\nt of the cost of this exercise for us will be driven by the size of the audit sample\n,\n \nand the bigger the audit sample\n the more reliabl\ne and effective it will be. T\nhere will be a balancing act \nthat\n the council has to undertake in order to determine what\n&#xa0;\nscale of audit to embark on.\nQ82 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: Y\nou will take advice to\n make sure that the sample \nyou have is statistically sound.\nMark Addison: \nAbsolutely, yes, we must do that.\nQ83 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: Still on the point of re\nvalidation, the GMC has five\n&#x2011;\nyearly\n cycles of revalidation\n,\n and the point has been made by some nurses that it seems unduly onerous that they have to revalidate every three years.\nJackie Smith: \nThat is the renewal point.\nQ84 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nBut \nyou wanted to link it in;\n \ni\nt is the renewal point. Do you think that, over time, if this becomes onerous you would shift to six\n&#x2011;\nyearly\n?\nJackie Smith: W\ne would certainly want to evaluate the first phase of revalidation before we made any decisions on that, but I absolutely take the point that we would need a change to our legal framework to be able to do it differently\n,\n and we would hope that that would be part of the Law Commission Bill\n.\nChair: Barbara wants\n to ask about fees.\nQ85 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: It is \nabout the level of the fees and whether it would be possible to allow phase\nd\n payments. We recommended that\n,\n and you understood \nthat \nit would be too costly \nwhile you processed registrations manually, so will you be moving to an online process? We still feel that phased payments should be introduced\n,\n as people have been finding it tough.\nJackie Smith: \nYes, I have two responses to that. We are moving to online services\n,\n which we hope to launch in April of next year for a small group initially. We do not want to launch online services for 674,000. \nT\nhat \nwill be one thing that\n I think \nwill\n definitely improve customer service and make it easier for nurses and midwives. The second is that we have not completely ruled out phase\nd\n payments but it needs to form part of our ICT strategy, which will go to the council in November. Our intention is to replace the registration database in 2014. Once we do that and we have a new system in place, it will make it easier to look at phase\nd\n payments. We have not ruled it out completely. We will return to it.\nMark Addison: I\nt\n will be a factor that we \nwant to consider in the design of that longer\n-\n term ICT strategy.\nQ86 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nThat does not sound very positive. It is a recommendation from\n us.\nJackie Smith: \nI know. It is simply that we are not in a position to do it within the current systems.\nQ87 &#xa0; \nBarbara Keeley: \nIndeed, but the words you just used do not sound like you want to make it part of a new system. If you are replacing the database, surely you are going to have to decide about IT requirements\n, so you\n \ncould\n say\n,\n \n“\nWe can do it from the \npoint that we replace the databa\nse,\n”\n but what you said sounded a lot weaker than that.\nJackie Smith: \nThere are added complications, one of which is that not a huge number of nurses and midwives pay by direct debit at the moment, so the percentage \nfor \ntake\n&#x2011;\nup is\n pretty low. It is around \n20%. We would need to \ndo \nquite a bit of work to improve that first of all before we could get into a \nsuitable position. I\nt is not that I am not enthusiastic. It is just that\n—\nQ88 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYou might find this will encourage them.\nJackie Smith: \nIt may well do.\nQ89 &#xa0; \nChair: C\nan you give the Committee an assurance that the ICT system will be designed in a way that is compatible with this option?\nMark Addison: \nYes. That was, I hope, the gist of my earlier remark\n: \none of the things that we will be building into the consideration of that forward design is your recommendation about phased payments.\nQ90 &#xa0; \nChair: \nYes. \n“\nBuilding it into the consideration\n”\n might be building into a phase you do not\n—\n \nMark Addison: \nI do not want to make a commitment that we will not embark on any IT strategy unless it has that capability because I do not know what I would be committing myself to. But I do take the message that it is a serious recommendation from you, that you would like us to think about it very carefully and only reject a system if it is absolutely impossible or dispr\noportionately expensive to do. \nI will take away \nt\nhat message and convey \nit \nto the council when they look at the strategy in November.\nQ91 &#xa0; \nRosie Cooper: \nBut surely\n—\nforgive me\n—\nthe smallest organisation to the largest can manage to collect their subs weekly, monthly or whatever. You could just nip down to your local organisation and ask them how they do it\n,\n because it seems that you cannot be in the 21st century and it \nwould be\n too hard to take money \noff people in 12 monthly instal\nments\n,\n or whatever. If that is se\nen to be really difficult, \nhow do you deal with the really difficult questions? It scares me when I hear stuff like that, honestly.\nMark Addison: \nI understand the point.\nChair: Sarah wants\n to ask a final question\n, though\n I have a final question as well, I am afraid. \nWe \nare on \nNo. \n26.\nQ92 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nWe have fast forwar\nded. I am sorry, Chair. I want\n to ask a question about the d\nraft legislation about language-\ntesting. Under current proposals, language assessments will only take place after applicants from the EU have actually been accepted on to the register, in other words not proactively assessed. How are you addressing this?\nMark Addison: \nPerhaps I can say a word or two. We are as frustrated as everybody else about this. As you know, we would like to have been in a position to move more quickly\n,\n and the GMC is in a slightly different place. Perhaps I could just explain why. There are three fundamental issues that affect a regulator\n’\ns ability to test for language, as\n I see it. One is the European d\nirecti\nve. The second is the way that d\nirective is transposed into UK law. The third is the legal framework that the regulator has. The GMC happened to have a legal framework \nwhich\n has, I think, the \n“\nlicence to practise\n”\n component to it\n,\n which allows them, with the right kind of signals from the Commission, if their legislation is tweaked,\n to move to be able to language-\ntest. We are not in that posit\nion. First of all, the current d\nirective is generally quite hostile. Second, the way it is transposed makes things difficult for us. Third, and most importantly, we do not have that distinction\n,\n so we cannot introduce a point in the process between registration\n and the right to practise that\n will allow us t\no introduce a language test. That is the current position\n unless there is a willingness on the Government\n’s side\n to introduce leg\nislation that\n would advance us to the point where\n we could make that distinction.\n \nT\nhat would be a very big thing to ask in advance of the Law Commission coming through and in advance of the tra\nnsposition of the new directive, which will help, \nwhich i\ns under negotiation in Brussels\n.\nQ93 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nPerhaps \nit\n would be helpful for\n the\n Committee to understand what you would like to see in place. If you were actually drafting a change to the legislation, where would you see that sitting? \nMark Addison: \nWe can let \nyou \nhave a detailed note if that would be helpful.\nQ94 &#xa0; \nChair: A \ndraft amendment for us to put down to the Care Bill\n might be helpful\n.\nMark Addison: \nWe wi\nll take that away too. The new d\nirective explicitly \naddresses the issue of language-\nte\nsting, so it is much friendlier\n to the notion that there should be the capa\ncity for regulators to language-\ntest. \nT\nhat is a big step forward\n. If the transposition of that d\nirective into UK law is managed correctly and if we achieve, either through the Law Commission or th\nrough the transposition of the d\nirective, a change to our legal framework \nthat\n will allow us to make that distinction, then we can introduc\ne language-\ntesting, not asking employers to do it but actually ourselves making that decision, as the GMC are hoping\n to\n. \nW\ne would welcome suppor\nt for the transposition of the directive in a way that\n fully involves us and makes sure \nthat we are clear that the way it is put into UK law will help us to get to t\nhe result we want—t\nhat would be extremely helpful\n—and, s\necondly, support for the change to our legal framework at that critical moment, which also allows us to make the change. \nQ95 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIt would be very helpful to the Committee to know precisely what is required to be changed in all three of the headings you describe\n,\n and what the constraints are on the timetabl\ne. The Government has now moved—partly, I think\n we feel\n,\n because\n of the opinions expressed here—on language-\ntesting for doctors\n,\n and it is regrettable that we are in a position where we cannot do it for nurses as well.\nMark Addison: \nWe agree.\nJackie Smith: \nWe can certainly submit that as a matter of urgency.\nQ96 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: \nWe understand that the new legislation would take two years to come into force, so what would you recommend can be done to protect patients in the meantime?\nJackie Smith: \nWe \nstill \nurge employers to test language\n. That is what we continue to urge.\nQ97 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: W\nhere someone has arrived and they recognise there is a problem, \nyou urge them \nto test at an early stage.\nJackie Smith: \nYes.\nQ98 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: T\nhe clear message should be to any employers who are not sure if they are able to do that\n—\nJackie Smith: \nYes, \n“\nPlease, test language.\n”\nQ99 &#xa0; \nDr Wollaston: W\nhere they have concerns\n,\n they can test and they should do\n so at the earliest opportunity.\nJackie Smith: \nYes, absolutely.\nMark Addison: \nIt is \na \nsecond best, but it is all we have.\nQ100 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you very much. That has been a useful session and we will issue a report, but we would be grateful for the two bits of further evidence you said you would send to us.\nMark Addison: \nWe will get them to you as soon as we can. \nChair: \nWe can reflect \non \nthat and on our opinions. Thank you very much.\n&#xa0;\n              \nOral evidence: \n2013 accountability hearing with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, HC 699\n              \n              \n2\n"
