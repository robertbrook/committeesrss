defaultWritten evidence from CTC (SRN 026)default&#xa0;
defaultCTC, the national cycling charity, was founded in 1878. CTC has 70,000 members and supporters, provides a range of information and legal services to cyclists,
default organises cycling events, and represents the interests of cyclists and cycling on issues of public policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
defaultThe strategic road network can, in the words of the Government’s 
default‘Action for Roads’ policy
default, be “a barrier for walkers and cyclists.” Large
default junctions are dangerous locations for cyclists and the very high perceived risk of
default cycling 
defaultmeans cycle trips are suppressed. In some cases 
defaultmajor roads are the only practical route available to cyclists, but conditions are unacceptably dangerous on the car
defaultriageway, or where off-carriageway facilities cross junctions
default, such as slip roads or large roundabouts
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC welcomes the statements 
defaulton pages 44 and 45 of the 
default‘
defaultAction for Roads
default’
default paper 
defaultto
default provid
defaulte
default better provision for cyclists on the strategic road network. 
defaultThis followed an announcement by the Prime Minister in August 2012 to ‘cycle proof’ major road schemes
default, while the Shadow Transport Secretary has promised an obligation on authorities “to ‘cycle proof’ new policies and projects.”
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile 
defaultthis announcement 
defaultand commitment is welcome
default,
default CTC remains 
defaultconcerned
default that
default the means by which the Government will ensure that provision for cyclists improves on – and around – the strategic road network is 
defaultcurrently 
defaultineffective, and needs to be radically improved.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC recomm
defaultends that the Highways Age
defaultncy 
defaultmust be tasked not just to 
defaultassess conditions for cyclists and not make conditions worse, but to ensure that conditions substantially improve for cyclists. 
defaultDesign guidance on cycle provision produced by the Agency must be stren
defaultgthened and brought into line with better 
defaultquality standards produced by the Department for Transport
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC believes that the National Transport Model has key flaws – particularly in the assumptions it uses of the growth of cycle use in future years – and s
defaultuggests that providing infrastructure to satisfy the outcomes of an inaccurate model risks wasting resources and locking future generations into unsustainable levels of motor traffic use.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roadsdefault” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?default&#xa0;
defaultHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?default&#xa0;
defaultIn August the Prime Minister 
defaultacknowledged in a 
defaultstatement
default the need to tackle problems on the strategic road network and to ‘cycle proof’ major roads schemes.
default 
default In a welcome act of cross-party consensus, the then Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, Maria Eagle MP also promised “
defaultan obligation to ‘cyc
defaultle-proof’ new policies and projects
default.”
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ‘Action for Roads’ paper gives a little more detail on the intention behind the ‘cycle proofing’ statement. CTC believes this is a worthy and important principle, but past experience leads us to fear that the qua
defaultlity of implementation will not live up to the promise.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the early 2000s CTC, along with other groups representing walkers and horse riders, 
defaultworked with the Highways Agency to draw up lists of
default schemes where crossings needed to be improved.
default This was desi
defaultgnated as the Non-Motorised User Crossings 
defaultImprovement 
defaultProgramme, but funding pledged to support the programme was redirected to other projects.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhen the Programme was evaluated in 2008 (the last date for which 
defaultinformation is
default available), only 259 (22%) o
defaultut of 1,159 schemes had been completed. A further 46% had been deleted
default from the Programme;
default the outcome
default of 32%
default 
defaultis 
defaultunknown.
default  Not only have relatively few of these schemes been progressed, CTC still hears of newly built schemes where conditions for cyclists 
defaultare likely to be made worse, rather than improved. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC’s concerns about the way the strategic road network affects cycling include:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultdisproportionately high
default risk to cyclists using the strategic road network;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBarriers to local trips created by the net
defaultwork severing the minor road and rights of way network;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUse of the
default strategic road network 
defaultby local motorised 
defaulttraffic
default, which could be shifted to sustainable modes.
default&#xa0;
defaultEach of these three points is discussed in further detail below.
default&#xa0;
defaulta) defaultThe defaultdisproportionately defaulthighdefault risk to cyclists using the strategic road networkdefault.default Whereas rural major roads (not including motorways) carry a risk per mile travelled by car or motorcycle of four times higher than on minor urban roads; for cyclis
defaultts the risk is 28 times greater (Tabl
defaulte 1).
default&#xa0;
defaultMotorcyclists – who are in general at greater risk – are 5 times more likely to be killed than cyclists on minor urban roads, but are at a lower risk than cyclists when it comes to the major rural road network. Cycling on rural major roads is unacceptably 
defaultrisky – and correctly perceived as such by many. Yet many cycle trips must, in some way, either use, or cross, the major road network.

default&#xa0;
defaultb) Barriers to local trips created by the network severing the minor road and rights of way networkdefault. defaultIt is in part because of the elevated risk of using the major road network in a) that makes the major road network such a barrier to local trips. 
defaultThose using the road itself are likely only to be the brave (usually using the road for sports cycling traini
defaultng or time trialling, or long distance touring/commuting) or those inadvertently using the strategic road network due to confusion or lack of signed alternatives.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, major roads are even more of a problem when 
defaultit comes to making 
defaultlocal 
defaulttrips which need to cross 
defaultthe
default physical barrier that the
default network 
defaultpresents 
defaultand where provision has not been mad
defaulte for cyclists (or pedestrians).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe strategic road network is, in general, made up of two types of road: purpose built dual carriageway/motorway 
defaultand historically strategic road alignments which have been gradually upgraded. 
default&#xa0;
defaultOf these two types of road, the 
defaultupgraded old road
default represents the biggest problem, partly because they are in close proxi
defaultmity to heavily populated areas, often passing through 
defaulturban areas or rural areas with multiple minor road junctions. Purpose built
default motorways
default or new dual carriageways
default use 
defaultgrade
default-
defaultseparated crossings
default for most minor roads and rights of way
default, whereas the process of gradual upgrading has meant that older roads sever
default 
defaultlocal road 
defaultand rights of way 
defaultnetwork. 
defaultThe ‘Action for Roads’ document acknowledges that “some major roads, particularly those built in the early days of mass-motoring, can create a barrier between two sides” (p. 45).
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough thousands of examples exist, 
defaultone can be found on
default the A27 in West Sussex
default, a road that forms
default part of the strategic road network serving the South Coast. In many places it bypasses towns and villages, however, in other places it remains in the same location as the road had been at the st
defaultart of the motoring age
default (see Figures 1 and 2 below). Whereas then traffic would have been light and crossing would have been 
defaultsimple
default, it is now a fast, very heavi
defaultly used dual carriageway, with over 27 thousands vehicles per day.
default&#xa0;
defaultMinor roads which used to 
defaultcross the road are now closed to motor traffic
default, or accessible only as single-facing junctions
default, while pedestrians and cyclists are supposed to wait for gaps in two streams of 70 mph traffic to cross
default.
default There are three potential routes between
default the villages of 
defaultSlindon and Walberton, including minor roads, a bridleway and a busier B-road.
default All of these routes 
defaulthave
default level c
defaultrossings with the A27.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe A27 in the 1920s (left) and today (right)
default 
defaultsevering local trips between villages.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHundreds of these minor roads hav
defaulte been cut in road upgrades over the years, with similar impact
defaults on the rights of way network. These problems abound across the network.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn other places, where the major road served 
defaultas crucial link joining minor roads, or the sole link between communities
default, the lack of proper adjacent facilities for cyclists, or inadequate quality of treatment of crossings of major junctions, means that the link has become unusable for all but the least risk averse cyclists. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
default‘
defaultAction on Roads
default’
default paper has task
defaults
default 
defaultthe 
defaultHighways Agency with analysing where the strategic road network acts as a barrier to local cycling movement
default. H
defaultowever, the commitment to mitigate the problem is contingent on 
defaultkey 
defaultindividuals
default within the Agency
default, and the mechanism
defaults to embed this in Highways Ag
defaultency (and local authority) practice are presently vague and undeveloped. 
defaultAlthough each scheme must go through a No
defaultn-Motorised User Audit process, in CTC’s experience, 
defaultthis often appears to have failed to deal with the problems, or has 
defaultnot generated 
defaultadequat
defaulte
default solutions.
default&#xa0;
defaultLack of evidence of cycle use should not be used as a reason not to provide routesdefault&#xa0;
defaultPart of the problem remains that in many places where roads are being upgraded or junction capacity increased, conditions for cycling are already very hazardo
defaultus and 
defaultconsequently cycling levels are minimal. However, just because conditions are poor, does not mean that no one wants to use the route – on the example given above, there may have bee
defaultn many people who in the distant
default past travelled between Slindon and 
defaultWalberton by foot, cycle and even horse
default. 
defaultToday, though 
defaultonly a
default flat
default 
defaultmile divides these villages
default, such trips 
defaultare greatly
default deterred
default the need to cross the 
defaultriver of traffic that is the 
defaultA27. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFurthermore CTC campaigners have regularly faced problems with the way
default the HA treats cyclists when upgrading routes or junctions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study: Jundefaultcdefaulttion 9 M3default&#xa0;
defaultSince dangerous crossings or narrow, low quality routes are
default often
default little used, making the case for their improvement is hard. 
defaultThe lack of evidence of use of routes 
defaultthat are already severed means that attempts by local campaigners to argue for improvements, new – grade separated crossings – or parallel facilities, are often ignored or
default underplayed by HA contractors.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultProposals to 
defaultupgrade junction 
default9 
defaultof the 
defaultM3 involved 
defaultnarrowing the available space for footway users alongside an overbridge to provide a third carriageway lane. The Highways Agency ignored the fact that the 
defaultfootpath provided at the time of the original construction of the junction
default was part of the National C
defaultycle Network and failed to engage with either cyclists or pedestrians with regard to the status and use of the route.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultCase study: Junction 13 M1default&#xa0;
defaultWhen redesigning junction 13 of the M1 (junction with the A421), the HA initially omitted any cycle provision. After the public inquiry inspector upheld objections to this from CTC’s local campaigner, a revised (but still inadequate) scheme was agreed. How
defaultever it was incompletely implemented when the junction was opened, leaving cyclists to negotiate an unsurfaced mud-bath or a major roundabout.  
default&#xa0;
defaultAfter protests led to this being remedied, the HA introduced signing which led cyclists straight to a dangerou
defaults roundabout, instead of connecting with a bridge built by the local authority to avoid this. It took months of campaigning before correct signing was installed – almost 3 years after the new junction had been opened.  Meanwhile, the scheme’s inadequacies 
defaultmean that a huge opportunity has been missed to encourage people to cycle to 
defaultwork at the nearby Amazon depot, or to Cranfield University.
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC recommends that the Highways Agency provide better training for staff
default and contractors
default in how to design for cyclis
defaultts, and develops more robust procedures to 
defaultensure that schemes actually develop 
defaultimproved 
defaultnetworks for walking and cycling, not just mitigating the damage caused by existing or new roads.
default 
defaultThe programme of works to retrofit improvements must continue in future years, with more of the Non-Motorised User Crossings schemes progressed.
default&#xa0;
defaultCTC also recommends that the 
defaultsections of the 
defaultstandards document used by the Highways Agency, the ‘Design Manua
defaultl for Roads and Bridges’
default, 
defaultbe 
defaultoverhaul
defaulted
default to bring it in line with other cycling design guidance. Dimensions and designs in this document fall well below the standard of 
defaultother international and national best practice
default, presenting local authority engineers wit
defaulth confusing and conflicting double standards, and permitting designers to opt for the minimal standard design
default, rather than a high quality solution.
default&#xa0;
defaultc) defaultUse of the strategic road network by local motorised traffic, which could be shifted to sustainable modedefaults.default defaultPrevious research has suggested that congestion on the strategic road network is often due to short trips that use parts of the strategic network.
default 
defaultIf conditions for local trips on and across the strategic road network could be improved
default for cyclists
default, th
defaulte benefits may be conferred on the network itself, by reducing 
defaultthe level of traffic using the strategic road network to m
defaultake short intra-urban journeys. This could alleviate congested locations though demand-side, rather than supply-side, measures.
default&#xa0;
defaultCreati
defaultng access to the strategic road network for local motor traffic in some cases also induces more traffic onto local roads through attracting longer trip distances and enhancing the perceived ease of access by car. In this respect, reduction in the permeabil
defaultity of the strategic road network for motor traffic is 
defaultbeneficial, but access across the network for cyclists and
default pedestrians must be maintained. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTable 1.2 of the report (p 18) shows that although traffic on the strategic road network grew up until 2006, since then it has been static. While some of that period included a substantial recession, 
defaultthe lack of growth in 2006 (before the recession) and subsequently, together with the gradual decline in traffic on the rest of the road network, suggests that the outputs of the National Transport Model
default, which have persistently predicted sustained motor t
defaultraffic growth,
default are flawed.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne small example of the out of date baseline data that the NTM uses can be found in its figures on cycling. The NTM assumes that 
defaultaverage cycle trip length (originally a little over 2 miles in 2010) will rise very slightly, befo
defaultre falling back to a figure b
defaultelow the 2010 figure by 2035, whereas car trips will continue to increase in length.
default 
defaultHowever, in reality, cycle trip lengths are 48% longer in 2012 than 
defaultthey were 10 years earlier, far higher than the inpu
defaultt level used in the m
defaultodel, while car trips have not increased in length (
defaultsee 
defaultfigure 3).
default&#xa0;
defaultThis extension in the average trip length is likely due to the growth of cycling amongst long-distance sport cycling and 
defaultcycle commuting amongst older adults. 
defaultCTC suspects that this is supported by the rise in value and quality of cycles, which is likely to make 
defaultlonger distance trips more practical. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn addition, CTC believes that the Transport Model is underplaying the
default long-term
default impact of electric bikes, which make up 
defaultjust 1% of the market at present, but in mature markets, such as the Netherlands, amount to 15% of total
default bike sales
default.
default Bikes with electrical assistance will lead to further increases in trip length, increasing the li
defaultkelihood that cycle trips will a) displace more car trips and b) intersect with, or require the use of, the strategic road network.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is but one – 
defaultalbeit minor - example of how CTC
default feel
defaults
default that the 
defaultparameters used within
default the National Transport Model are
default inaccurate. 
defaultTransport academics have pointed out that
default other aspects of the models calculations are flawed
default and biased 
defaulttowards inflated traffic growth.
default 
defaultCTC
default suggest
defaults
default that the model needs to be substantially overhauled and improved before its forecasts are u
defaultsed to determine policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf
default 
defaultthe Model’s output is accepted as inevitable and the network is planned to meet the growth in motor traffic, then that growth has a greater chance of materialising. On the other hand, a more radical suite of policy measures to 
defaultreduce motor traffic and shift to sustainable modes could produce a very different result, and one that would 
defaultbe substantially 
defaultless costly, result in far fewer emissions and be more appealing to 
defaultthose communities potentially blighted by the projected huge 
defaultincreases in traffic.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe greatest impact on reliability 
defaultcomes from road crashes, not necessarily congestion, which is 
defaultusually predictable and can be accommodated for
default in trip timing and route choice
default. Reducing the risk of crashes for all road users should, we feel, be the focus of efforts to improve reliability. The use of lower speed limits, enforced by average speed camer
defaultas, has shown to be effective in this regard.
default One area of technological improvement that should be investigated further is that of intelligent speed adaptation, by which maximum vehicle speeds could be determined independently and 
defaultvaried
default to 
defaultaccommodate 
defaultthe
default 
defaultweather 
defaultconditions or density of traffic
default.
