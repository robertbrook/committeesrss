[normal]Written evidence from CTC (SRN 026)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC, the national cycling charity, was founded in 1878. CTC has 70,000 members and supporters, provides a range of information and legal services to cyclists,
[normal] organises cycling events, and represents the interests of cyclists and cycling on issues of public policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The strategic road network can, in the words of the Government’s 
[normal]‘Action for Roads’ policy
[normal], be “a barrier for walkers and cyclists.” Large
[normal] junctions are dangerous locations for cyclists and the very high perceived risk of
[normal] cycling 
[normal]means cycle trips are suppressed. In some cases 
[normal]major roads are the only practical route available to cyclists, but conditions are unacceptably dangerous on the car
[normal]riageway, or where off-carriageway facilities cross junctions
[normal], such as slip roads or large roundabouts
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC welcomes the statements 
[normal]on pages 44 and 45 of the 
[normal]‘
[normal]Action for Roads
[normal]’
[normal] paper 
[normal]to
[normal] provid
[normal]e
[normal] better provision for cyclists on the strategic road network. 
[normal]This followed an announcement by the Prime Minister in August 2012 to ‘cycle proof’ major road schemes
[normal], while the Shadow Transport Secretary has promised an obligation on authorities “to ‘cycle proof’ new policies and projects.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While 
[normal]this announcement 
[normal]and commitment is welcome
[normal],
[normal] CTC remains 
[normal]concerned
[normal] that
[normal] the means by which the Government will ensure that provision for cyclists improves on – and around – the strategic road network is 
[normal]currently 
[normal]ineffective, and needs to be radically improved.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC recomm
[normal]ends that the Highways Age
[normal]ncy 
[normal]must be tasked not just to 
[normal]assess conditions for cyclists and not make conditions worse, but to ensure that conditions substantially improve for cyclists. 
[normal]Design guidance on cycle provision produced by the Agency must be stren
[normal]gthened and brought into line with better 
[normal]quality standards produced by the Department for Transport
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC believes that the National Transport Model has key flaws – particularly in the assumptions it uses of the growth of cycle use in future years – and s
[normal]uggests that providing infrastructure to satisfy the outcomes of an inaccurate model risks wasting resources and locking future generations into unsustainable levels of motor traffic use.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads[bold]” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In August the Prime Minister 
[normal]acknowledged in a 
[normal]statement
[normal] the need to tackle problems on the strategic road network and to ‘cycle proof’ major roads schemes.
[normal] 
[normal] In a welcome act of cross-party consensus, the then Shadow Secretary of State for Transport, Maria Eagle MP also promised “
[normal]an obligation to ‘cyc
[normal]le-proof’ new policies and projects
[normal].”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ‘Action for Roads’ paper gives a little more detail on the intention behind the ‘cycle proofing’ statement. CTC believes this is a worthy and important principle, but past experience leads us to fear that the qua
[normal]lity of implementation will not live up to the promise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the early 2000s CTC, along with other groups representing walkers and horse riders, 
[normal]worked with the Highways Agency to draw up lists of
[normal] schemes where crossings needed to be improved.
[normal] This was desi
[normal]gnated as the Non-Motorised User Crossings 
[normal]Improvement 
[normal]Programme, but funding pledged to support the programme was redirected to other projects.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When the Programme was evaluated in 2008 (the last date for which 
[normal]information is
[normal] available), only 259 (22%) o
[normal]ut of 1,159 schemes had been completed. A further 46% had been deleted
[normal] from the Programme;
[normal] the outcome
[normal] of 32%
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]unknown.
[normal]  Not only have relatively few of these schemes been progressed, CTC still hears of newly built schemes where conditions for cyclists 
[normal]are likely to be made worse, rather than improved. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC’s concerns about the way the strategic road network affects cycling include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]disproportionately high
[normal] risk to cyclists using the strategic road network;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Barriers to local trips created by the net
[normal]work severing the minor road and rights of way network;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Use of the
[normal] strategic road network 
[normal]by local motorised 
[normal]traffic
[normal], which could be shifted to sustainable modes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Each of these three points is discussed in further detail below.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a) [bold]The [bold]disproportionately [bold]high[bold] risk to cyclists using the strategic road network[bold].[bold] Whereas rural major roads (not including motorways) carry a risk per mile travelled by car or motorcycle of four times higher than on minor urban roads; for cyclis
[normal]ts the risk is 28 times greater (Tabl
[normal]e 1).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Motorcyclists – who are in general at greater risk – are 5 times more likely to be killed than cyclists on minor urban roads, but are at a lower risk than cyclists when it comes to the major rural road network. Cycling on rural major roads is unacceptably 
[normal]risky – and correctly perceived as such by many. Yet many cycle trips must, in some way, either use, or cross, the major road network.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b) Barriers to local trips created by the network severing the minor road and rights of way network[bold]. [bold]It is in part because of the elevated risk of using the major road network in a) that makes the major road network such a barrier to local trips. 
[normal]Those using the road itself are likely only to be the brave (usually using the road for sports cycling traini
[normal]ng or time trialling, or long distance touring/commuting) or those inadvertently using the strategic road network due to confusion or lack of signed alternatives.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, major roads are even more of a problem when 
[normal]it comes to making 
[normal]local 
[normal]trips which need to cross 
[normal]the
[normal] physical barrier that the
[normal] network 
[normal]presents 
[normal]and where provision has not been mad
[normal]e for cyclists (or pedestrians).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The strategic road network is, in general, made up of two types of road: purpose built dual carriageway/motorway 
[normal]and historically strategic road alignments which have been gradually upgraded. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Of these two types of road, the 
[normal]upgraded old road
[normal] represents the biggest problem, partly because they are in close proxi
[normal]mity to heavily populated areas, often passing through 
[normal]urban areas or rural areas with multiple minor road junctions. Purpose built
[normal] motorways
[normal] or new dual carriageways
[normal] use 
[normal]grade
[normal]-
[normal]separated crossings
[normal] for most minor roads and rights of way
[normal], whereas the process of gradual upgrading has meant that older roads sever
[normal] 
[normal]local road 
[normal]and rights of way 
[normal]network. 
[normal]The ‘Action for Roads’ document acknowledges that “some major roads, particularly those built in the early days of mass-motoring, can create a barrier between two sides” (p. 45).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although thousands of examples exist, 
[normal]one can be found on
[normal] the A27 in West Sussex
[normal], a road that forms
[normal] part of the strategic road network serving the South Coast. In many places it bypasses towns and villages, however, in other places it remains in the same location as the road had been at the st
[normal]art of the motoring age
[normal] (see Figures 1 and 2 below). Whereas then traffic would have been light and crossing would have been 
[normal]simple
[normal], it is now a fast, very heavi
[normal]ly used dual carriageway, with over 27 thousands vehicles per day.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Minor roads which used to 
[normal]cross the road are now closed to motor traffic
[normal], or accessible only as single-facing junctions
[normal], while pedestrians and cyclists are supposed to wait for gaps in two streams of 70 mph traffic to cross
[normal].
[normal] There are three potential routes between
[normal] the villages of 
[normal]Slindon and Walberton, including minor roads, a bridleway and a busier B-road.
[normal] All of these routes 
[normal]have
[normal] level c
[normal]rossings with the A27.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The A27 in the 1920s (left) and today (right)
[normal] 
[normal]severing local trips between villages.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Hundreds of these minor roads hav
[normal]e been cut in road upgrades over the years, with similar impact
[normal]s on the rights of way network. These problems abound across the network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In other places, where the major road served 
[normal]as crucial link joining minor roads, or the sole link between communities
[normal], the lack of proper adjacent facilities for cyclists, or inadequate quality of treatment of crossings of major junctions, means that the link has become unusable for all but the least risk averse cyclists. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]‘
[normal]Action on Roads
[normal]’
[normal] paper has task
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]Highways Agency with analysing where the strategic road network acts as a barrier to local cycling movement
[normal]. H
[normal]owever, the commitment to mitigate the problem is contingent on 
[normal]key 
[normal]individuals
[normal] within the Agency
[normal], and the mechanism
[normal]s to embed this in Highways Ag
[normal]ency (and local authority) practice are presently vague and undeveloped. 
[normal]Although each scheme must go through a No
[normal]n-Motorised User Audit process, in CTC’s experience, 
[normal]this often appears to have failed to deal with the problems, or has 
[normal]not generated 
[normal]adequat
[normal]e
[normal] solutions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lack of evidence of cycle use should not be used as a reason not to provide routes[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Part of the problem remains that in many places where roads are being upgraded or junction capacity increased, conditions for cycling are already very hazardo
[normal]us and 
[normal]consequently cycling levels are minimal. However, just because conditions are poor, does not mean that no one wants to use the route – on the example given above, there may have bee
[normal]n many people who in the distant
[normal] past travelled between Slindon and 
[normal]Walberton by foot, cycle and even horse
[normal]. 
[normal]Today, though 
[normal]only a
[normal] flat
[normal] 
[normal]mile divides these villages
[normal], such trips 
[normal]are greatly
[normal] deterred
[normal] the need to cross the 
[normal]river of traffic that is the 
[normal]A27. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Furthermore CTC campaigners have regularly faced problems with the way
[normal] the HA treats cyclists when upgrading routes or junctions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study: Jun[bold]c[bold]tion 9 M3[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Since dangerous crossings or narrow, low quality routes are
[normal] often
[normal] little used, making the case for their improvement is hard. 
[normal]The lack of evidence of use of routes 
[normal]that are already severed means that attempts by local campaigners to argue for improvements, new – grade separated crossings – or parallel facilities, are often ignored or
[normal] underplayed by HA contractors.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Proposals to 
[normal]upgrade junction 
[normal]9 
[normal]of the 
[normal]M3 involved 
[normal]narrowing the available space for footway users alongside an overbridge to provide a third carriageway lane. The Highways Agency ignored the fact that the 
[normal]footpath provided at the time of the original construction of the junction
[normal] was part of the National C
[normal]ycle Network and failed to engage with either cyclists or pedestrians with regard to the status and use of the route.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study: Junction 13 M1[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]When redesigning junction 13 of the M1 (junction with the A421), the HA initially omitted any cycle provision. After the public inquiry inspector upheld objections to this from CTC’s local campaigner, a revised (but still inadequate) scheme was agreed. How
[normal]ever it was incompletely implemented when the junction was opened, leaving cyclists to negotiate an unsurfaced mud-bath or a major roundabout.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]After protests led to this being remedied, the HA introduced signing which led cyclists straight to a dangerou
[normal]s roundabout, instead of connecting with a bridge built by the local authority to avoid this. It took months of campaigning before correct signing was installed – almost 3 years after the new junction had been opened.  Meanwhile, the scheme’s inadequacies 
[normal]mean that a huge opportunity has been missed to encourage people to cycle to 
[normal]work at the nearby Amazon depot, or to Cranfield University.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC recommends that the Highways Agency provide better training for staff
[normal] and contractors
[normal] in how to design for cyclis
[normal]ts, and develops more robust procedures to 
[normal]ensure that schemes actually develop 
[normal]improved 
[normal]networks for walking and cycling, not just mitigating the damage caused by existing or new roads.
[normal] 
[normal]The programme of works to retrofit improvements must continue in future years, with more of the Non-Motorised User Crossings schemes progressed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CTC also recommends that the 
[normal]sections of the 
[normal]standards document used by the Highways Agency, the ‘Design Manua
[normal]l for Roads and Bridges’
[normal], 
[normal]be 
[normal]overhaul
[normal]ed
[normal] to bring it in line with other cycling design guidance. Dimensions and designs in this document fall well below the standard of 
[normal]other international and national best practice
[normal], presenting local authority engineers wit
[normal]h confusing and conflicting double standards, and permitting designers to opt for the minimal standard design
[normal], rather than a high quality solution.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c) [bold]Use of the strategic road network by local motorised traffic, which could be shifted to sustainable mode[bold]s.[bold] [bold]Previous research has suggested that congestion on the strategic road network is often due to short trips that use parts of the strategic network.
[normal] 
[normal]If conditions for local trips on and across the strategic road network could be improved
[normal] for cyclists
[normal], th
[normal]e benefits may be conferred on the network itself, by reducing 
[normal]the level of traffic using the strategic road network to m
[normal]ake short intra-urban journeys. This could alleviate congested locations though demand-side, rather than supply-side, measures.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Creati
[normal]ng access to the strategic road network for local motor traffic in some cases also induces more traffic onto local roads through attracting longer trip distances and enhancing the perceived ease of access by car. In this respect, reduction in the permeabil
[normal]ity of the strategic road network for motor traffic is 
[normal]beneficial, but access across the network for cyclists and
[normal] pedestrians must be maintained. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Table 1.2 of the report (p 18) shows that although traffic on the strategic road network grew up until 2006, since then it has been static. While some of that period included a substantial recession, 
[normal]the lack of growth in 2006 (before the recession) and subsequently, together with the gradual decline in traffic on the rest of the road network, suggests that the outputs of the National Transport Model
[normal], which have persistently predicted sustained motor t
[normal]raffic growth,
[normal] are flawed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One small example of the out of date baseline data that the NTM uses can be found in its figures on cycling. The NTM assumes that 
[normal]average cycle trip length (originally a little over 2 miles in 2010) will rise very slightly, befo
[normal]re falling back to a figure b
[normal]elow the 2010 figure by 2035, whereas car trips will continue to increase in length.
[normal] 
[normal]However, in reality, cycle trip lengths are 48% longer in 2012 than 
[normal]they were 10 years earlier, far higher than the inpu
[normal]t level used in the m
[normal]odel, while car trips have not increased in length (
[normal]see 
[normal]figure 3).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This extension in the average trip length is likely due to the growth of cycling amongst long-distance sport cycling and 
[normal]cycle commuting amongst older adults. 
[normal]CTC suspects that this is supported by the rise in value and quality of cycles, which is likely to make 
[normal]longer distance trips more practical. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, CTC believes that the Transport Model is underplaying the
[normal] long-term
[normal] impact of electric bikes, which make up 
[normal]just 1% of the market at present, but in mature markets, such as the Netherlands, amount to 15% of total
[normal] bike sales
[normal].
[normal] Bikes with electrical assistance will lead to further increases in trip length, increasing the li
[normal]kelihood that cycle trips will a) displace more car trips and b) intersect with, or require the use of, the strategic road network.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This is but one – 
[normal]albeit minor - example of how CTC
[normal] feel
[normal]s
[normal] that the 
[normal]parameters used within
[normal] the National Transport Model are
[normal] inaccurate. 
[normal]Transport academics have pointed out that
[normal] other aspects of the models calculations are flawed
[normal] and biased 
[normal]towards inflated traffic growth.
[normal] 
[normal]CTC
[normal] suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that the model needs to be substantially overhauled and improved before its forecasts are u
[normal]sed to determine policy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If
[normal] 
[normal]the Model’s output is accepted as inevitable and the network is planned to meet the growth in motor traffic, then that growth has a greater chance of materialising. On the other hand, a more radical suite of policy measures to 
[normal]reduce motor traffic and shift to sustainable modes could produce a very different result, and one that would 
[normal]be substantially 
[normal]less costly, result in far fewer emissions and be more appealing to 
[normal]those communities potentially blighted by the projected huge 
[normal]increases in traffic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The greatest impact on reliability 
[normal]comes from road crashes, not necessarily congestion, which is 
[normal]usually predictable and can be accommodated for
[normal] in trip timing and route choice
[normal]. Reducing the risk of crashes for all road users should, we feel, be the focus of efforts to improve reliability. The use of lower speed limits, enforced by average speed camer
[normal]as, has shown to be effective in this regard.
[normal] One area of technological improvement that should be investigated further is that of intelligent speed adaptation, by which maximum vehicle speeds could be determined independently and 
[normal]varied
[normal] to 
[normal]accommodate 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]weather 
[normal]conditions or density of traffic
[normal].
