defaultWritten evidence from Sherborne Transport Action Group (TIC 107)
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Sherborne Transport Action Group (STAG) aims to improve transport provision for the people of Sherborne and the surrounding villages, particularly to help those 
defaultwithout access to a car and to encourage car owners to use other modes.
default&#xa0;
defaultSTAG welcomes all who have an interest in its objects.  Members may include representatives of town and parish councils, transport-related organisations, transport-providers and other
default interested members of the community.
default&#xa0;
defaultThis submission was agreed by STAG at its meeting on 19 September 2013.default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe great majority of enquiries into local transport have concentrated almost wholly on the context of cities and large towns.  We welcome the 
defaultemphasis of the current enquiry .  We hope, however, that it will include not only areas which are truly isolated, but also the rural areas which cannot be regarded as isolated, but where the dispersal of population raises issues entirely different from th
defaultose of the large urban areas.  Sherborne

defaultAnnex 1default&#xa0;defaultRelation of Public Transport to Development PlanningdefaultProvision of public
default transport ought to be assessed in the overall context of planning.
default  This is made more difficult by the fact that transport is a County re
defaults
defaultponsibility, while planning lies with the Districts.
default 
default Active integration is needed.
defaultThe current criteria for the crea
defaulttion of Local Plans call for assessment, in deciding how rural areas should develop, of the overall effect on the cost of services to a community. The absence of accessible public transport will increase those costs. It has the effect of excluding many of 
defaultthe very elderly, who are present in increasing numbers, from any community or business centre which is less than a very few miles from their home (anecdotal evidence from the property market suggests 7 miles). This alienation, once it has occurred, is irr
defaulteversible. 
defaultThere is a compelling case for providing housing in the villages for younger people so that schools and other facilities remain viable.  However, i
defaultt would be perverse to decree an increase in the need for distributed social/affordable housing i
defaultn isolated rural communities without costing in a long-
defaultterm subsidy for transport. T
defaulthose with a real need may be expected to have a greater requirement for public transport to access not only retail but increasingly necessary social and health services. Wi
defaultthout a transport subsidy, the effect would otherwise be to create rural communities which are increasingly made up of the relatively wealthy middle aged, whose contribution to local costs is currently limited by the absurdly low top band of Council Tax. 
defaultThe relative cost to local government of servicing those of the population who are in fact frail, immobile or poor would therefore be reduced by not encouraging these people to live in isolated communities.  But it must be questioned whether this would be 
defaultsocially acceptable.

default  We have encountered firm statements from local authority representatives which are i
defaultn 
defaultflat 
defaultcontradiction with the actual situation.
default  However, several factors stand out:
default&#xa0;
default1.  The scheme was introduc
defaulted on the basis that it would be fully funded by central government.  While one recognises the right of a government to vary the undertakings of its 
defaultpredecessor, it is deeply regret
defaultable that 
default'
defaultgovernment
default' (of whatever party)
default has reneged on this and thereby 
defaultdestroyed the foundations of the scheme.
default  Given the constraints on local authority funding, the reduction in central provision means that the operators are squeezed.
default  The original maxim that operators should neither gain nor lose by the scheme is no longer being honoured.
default&#xa0;
default2.  The basis of calculating reimbursement is extremely coarse
default, with a single reimbursement rate whatever the length of journey.
default  Some authorities 
defaultwork on an 'average fare' across all
default of an operator's routes.  The reimbursement rate is thus 
defaultdominated by
default short urban routes
default 
default(the large majority)
default and is wholly inadequate for the long rural routes.  This results
default 
defaultin a 
defaultperverse 
defaulttransfer of funds from long r
defaultural routes to short urban routes, contrary to the economic stresses.
default&#xa0;
default3.  Since the reimbursement rate is based on the average of cash fares (often a tiny minority of passengers) there is an incentive to keep those cash fares high and to 
defaultavoid offering an
defaulty
default discounted fares such as off-peak 
defaulto
defaultr promotional periods. 
default This militates against attracting new fare-paying passengers.
default&#xa0;
default4. There is widespread evidence that many passengers would be prepared to pay a modest fare rather than having entirely free travel,
default if this would secure the future of a route.  However, 
defaultsuch flexibility is not permitted
default under the rules of the national scheme.
