[normal]Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire [CST0070][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you very much for your letter regarding your inquiry into crime statistics. I hope the below will assist your Committee in forming an overview of the recording and use of crime statistics in North Yorkshire.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My Police 
[normal]and 
[normal]Crime Plan contains no specific targets for crime. Currently, our only objectives are broad, but are the focus of our work in North Yorkshire. We have one specific overarching 
[normal]goal, 
[normal]which is 
[normal]to 
[normal]maintain North Yorkshire as the safest county in England.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]More generally, I am reviewing my Police and Crime Plan 
[normal]at 
[normal]the moment, and 
[normal]am 
[normal]developing 
[normal]a 
[normal]more thorough system for measuring performance. This will be based on outcomes rather than fulfilling targets, and I hope to publish the renewed plan in 
[normal]the 
[normal]summer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At this stage, it is hard to disaggregate police performance to know what effect the 
[normal]wholesale 
[normal]removal of targets has had in North Yorkshire. It is 
[normal]also 
[normal]important to bear in mind that other police agencies, such 
[normal]as 
[normal]HMIC, and to a large extent the 
[normal]general 
[normal]public, 
[normal]still 
[normal]judge police forces 
[normal]by 
[normal]targets, 
[normal]and 
[normal]one target in particular- crime coming down. 
[normal]This 
[normal]has had 
[normal]an impact 
[normal]on police culture generally, but 
[normal]as 
[normal]explained 
[normal]above, 
[normal]I hope to be 
[normal]able 
[normal]to implement 
[normal]a 
[normal]new 
[normal]series 
[normal]of 
[normal]outcomes 
[normal]measures rather than a reliance on targets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It 
[normal]is also 
[normal]important to note that we 
[normal]would welcome 
[normal]the increase in the reporting 
[normal]of some crimes. We 
[normal]know anecdotally that domestic 
[normal]abuse, 
[normal]sexual 
[normal]abuse, 
[normal]rural crime and hate crime (among
[normal]s
[normal]t others) 
[normal]are all 
[normal]historically under-reported. The 
[normal]opening of 
[normal]a new 
[normal]Sexual 
[normal]Assault Referral 
[normal]Centre 
[normal]in York has led to an increase in crimes being 
[normal]reported, 
[normal]but this is 
[normal]welcome as we are 
[normal]now 
[normal]able 
[normal]to support more victims 
[normal]of this 
[normal]terrible crime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On 
[normal]the accuracy and assuredness 
[normal]of 
[normal]crime 
[normal]figures more 
[normal]generally, 
[normal]we have a 
[normal]robust 
[normal]s
[normal]y
[normal]stem of checks and 
[normal]balances in North Yorkshire.
