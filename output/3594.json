"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from Heathrow (WRT 039)&#xa0;CapacityHeathrow has always operated with a slightly lower declared capacity during the winter season compared to the summer.\n&#xa0;\n In my evidence I referred to the fact that this year, for the first time, we \nlooked at whether there were opportunities to further reduce the winter schedule in order to improve resilience. I said I would come back to you with the information on how many flights this has affected.\n&#xa0;\nThis year we have reallocated, from the winter to \nthe summer season, 1,000 scheduled flights over the entire season. There is a capacity of 1,341 flights per day on average during the summer season and 1,279 flights per day during winter.\n&#xa0;\n We do not believe that there is further scope to reduce the winter\n schedule without damaging the range of flights and destinations available to passengers.\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nWe believe that making cancellations on an ad hoc basis in advance of forecast winter weather is a better solution for passengers than making further reductions ac\nross the entire season. Our approach results in cancellations on a handful of days rather than flights being cancelled for all 154 days of the winter season.\n&#xa0;\nAircraft Capability I can confirm that over 99% of aircraft using Heathrow can land during low v\nisibility (Cat111).\n&#xa0;\nPassenger communicationsMaking sure as many of our passengers as possible can travel to their destination is our priority during weather-related disruption. In the event that passengers are unable to travel, we work with airlines and \nother partners to give timely and accurate information. I wanted to confirm that Heathrow has the ability to respond on social media to passengers seeking help and advice 24 hours a day, if the level of disruption requires this response.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
