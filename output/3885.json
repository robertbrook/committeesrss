\nRCH0022\n&#xa0;\nSupplementary w\nritten evidence submitted by the Office of the Children’s Rights Director\n&#xa0;\nSubmitted by Roger Morgan, Children’s Rights Director for England\n&#xa0;\nQualifications (Transcript Q10)\n&#xa0;\nChildren have repeatedly in consultations defined the \npersonalities that they consider make good residential staff.\n&#xa0;\n If follows that recruitment should select for these traits as well as for qualifications, and that qualifications without these traits are unlikely to make good staff, according to the children\n they care for.\n&#xa0;\nIn \nLife in children’s homes (Children’s Rights Director, 2007),\n the children’s list of the top five factors making good residential staff was:\n&#xa0;\n kind and caring, listening and responding to children’s concerns and problems, funny happy and\n easy to get along with, supportive understanding and encouraging, and effective in keeping children safe and well. \n&#xa0;\nBy contrast, the greatest negative was having changing moods.\n&#xa0;\n Other negative traits were bringing personal issues to work, any tendency to\n bully, having favourites, over-reliance on restraint rather than being able to stay calm and ‘de-escalate’ situations, and any tendency to ‘put children down’ (even in anger) because of those children’s situation or past.\n&#xa0;\nIn \nChanging Children’s Homes (C\nhildren’s Rights Director, 2013), \n&#xa0;\nwhich I am about to publish, responses from a survey of over 600 children currently resident in children’s homes defined the necessary personality traits of residential staff very similarly, as being caring and kind, good\n at communicating with children, and having a sense of humour.\n&#xa0;\nSo yes, I am happy to be quoted as advocating that on the basis of children’s definition of the personality traits needed in a good member of residential staff, those traits should indeed be \nselected for in recruitment, alongside qualifications.\n&#xa0;\nInduction training\n&#xa0;\nWe have not specifically referred to ‘induction’ as such in consultations, but have asked children what training they consider residential staff need to have.\n&#xa0;\n Children do say th\nat qualifications are important, but they also state that basic skills are needed, which in my view supports the need for basic skill induction as well as qualifications, and demonstrates that qualifications alone are not enough without those basic skills \nbeing trained for.\n&#xa0;\n In \nChanging Children’s Homes (Children’s Rights Director, 2013, about to be published) \n&#xa0;\nchildren define basic skills all staff need to be trained in as being:\n&#xa0;\n training in working with children, how to manage behaviour, first aid, askin\ng and taking into account children’s views, engaging children in activities, helping with homework, helping children learn independence (especially how to cook), and how to supervise and safeguard children in and around a children’s home.\n&#xa0;\nListening to Ch\nildren\n&#xa0;\nThe reference to children contacting us is to the number of children who contact the Office of the Children’s Rights Director over breaches of their rights, which almost always include a failure to listen to the child and failure to comply with Re\ngulations or Statutory Guidance.\n&#xa0;\n \nThis number of ‘casework contacts’ to my office runs on average at over 400 per annum.\n&#xa0;\n My reference to being unable to put a numerical figure on the extent to which children do not receive what Regulations say they are en\ntitled to was to emphasise that these 400-plus are the children who actually contact my office, but there will be an unknown number of others in similar circumstances who do not contact my office, so I cannot quantify a total number or proportion of childr\nen not receiving entitlements under Regulations.\n&#xa0;\nChoice\n&#xa0;\nThe report containing the reference to 47% of children in care was the \nChildren’s Social Care Monitor 2011 (Children’s Rights Director, 2012).\n&#xa0;\n \nCan I now however formally make a correction to the \nfigure I am recorded as saying in evidence – the correct figure from the report is 57% of children stating that there had been no choice of placement the last time they moved to a new placement, not 47%.\n&#xa0;\n Makes the point an even stronger one.\n&#xa0;\n There are ot\nher data in that report on placement change – including lack of notice of change of placement and lack of visiting new placements before moving in.\n&#xa0;\nNumber of single placement homes\n&#xa0;\nDfE\n statistics should give you the number / percentage of single place children’s homes – should be available from the department’s statistics section, but let me know if you have any difficulty with this and I’ll check out for you.\n&#xa0;\nMy thoughts on single pe\nrson homes as a distinct and separate category of home are that while many children in children’s homes generally refer to living with a group of peers as being a distinctive feature of residential life, and many foster children refer to living in a family\n setting as a distinct feature of foster care, single place children’s homes are neither group living nor a family setting.\n&#xa0;\n They are uniquely providing care by a group of staff, changing with different shifts, living with and caring for just one child.\n&#xa0;\n T\nhe safeguarding issues are different to both group living and family living, the focus on one child is distinctively more intensive, the experience of residential care alone is very different to life in another type of children’s home, while care is profes\nsional rather than personal parenting even though there are no other children – a group of staff around one child, rather than the usual group of staff around a group of children, and Regulations and Standards naturally tend to focus on the norm of group l\niving in a home.\n&#xa0;\n To me, the difference between being a child alone with a staff group and being a child living in a residential group of children is greater to a child than whether the home is owned by a local authority or an independent body.\n&#xa0;\nClosure a\nnd receivership\n&#xa0;\nThe relevant legislation is the Children’s Homes Regulations 2001 (as amended), where in Regulation 39 a receiver, liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy is required to notify Ofsted\n of his appointment and the reasons for it, to appoint a manager to take full-time day to day charge of the home if there is no registered manager, and to notify his intentions regarding the future operation of the home.\n&#xa0;\n Clearly, receivers, liquidators an\nd trustees have a clear financial duty and role, but there is in my view inadequate protection for children in the Children’s Homes Regulations.\n&#xa0;\n Specifically, (i) the Regulations empower a receiver, liquidator or trustee to appoint a manager for the home \nif there is no continuing registered manager – but they do not stipulate that such an appointed manager shall have the same duties in relation to the welfare of the children in the home as a registered manager does, (ii) the Regulations do not impose \non th\ne receiver, liquidator or trustee the same duties towards the safety and welfare of the children in the home that would apply to another person or organisation taking over as provider of the home, and (iii) there is no specific provision requiring the rece\niver, liquidator or trustee to act in relation to the home and their future plans for it in a manner which protects the welfare of any remaining children in the home and maximises as far as practicable their future appropriate onward placement if the home \nis to be closed (eg in practice, to delay closure until all the children have been satisfactorily placed elsewhere, even if that conflicts with usual financial duties of receivers, liquidators or trustees), and finally (iv) there is no imposition of a duty\n to cooperate with placing authorities and the local area authority in their work to secure appropriate future placement for any children who must leave the home.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
