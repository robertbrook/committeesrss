"Written evidence submitted by Robin Mclaren, Know Edge Ltd&#xa0;INTRODUCTIONI am a director of Know Edge Ltd an Edinburgh based, independent management consulting company that supports organisations to innovate and generate business benefits from their land information. I am recognised as a world expert in Land Information Managem\nent and have worked extensively with the United Nations, EU and World Bank on land policy / land reform programmes to strengthen security of tenure and support economic reforms in Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, Middle-East and the Far-East. I am curre\nntly supporting the Iraq and Kuwait governments in the formulation and implementation of their National Land Policies. I am an advocate of good land governance \n(\n1)\n \nthat \nfacilitate the allocation of rights to use the land in a way that ensures sustainable \ndevelopment, providing optimum social and economic benefit, not only for the present but also for future generations, without damaging the environment.\n&#xa0;\nLAND REFORM REVIEW GROUP – CALL FOR EVIDENCEI welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to assist the\n work of the \nScottish Affairs Committee\n. My comments are all aimed at policy and institutional frameworks to support and guide the land reform process.\n&#xa0;\nIssues with Current Situation of Administering and Managing Land in Scotland&#xa0;\nFragmented Land Policies\n - \nThere is no single source of land policy or National Land Policy – rather, the policies on land in Scotland are located in numerous sources such as national development policies, land use strategies, laws and regulations and even as the result of admini\nstrative practices. Also, there are numerous policies across the government directorates and agencies that touch on land, such as policies on housing, education, natural heritage, economic development, etc. This patchwork of land policies makes it problema\ntic for these land policies to collectively align and effectively support the vision for Scotland and ensure that land effectively supports Scotland’s future needs.\n&#xa0;\nWeak Land Governance\n - the governance arrangements of land\n are weak – there is no recognis\ned champion of the sector and no cross cutting government body of senior officials, such as a Land Commission, to co-ordinate land activities. This has resulted in weaknesses in two crucial areas: there is no overall National Land Policy, neither in genera\nl nor on the state and public lands in particular, providing a consistent policy framework of all the ministries managing land; and the lack of efficient co-ordination across the ministries involved in land administration and management significantly delay\ns or stops the implementation of land \ninitiatives\n, including land reform\n.\n&#xa0;\nInconsistent Management of Land\n - the institutional arrangements for administering and managing land are highly fragmented across \nScottish\n public sector custodians and there is neit\nher regulatory nor executive oversight body. This results in inconsistent and inefficient approaches to land management.\n&#xa0;\nInefficient Land Information Management\n – information about land is captured, maintained and managed independently by the custodians o\nf land without the adoption of national data and procedural standards. This has resulted in land information being incomplete, inconsistent, inaccessible and not shared and used across Government\n and beyond\n. For example, there is no definitive inventory of\n state \nand public \nland\n and the geographic access to land ownership\n is limited to land within the Land R\negister\n. \n&#xa0;\nInsufficient Capacity in Land Management\n – although the \ndirectorates and agencies\n involved in land have good skills within their particular la\nnd disciplines, the government is missing resources that have a wider perspective of land administration and management and can understand the wider land policy issues. This just serves to compound the fragmented and un-coordinated management of land in \nSc\notland\n.\n&#xa0;\nWay Forward&#xa0;\nScotland’s land reform agenda has to be guided by a National Land Policy framework, be informed through open, comprehensive land information, be administrated \nand regulated \nthrough strong governance and be implemented with sufficient \ncapacity. These proposals are discussed below:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransparency is a fundamental characteristic of good land governance that encourages engagement with citizens over land issues and is proven to reduce corruption\n and the mis-u\nse of land\n. I believe that \nall government organisations involved with land, including the \nRegisters of Scotland\n,\n should be totally transparent and expose, free of charge, as much of their land information to the public as possible.\n&#xa0;\nI would also \nrecommend that \nthis \nland \ninformation\n \nbecome an integral part of the wider ‘open data’ initiative being advocated by open government. The opening up of governmental data, free for re-use, is being justified on economic grounds (2) (\n3\n) \n(4) \nsince access to th\nese data will have major benefits for citizens, businesses, and society and for the governments themselves. Some of the benefits include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nA National Land Policy and associated Land Reform Policy must be evidence based. This will only happen if Scotland creates a National Land Information Se\nrvice that provides ease of access to a holistic set of interoperable land information about Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLand Administration Systems provide the infrastructure for implementing land policies and land \nmanagement strategies in support of sustainable development. This infrastructure includes the institutional arrangements, a legal framework, processes, standards, land information, management and dissemination systems, and technologies required to support \nallocation, land markets, valuation, control of uses, and development of interests in land. Land Administration Systems are dynamic and evolve to reflect the people-to-land relationships, to adopt new technologies and to manage a wider and richer set of la\nnd information. The Registers of Scotland provide \nthe \nland tenure element of Scotland’s Land Administration System.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Figure 1: The land management paradigm (5)Land management underpins the distribution and management of a key asset of any society namely\n its land. For western democracies, with their highly geared economies, land management is a key activity of both government and the private sector. Land management, and especially the central land administration component, aim to deliver efficient land ma\nrkets and effective management of the use of land in support of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. The land management paradigm, as illustrated in Figure 1, allows everyone to understand the role of the land administration functions (land \ntenure, land value, land use, and land development) and how land administration institutions relate to the historical circumstances of a country and its policy decisions. The \nLand Administration System\n is the fundamental infrastructure that underpins and i\nntegrates the land tenure, land value, land use and land development functions of land administration to support an efficient land market that fully demonstrates sustainable development.\n&#xa0;\nLand Administration Systems are just a means of implementing land po\nlicies. However, Scotland does not have a National Land Policy to provide a holistic framework to guide the land tenure, land value, land use and land development functions of land administration. It is recommended that Scotland creates a National Land Pol\nicy to guide the future of \nScottish land \ninstitutions\n, including the land reform agenda.\n \nAn example framework for a National Land Policy is detailed in Appendix A.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLand administration and management in Scotland is characterised by the fragmentation of responsibilities across a wide range of land custodians with little monitoring and regulation of their land activities. This \nlaissez faire\n custodian approach is contrar\ny to international good practice that is increasingly integrating and regulating the management of state and public land. For example, Singapore has formed a Singapore Land Authority that integrates land registration and cadastre, state land management, ge\nospatial and land information management, corporate services and regulation. It is therefore recommended that land institutional arrangements in \nScotland\n are incrementally integrated over the following transitional steps.\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLand Coordination Committee\nThe first step change in strengthening the governance of land in \nScotland\n would be to create a Land Coordination Committee, reporting to \na Minister\n, composed of senior officials from the key \ndirectorates\n \nand agencies\n managing \nand administering\n land. This L\nand Coordination Committee would have responsibilities at both the policy and operational levels. A key activity will be to create impro\nved access to integrated land information.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLand Commission\nOnce the Land Coordination Committee is operating effectivel\ny, then the land governance could be further strengthened by transforming the Land Coordination Committee (based purely on cooperation) into a Land Commission with \nformalis\ned executive roles and responsibilities. As well as continuing the role of coordinat\ning land activities, a key responsibility for the Land Commission would be \nformulating and maintaining a National Land Policy and monitoring that the individual \ndirectorates’ and agencies’\n policies are aligned and implementing the National Land Policy. This will ensure the allocation of rights to use the land delivers sustainable development and provides optim\num social and economic benefits\n.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLand Authority\nIn the medium term institutional \nreform in the land sector should go further and consolidate many of the current land administration and management activities of the diverse \ndirectorates and agencies\n, including mapping and geospatial information management, into a single Land Authority. T\nhis would be similar to the institutional solutions introduced into New Zealand (\nhttp://www.linz.govt.nz/\n ) and Singapore (\nhttp://www.sla.gov.sg/\n ). \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nScottish public sector professionals tend to be specialists in narrow fields in the land sector and are missing the wider land management perspective and understanding. This reduces the professionals’ interest and involvement in wider land policy iss\nues and coordination of land activities across directorates and agencies. It is recommended that capacity building programmes be identified and designed, e.g. continued professional development training programmes, establish a post-graduate educational pro\ngram on land management in cooperation with Scottish Universities. Capacity building programmes are a continuous process and should be activated as soon as possible to ensure that the resources are available to underpin the recommended improvements in land\n administration and management in Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDevelopment practitioners of all persuasion recognize that a well-functioning land sector can boost a country's economic growth, foster social development, shiel\nd the rights of vulnerable groups and help with environmental protection. Improving practices requires an objective assessment of the land governance setting, and the identification of priority areas.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nLand Governance Assessment Framework (\nLGAF\n)\n, \ndeveloped by the World Bank and its partners, provides a holistic, diagnostic review at the country level that can inform policy dialogue in a clear and targeted manner. It is built around five main areas for policy intervention:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLegal and institutional f\nramework\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLand use planning, management and taxation\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nManagement of public land\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic provision of land information\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDispute resolution and conflict management\n&#xa0;\nThe LGAF helps policymakers and other stakeholders to make sense of the technical levels of the \nland sector, benchmark governance, prioritize reforms in the land sector, and identify areas that require further attention.\n&#xa0;\nThe LGAF process is guided by a framework of 21 land governance indicators in the 5 key areas listed above, each divided into 3-4 \ndimensions for which rankings are assigned by expert panels based on pre-coded answers (on a scale from A to D) that draw on global experience. Through a consensual and participatory assessment by local experts of this core set of indicators, the LGAF serv\nes to map out key information on land governance and define actionable paths for policy interventions, all in a contextualized and country-driven manner. Implementation takes place in a number of discrete steps that are overseen by a local coordinator, a w\nell-respected and impartial person with extensive knowledge of the sector.\n&#xa0;\nI would recommend that the \nScottish Affairs Committee\n commissions a review of Scotland’s current land governance through the LGAF. This will then guide the most appropriate policy \ninterventions. \n&#xa0;\nAPPENDIX A: WHAT IS A NATIONAL LAND POLICY?The aim of a National Land Policy is to secure the rights of all land users and serve the multiple goals of equity, poverty reduction, income growth, economic efficiency and sustainable environme\nntal management.
