[normal]Dear Members
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]UK
[normal] has the ability to improve safety for cycling but a combination of regulation, practices,
[normal] design standards, cycling culture and training plus other general road safety 
[normal]improvements are required
[normal] to achieve good 
[normal]to excellent 
[normal]results.

[normal];
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The 
[normal]Introduction to the Highway Code[bold] includes: 
[normal]“
[normal]Although failure to comply with the other rules of The Highway Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts (see 
[normal]The road user and the law
[normal]) to establish liability. This includes rules which use advisory wording such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’.”
[normal] 
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/highway-code/introduction
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For c
[normal]yclists this can create a 
[normal]problem in that the Code uses the word ‘should’ when applied to advice on what to wear
[normal], Rule 59, see below
[normal]. 
[normal]For pedestrians the word ‘should’ is not use
[normal]d. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Advice for pedestrians states;
[normal]  (
[normal]https://www.gov.uk/rules-pedestrians-1-to-35
[normal] )
[normal]Rule 3
[normal]Help other road users to see you.[bold] Wear or carry something light-coloured, bright or fluorescent in poor daylight conditions. When it is dark, use reflective materials (e.g. armbands, sashes, waistcoats, jackets, footwear), which can be seen by drivers using headlights up to three times as
[normal] far away as non-reflective materials.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In practice compensati
[normal]on is sometimes reduced for
[normal] people cycling
[normal] due to not 
[normal]wear
[normal]ing
[normal] extra safety aids and pedestrians usually gain full compensation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To provide for fair compensation and support people’s right
[normal] to 
[normal]wear their normal clothing
[normal], the following changes are suggested. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Adding a
[normal] sentence to the ‘
[normal]Introduction[bold]’,
[normal]“However, liability should not be based on wearing extra safety aids in the case of pedestrians and cyclists.”

[normal]Clothing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The advice to wear a helmet was added to the Code in 1993 when evidence was still being collected and it was p
[normal]remature. In 2013 there is
[normal] evidence for a
[normal]nd against promotin
[normal]g their use, from both safety and social perspectives.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rule 163[bold] 
[normal]– suggested changes

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘pass vulnerable road users with extra care and generous clearance’

[normal]https://www.gov.uk/road-users-requiring-extra-care-204-to-225/motorcyclists-and-cyclists-211-to-213
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Take extra care passing cyclists, 
[normal]preferably leave 1.5m or more but at least a minimum passing distance of one metre between the motor vehicle and a bicyclist for speeds up to 30 mph. At higher speeds more space should be provided and sufficient to prevent contact with the person operating
[normal] the bicycle if the person were to fall into the driver’s lane of traffic. Pass with care and not at excessive speed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rule 2[bold]39[bold]Parking (239 to 247)

[normal]l
[normal]d
[normal] give more emphasis, ‘General rules section could be used.
[normal] 
[normal]People opening doors and causing accidents result in deaths and serious injury to cyclists

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Plus an enlarged picture illustrating the dangers of opening a car door could be provided
[normal]A link to 
[normal]rule 239 could be added.

[normal]HGV type vehicles are required to leave at least a 2 seconds gap from the vehicle in front on all types of roads. 
[normal]Note, this allows for a better view on the inside area where cyclists are likely to be.
[normal]The above suggestions
[normal] 
[normal]for

[normal]the I
[normal]ntroductio
[normal]n, 
[normal]rules
[normal] 59, 163, 
[normal]213
[normal] and 239 plus 
[normal]new
[normal] Rule
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]could
[normal] resu
[normal]lt 
[normal]in 
[normal]fewer accidents
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A number
[normal] of other measures could be introduced
[normal] as part of 
[normal]a
[normal] road safety
[normal] bill
[normal], see below
[normal], 
[normal]Appendix 
[normal]A
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Part 2[bold]Design standards for cycling infrastructure [bold]The 
[normal]UK
[normal] provides
[normal] design
[normal] guidelines and 
[normal]DfT
[normal] issue guidance
[normal]. These do not generally result in high quality consistent standards for infrastructure and in some cases engineers will not provide cycling facilities at all or 
[normal]provide sub guidelines recommendations or not 
[normal]follow the
[normal] gui
[normal]delines.
[normal] 
[normal]A new
[normal] approach is needed based on
[normal] standards that form the minimum requirement for cycling 
[normal]infrastructure
[normal]. One standard already in use in Victoria, Australia, ‘
[normal]Design standards for bicycle facilities’
[normal], they provide 
[normal] 
[normal]'Cycle Notes',
[normal] a series of 
[normal]21 
[normal]in
[normal]formation bulletins on design standards for cycling infrastructure.
[normal]http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoa
[normal]ndservices/Bicycles/StrategicDirectionsForCycling/BicycleFacilityDesignStandards.htm
[normal]The detail design 
[normal]of infrastructure for cycling is an important safety aspect
[normal] and guidelines are not adequate to meet the needs required.
[normal] The aim is for the ‘standards’ to direct the design engineers to what is required for best practice
[normal] and reduce their design time and costs
[normal]. The 
[normal]Netherlands
[normal] also provide high design standards and a 
[normal]UK
[normal] ‘Design standards’ would need to apply best practice
[normal] su
[normal]ch as CROW
[normal] when possible, for more information refer 
[normal]http://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/wiki/dutch-cycle-infrastructure
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part 3[bold]General road safety improvements and consequ[bold]ences for cycling[bold]If Parliament passed a
[normal] 
[normal]Cycling 
[normal]Promotion and Road Safety Bill
[normal], (see 
[normal]Appendix 
[normal]A
[normal] for deta
[normal]ils)
[normal] 
[normal]this 
[normal]woul
[normal]d show that Parliament was
[normal] send
[normal]ing
[normal] a strong message
[normal] to improve safety for cycling
[normal]. In 
[normal]Wales
[normal] they 
[normal]had
[normal] a consultat
[normal]ion on cycling and 
[normal]this
[normal] may help to improve safety, see; 
[normal]http://wales.gov.uk/consultations/transport/activetravelbill/?lang=en
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Roads
[normal] in 
[normal]UK
[normal] cities have
[normal] developed over centuries and were not designed for large HGV type vehicles
[normal]. Delivery of goods to inner cities should be limited to 
[normal]using 
[normal]vehicles of about 2m wide and 8
[normal]m long as a general rule
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] a maximum
[normal] size
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]One e
[normal]xamples of 
[normal]a 
[normal]vehi
[normal]cles near to being s
[normal]uitable is
[normal] t
[normal]he 
[normal]MWB Hi-Roof Van at 1.9m wide and 5.7m long can carry 1300 kg.  
[normal]http://www.rabbitsvehiclehire.co.uk/vehicle/mwb-hi-roof-van/
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This would provide for more passing clearance for cyclists and reduce the risk when turning. 
[normal]It w
[normal]ould also benefit general traffic flow. 
[normal]If
[normal] some
[normal] larger vehicles 
[normal]gained permission
[normal] then
[normal] some restrictions on 
[normal]not 
[normal]delivering
[normal] during peak traffic
[normal] hours
[normal] could be r
[normal]equired
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part 4[bold]O[bold]verseeing changes without undue delays[bold]A ‘Cycling Minister’ with just cycling to focus on may be the best approach and reporting to the Cabinet. 
[normal]Funding for urban areas and rural locations, e.g. 
[normal]e.g. designing safer
[normal] junctions 
[normal]and 
[normal]provisi
[normal]ons for crossing ‘A’ roads 
[normal]would require a higher level of short term funding. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part 5[bold]Measuring results and effects[bold]The 
[normal]short and long term effects would need evaluating
[normal]. Measuring pas
[normal]sing clearanc
[normal]es
[normal] to see if on average 
[normal]a lo
[normal]wer proportion of drivers 
[normal]pass
[normal] 
[normal]too close
[normal].
[normal] If a change in driving culture oc
[normal]curs with more consideration given to 
[normal]c
[normal]yclists would need assessing
[normal]. 
[normal]Accident data for all road users can be evaluated against the trends. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Appendix A[bold]Proposed, Cycling Promotion and Road Safety Bill[bold]Aims -[bold]1 Promote a cycling consciousness that reflects in safer driver’s behavio
[normal]u
[normal]r. 
[normal]2 To reduce conflicts between all road users and improve road safety.
[normal]3 Develop quality cycling in
[normal]frastructure and junction designs/provisions.
[normal]4 Improve cycling networks across 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal].
[normal]5 Create jobs and 
[normal]encourage 
[normal]extra visitors.
[normal]6 Increase the combined use of cycling and public transport.
[normal]7 Reduce traffic pollution by more people cycling an
[normal]d reduced speed limits.
[normal]8 Improve health by more people cycling more often.
[normal]9 Improve cycling safety by ‘Safety in Numbers’ 
[normal]Contents[bold]1[bold]Standard of cycling infrastructure[bold]1.1 A revised standard for cycling provisions and infrastructure shall be provided
[normal].
[normal]1.2
[normal] Cycling infrastructure and provisions shall be maintained and repaired so that they are safe and fit for purpose.
[normal]2[bold]Making the road environment more suitable for cycling[bold]To reduce cyclists feeling squeezed or threatened by motorised traffic, the foll
[normal]owing 
[normal]provisions shall be introduced;
[normal]2.1 No overtaking of cyclists shall be permitted at the 
[normal]pedestrian 
[normal]refuge or crossing or for a distance of 10m either side of the refuge or cros
[normal]sing.
[normal]2.2 Separate bypass cycle lane shall be provided at refuges if possi
[normal]ble
[normal].
[normal]3[bold]Passing clearance and speed restriction for motor vehicles passing cyclists.[bold]3.1 
[normal]Refer prop
[normal]osed Highway Code changes above.
[normal]3.2
[normal] On narrow roads, 5 m or less in width, the permitted maximum motor vehicle speed is 20 mph when passing
[normal] cyclists. 
[normal]4[bold]Ma[bold]ximum Speed limits[bold]4.1
[normal]To 
[normal]reduce deaths and serious injuries and 
[normal]improve road safety for all road users the following speed limits shall apply unless signed otherwise. 
[normal]Motorways

[normal]‘A’ roads dual carriageways 60 or 70 mph, depending on ri
[normal]sk level and if prov
[normal]ided with 
[normal]separate cycle paths.

[normal]Rural roads without centre lines 40 mph
[normal].
[normal]Urban roads 40 mph, 30 mph, 25 mph and 20 mph limits to suit the situation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Notes
[normal]4A
[normal]The 25 
[normal]mph limit compared with the 30 mph roughly halves the fatality risk, see page
[normal]s

[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]robability of death reduces f
[normal]rom about 0.65 at 30 mph (50 km/
[normal]hr
[normal]) to 0.3 at 25 mph (40 km/
[normal]hr
[normal]). 
[normal]http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/p
[normal]ublications/road_traffic/world_report/speed_en.pdf
[normal]Many roads in urban areas are suited to 25 mph limits rather than 30 mph limits.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4B
[normal]The GB accident data for 2011 shows 979 deaths in non-built up areas compared with 816 for built up areas. Most 
[normal]deaths occurred on ‘A’ roads. For cycling ‘A’ roads pose a high risk and changes are needed urgently. The above suggestions could help lower the number killed and relate directly to the provision of cycling infrastructure.
[normal]5[bold]Junction layout and design[bold]5
[normal].1
[normal] Road
[normal] junctions need to be rated for risk to cyclists, starting with ‘A’ roads. Staggered junctions are often used by cyclists to cross major roads and many improvements are required.
[normal]6[bold]Funding of cycling infrastructure and general provision for cycling[bold]6
[normal].1 
[normal]Long term f
[normal]unding at a rate of £10 per person (index linked) or three perc
[normal]ent of the transport budget to

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Note
[normal]7A
[normal]http://www.nice.org.uk/media/3FE/1A/Blo 
[normal]... Review.pdf
[normal]There is strong evidence that someone’s ability to drive is affected if they have any alcohol in their blood. Drivers with a BAC of between 0.02 and 0.05 have at least a three times greater risk of dying in a vehicle crash. This risk incr
[normal]eases to at least six times w
[normal]ith a BAC between 0.05 and 0.08.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7B
[normal]http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/conten ... 1.full.pdf
[normal] (USA report)
[normal]Studies show a 3 to 17 fold increas
[normal]ed risk of a fatal MVC with BAC &lt; 0.08 g/dl compared to sober drivers.(17 factor for 16-20 age group).
[normal]8[bold]Amended the arrangements for changing the clocks in the winter and summer.

[normal]http://www.publications.parliament.uk/p ... 65/665.pdf
[normal] page 10.
[normal]The Department has strong evidence that more than
[normal]80 fewer people would be killed each year on 
[normal]Great Britain
[normal]’s roads if the Government
[normal]amended the arrang
[normal]ements for changing the clocks in the winter and summer.
[normal]Notes[bold] on costs;[bold]Congestion[bold]The Department for Transport's (
[normal]DfT's
[normal]) estimated that the cost of congestion to business is set to rise by £10-12 billion over the period from 2003 to 2025 (expressed in 2
[normal]002 prices). Adding in the value of the lost time experienced by other travellers raises this figure to £23-24 billion per annum.[2] 
[normal]Cutting congestion in towns and cities by more people cycling, assume 33% more, could result in more than £0.5 billion in
[normal] savings as a guide estimate.
[normal]http://www.publications.parliament.uk/p ... /87204.htm
[normal]Health[bold]“Take obesity: it already costs our NHS a staggering £4
[normal] billion a year. But within four years, that figure’s expected to rise to £6.3 billion
[normal].” David Cameron, 16 May 2011.
[normal]Obesity cost approximately £66 per person and expected to in
[normal]crease to about £100 per year.  
[normal]Potential savings by more cycling could be appr
[normal]oximately £1 b
[normal]illion per year. 
[normal]http://fullfact.org/factchecks/NHS_refo ... ealth-2732
[normal]Tourism[bold]Internationally, 1
[normal]2 % of Germans cycle to work, 27% Netherlands, 18% Denmark, 80+milion people in the USA have bicycles. The 
[normal]UK
[normal] cycling to work rate is about 1%-2% but in some cities is much higher. The 
[normal]UK
[normal] travel credit £19 billion compares with a debit of £32 billion. Loss
[normal] approximately, £13 billion per year, average approximately £200+ per person. Providing more and better cycling facilities and improved road safety measures would result in more visitors and more people cycling within the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. Potentially from a transfer of
[normal] 0.5% (1 in 200) in extra visitors to the UK and a reduced level of travellers overseas, a net benefit to the UK could be approxim
[normal]ately £255 million per year. 
[normal]Annual saving for 
[normal]UK
[normal], approximately £255 million per year.
[normal]Fuel [bold]and accident savings[bold]Many motor 
[normal]vehicle journeys are less than 3 miles and by more people cycling, savings could be made of p
[normal]otentially £1 billion per year. 
[normal]A depressingly high proportion of short trips are mad
[normal]e by car, 23% under a mile, 33% 
[normal]1 – 2 miles, and 79% 2 – 5 miles.

[normal]Job creation[bold]http://www.bikeleagu
[normal]e.org/resources/rep ... _Dec20.pdf
[normal]The link provides estimates of 14 jobs per million dollar spent - about 20 per million pounds. Tourism jobs would add to these numbers. Estimating at 25 jobs per million pounds and £10 per person would result in 15000 
[normal]extra jobs being created. 
[normal]Summary of costs[bold]Potential savings 
[normal]from a ‘
[normal]Cycling Promotion and Road Safety Bill
[normal]’ 
[normal]could be more than £3 billion per year compared with an estimated cost of £0.6 billion per year. Over a 10 year period a net return of £24 billio
[normal]n appears possible.
