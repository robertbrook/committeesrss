"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire [CST0046]&#xa0;&#xa0;What, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?&#xa0;Only one target has been set for the police force for 2013/14, and that is around reducing the risk of domestic burglary. \nThe target is for performance to be better than similar forces and partnerships. Only one target area was chosen to reflect the significance of the problem faced by the communities of West Yorkshire in terms of the volume of domestic burglaries.\n A number o\nf other performance indicators are being tracked for change over time \nand\n in agreement with the Chief Constable some challenging internal police force ambitions have been agreed across a range of indicators.\n&#xa0;\nIn the past there have been issues where settin\ng targets has become a perverse incentive. As an example the old Police Authority set a target to increase the sanction detection rate for domestic violence cases. There was concern that this incentivised police officers to proceed with cases despite poor \nquality evidence. Therefore the impact – \neither intentional or\n unintentional – \nof \nany targets set need\ns\n to be carefully considered.\n&#xa0;How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?&#xa0;Primarily external inspections by bodies such as the Audit Commission or HMIC have been relied upon to provide reassurance that recorded crime figures are correct. However since recent HMI\nC inspections that have raised \nconcerns\n over \nsome aspects of crime recording\n I have instructed my Internal Audit function to undertake an audit into crime recording, and have been briefed on \nissues identified internally, \nchanges \nneeded \nand improvements \nmade \nto crime recording by the Chief Const\nable via \nthe \nvarious mechanisms that I use to hold him to account. I am interested to see the results from the current HMIC crime recording inspection – which I fully expect to show some \nareas for improvement\n \n–\n \nbut feel that West Yorkshire Police is well on its way to improving its crime recording practices. \nThis will remain a key focus for both myself and the Chief Constable.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
