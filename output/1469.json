"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Broomley &amp; Stocksfield Parish Council (TIC 029)&#xa0;\nIntroductionBroomley\n &amp; \nStocksfield\n Parish is a community of around 1300 \nhouseholds with a population consisting of a broad mix of ages, incomes, and abilities.\n&#xa0;\nThe parish is situated to the south of the A695 which runs between Prudhoe and Hexham in Northumberland.\n&#xa0;\nThe parish consists of the larger settlement of \nStocksfield\n w\nith additional satellite settlements of New Ridley, \nHindley\n and \nBroomley\n.\n&#xa0;\nBusesCurrently the parish is served by a half hour bus service seven days a week (no 10) operated by Go North East.  This is a good service but runs along the A695 and does not ser\nve the other parts of the parish.\n&#xa0;\nThe only other regular commercial service is the \n613 between \nWhittonstall\n and Hexham which travels around \nStocksfield\n and some of its satellite communities.   Thi\ns bus only operates on Tuesdays and is a much valued weekly\n service to an unsustainable community.\n&#xa0;\nIn the recent past the route from \nWhittonstall\n to Branch End (\nStocksfield\n) was served by a service on a weekday basis (2 buses a day each way) to Newcastle.\n&#xa0;\nIn the distant past New Ridley was served by a regular se\nrvice to Newcastle which operated 7 days a week and 3-6 times a day from early morning to late at night.\n&#xa0;\nFor many of the residents in the parish of \nBroomley\n &amp; \nStocksfield\n the current bus route is up to 20 minutes walk from their homes.   In the satellite \nsettlements this route is only accessible by car or bike.\n&#xa0;\nMany of the residents of New Ridley and New Ridley Road in particular form part of our aging population and once they are unable to drive will be isolated in their homes as the bus service does not\n meet their needs.  New Ridley is 1.5 miles from the A695 (a good 40 minute walk for a fit person\n)\n and the southern parts of New Ridley Road are also up to a 30 minute walk from the A695.\n&#xa0;\nTrainsThe current train service is good and offers a regular servi\nce to Newcastle and beyond in the east and Hexham and Carlisle to the west.   However, the rolling stock is very old and passengers would appreciate newer if not new carriages and trains.\n   Passengers travelling from the further points of the parish must u\nse cars or bikes\n to travel to \nStocksfield\n station.\n&#xa0;\nComments from Broomley &amp; Stocksfield Parish Council &#xa0;In order to identify demand for passenger \ntransport in isolated communities, Government and local authorities need to consult widely with the residents of all communities in order to establish where potential passengers need to travel, at what times of day, and how frequently the services might ne\ned to operate.   Local authorities need to consult in as many ways as possible, e.g. through household surveys, local press, local parish and town councils, etc.   It is not enough to consult only on-line as many people do not have \ndirect access to on-line\n services and do not necessarily connect to local authority and government websites.\n&#xa0;The current \nbu\ns \nservices offered to the more remote and isolated parts of the parish are inadequate and do not meet the needs of people with disabilities, older or younger people.   The service most recently offered to residents in New Ridley did not meet the needs of p\notential travellers, in that it did not go to the destinations to which they wished to travel.\n  \nThis mean\nt\n that it was not used by many passengers.\n This service no longer operates.\n&#xa0;\nWe\n appreciate that not all \nof \nthe wishes of potential travellers can be me\nt, but it \nseems to us \nthat the bus services are \noften \nrun for the convenience of the operators and not the travelling public.\n&#xa0;The main challenge associated with funding transport services in isolated communities is the fact that by the nature of their isolation, the number of passengers is unlikely to be sufficient to make the services sustainable.   In addition, the cost of prov\niding the service is likely to be high and this will naturally affect the fares.\n&#xa0;\nIn an ideal world, residents of isolated communiti\nes should not be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive services.  In the “real” world however, these services must be seen as a means of linking these communities with their larger neighbours.   However, schemes must be introduced which are\n competitive for passengers but also enable the operators to make a sustainable living.\n&#xa0;The main challenge with providing better services is to ensure that th\ne services offered are fit for purpose and cover routes that suit the needs of passengers.\n  There is also a need to consider cost-effective ways of providing short, additional bus routes in isolated communities which link with the regular services operatin\ng in nearby more densely populated areas.  \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
