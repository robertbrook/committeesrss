default&#xa0;defaultBackground
default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis response comes from the Council for the Mathematical Sciences (CMS) and therefore concentrates on issues that are particularly relevant to the careers of women in mathematics.  
defaultThe CMS was established in 2001 by the Institute
default of 
defaultMathem
defaultatics and its
default 
defaultApplications (IMA), the London Mathematical Society (LMS) and the Royal Statistical Society
default 
default(RSS). 
default 
defaultThey were joined in 2008 by the Edinburgh Mathematical Society (EMS) and the
default 
defaultOperational Research Society (ORS). 
default 
defaultThe CMS provides an authorit
defaultative and objective
default 
defaultbody that exists to develop, influence and respond to UK policy issues that affect the
default 
defaultmathematical sciences in higher education and research, and therefore the UK economy
default 
defaultand society in general.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe London Mathematical Society (LM
defaultS) has a longstanding concern about the loss of women from mathematics and established its Women in Mathematics Committee in 1999.  The Committee now has representatives from all of the constituent societies of the CMS and has been particularly active over
default the last few years. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultThe International Review of the Mathematical Sciences (2010) which was commissioned by the EPSRC identified the low proportions of women in mathematics in the UK as an issue of real concern and recommended that urgent action shou
defaultld be taken to address this.  Partly in response to this, the LMS commissioned the first ever national survey of UK mathematics departments to identify examples of good practice in advancing women’s careers in mathematics and to enable departments to bench
defaultmark themselves against other UK departments.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default 
default2.1
default              
defaultThere is a wealth of documentation on this issue and a comprehensive analysis appears in the report `Tapping all our Talents’ 
defaultproduced by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012.
default  Although the report concentrates particularly on Scotland, the majority of the findings apply to the whole of the UK. 
default2.2
default              
defaultWith
defaultin mathematics, the decline is particularly serious.  The proportion of undergraduate students in the UK studying mathematics who are female has been rising steadily and is now over 44%.  In contrast, the proportion of mathematics professors in the UK who 
defaultare female is only 6%.  The recent survey commissioned by the London Mathematical Society showed that there are two points in the pipeline that are particularly problematic. 
default2.3
default              
defaultThe first major drop in the proportion of women occurs in the transfer from u
defaultndergraduate to postgraduate study and only around 25% of PhD students in mathematics in the UK are female.  It is particularly concerning that this proportion has essentially remained steady for a number of years and that the proportion of UK domiciled Ph
defaultD students in mathematics is only around 19%.  This is less than half of the proportion of UK domiciled undergraduates in mathematics who are female and it is notable that over 30% of overseas domiciled PhD students in mathematics in the UK are female. 
default2.
default4
default              
defaultThe reasons for the particularly sharp drop at this point in the pipeline are not well understood but the striking difference between the UK and overseas figures suggests that some of the issues must be cultural and specific to the UK.  It is notable tha
defaultt the proportions of women undergraduates in mathematics at some of the most highly regarded universities are much lower than the national average.  The very low numbers of female professors of mathematics in the UK also means that there is a lack of role 
defaultmodels – and again, this is particularly true at some of the top universities.  There could well be a problem with a lack of confidence at this stage and also a failure to appreciate that the skills required for research are not necessarily the same as the
default skills required to succeed in examinations.
default2.5
default              
defaultWithin mathematics, there is a surprisingly small drop in the proportions of women from postgraduate to postdoc to lecturer, and in fact nearly 30% of lecturers/senior lecturers in mathematics in the UK are 
defaultwomen.  This apparent discontinuity in the pipeline is due to the large numbers of women on teaching only contracts: if teaching only roles are not included then the proportions of postdocs and lecturers/senior lecturers who are women are both about 20%. 
default2.6
default              
defaultWithin mathematics, the other significant place in the pipeline where there is a significant drop in the proportion of women is in the promotion from lecturer/ senior lecturer to professor, and only 6% of professors are women.  This figure is steadily 
defaultrising but is still a 
defaultcause for concern.  The LMS report contains a further analysis which shows that the low number of women professors is not simply a consequence of the fact that the proportion of lecturers who are women was lower in the past.  The anal
defaultysis shows that, for mathematicians aged between 50 and 60 who hold academic posts, men are nearly three times as likely as women to have been promoted to professor. 
default2.7
default              
defaultA key factor here would seem to be the fact that promotion is primarily based on achi
defaultevements in research.  Surveys of women mathematicians show that many women feel that they are often asked to take on teaching and pastoral roles which they carry out well (and indeed often enjoy) but at the expense of their research and their promotion pr
defaultospects.  There is a delicate balance here between recognising teaching as well as research in promotion and ensuring that those women who are good at research are enabled and encouraged to fulfil their true potential. 
default2.8
default              
defaultMathematics research does not re
defaultquire much equipment but does require long periods of quiet uninterrupted time.  Many women have commented that they have found this particularly difficult to manage when they return from maternity leave, particularly if they return to work part time.  The
default flexibility of an academic career is valued by many but the reality is that much mathematical research is carried out at evenings and weekends and this can be very hard to combine with a young family.  Furthermore, it can often be very difficult for women
default to travel when they have small children and this makes it hard for them to maintain their visibility and to network.
default2.9
default              
defaultThere are also issues around the different ways that men and women tend to work with women being more likely to value collaborative wo
defaultrking – it is not clear that promotion committees are always very good at dealing with these differences or making full allowance for the impact of maternity leave and part time working. 
default2.10
default              
defaultA recent survey of women mathematicians showed that a very larg
defaulte proportion of them had partners who are also mathematicians.  Finding one lectureship in mathematics is very difficult but finding two in universities that are geographically close and have research groups in the right areas is incredibly difficult.  The
default so called `two body problem’ is not currently addressed at all in the UK and it remains the case that it is the woman’s career that is most likely to suffer.  In mathematics it seems that many of these women either leave academia or end up on teaching onl
defaulty contracts or in a university where their research is not supported.  This situation is further exacerbated by the drive to concentrate research funding in a few universities.
default2.11
default              
defaultThe LMS is also concerned by the disproportionately low numbers of women w
defaultho are nominated for prizes and invited to speak at conferences.  It seems highly likely that this is not intentional but is rather a result of the fact that those doing the nominating and inviting tend to be men who do not tend to think of the small numbe
defaultr of eligible women unless encouraged to do so.  Giving such awards and invitations to appropriately qualified women is not only highly beneficial to individual’s careers, it also helps to inspire women at an earlier stage in their careers.  
defaultWhen women le
defaultave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills 
defaultin different employment sectors? 
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultFemale mathematicians enter a wide range of careers in private and public sectors acro
defaultss many industries.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThose that leave academia at higher levels tend to move into industry as independent
default&#xa0;
defaultconsultants
default&#xa0;
defaultfocusing
default on their academic specialisms.
default 
default 
defaultThe transition process itself can be quite challenging, as industry does not employ mathematician
defaults in its purest sense, 
defaultalthough employers
default&#xa0;
defaultare always keen to apply
default&#xa0;
defaultmathematical
default&#xa0;
defaultskills across a variety of roles. 
default 
defaultUnfortunately, similar issues of progression arise in industry and the number of women in senior roles is worryingly small.
default&#xa0;
default              
default3.2

default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe fact that many skilled women enter these careers is to be welcomed. 
default 
defaultThe concern is that a disproportionately large number of women are leaving academia compared to men an
defaultd it seems likely that many are 
defaultleaving for the wrong reasons.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice? 
default4.1
default              
defaultMany organisations have been working to improve working practices in universities in the UK.  In particular, there are now over 90 institutions who have signed up to the Athena SWAN Charter
default.
default4.2
default              
defaultInterest in the scheme and in the issues surrounding women’s careers rose dramatically following an announcement by the Chief Medical Officer in 2011 that in future all medical schools applying for certain types of funding would be expected 
defaultto have an Athena SWAN silver award.  This was the first time that funding has been directly linked to action on equality and diversity issues and was followed in January 2013 
defaultby the 
defaultRCUK's statement on e
defaultqua
defaultlity and d
defaultiversity
default 
defaultwhich caused many departments to take these issues seriously for the first time.
default 
default4.3
default              
defaultAs identified by the International Review of Mathematics in 2010, there has traditionally been a worrying lack of awareness of the issues surrounding wo
defaultmen’s careers in mathematics and the need to take action and many departments are now on a sharp learning curve. 
default4.4
default              
defaultIn recognition of this, the LMS has established a Good Practice Scheme 
defaultwith the aim of supporting mathematics departments interested in embedding equal opportunities for women within their working practices and to provide specific support to those departments working towards Athena SWAN aw
defaultards.
default  The scheme enables departments to share good practice in a number of ways including through workshops. 
default4.5
default              
defaultThe most significant activity of the scheme has been to commission a national benchmarking survey of UK mathematics departments as described 
defaultabove.  As part of this, thirty departments from a range of institutions filled in a comprehensive questionnaire giving detailed information about their working practices in ten areas.  The findings made sobering reading but the resulting report contains n
defaultumerous examples of good practice and departments who scored particularly highly will be invited to speak at workshops. 
default4.6
default              
defaultDetailed examples of good practice are described in the report.  Some of the best of these include university schemes to support th
defaulte research careers of those returning from extended breaks for maternity leave or other reasons. Some institutions offer a sabbatical at this point and in the very best instances these schemes are properly funded to provide teaching cover 
defaultrather than shari
defaultng the load around others in the department.  This is an example of making a short term investment for a long term gain.
default4.7
default              
defaultExamples requiring minimal amounts of funding are the organisation of regular networking events for women in the department, perhap
defaults over lunch or tea and cake, specific welcome sessions for new women undergraduates and sessions for final year women undergraduates to discuss options for postgraduate study. 
default4.8
default              
defaultThe LMS Council issued a statement on women in mathematics in 2008 
defaultsummarising some of the key issues surrounding the careers of women in mathematics and identifying a number of practical steps that it would take to try and address these in its own procedures.
default  The second part of this statement is reproduced here:

defaultT
defaulthe Society recognises the need to give active consideration to ensuring that
default 
defaultmen and women are treated equally in their prospects, recognition and
default 
defaultprogression. 
default 
defaultSuch disadvantages as do o
defaultccur are often the unintentional 
defaultoutcome of the formulation of regula
defaulttions and procedures which do not give
default 
defaultadequate attention to the needs of people in such positions.
default  
defaultAccordingly, the Society will:
default&#xa0;
default(a) be aware of and seek to ensure an appropriate gender balance on its
default 
defaultcommittees and working groups, and encourage the No
defaultminating
default 
defaultCommittee to give similar attention in its proposals for election;
default&#xa0;
default(b) keep under review the regulations governing its membership, prizes,
default 
defaultawards and grants to ensure that they do not inadvertently deter or fail
default 
defaultto recognize people with non-stand
defaultard career patterns;
default&#xa0;
default(c) actively encourage and facilitate the nomination of women for its prizes
default 
defaultand awards, and ensure that it considers women when it is proposing
default 
defaultnominees for external prizes and positions;
default&#xa0;
default(d) actively seek to include women speakers 
defaultin its meetings and workshops;
default&#xa0;
default(e) expect that the organisers of conferences and activities who are seeking

default”
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM c
defaultareers? 
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultThere are a number of ways in which the Government could help. Given the current momentum behind the Athena SWAN scheme, it seems sensible to use this as one of the main instruments for bringing about change.  It is, however, important to note
default that the preparation of an application for such an award is a major task and it must be ensured that this task is not imposed on junior women in a department.  The scheme is currently running on small amounts of funding with minimal staffing and it is ess
defaultential that the operation is properly funded by the Government to enable it to meet the huge surge in demand and to provide an increased level of service. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultIt is striking that many departments only began to take these issues seriously when it became a
defaultpparent that they might otherwise lose valuable research funding.  The Government could 
defaultadd to the pressure on universities and departments to take action by making other types of funding conditional on action being taken on equality and diversity issues. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultOne of the key areas requiring more funding and policy changes is around maternity/paternity leave.  Best practice would be for universities to provide properly funded teaching cover both during and after maternity leave so that colleagues do not suf
defaultfer from an increased teaching load and the woman can have some time to get her research career back on track.  The Government could play an important role in bringing this about – especially if it was to provide funding specifically for this purpose. 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default4
default              
defaultThe Government could also change regulations to allow paternity leave and
default              
defaultmaternity leave to be shared much more equally.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultTaking part in conferences and research visits is an important part of academic life and is often difficult to do with small ch
defaultildren.  Universities and conference organisers could help by providing video links.  The LMS offers a childcare grant scheme to help with extra expenses incurred as a result of such activities but, ideally, these expenses should be met routinely by univer
defaultsities alongside travel and subsistence claims.  The Government could encourage this and also change the current situation where such expenses are taxable. 
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultTo encourage women to be ambitious and to seek senior posts, universities
defaultcould be required to
default run "Women in Leadership" courses and also courses on assertiveness.
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultThere have been many studies showing that both men and women tend to rate identical applications for jobs or promotion differently if they are told the gender of the applicant.  Unf
defaultortunately there are many practicalities that would make it difficult to ensure that application processes in academia were gender blind.  Those involved in selection panels and grant review panels could, however, be required to undergo training on unconsc
defaultious bias.
default&#xa0;
default5.8
default              
defaultThe Research Councils have played a key role in putting pressure on universities to take action but there are a number of measures which they could introduce which would make a huge difference.  For example, they could offer new competitive
default Fellowship schemes specifically aimed at academics who have had to relocate in order to follow a partner (thus addressing the two body problem) or who have returned to work from a long period of maternity or sick leave (thus enabling the best researchers 
defaultto concentrate on research at a time when many find this difficult).  Research Councils could also increase the flexibility of all their funding to allow researchers to switch to part time working following maternity leave and extend grants accordingly. 
default&#xa0;
default5.9
default              
defaultGiven that the drop-off from undergraduate to postgraduate is so significant in mathematics, Research Councils could play a key role by insisting 
defaultthat Centres for Doctoral Training take specific steps to attract women students
default and to support such students through their studies. They could even set minimum targets for the proportions of women students although these would have to be carefully agreed for each centre taking the subject area into account.  They could also insist th
defaultat both men and women should be involved in the leadership of such centres.  The CDT application process could require
default statistics
default to be provided
default on the 
defaultcurrent 
defaultgender breakdown of the dep
defaultartment (for undergraduates, postgraduates 
defaultand academic staff), toget
defaulther
default with a description of what actions the department proposes to take to improve matters 
defaultif the proportion of women is low.
default&#xa0;
default5.10
default              
defaultAlthough such schemes would be run by the Research Councils, the Government could help by insisting that a certain proportion
default of the Research Council’s funding is spent on schemes specifically aimed at addressing issues related to equality and diversity. 
default&#xa0;
default5.11
default              
defaultIt is also important that strategic decisions taken by Research Councils do not inadvertently affect women – for exampl
defaulte, by concentrating funding in universities with relatively low proportions of women.  Again, the Government has a key role to play in requiring Research Councils to take such issues into account.
