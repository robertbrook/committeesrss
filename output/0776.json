"Written evidence from Mrs Christine Talbot (LTC 28)&#xa0;\nI am a State Registered Nur\nse and \nLymphoedema\n Practitioner, specialising in the care and practice of \nlymphoedema\n management \nin the Dorset area\n for seven years\n.\n&#xa0;\nI see a wide range of patients with both primary and secondary \nlymphoedemas\n, \nlipoedemas\n and combined pathologies.\n \nSecondary \nlymphoedemas\n are as a result of surgery, trauma or chronic illnesses\n \n&#xa0;\nIn the main\n patients pay private\nly for their treatment;\n \nuntil recently a few had Primary Care Trust funding,\n funding\n which has now been withdrawn\n,\n regardless\n of necessity.\n \nA\ns yet no funded care package has been implemented\n in its place\n by the individual General Practitioner surgeries\n,\n \nDistrict Nurses claim they cannot offer such specialised treatment, neither would they have th\ne time to do so, thus as a traditional ‘Nightingale’ nurse, I am\n treat\ning clinically dependent \nlymphoedema\n patients for free\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nEqually patients on social benefits or very limited incomes and other specific financial short falls\n, are seen on a reduced rate, treatment is paramount to their well being\n,\n without which they could incur all manner of complications, infection, chronic pain and associated disabilities\n.\n \nIronically, \nwithout\n \nmy clinical \nlymphoedema\n skills\n, these patients would\n \ncome under the NHS financial umbrella and\n \nreceive costly inappropriate care and medication for their condition.\n&#xa0;\nIn general the NHS \nhas\n \nneither\n the\n training,\n the\n interest\n,\n nor sufficient knowledge of \nlymphoedema\n and its multifaceted complexities\n, nor\n any realistic\n understanding of \nongoing, lifelong dependency on healthcare\n.\n \nA few NHS or charity associated \nLymphoedema\n Clinics offer a limited service of six monthly limb \nmeasurementsappointments\n and supplying of hosiery.\n&#xa0;\nI would advocate,\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI look forward with interest to the outcome of the House of Commons Inquiry into lon\ng term conditions and care\n requirements\n.\n \nSo too, as to\n whether there will be future opportunity and funding for education and enlightenment\n with regards to a \nmost debilitating, clinically\n complex and\n socially and psychologically demanding and depressing condition for those afflicted\n.\nMay 2013\n"
