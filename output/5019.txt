&#xa0;Written evidence from the National Federation of Retail Newsagents [PCC Progress 11]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the Home Affairs Committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the performance of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs).

[[[&#xa0;]]]2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.&#xa0;3. The NFRN assists the independent retailer to compete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expertise and services. It also represents its members’ interests at governmental and parliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. &#xa0;

[[[General Remarks]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4. The NFRN understands the importance of the role of PCC to both the police and local communities. &#xa0;5. With this in mind, the NFRN is working towards its aim of meeting all PCCs over the course of the coming year.&#xa0;6. NFRN engagement with PCCs has already started. We recently wrote a letter to all PCCs regarding our concerns about shoplifting and the impact it has on our members’ businesses. Going forwards, we will continue to engage with PCCs through regular contact and our newsletter, to keep them informed about the key crime issues facing the independent retail sector. &#xa0;7. However it is important to note that one year is not long enough to be able to fully judge the performance of PCCs.&#xa0;8. In our submission to the committee’s inquiry, the NFRN will focus on the two following areas, from the Federation’s perspective of their handling of the issue of shoplifting and anti-social behaviour:&#xa0;- The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area&#xa0;- The effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities&#xa0;

[[[Declaration of Interest]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]9. Whilst we work to engage with PCCs on behalf of our members, we have no further relationship with them.

[[[The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]10. In the period since commissioners were elected, there have been a number of notable achievements delivered by various PCCs. &#xa0;11. We welcomed news that the PCC for West Yorkshire Mark Burns-Williamson had launched a petition with the intention of persuading the government to ensure that the funds generated from seized criminal assets are spent on community and anti-crime initiatives in the same areas where the crimes were committed. &#xa0;12. In addition, a number of PCCs have launched community crime funds in their areas to help tackle problems. PCC for Avon and Somerset Sue Mountstevens has allocated £2.4m to various organisations in the area to help reduce crime and disorder. The fund will also provide support for victims of crime, a move supported by the NFRN.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]13. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of the effectiveness with which commissioners are reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their areas. For example, the way in which business crime, specifically shoplifting, is dealt with is of concern to the Federation’s members.&#xa0;14. Discussions with our members and recent media reports have raised concerns amongst the NFRN that shoplifting is not being dealt with seriously enough by police and police and crime commissioners.&#xa0;15. An investigation by the Birmingham Mail for example, discovered that police had failed to investigate or record more than 60% of shoplifting incidents that had taken place in Birmingham’s city centre. &#xa0;16. Furthermore, it was reported in August 2013 that Hammersmith and Fulham police had dropped a proposal to not arrest those who shoplift goods under £50. Whilst it is fortunate the proposal was not adopted, the NFRN considers that it should not have been considered in the first place as it would have undermined the businesses of our members.&#xa0;17. The NFRN appreciates that PCCs are not in operational control of the police; however they do set their priorities. Therefore we feel that more work needs to be done to ensure that this important issue is not allowed to slip down the policing agenda in terms of performance.  &#xa0;18. Another issue where improvements could be made is anti-social behaviour against retail workers more generally.&#xa0;19. Unfortunately, newsagents and convenience stores are easy targets for such behaviour in light of their late opening hours and the relatively few members of staff on duty in comparison to the large supermarkets. &#xa0;20. In a survey we conducted recently of our membership, 35.7% of respondents had been a victim of crime or anti-social behaviour in the last 12 months.&#xa0;21. Furthermore, research published recently by the Union of Shop Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) revealed that of their shop worker respondents, 1 in 5 report verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis, almost 1 in 10 report a threat of violence at least once a month. &#xa0;22. A survey carried out for Independent Retail News also showed that the number of independent retailers who had been a victim of violent crime had increased from 8%in 2010 to 15% in 2011.&#xa0;23. Anti-social behaviour, violence and threatening behaviour are problems that are continuing to blight our members’ livelihoods.&#xa0;24. We are appreciative of work already done on this issue by PCC’s. For example, in October 2013 the NFRN was pleased to learn that Commissioners had joined Chief Constables to support a campaign week seeking to tackle the problem.&#xa0;25. However in light of this continuing problem, we feel that more attention needs to be placed on the issue to help protect retailers and their staff from this behaviour.&#xa0;

[[[The effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]26. The NFRN will focus its response to this question on its knowledge of the priority PCCs place on the issue of shoplifting.&#xa0;27. As noted previously in this submission, the Federation wrote to all PCCs asking them to clarify their approach to this form of crime. &#xa0;28. The responses we have received from Police and Crime Commissioners regarding shoplifting, have all sought to reassure the NFRN that the issue of shoplifting remains high in the list of policing priorities.&#xa0;29. In practice, PCCs have gone to varying lengths in their promotion of policing priorities. Whilst some have simply provided assurance that they understand the importance of the issue, others have taken steps to demonstrate that this is truly the case.&#xa0;30. Clive Grunshaw, PCC for Lancashire advised us that a business crime lead for the Constabulary had been appointed and that he personally holds the Chief Constable to account for performance in this area.&#xa0;31. Furthermore, Bill Longmore the PCC for West Mercia revealed that he was in the process of developing a Business Crime strategy for both West Mercia and Warwickshire police and Essex PCC Nick Alston held a business crime forum to discuss the issue.&#xa0;32. However, the issue is not being as demonstrably prioritised in other areas of the country. Mark Burns-Williamson OBE, PCC for West Yorkshire recognised the importance of the issue but admitted it was “not specifically a priority within the Police and Crime Plan”. &#xa0;33. It is evident that the effectiveness of PCCs in promoting this issue varies considerably in different areas.&#xa0;34. The NFRN appreciates the hard work many PCCs have put into dealing with this matter but would encourage all commissioners to do the same, in order for this type of behaviour to be tackled effectively. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]35. We would welcome the issues of shoplifting and anti-social behaviour becoming priorities in all Police and Crime Plans and the NFRN will seek to engage with PCCs as they develop these plans.
