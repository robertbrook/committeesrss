"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Ashfield District Council\n/ Nottinghamshire County \nCouncil\n(\nSLC 0001)\n&#xa0;\nI represent a township in Nottinghamshire called \nHucknall\n (former MP Paddy Tipping) and back in 2008, a grandmother and her grand\nson were killed (hit by a train) on a pedestrian crossing known as either\n \nBayles\n and \nWyhles\n or \nMoorbridge\n.\n&#xa0;\nLast year, another tragic death occurred, this time involving a 13 year girl who was hit by a tram (NET).\n&#xa0;\nThere have been a total of 5 deaths at this crossing, along with 2 horse related incidents, and numerous \"near mis\nses\" The 2 human deaths are believed to be suicide.\n&#xa0;\nI have held several public meetings, and met with different Network Rail chiefs to try my best to get things resolved, and only now - after the third death have Network Rail decided to build and fund a f\nootbridge over this crossing.\n&#xa0;\nMembers of our community, have found this difficult to accept, if it was known that this busy pedestrian crossing was a potential source of yet another accident, why then, after the 2 deaths in 2008 was a footbridge not erect\ned then?\n&#xa0;\nNobody knows the criteria which Network Rail are \nworking\n to, and it appears that everything is funding orientated, yet Network Rail are quite prepared to pay the fines imposed by the courts for errors of their judgement. \nLeeds\n £450,000 and £1 mil\nlion at \nElsenham\n.\n Would it not have made more common sense to have executed the safety works - and saved lives, rather than pay the fines and they still have to do the safety works after.\n&#xa0;\nI welcome, and would be honoured with the opportunity to address yo\nur Select Committee to explain the tragic events which have occurred in \nHucknall\n over the past 5 years, as unfortunately I've been involved in them all, and perhaps I will be able to give your committee the community concerns and facts.\n&#xa0;\nMany believe that \nthe recommendations from the Transport Select Committee need to reflect \na clear criteria\n, which Network Rail must keep to, with the emphasis on protecting lives.\n&#xa0;\nShould you need any further information, please do not hesitate in contacting me.\n&#xa0;\nJuly 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
