Written evidence submitted by Dr Christopher Maguire BA, MBA, PhD (FSS010)I was formerly employed by the Forensic Science Service (1981 – 2010) where latterly my position was that of Senior Forensic Consultant in the International Division.
&#xa0;
I am currently employed as a Reader in Forensic Science in the Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science; my position is primarily a research post.  My current research interests include;
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
&#xa0;
My research income has included a £285,000 contract with the Department of Public Safety, Canada to advise “A Feasible and Sustainable Model for Forensic Services Delivery in Canada”.  This work was completed in April 2012.

These comments may, or may not, reflect those of my colleagues but I understand that a collective response may be submitted to you from the Northumbria University Centre for Forensic Science
&#xa0;
The following comments on some of the questions posed by the Science and Technology Committee are based on my own experiences and research and reflect my personal opinions.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I do not believe that the Government has any strategy for the provision of forensic science in England and Wales.  The delivery of forensic science has been simply driven by 
lowest 
perceived cost.  
&#xa0;
In the years 1997 – 2007 the forensic science providers 
(FSPs) 
were able to compete for work from police forces on a number of terms; service volumes, turn-round times, added-value services, research and innovation and price.  Individual pol
ice forces let contracts to FSP
s under Service Level Agreements, usually of three years duration.
  (This is still the way the Northeast police forces operate; they will be tendering for their forensic provision for the first time in March 2013)
The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) established the National Forensic Procurement Project in 2007 to:
 “... formulate a strategy for future procurement of forensic analysis, to develop a standardized User Requirement, Specifications and Terms and Conditions and to subsequently undertake an EU procurement to select suppliers under a national (forensic) framework agreement (NFFA)”.
Note that the term used is 
‘forensic analysis’; 
indicating the desire to commoditize forensic science into a series of ‘tests’ and removing the concept of a ‘service provider’; downplaying the professionalism of the forensic scientists and the ‘value’ or ‘contribution’ the external FSPs could make to the CJS.
&#xa0;
The police forces were to 
“run mini-competitions within the framework on a regional basis” 
with the NPIA supporting the procurement process; defining the product to be delivered, the product volumes, the expected turnaround times and the quality standards to be met
.  There was no value placed on research and innovation or client/service provider partnerships.  Under this procurement process the only parameter on which the 
FSPs
 could compete was ‘Price’ and setting the NFFA under a regional basis meant that significant revenues could change hands as contracts were won and lost by 
FSPs
.
&#xa0;
An initial tender exercise was carried out by the NPIA in order to register 
FSPs
 as accredited suppliers, such that when forces or regions wanted to procure forensic science support, very little additional work would be required on behalf of the tendering authority or the FSPs.
  
 
FSS Ltd. commented to the Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee (2011):
&#xa0;
“In reality, the majority of the tenders that have taken place have selectively utilized parts of the framework, but have also introduced other bespoke elements, meaning each tender is a lengthy and relatively complicated process (and therefore also expensive) for all involved”. 
&#xa0;
And:
“Police take-up of innovation has ground to a halt and it seems that opportunities to introduce innovative solutions to criminal justice issues are not developed”.
&#xa0;
However, the police 
have 
realized significant savings in the commoditized product areas, as the competitive tendering model drove down the market price for these tests.  For example, in 2005 the price of a DNA database (CJ) analysis was about £40; by 2010 t
his had fallen to less than £20.  
&#xa0;
The introduction or the NPIA National Forensic Framework Agreement in 2007/08 created a significant barrier to new entrants.  FSPs had to respond to an initial tender exercise to be registered a suppliers under the NFFA procurement.  Without this accreditation a firm wishing to enter the market cannot compete for police business.  It is not clear to me how a new firm wishing to enter the forensic market can now obtain such accreditation.
&#xa0;
In its response to the Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee (2011) FSS Ltd. noted;
&#xa0;
“Rather than establishing and cementing a truly competitive, healthy market, the NFFA has contributed to its destabilization, introducing significant uncertainty for existing FSPs and introducing barriers for new entrants”.
&#xa0;
It is clear that the stability of the forensic market is now crucial to the Criminal Justice System of England and Wales.  In my opinion the forensic market needs significant government regulation and supervision such
 that the
 remaining forensic science suppliers can adequately recover their costs, compete to meet the changing market conditions and be incentivized to invest in research and development.
&#xa0;
In reality, following the closure of the FSS there has been little incentive for the forensic science suppliers to invest in significant primary research.   In my opinion the current FSPs undertake 
developmental research which is largely designed to minimize their internal costs and increase their competitive advantage.  
&#xa0;
I understand that one of the current suppliers purchased an advanced FSS DNA interpretation application in the aftermath of the FSS closure and has deployed this within its own organization.  I suggest that it would have been more beneficial for Criminal Justice System
