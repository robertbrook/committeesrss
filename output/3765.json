These forcings are spatially heterogeneous and include the effect of aerosols on clouds and associated precipitation [e.g., Rosenfeld et al., 2008], the influence of aerosol deposition (e.g., black carbon (soot) [Flanner et al. 2007] and reactive n\nitrogen [Galloway et al., 2004]), and the role of changes in land use/land cover [e.g., Takata et al., 2009]. Among their effects is their role in altering atmospheric and ocean circulation features away from what they would be in the natural climate syste\nm [NRC, 2005]. As with CO2, the lengths of time that they affect the climate are estimated to be on multidecadal time scales and longer.\nWe also wrote (with respect to the 2007 IPCC WG1 report, but their focus was not changed for the 2013 WG1 report)\nUnfor\ntunately, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment did not sufficiently acknowledge the importance of these other human climate forcings in altering regional and global climate and their effects on predictability at the regional\n scale. It also placed too much emphasis on average global forcing from a limited set of human climate forcings.\n&#xa0;\nThis is documented in the p\nreface to the set of books \nPielke Sr, R.A., Editor in Chief., 2013:\n&#xa0;\nClimate Vulnerability, Understanding and Addressing Threats to Essential Resources\n, 1st Edition.

Wright, Eds.,\n Academic Press, 1570 pp. [http://pielkeclimatesci.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/b-18preface.pdf]\nIn that article, we \nconclude\n that\nMultidecadal predictions of changes in regional and local climate statistics have not shown skill when run in a hindcast mode \nfor the past several decades.\nSuch a test, of course, must be a prerequisite to have any confidence in prediction (projection) skill of changes in regional climate in the future.\nPielke Sr., R.A., R.

This vulnerability concept requires the determinati\non of the major threats to local and regional water, food, energy, human health, and ecosystem function resources from extreme events including those from climate but also from other social and environmental issues. After these threats are identified for e\nach resource, then the relative risks can be compared with other risks in order to adopt optimal preferred mitigation/adaptation strategies. This is a more inclusive way of assessing risks, including from climate variability and climate change, than using \nthe outcome vulnerability approach adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A contextual vulnerability assessment using the bottom-up, resource-based framework is a more inclusive approach for policy makers to adopt effective mitiga\ntion and adaptation methodologies to deal with the complexity of the spectrum of social and environmental extreme events that will occur in the coming decades as the range of threats are \nassessed, beyond just the focus on CO2 and a few other greenhouse gas\nes as emphasized in the IPCC assessments.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis is discussed in the articles\nPielke Sr., R.A., 2003: Heat storage within the Earth system.

Physics Today, 61, Vol. 11, 54-55. http://pielkeclima\ntesci.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/r-334.pdf\nIn the text\n of the 2003 article\n, \nI \nwrote\nSince the surface temperature is a two-dimensional global field, while heat content involves volume integrals, as shown by Eq. (1), the utilization of surface temperature as a monitor of the earth system climate change is not particularly useful in evaluat\ning the heat storage changes to the earth system. The heat storage changes, rather than surface temperatures, should be used to determine what fraction of the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere are in radiative equilibrium.\nI also recommend the \nweblog post \nhttp://pielkeclimatesci.wordpress.com/2011/09/20/torpedoing-of-the-use-of\n-the-global-average-surface-temperature-trend-as-the-diagnostic-for-global-warming/\nIn that post I discuss\n an issue (of deeper ocean sequestration of heat) that provides one (of several) major reasons that the global average surface temperature is an in\nadequate metric to monitor global warming and cooling\n.\nI would be glad to elaborate on the above issues, as well as provide other examples of the failure of the 2013 IPCC WG1 to\n properly\n report on climate science to the public and policymakers. \nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
