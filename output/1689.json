"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence \nCommunity Transport Association\n (TIC )\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis evidence is submitted by the Community Transport Association (CTA)\n,\n a national charity providing leadership, learning and enterprise support to organisations delivering innovative and flexible transport solutions to achieve social change in their communities.\n  The CTA currently has around 1,500 member organisations.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe demand for community transport (CT) has increased \nin recent years for a variety of reasons, particularly in \nisolated \nareas. Services include\n \ndemand responsive\n routes, dial-a-ride\n, voluntary car schemes, minibus hire, schedul\ned bus services, wheels to w\nork and \npatient/visitor tran\nsport, as well as brokerage, training and community development.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nCTA welcomes the inclusion of \nCT in the Transport Committees inquiry and the opportunity to provide written\n \nevidence.\n We would also welcome the opportunity to\n provide further insights and ideas about the important role CT can plays in supporting isolated communities when oral evidence is being heard in the autumn.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger tran\nsport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?\n&#xa0;\n2.1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Community Transport Association\n:  \nThe CTA \nprovides a\n voice for CT across the UK \nwith\n a\n \nlong history of consulting members and the sector \nand\n articulat\ning\n the views\n and needs of community based transport to policy makers at a national (and devolved) government level.\n  In so doing, it is able to comment on demand at a strategic level as it consults with operators around the country at regional events\n, members meetings\n and via national conferences and through electronic communication groups.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSub-r\negional/county CT consortia\n:\n  \nWe are seeing the development of\n more\n \ncounty/\nsub-\nregional bodies \nsupporting \nthe development of community transport in their area\n, including\n \nformally constituted consortia \nof which\n \nSuffolk, Devon, Norfolk, Greater Manchester are all \ngood examples\n.  They can act as a conduit for communication with local government on the needs of CT providers and users.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authority consultation, research an\nd transport departments:\n  \nLocal authorities \nin some areas have an excellent record of consulting with both CT providers and CT users.  They commission their own research from time to time and transport department staff are frequently very knowledgeable on \npolicy and operational matters.  This experience is not universal, however, and the CT sector does struggle to engage with local authorities in many areas.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCT\nA S\ntate of the Sector (SOTS)\n reports\n:\n  \nThe CTA researches and publishes its \nS\nOTS\n reports in England (and other countries of the UK) in order to continually improve the available evidence base on CT.  \nThese reports are \nused to\n build a better picture of CT service development across England.  This developmen\nt reflects demand for service\ns given the fact that CT services are established in direct response to identified user need.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAdditional data sources\n:\n  \nAdditional \npublicly available research and \ndata \nanalyses\n will be used\n by authorities to,\n such as:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) take\nn into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?\n&#xa0;\n2.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccount taken of different groups’ requirement\ns\n is patchy\n:\n  \nIt is the experience of the CTA and the CT sector that the account taken of different groups’ needs can va\nry widely by area.  Typically this can depend on the structure of the local authority transport department or even on the commitment of a small team or one individual.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nL\nack of network planning \ndu\ne to the unregulated \nbus \nmarket\n:\n  \nThere is a lack of ability\n to develop planned public transport networks outside London due to the de-regulated nature of the market.  This, in turn, means that it can be difficult for local authorities to influence the extent to which services take account of different passenger gr\noups in isolated areas.  The current economic climate also means that authorities are less able to support socially necessary bus services\n through tendered routes.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisadvantaged groups\n’\n needs are often an afterthought\n:\n  \nIt is understandable that transport authorities and operators seek to maximise the efficiency of the services they procure and/or operate.  Too often, however, the needs of marginalised groups of people are not fully considered\n from the outset\n.  One clear \nexample of this is the failure to require the mandatory reimbursement \nfor transportation \nof eligible concessionary pass holders on services \n(such as community transport) \nwhere no registered local bus service operates or where such services are inaccessible\n \nto users.\n  The transport of young people is \nalso a particular \nissue as no consistent concessionary arrangement exists for them across \nEngland.  A national \nyoung persons’ \nconcession would not only help to address the problems of isolation for young people,\n it would also help to build the habit at an early age of using public/community transport rather than assuming obtaining a car is the solution to all transport problems.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExpectation that CT will pick up needs that others cannot meet:\n  \nIn recent years we \nhave seen \na\n \ngrowing assumption that CT \nservices will grow to fill the gaps \nthat commercial/statutory providers are unable to.  However, this increasing demand for CT services is set against a backdrop of decreasing funding which is stretching \nmany to break\ning point.  Many CT\n operators have sought to develop a social enterprise business model in order to become more sustainable.  This has been successful for some but has \nalso resulted in some struggling to manage new business relationships, particularly when\n service commissioners do not appear prepared to pay for the full cost of the service received\n.\n  \nThere is \nonly \nlimited use of community audit or transport needs \nanalysis \nat \nd\nistrict or \nparish level, which could \npotentially \nbetter inform authorities of user\n needs.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be overcome? \n&#xa0;\n2.3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of integrated network planning\n:\n  \nThe inability to plan and develop an integrated network is a challenge for \ntransport \nauthorities. The l\nack of bus\n route/market\n regulation\n which would allow this means that only profitable routes are developed in many areas.\n  This leads to an expectation th\nat transport authorities and/or the CT sector will pick up on the needs of those who cannot access commercial bu\ns\n services.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSilo funding mentality\n:\n  \nL\nocal authorities, \nhealth \nagencies, government departments and other bodies \nappear to be\n \ntrying to protect\n \ntheir \nown budgets rather than \nfocusing on the strategic benefits of \nintegrate\nd\n services.\n \nThe complex nature of the NHS and its particular transport requirements is a significant challenge in this respect.  There is evidence of the NHS \nreducing \ntransport p\nrovision \nin some areas \nby changing (tightening) eligibility criteria in order to reduce transport spend.  This merely has the effect of requiring someone else (typically CT or local authorities) to deliver the transport.  It is not unusual for the CT secto\nr to deliver transport to health because the NHS will not or cannot pay for it.  \nIn many cases \nthe charitable/voluntary sector is \nnot receiving full cost recovery for services provided and so \nit \nis, in effect, \nsubsidising \nthe \nstatutory\n sector (eg the NHS)\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRestrictive national policy:\n  \nIn some cases, national policy is restricted to too narrow a field.  \nFor instance, the lack of a \nmandatory \nobligation \nto \nreimburse local CT operators running Section 19 services at separate fares for transporting eligible \nconcessionary passengers means that many CT operators end up subsidising these passengers themselves.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nService information:\n  \nInformation \non \nexisting services should be more visible and accessible\n and more detailed guidance is required on \nhow isolated commu\nnities \ncan \nimprove \npublic and community transport (for instance \nby running \nmore services \nthemselves\n).\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved? \n&#xa0;\n2.4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nom\nmunity transport\n is \nbased on user need\n:\n  \nCT is flexible and r\nesponsive to \nlocal \nneed\n \nand \nas a sector.  It\n \nunderstands passenger requirements\n so services are devised to meet \ntheir \nneed\ns\n.  CT is the only sector of the public transport market that was co\nnceived and designed to deliver\n community development and equality of opportunity – it merely uses transport as the tool to do this.  \nThere \nhas been \nh\nuge increase in \nthe \ndemand \nfor CT \nin recent years \nbut \nat the same time, \nthe \navailable funding has reduced \nthe sector’s\n ability to service need is \nbecoming ever more \ncompromised\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCTA State of the Sector reporting \nillustrate\ns\n \nthe impact of the sector:\n  Three reports have now been published by the CTA (2009, 2010 and 2012) on the state of the CT sector in Englan\nd.  The next report is due for publication in 2014.  Although covering the whole of England, the 2012 report also included a particular focus on rural areas, which is where many communities and individuals suffer from isolation.  Some of the key findings o\nn the CT sector in England summarised in this report were:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImproving community transport:\n The effectiveness of CT could still be greatly improved by implementing a number of measures.  These include:\n&#xa0;\nInvesting in growth through transport\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPermits &amp; \noperator \nlicensing\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDrivers \nlicensing\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTo what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other dema\nnd-responsive transport services? \n&#xa0;\n2.5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nImproving the DRT network:\n  \nReliance on t\naxis and DRT \nas opposed to fixed route local bus services \ncould be acceptable \n(assuming CT is \nincluded in the definition of DRT) \nproviding a sufficiently diverse network exists.  \nFlexible community based DRT can meet needs for many people but \nit \nneeds investment.\n  \nIt is also imperative that the systemic discrimination that exists within the concessionary travel system that prevents many isolated people from accessing such services \nis tackled.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable? \n&#xa0;\n2.6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nervice integration \nand \ncross-sector benefits\n:\n  \nChallenges presented by the lack of integrated p\nlanning are detailed above.  There needs to be a requirement on all publicly funded services to assess the impact of their planning and service provision in order to consider how they can integrate with other sectors.  It is also important that the real co\nst of service provision is recognised insofar as those using or procuring services (particularly when this is done indirectly) meet the full and realistic cost of the service which they are receiving.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBrokerage and\n \nshare\nd resources\n:\n  \nThe default position for all publicly funded services/operators/vehicles is that they \nshould \nbe shared and accessible to the maximum number of people unless it can be shown that there is a real and pressing reason for this not to happen.  In isolated commu\nnities, it is particularly important that scare resources are effectively utilised.  There is no reason why NHS, local authority, school or CT vehicles cannot be used to help meet the needs of groups other the\nir\n core clients.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFull cost recovery\n for voluntary car schemes\n:\n  Hundreds (possibly thousands) of car schemes operate across the country.  Transport authorities and the NHS frequently make use of these services to support the delivery of their statutory obligations.  This engagement needs to\n be more formally recognised and statutory agencies must pay the full cost of the services/benefits they are receiving.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe CTA has shared this evidence with its (1,500) member organisations for discussion and would be keen to expand further o\nn those discussions and the points above through oral evidence to the Transport Committee.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
