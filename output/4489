[normal]Written evidence submitted by [bold]tecUK ‘TV’ [bold][FBB0088][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction[bold]This response was formatted with and on behalf of the UK’s consumer electronics industry. We have chosen to answer the question posed by the inquiry we felt most directly relevant to our relationship with the BBC, and influential upon the UK television val
[normal]ue chain. We have also submitted a similar response to the same question focusing on the UK radio industry, garnering views from our members who supply digital technology within the UK radio market. The below response is positioned as a series of critical 
[normal]questions that we feel must be considered by the inquiry in order to ascertain what role the BBC should indeed play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content. 
[normal]About techUK[bold]techUK represents the companies and technologies that are def
[normal]ining today the world that we will live in tomorrow. More than 850 companies are members of techUK. Collectively they employ more than 500,000 people, about half of all tech sector jobs in the UK. These companies range from leading FTSE 100 companies to ne
[normal]w innovative start-ups. The majority of our members are small and medium sized businesses.
[normal]What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?[bold]1.[bold]       
[normal]How can the BBC continue to support the free-to-air broadca[bold]st platform, and best work towards a spectrum clearance to accommodate HD services and stop the expensive simulcast of both SD and HD?  [bold]The BBC have recently launched 5 new HD services bringing the total number of BBC subscription-free HD channels to 7. 
[normal]However, this means that 7 channels are now ‘simulcast’, i.e. broadcast in both standard definition and higher definition which therefore utilises a significant amount of the UK’s limited spectrum and adds cost to the BBC. Against this, a significant perce
[normal]ntage of DTT devices able to receive broadcast TV signals in the UK are now sold incorporating HD technology, and indeed a significant percentage of UK homes are now HD homes. Whilst we make a transition from standard definition to higher definition it is 
[normal]only right that this process of simulcasting takes place, as it did with both analogue and digital services before a switchover process was completed. The BBC must then work with industry and government to build an HD strategy which can deliver the migrati
[normal]on from SD to HD within a framework that maintains high levels of customer satisfaction and is commercially deliverable from the manufacturers perspective
[normal]2.[bold]       
[normal]How can the BBC continue to deliver outstanding value for money to license fee payers, whi[bold]lst allowing an open and competitive ‘hybrid’ TV market to develop which  enables growth and innovation across the converging landscape? [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]There is concern within the UK consumer electronics industry and beyond, that the BBC is increasingly using its resou
[normal]rces to become more and more like a vertical platform operator. Over recent years Public Sector Broadcasters around Europe have been claiming that manufacturers will abuse their position to become gatekeepers of their content. However, there is increasing 
[normal]concern that the opposite is actually happening with PSB controlled whitelisting determining which horizontal devices get access to broadband delivered PSB content. 
[normal]This is not in the best interests of the UK consumer, and has the ability to significantl
[normal]y reduce competition within the TV and consumer electronics market place. Just as the BBC have a significant impact on the UKs creative industries, so are they capable of disrupting the technology sector. The BBC must champion common standard platforms, an
[normal]d not exert inappropriate levels of control over devices. ‘Catch-up’ like services are an example of where the BBC are leading hardware development, and we believe this should clearly not be within the remit of a publicly funded body. The lack of a common 
[normal]standards platform for catchup TV services across the PSBs, results in a lack of choice and competition for the consumer. The true and growing impact of the BBC upon the developing TV
[normal] [bold]related hardware and standards marketplace must be understood and factor
[normal]ed into their charter, in order to not only ensure innovation can take place but that the tech focused TV market is in-fact sustainable.
[normal]3.[bold]       
[normal]How can the BBC work to he[bold]l[bold]p drive and support the development and alignment of international standards in [bold]order to offer UK consumers the best possible experience, and a competitive UK market place?[bold]The BBC have and are expected to continue to provide a lead in the development of world leading new technology and interoperability standards and innovation. It i
[normal]s imperative that the BBC must work in partnership with the technology industry to ensure consumers are provided with the best possible experience and a competitive marketplace from which to purchase associated hardware. In an increasingly connected and gl
[normal]obalised world, not only is content more international than ever before, but the choice, feature set and costs of devices within the UK market place are greatly impacted by the global marketplace as many manufacturers globalise their development capabiliti
[normal]es to ensure that they can remain competitive in a marketplace which is increasingly difficult to achieve operating profits. Where technology is developed by UK broadcasters which does not reflect global trends or interoperability it restricts or delays ma
[normal]nufacturers ability to bring hardware to market, and places significant additional financial pressures as they are unable to achieve scale. This results in both reduction of choice and competition for UK consumers to enjoy since manufacturers cannot operat
[normal]e effectively within local markets anymore. The BBC must play a greater role working with elements of the international TV marketplace, including European broadcasters, to align on international standards.
[normal]4.[bold]       
[normal]How can the BBC develop long-term strat[bold]egies which account for new “game changing” technologies capable of disrupting current business models such as cloud computing or Ultra-High-Definition services?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Where
[normal] [bold]technology is being developed capable of changing the fundamental nature of our enterta
[normal]inment experience, the BBC must adapt in a timely manner in order to meet shifting consumer behaviour. For instance, there are increasing discussions about the use of cloud based content storage for catch-up services. Whilst current regulations allow for t
[normal]ime shifting on STRs, they may no longer be fit for purpose in a networked environment which could impact the licensing and use of copyrighted material. This in turn then clearly impacts BBC strategies. A process of clear communication between the BBC and 
[normal]the value chain must take place in order for critical players to know what considerations the public sector broadcaster have given to such ‘game changing’ technologies and what plans and timelines they are putting in place. This will enable hardware manufa
[normal]cturers in particular to align and offer consumers compatible devices on the market in a timely manner. Another such example is around the BBCs view and strategy on new ‘Ultra High Definition’ services. There appears to be global interest in this technolog
[normal]y from both device players, content creators, and broadcasters. In fact there are already a number of UHD capable devices on the UK market and in UK homes inspite of the lack of a content delivery strategy. The disconnect between hardware capability and co
[normal]ntent availability risks consumer dissatisfaction which in turn can impact on the attractiveness for manufacturers to invest in bringing products to market. The BBC has a role to play in shaping and leading the availability of UHD content and must clearly 
[normal]communicate their UHD plans in order for the market to set the right consumer expectations. 
[normal]5.[bold]       
[normal]What role can the BBC play in educating and informing consumers to the benefits of the 'connected experience' across a range of devices and platforms[bold], both in and out of home?[bold]The BBC already do a good job promoting the use of different online services such as the iPlayer and how that can be received via connected TVs, games consoles, and even out of the home via tablets and smartphones. However, as m
[normal]ore and more devices enter the marketplace capable of receiving content via the internet, and indeed more services are developed which incorporate BBC content, the BBC will need to significantly increase its communication with license fee payers about the 
[normal]number of different ways in which they can enjoy BBC services.
