[[[Written evidence submitted by the UK Council on Deafness (UKCOD)]]]

[[[About ]]]

[[[UKCOD]]]UKCOD is the UK's leading membership body for organisations concerned with Deafness. We provide access to specialist information, conferences and collaborative working opportunities, whilst providing a collective membership voice to political and cross sector partners.

[[[Introduction ]]]Deaf people are 4 times more likely to be unemployed than the general population. The Job Centre Plus offer vital services that deaf people rely on. UKCOD feel that the accessibility of these services for deaf people could be improved in a number of ways. We use the term “deaf” to mean all deaf people, including those who use BSL, those who lipread and may wear hearing aids or cochlear implants, and those who are deafblind.
