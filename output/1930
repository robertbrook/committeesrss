[normal]Association of Professional Financial Advisers[bold] – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]When the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills consulted on whether non-economic regulators should have a duty to have regard to growth, APFA (the Association of Professional Financial Advisers) called for the newly formed financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to be given a duty to have regard to growth and the economic impact of its actions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In its response to the consultation, the Government states that it believes that the duties contained in the Financial Services Act 2012 (FSA 2012) are appropriately framed for regulators of financial services, given the nature of financial services markets and their role in the economy, while being sufficiently similar in intent to the growth duty being consulted on to remove any necessity to apply it to them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, APFA remains concerned, for the reasons set out in its original response, that the existing duty is insufficient and that the FCA should therefore be brought within the scope of the new duty for non-economic regulators to have regard to growth. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In summary, we acknowledge that the FSA 2012 includes a regulatory principle that the FCA must have regard to the desirability of sustainable growth. Our concern is that the consultation envisaged a stronger duty (i.e. regulators 
[normal]must[bold] consider the impact of their actions in economic terms) than that which is contained in the FSA 2012. If the FCA were to be excluded from the proposed duty, it would not be obliged to consider the economic impact of its actions, but only to 
[normal]have regard to[bold] the desirability of economic growth. Therefore, we believed that the FCA’s existing duty is not as strong as that proposed and that this shortcoming needed to be rectified.

[normal]RESPONSE [bold]DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS, INNOVATION &amp; SKILLS CONSULTATION  [bold]NON-ECONOMIC REGULATORS: DUTY TO HAVE REGARD TO GROWTH[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]ABOUT APFA[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Association of Professional Financial Advisers (APFA) is the representative body for the financial adviser profession. There are approximately 14,000 adviser firms employing 81,000 staff. 40% of investment and protection products are sold through financial advisers, with annual revenue estimated at £3.8 billion (£2.2 billion from investment business, £1.2 billion from general insurance and £400 million from mortgages). Over 50% of the population rank financial advisers as one of their top three most trusted sources of advice about money matters. As such, financial advisers represent a leading force in the maintenance of a competitive and dynamic retail financial services market.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]APFA welcomes this opportunity to respond to the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills’ consultation on Non-economic Regulators: Duty to have regard to growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]OUR RESPONSE[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In general we would welcome the introduction of a duty for regulators to have regard to growth. The financial services sector, in which we have a particular interest, is integral to the prosperity of the wider economy,
[normal] 
[normal]employing 1.1 million people and contributing 9% of UK GDP. It is therefore imperative that the financial services regulators should not act in a disproportionate way which might constrain financial services firms from growing. We understand, from correspondence with the Department
[normal] 
[normal]for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, that it is not currently the government’s intention to include the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) within the scope of a duty to have regard to growth. We believe this is a missed opportunity. Given the importance of the financial services sector to the UK economy, omitting the FCA from a duty to have regard to growth means the proposed legislation risks not having as much impact as would otherwise be the case.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The previous regulator, the FSA, did not have a duty to consider the economic impact of its actions and we believe this led to it developing policies in isolation without considering the overall impact regulation was having on the industry or the economy. An example is the Retail Distribution Review (RDR). Data recently published by APFA
[normal] suggests that preparing for RDR caused a drop in revenue for financial advice firms in 2012, following several years of steady growth. Whilst it is too early to know what impact it will have in 2013, figures recently published by the FSA show that there has been a 25% fall in the number of advisers operating in the market, which suggests that there may be an on-going negative impact on firms’ revenue. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We acknowledge that the Financial Services Act 2012 (FSA 2012) includes a regulatory principle that the FCA must have regard to the desirability of sustainable growth. Our concern is that the current consultation envisages a stronger duty (i.e. regulators 
[normal]must[bold] consider the impact of their actions in economic terms) than that which is contained in the FSA 2012. If the FCA were to be excluded from the duty
[normal] 
[normal]proposed in this consultation, it will not be 
[normal]obliged
[normal] to consider the economic impact of its actions, but only 
[normal]to have regard to the desirability[bold] of economic growth. Therefore, we believe that the FCA’s existing duty is not as strong as that proposed and that this shortcoming needs to be rectified. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It would also seem inconsistent for the FCA to come within the scope of the Regulators’ Compliance Code (as proposed in the separate consultation paper “Amending the Regulators’ Compliance Code”) which requires regulators to carry out their activities in a way that helps businesses to grow, but not to come within the scope of a legal duty to have regard to growth. It seems to us, and it appears to be the intention expressed in the paper (at paragraph 2.15) that if the FCA is within the scope of the Regulators’ Compliance Code (and we believe it should be) then it must by extension come within the scope of a legal duty to consider the impact of its actions in economic terms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the legislation is intended to apply to all non-economic regulators, there needs to be a strong argument for deciding to omit any particular regulator. We do not believe that argument can be made in respect of the FCA. We therefore believe that primary legislation should be used to introduce a duty for regulators to have regard to growth and the economic impact of their actions, and that the FCA should be brought within the scope of that legislation, as well as within the scope of the Regulators’ Compliance Code.
