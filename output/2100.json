"&#xa0;\nAssociation of British Bookmakers – Written evidence&#xa0;I am pleased to put forward this submission from the Association of British Bookmakers concerning the draft Deregulation Bill. \nOur interest relates to the duty of growth elements, which the industry welcomes strongly. We set out our support for the proposals in a letter to the Better Regulation Delivery Office on 19\nth\n April 2013.\n&#xa0;\nThe Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) is the leading trade association for betting shop operators on the UK’s high streets.  \nThe ABB’s members include 4 of the 5 biggest UK betting shop operators, along with about 100 operators of family owned independent medium-sized and small estates and single shops. Together our members operate 80% of the betting shop market. \nBritain’s betting shops have been trading on high streets and in town centres for over fifty years and now serve over eight million customers. \nWe employ over 40,000 people and are one of the UK’s largest employers of women and young people – in fact, a quarter of all our staff are aged 18-24 and 56% are women.\nBritain’s high street betting shops pay one billion pounds a year in taxation, and contribute over three billion pounds a year to the UK’s economy. \nAt a time when major retailers like Comet, \nJessops\n, HMV or Blockbusters are closing down or going into administration, bookmakers continue to create jobs right at the heart of the UK’s high streets and town centres. Indeed, just this week, the latest retail survey shows that there are 14% of retail units lying vacant. \nThe Gambling Regulatory Regime\nThe Gambling industry is highly regulated. \nWe recognise there will always be natural tension between a regulator and the industry or sector it regulates, regardless of the area in which they work or regulate. \nBetting operators require operating licences from the Gambling Commission, personal licences are required by key management and, in the case of those operating betting shops, premises licenses are granted by local authorities.\nBetting operators are subject to both operating and premises licensing conditions, a social responsibility code and technical standards. \nThe Gambling Act 2005 (operative from 2007) is founded on three Licensing Objectives:\n•Keeping crime and disorder out of gambling\n•Protecting children and the vulnerable from the potentially harmful of effects of gambling\n•Keeping gambling fair (mainly about clear rules and complaint procedures)\nThe Act is constructed on that basis that there should be an “aim to permit” gambling as a legitimate leisure pursuit unless there are genuine evidenced concerns relating to the three Licensing Objectives. \nThe fundamental principle underpinning the Gambling Act is that licensed operators are subject to significant levels of social control (the gambling regulatory regime described above) as a quid pro quo for market liberalisation.\nThe Gambling Commission, which has always stressed its “social regulator” (as opposed to economic) credentials, is clear that it regulates gambling in “the public interest” taking into account:\n•The need to protect the public\n•The need to maintain public confidence in the gambling industry and the Commission\n•The importance of declaring and upholding proper standards of conduct and competence by licence holders\nThe Commission also makes clear that in assessing evidence it will employ a “precautionary principle” in assessing evidence. In effect this means that where evidence of harm is inconclusive it will opt to prevent rather than support innovation and growth. \nTurning to the questions on the specific issue of regulators having a duty to the desirability of promoting economic growth:\n17. To what extent do the Government’s existing powers of direction over regulators already provide the ability to guide regulators towards the importance of promoting economic growth? Is this legislation necessary?\nThis legislation is necessary. Too often, decisions are made or guidance issued by a regulator, without any consideration or thought for the economic consequences on the industry they are regulating. \nRequiring regulators to have regard for promoting economic growth in the industry they regulate would mark a sea change in approach, and we welcome such legislation. \nIt should lead to regulators pausing and thinking through the economic impact of any decision they make and should lead to a much better understanding about the issues – from both sides.\n18. Will the introduction of a duty to have \nregard\n to “promoting economic growth” compromise the independence of regulators? What additional safeguards are required to ensure that the introduction of such a duty will not compromise the independence of a regulator?\nThere is no reason that we envisage where the independence of the regulator would be compromised under this duty. It simply means that the regulator should be expected to consider the economic impact of their decisions on the industry they regulate and ensure they consider how such a decision would promote economic growth – or might not.\n19. How is a duty to have regard to the desirability of economic growth likely to affect those regulators to which it is applied?\nWe believe it would make the regulator more considerate of the economic impact of their announcements, proposals before publishing them.  It could allow for discussions beforehand \nto iron\n out any misunderstandings that could occur and prevent anything which has the capacity to turn a minor issue to a major one.\nWhile this could be seen as a new basis for a regulator to work, it simply flags up that the regulator has not been doing this beforehand. \n20. Where is the introduction of such a duty likely to have beneficial effect? Where might there be adverse consequences?\nIt is likely to be of benefit in the ways decisions or announcements are made, hopefully leading to discussions before any announcement, and an understanding by the regulator of the costs to business of what they are proposing. The adverse consequences seem minimal – it could lead to disputes over how much something is impacting on business, and indeed business could overstate the impact of any decision or issuing of guidance. That is why a much closer working relationship would mitigate this from happening. \n21. How might the extent to which a regulator has fulfilled, or breached, the duty be ascertained?\nAs part of publishing a new proposal for the industry, or asking for new information – or the same information in a different way – the regulator should provide details of what they think it will cost the industry – in staff time and money – to provide this information; in turn, when responding, the industry could provide the costs as incurred, so the facts are there. The proposals included the expectation that the regulator would publish a clear statement on how they would promote economic growth, and an annual report setting out how they had achieved it. \nThis seems the best way to do this, providing a basis for how the regulator will promote economic growth, against which they can be measured, but would also mean the industry being regulated understood where the regulator was coming from. \n22. How can the likely financial and economic impact of the proposed duty be assessed? \nBetting shop operators can calculate the costs (staff, time) involved in responding to requests or providing information to the Regulator – this would provide a clear statement as to whether a proposal or decision was promoting or impeding economic growth.\nThe ABB would be happy to provide oral evidence future to the Joint Committee.\n&#xa0;\n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
