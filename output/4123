defaultTemporary/Alternative measure: cycle lanes in OPPOSITE DIRECTION to traffic
default1.default The second is named a "temporary/alternative measure" because, although segregated cycle lanes (with a small kerb) are the ultimate safety goal, on Lond
defaulton's (and Britain's) narrow streets this is simply not going to be always feasible. There will simply not be enough space for a pavement and a road AND a cycle lane in many cases. As such, without a revolutionary idea such as I propose, the problem of cycl
defaulte safety in UK cities will never go away.
default2default. My proposal, therefore, is that while motorists drive on the left, cyclists should ride on the RIGHT. As long as cars and 
defaultlorries
default have "blind spots", there will always be accidents - they will remain unpreventab
defaultle. So the obvious answer is for cyclists to come TOWARDS the motorists. A report once stated that the best way for a pedestrian to avoid risk while crossing outside a designated crossing area is to make eye contact with the approaching motorist. Cyclists 
defaultat the moment cannot do this. For inexperienced road cyclists, this (not seeing what is coming behind you) causes fear and anxiety and while there is fear and anxiety there will be mistakes. By motorists too. There are enough things to be distracted by in 
defaultfront of him (such as jay-walking pedestrians, cars pulling out in front 
defaultetc
default) and as such he neglects to look as often as he should in his rear and wing mirrors. With cyclists coming TOWARDS him, he will again be able to concentrate mostly on what is going
default on in front.
default3default. TURNING: turning right at junctions will prove a lot safer for cyclists with the new OPPOSITE DIRECTION idea. Turning LEFT may be more difficult but at least the cyclist turning will now be IN FRONT of the motorist, i.e. IN FULL VIEW just 
defaultlike a pedestrian in a way. And it is the responsibility of the cyclist to make himself visible at all times. This will not change with the new system.
default4default. COST: the cost will be negligible. All that is required is for the cycle motif on lanes to be changed
default and a big publicity campaign to be carried out. A trial period/place could be a good idea too.
defaultA catchy name might be "Right way" (as opposed to "wrong way", as it will continue to be, for motorists) or "Opposite view".
