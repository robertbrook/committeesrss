[normal]Written evidence from [bold]Novo Nordisk [bold](LTC 54)[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novo Nordisk strongly welcomes the focus on diabetes being taken by the Health Committee.
[normal] 
[normal]Diabetes is rapidly becoming one of the most pressing public health issues 
[normal]with three 
[normal]million people
[normal] now diagnosed with diabetes and
[normal] 850,000 
[normal]peop
[normal]l
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]unaware they have the condition
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In the next 20 years, the number of people 
[normal]diagnosed with 
[normal]diabetes is expected to rise to 
[normal]5.6
[normal] million at a cost of £3
[normal]9.8
[normal] billion to the NHS and to the wider economy
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Diabetes significantly increases the risk of developing a number of potentially life-threatening complications including stroke, cardiac failure and renal failure, as well as blindness and major limb amputations.
[normal] 
[normal]It is estimated 80% of the cost of diabetes is avoidable through effective and timely interventions to prevent complications
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A clear and comprehensive strategy for tackling diabetes is urgently needed.
[normal] 
[normal]We await the publication of Action for Diabetes, which we hope will provide that strategy.
[normal] 
[normal]While we are encouraged by the work that is taking place to ensure diabetes remains a priority for the NHS, 
[normal]we believe that the implementation document must take a holistic view of care in the NHS and beyond.
[normal] 
[normal]In particular, the implementation guide must address how to reduce the variations that exist in diabetes care and outcomes across the country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are already levers and incentives in place to improve diabetes care, for example the Quality and Outcomes Framework
[normal] (QOF)
[normal] incentivises GPs to undertake a variety of care processes for people with diabetes.
[normal] 
[normal]These must be kept under constant review in order to ensure they are fit for purpose.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, new levers should be developed and effectively implemented so that care for people with diabetes 
[normal]is constantly improving.
[normal] 
[normal]These should include additional indicators on diabetes in the QOF and the clinical commissioning group outcome indicator set (CCGOIS).
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) payments should be developed and implemented to drive further improvement across the NHS.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a wealth of evidence linking rising rates of diabetes to rising rates of obesity.
[normal] 
[normal]An obese man is five times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes 
[normal]than an average weight man 
[normal]and an obese women is more than thirteen times more likely
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In England, 25% of adults are obese, with 42% of men and 32% of women overweight
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is predicted that if no action is taken, 60% of men, 50% of women and 25% of children in Britain would be obese by 2050
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Several European countries have introduced taxes on unhealthy food and beverages, such as sugary drinks, as part of their efforts to counter obesity
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]While the impact of imposing a tax on sugary drinks is unknown, the Government must ensure manufacturers follow the voluntary measures laid down in the Responsibility Deal.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As of April 2013, obesity has become part of the Public Health Domain of the Quality and Outcomes Framework, which will be managed by Public Health England (PHE).
[normal] 
[normal]It is essential that PHE implements preventative measures to ensure people, particularly children, are supported to moderate their sugar and fat consumption
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When people do develop diabetes, effective integrated care will be key to ensuring that they receive the care they need and are not exposed to needless risk of complications.
[normal] 
[normal]The types of services which the average person with diabetes will need access to will depend on the specific nature of their condition, their own profile and their place in the care pathway.
[normal] 
[normal]These can include: screening and diagnostic tests; assessments of risk factors and complications; dietary advice; lifestyle and exercise advice; education; glycaemic control and monitoring; Chronic Heart Disease risk factor control and targets; specialist referrals and specialist nursing; diabetes foot assessments and podiatry services; treatment of hypertension
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that all people 
[normal]with diabetes receive nine
[normal] health
[normal]care
[normal] checks
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Ensuring that people with diabetes receive the nine care processes recommended by NICE will require close working be
[normal]tween healthcare professionals
[normal] across the NHS.
[normal] 
[normal]The challenge for the new system is to break down boundaries between different parts of the health and care system.
[normal] 
[normal]There is a
[normal]n
[normal] opportunity for
[normal] health and wellbeing boards
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]HWB
[normal]s
[normal])
[normal] to lead this agenda, given the representation of both the NHS and local government on these boards.
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]ilo-
[normal]ed
[normal] budgets have been a barrier to integrated care and 
[normal]HWBs
[normal] should make a concerted effort to pool budgets across different areas of the care pathway to improve services for patients.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This should be coupled with reforms to tariffs for services for patients with long-term conditions which continue to act as an obstacle to delivering a joined-up system.
[normal] 
[normal]The year of care tariff for long-term conditions presents a real opportunity to move away from paying providers by episode of care and instead treating patients as individuals with complex care needs by focusing more on prevention and condition management in the community.
[normal] 
[normal]This will improve outcomes for patients and deliver much needed efficiencies in the way care is delivered.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novo Nordisk further welcomes the focus of the committee’s investigation of the readiness of social care services to treat patients with long-term conditions, such as diabetes, in the community.
[normal] 
[normal]Every year thousands of people enter the social care system, the majority of whom are over the age of 65.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he prevalence of diabetes amongst the over 65s is higher than in the general population, yet little is known about the prevalence of diabetes amongst social care users.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2007, the Department of Health estimated that 1 in 20 people with diabetes incur social services costs.
[normal] 
[normal]The presence of complications increased social services costs four-fold
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There is widespread recognition that a rapidly ageing society means more people living with chronic long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, placing pressure on health and social care costs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A report by the House of Lords Select Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change predicted that the demand for health and social care for people with diabetes in England and Wales will increase by 45% from 2010 to 2030
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Social care services must work closely with health services
[normal] to
[normal] ensure that social care users receive the treatment and support they need to maintain good blood glucose and to prevent complications which will result in hospital admissions.
[normal] 
[normal]This will become increasin
[normal]g acute as the older population, and consequently demand placed on adult social care and health services, 
[normal]rises.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The scale of the challenge to social care services of an ageing population has been clearly demonstrated by the Barnet ‘Graph of Doom’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is essential that local authorities and local health economies are equipped and prepared to meet this challenge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Meaningful
[normal] data on the prevalence and management of long-term conditions, such as diabetes, in social care settings
[normal] are
[normal] needed
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]As mentioned above there is little comprehensive evidence available on the treatment of long-term conditions in social care.
[normal] 
[normal]Novo Nordisk is undertaking work to 
[normal]uncover the significant contribution of diabetes to local authority social care costs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The complications related to diabetes are not just physical.
[normal] 
[normal]Novo Nordisk’s Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs 
[normal](DAWN2) 
[normal]project asked people with diabetes about their experiences of having the condition.
[normal] 
[normal]Across all people with diabetes, sleeping problems and depression were the most commonly reported
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is estimated that people with diabetes are two to three times more likely to have depression than the rest of the population
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is essential that the mental health of people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes, is considered alongside and equal to their physical wellbeing. 
[normal]Failure 
[normal]to support people
[normal] with diabetes
[normal] is associated with poorer glycaemic control, more diabetic complications and poorer medicines adherence
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As part of the DAWN2 project, Novo Nordisk aims to provide enhanced support and education for people with diabetes in order to improve understanding amongst people with diabetes of the need for good glucose management and to give them the help they need to manage their condition effectively.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to 
[normal]the project on
[normal] social care, N
[normal]ovo Nordisk is currently engaged in a significant project with King’s Health Partners, comprising Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital and King’s College Hospital London, to demonstrate how the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry working in partnership can develop a model for sustainable diabetes care, research and education.
[normal] 
[normal]The ambition of this joint working project is to co-create a world-recognised centre for diabetes care, research and education: developing and delivering the most cost-effective, highest quality care, ensuring optimal outcomes to patients served by King’s Health Partners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The expected outcomes and benefits to patients and the NHS of the joint working project are as follows:
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.
[normal] 
[normal]The company also has leading positions within haemophilia care, growth hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy. Headquartered in Denmark, Novo Nordisk employs about 32,500 people in 74 countries and markets its products in 179 countries.
