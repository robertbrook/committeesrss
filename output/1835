defaultIntroductiondefaultIntellect welcomes the opportunity to input into this review on procurement and provide an IT industry perspective in response to the questions raised. The views that we express and the recommendations that we make in this response are relevant to all areas of procurement, not just the procurement of IT. However the procurement of IT within local government does give rise to issues for both suppliers and buyers which can, and often do, have a detrimental effect on the delivery of cost effective services to citizens.
default&#xa0;
defaultBackgrounddefaultIntellect and the government have worked together over many years to create tools and proce
defaultsses to improve IT procurement
default. Examples include a pre-procurement market engagement process known as Concept Viability
default, 
defaultour Innovation Den series
default 
defaultwhich are half-day sessions that offer small, innovative businesses the opportunity to pitch their ideas to panellists from central and local government
default,
default and a Pre-Qualification Tool
default to help procuring authorities
default test the readiness for major I
defaultT procurements. However, 
defaultprocurement across the local government sector has remained
default 
defaultinconsistent 
defaultwith the result that, despite many initiatives, procurement of major ICT systems and services in 
defaultlocal government remains varied in both success, value for money and outcomes for citizens.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIntellect members have experience of working across both the public and private sectors. They have observed that within the public sector procurement rules and regulations are often translated into processes and cultures that tend to engender a more adversarial procurement environment. Many of our recommendations are aimed at breaking down barriers between industry and the 
defaultlocal government sector
default 
defaultto create a competitive market and a level playing field 
defaultwhilst, at the same time, maintaining the necessary integrity of the public procurement process. Intellect believes that huge improvement is possible through change in this area and that
default 
defaultthere are opportunities to achieve quick wins by building on work that has already been undertaken.
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrent opportunities within the marketdefaultIntellect’s position is that the public sector technology market is competitive and vibrant with a substantial supplier and customer base.  There are also significant business opportunities for suppliers across the public sector, with a pipeline worth over £25bn.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the main challenge facing suppliers to the public sector is the way customers procure technology and the processes and practices used.  These create high entry barriers for suppliers, small and large, and threaten our industry’s ability to grow and innovate. The cost of doing business in the public sector is a real challenge for industry, particularly for smaller suppliers.
default&#xa0;
defaultIndustry and government have developed and started to implement policies and best practices that seek to remove these barriers.  The reforms introduced by the government to reduce these barriers are already making a positive impact. We support these reforms and are encouraged by the actions taken so far.   
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal government are also ahead of the curve in terms of some central government initiatives and have led the way in particular areas of government policy. For example, local government have already readily embraced the SME agenda and has sourced innovation and new technology from the SME community at a rate much higher than that of central government. Local government are also key users of the G Cloud framework with several success stories emerging from the sector on how using the new agile model G Cloud presents has resulted in improved procurement costs and experience for those involved. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSeveral forward thinking organisations are also embracing suppliers as strategic partners and delivering improved services through these relations for both the council as a customer and the citizen as a consumer.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, these examples exist often as pockets of innovation within the sector with little focus placed on sharing this knowledge or collaborating further to achieve economies of scale. F
defaultor
default procurement to be truly
default successful 
defaultwithin the local government sector 
defaultthere has to be a comprehensive cha
defaultnge to process and practice in public s
defaultector procurement
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultChallenges faced within the sectordefaultOur members face a number of potential challenges when procuring within this market which we have listed as follows:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf we are successful with this we will see a growing number of suppliers succeeding in the market, a customer base that implements good technology quicker, a reduction in the cost of technology to the public sector, and the delivery of better public services. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAreas for actiondefault&#xa0;
defaultIn order to achieve the above the following three areas need to be looked at and worked on not only between local and central government but also consulting and working with industry to achieve the needed outcomes:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultImprove standardisation and transparency within the process
defaultWhilst local government organisations
default must have freedom to act
default, increased standardisation of process and documentation can contribute to improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the procurement process.  
defaultSuppliers are concerned abo
defaultut the often onerous nature of 
defaultPre-Qualification Questionnaire (P
defaultQQ) processes 
defaultas well as
default the often obscure status of the business case for investment.  
defaultCentral government together with local government and industry should work to identify areas within the procurement where standardisation can be applied e.g. PQQ or Terms &amp; Conditions. Although we appreciate that an exercise like this is unlikely to produce a one-size-fits-all document it may still be possible to create a suite of standardised documents that relate to the scale and type of procurement so as to enable the necessary local flexibility.
defaultTransparency is a key tool to enable all sides to ensure a procurement process is run to achieve the best outcome. 
defaultIntellect’s consultative work with its members indicates that both suppliers and purchasers would benefit from a clearer understanding of the context and scope of particular procurements
default.  Local government should be encouraged to be transparent through every stage of the procurement process.
default&#xa0;
defaultEncourage and foster greater market engagement and relationships
defaultStructured industry engagement is an increasingly important part of preparing for public sector procurements. Early engagement means policies can be refined into outcome definitions before the launch of a formal competition; and carefully designed procurement strategies can be aligned to deliver the desired outcomes ensuring better overall performance and value for money. It also means potential suppliers have a real opportunity to put forward truly innovative solutions.
default  
defaultIn addition, currently suppliers are typically seen as adversaries who are to be kept at arm’s length and involved in as little of the project as possible. This attitude needs to change.  An environment of partnership and collaboration between suppliers and customers needs to be promoted and encouraged for local government to get the most from its procurement activity.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntellect and SO
defaultCITM run a joint forum between local g
defaultovernment and suppliers
default called the Local Public Service Supplier Forum
default to bring together both sides in a neutral forum to discuss and share information about the market to improve knowledge and develop potential solutions to challenges faced within this sector. 
default&#xa0;
defaultCentral government should promote and encourage initiatives like the Local Public Service Supplier Forum and other activities like Concept Viability referenced above to make market engagement not just accepted but a standard 
defaultpart of procurement across all local g
defaultovernment organisations.
default&#xa0;
defaultImproved knowledge and expertise within the sector
defaultA lack of knowledge about the IT marketplace and the wealth of suppliers operating in it is proving hugely detrimental to local government both in terms of aligning solutions to specific requirements as well as limiting innovation and the economies of scale that could be achieved. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough fora like the Local Public Service Supplier Forum Intellect have started to provide a platform for councils to share and come together to improve their skills and knowledge in this area but much more needs to be done.
default&#xa0;
defaultCentral government should play a stronger role in highlighting successes within the market and sharing the lessons learnt and best practice from the projects. In addition, there is a role for either central or local government to improve the procurement, project management and evaluation skills of individuals working within local government organisations. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIntellect is keen to work with local government and stakeholders within the sector to improve these areas and we would be happy to discuss our work and how we can help with the committee.
