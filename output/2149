defaultSarah defaultSimmondsdefault – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultI am writing to support the proposals of the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) to add provisions to the Bill.  The Friends of the Ridgeway have submitted a letter pointing out the additional protection proposed for National Parks and AONBs should be extended to World Heritage Sites.  The 
defaultAvebury
default half of the Stonehenge and 
defaultAvebury
default World Heritage Site lies within the North Wessex Downs AONB but the Stonehenge landscape 
defaultdoes
default not.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK, as a signatory to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO, 1972) is obliged to protect and conserve the Site’s significance or outstanding universal value (OUV) and appropriately present and transmit this to future generations. 
defaultThe
default extra protection 
defaultc
defaultould be most welcome in assisting us in part
default with
default this role
default in the Stonehenge and 
defaultAvebury
default World Heritage Site
default.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe 
defaultUNESCO 
defaultStatement of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV) outlines the reasons for the Site’s inscription on the WHS and acts as a guide to what we need to protect and how this will be achieved. The SOUV underlines the fact that “
defaultr
defaultoads and vehicles also cause damage to the fabric of some monuments while traffic noise and visual intrusion have a negative impact on their settings.”  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default most recent Stonehenge 
defaultand 
defaultAvebury
default World Heritage Site Condition Survey (Wessex Archaeology, 2010) points to evidence of damage by off road vehicles.
default  In the 
defaultAvebury
default half of the World Heritage Site, “d
defaultamage from the use of a monument as a 
defaultrouteway
default was recorded on the 
defaultHerepath
default and The Ridgeway. The condition of these latter routes are both of considerable concern, as
default 
defaultboth are suffering from their on-going use by vehicles, including recreational
default 
defaultoff-road vehicles and quad bikes. It is recommended that 
defaultefforts are made to
default 
defaultrestrict traffic using these routes and that remedial action be taken to stabilise
default 
defaultthe worst of the erosion caused.”  The survey indicates similar problems in the Stonehenge
default half of 
defaultthe World Heritage Site where there are 31 instances of ongoing impacts of vehicle damage.
default 
defaultD
defaultamage on BOATS account for nearly 
default20% of all vehicle impacts within the Stonehenge area but represent 50% of the most severe level of vehicles damage. 
defaultPolicy 5c of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site Management Plan (2009) states that 
defaultvehicular access to Byways within the World Heritage Site should be restricted apart from access for emergency, operational and farm vehicles.
default   
defaultObjective T of the 
defaultAvebury
default World Heritage Site (2005) aims to 
defaultprevent increasing physical damage caused to monuments and public rights of way by the impact of visitor pressure,
default and 
defaultrestore
default 
defaultthe areas significantly affected.
default&#xa0;
defaultShould the PDGLA provisions be enacted, it would be most beneficial if they could be extended to encompass the Stonehenge and 
defaultAvebury
default World Heritage Site.
