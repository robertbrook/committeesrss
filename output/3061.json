"&#xa0;\nBirmingham City Council—Written Evidence&#xa0;EU Action to tackle youth unemployment:House of Lords – Call for Evidence&#xa0;1.PURPOSE&#xa0;1.1\nThis paper provides a response from Birmingham City Council as evidence to the House of Lords Inquiry into EU action to tackle youth unemployment. As the largest local authority in the country and the core city in GBSLEP\n, youth unemployment is very high priority. Specifically this paper addresses the \nneed to focus EU funding to add value to current national efforts to tackle youth unemployment, reflecting the experience of Birmingham over recent years as well as addressing what we regard as the \nshortfalls of current government activity which require a more localised flexible resource to deliver greater impact. The evidence relates primarily to \nQuestion 2: how EU funds can best add value; \nand Question 4: how EU funds for youth unemployment could best be spent, and are set in the context of the current development by GBSLEP of its EU structural and investment fund prospectus. \nReference to other questions may be contained within the context of this paper, we would welcome the opportunity to discuss these further with members of the Inquiry at a later date&#xa0;\n1.2\nWe believe that this paper is the first stage in providing evidence to the Inquiry and we would welcome the opportunity to also give verbal evidence and offer Inquiry members the opportunity to visit Birmingham and the wider LEP area so that they can see at first hand both the issues and discuss how EU funding can best add value to existing and future provision. &#xa0;&#xa0;\n2.EVIDENCE OF LOCAL CHALLENGE: UNDERSTANDING OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe GBSLEP area is home to high concentrations of young people, of those that are economically active, too many are out of work, and not enough are actively engaged or readily participating, in the plethora of support directed at young people (e.g. Youth Contract) through mainstream and other localised employability and skills programmes. Over 27% of active job seekers in the GBSLEP area are young people between the ages of 18 and 24 years.\n&#xa0;\n 82% (12,600) of those claiming JSA are resident in Birmingham and Solihull, with 5,065 unemployed more than 6 months, and 2,875 for more than 12 months. \nThe largest number (11,480) of young JSA claimants in the GBSLEP are resident in Birmingham.&#xa0;&#xa0; Of these 41% (4,650) have been on JSA for more than 6 months. (ONS September 2013).\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to this it is widely documented and evident that the stock of unemployed people aged 18 to 24 years is in reality, much greater. This is because they are NEET and not claiming nor being tracked by public sector agencies (e.g. DWP).  The figures above will not capture or reflect this grouping.  Although JSA claimant figures for 18 - 24 year olds fluctuate on a monthly basis there is insufficient movement and off-flow to signal a lasting and positive reduction in the numbers. In fact, the general trend in Birmingham and North Solihull remains substantially unaltered and points to a deeper issue of long term youth unemployment being entrenched. The clear danger is that if we do nothing, \nthe large number of young people out of work now will stay out of work for a long time, creating lasting problems for them, for Birmingham and also for the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull area as a whole.\n&#xa0;\nIn recognition of the scale of youth unemployment nationally, and the growing impact on Birmingham as the City at the heart of the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership in particular; the \nBirmingham Youth Unemployment Commission was convened to examine the root causes and to propose recommendations for short, medium and long term action. The rapid review included a close examination and analysis of the employability, skills development, employment-related support programmes and business incentives already in place to tackle youth unemployment.  The Commission gathered evidence from the city's strategic partners, cross-sector agencies and field practitioners and expert witnesses involved in the management and delivery of programmes. The report was published and launched in January 2013 carrying with it, a series of high level recommendations.\n(\nwww.birmingham.gov.uk/youthunemploymentcommission).\n In addition to the above, DWP's release of  JSA statistics relating to the \nflows and \nduration of \nunemployment benefit claims by ethnicity, a deeper insight into the differences between the main ethnic groups in Birmingham.  \nUnderstanding these dynamics helps us design appropriate interventions for different groups. For instance, groups with a high proportion of long-term claimants and a low proportion flowing off each month, are best served by support that include projects aimed at those who are unaccustomed to work i.e. access to localised services and bespoke paid sheltered work experience. Whereas, groups with a higher turnover of claimants is likely to include people who have a pattern of working for a short time and then returning to claiming benefits. \nFlow data for the 12 months to December 2012 was analysed and the proportion of total claimants who stop claiming, i.e. flow off each month, was calculated. This gives a measure of how dynamic the claimant group is. The higher the proportion, the more dynamic the claimant group – i.e. a greater proportion of total claimants leave the benefit each month.\n&#xa0;3.THE BIRMINGHAM EXPERIENCE3.1\nBirmingham has a proven track record in managing ESF and ERDF programmes. During 2002-8, it was an \nESF Co financing Organisation managing the commissioning of over £19 million to support people into employment and training across the whole area plus concentrated support on the five most deprived areas. It followed a single pot approach securing £10.5 million match from mainstream BCC resources and the districts (BCC acts as broker through local management structures) and resources from national regeneration programmes (including SRB, NDC and NRF). This ensured all investment was strategically focused on the area avoiding duplication and maximising added value. 70% of contracts were awarded to the third sector. The 2005/8 programme, £9 million of resources assisted 3,388 people into employment and 2,133 into training. BCC, through its current ERDF programme, has a £24 million Action Plan under the Sustainable Urban Development strand focusing on regeneration in the city's five most deprived areas. Unfortunately the current ESF delivery model does not enable them to align physical economic development initiatives through ERDF to employment and skills initiatives through ESF in a way it did in the 2002-2008 period.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\nDuring 2008 – 2011, the City Council managed and commissioned £57m of \nWorking Neighbourhoods Fund against an agreed delivery plan which targeted local priorities. The programme delivered 4,149 Birmingham residents into jobs, 3,456 people from the most deprived areas of the City into jobs; many of these WNF projects have been held to be models of best practice in terms of local delivery. Delivery of this programme was largely contracted by the City on a payment by results model. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\nThe \nFuture Jobs Fund was introduced by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in 2009 as a response to significant concerns about the long-term effects of rising youth unemployment. DWP pledged 150,000 temporary paid jobs lasting six months for unemployed young people and people living in disadvantaged areas, with a maximum DWP contribution of £6,500 per job. The Coalition Government made the decision to end the FJF shortly after taking office in May 2010, citing high costs.\n In Birmingham the programme successfully delivered 2310 people into jobs. Evaluation of the programme overall showed that there were a number of significant benefits, and this was true of Birmingham too. The programme:\nThe weakness of the initiative was that it relied on public and third sector organisations and did not fully engage the private sector. The positive aspects of the Future Jobs Fund have been picked up and transferred into Birmingham’s Young Talent for Business Initiative which is described later in this paper.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\nThe continued effects on \npublic sector expenditure cuts in recent years have had a massive effect on the number of specialist organisations delivering support to young people, \neffectively dismantling and fragmenting the local support services that have previously existed to support young people generally, including specialised employment and skills support, for example the reduction in the Connexions Service as operated by Birmingham City Council.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\nThe \nWiSH Pilot project was one of five national co-design schemes developed in partnership with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The aim was to bring together DWP, Local Authorities and local partners to explore and test new solutions in tackling worklessness, demonstrate effective partnership working and develop a shared understanding of the evidence on what works.  In Birmingham the approach involved a \ndelivery partnership formed through the secondment and attachment of staff from DWP District office, Midland Heart (a Social landlord), Pertemps People Development Group and Birmingham City Council.  The project developed and delivered a flexible personal support and coaching service focused on hardest to place unemployed clients in the Shard End and Lozells &amp; East Handsworth wards. Coaches, who delivered on an outreach basis in community settings and places of trust, provided personal support which sought a balance between nurturing clients and challenging self limiting behaviours and beliefs.  They also acted a lead professionals and advocates for individual service users coordinating a range of support to clients form public and third sector providers. The project supported 511 hard to place unemployed clients during the 2 years of project delivery up until March 2013.    The approach has been recognised as good practice by DWP District Office who have adopted and applied the WiSH principles to their deployment of advisers in response to Troubled Families and Welfare benefits changes.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6\nFollowing the publication of the report of the \nBirmingham Commission on Youth Unemployment and the announcement of the multi-million pound \nBirmingham Jobs Fund on 22 January 2013. The fund comprises £2 million from Birmingham City Council, £1.5 million worth of “passported” Apprenticeship Grants for Employers (AGE) through \nNAS and £50,000 DWP Flexible Support Fund. Badged \nas Young Talent for Business, the Birmingham Jobs Fund approach comprises:\n&#xa0;3.7\nSo far key achievements of the Birmingham Jobs Fund have included:\n&#xa0;3.8\nBirmingham City Council delivers an \nEmployment Access function by fully exploiting it’s unique position to identify and capture jobs that can be opened up to “priority” candidates. and co-ordinating a multi-agency response to the needs of employers recruiting to new jobs locally. Working within strong local partnership arrangements  with DWP, NAS and the Skills Funding Agency, and plays its part by using its influence through the following processes:\n&#xa0;\n3.9\nSecuring interest through these means leads to a customised employer-facing recruitment service either directly led by the Employment Access Team or by working in partnership with others, e.g. Jobcentre Plus, Colleges and training and employment support intermediaries so as to ensure the best outcomes for Birmingham residents. This will be a job matching service against individual vacancies, or where numbers permit, the marshalling of bespoke pre-employment training courses – leading to guaranteed \nemployer-interviews. In other words the Council rallies key partners and creates Targeted Recruitment &amp; Training campaigns to meet the employers’ recruitment requirements which draws in resources to prepare unemployed residents for specific vacancies. Strong partnership relationships with key employers have been\n \ndeveloped through this route including the agreement of Employment &amp; Skills Charters with developers and end use companies in respect of major developments.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.10\nThese Birmingham led approaches underpin the delivery of the GBSLEP City Deal and the Skills for Growth Action Plan launched in May 2013, providing a very specific localised approach to address broader LEP priorities and to meet the specific challenges that face Birmingham.&#xa0;\n4NATIONALLY COMMISSIONED AND DELIVERED PROGRAMMES – THE ISSUES&#xa0;4.1\nLack of geographical targeting and local accountability&#xa0;In the immediate past most ESF and DWP contracts do not include explicit local delivery targets at even a city/ sub-regional level let alone focus activity on specific communities or neighbourhoods within the City boundary.  By contrast, when the City Council operated as an ESF Co-financing agency contracts were split by sub-city geography and community of interest. This model of local targeting was then extended to the Working Neighbourhoods Fund arrangements managed through the Council where 41 locality specific contracts were let with specific reference to targets set within Neighbourhood Employment and Skills Plans and prescribed activity was actively promoted in the 235 Super Output Areas in the city where worklessness rates exceeded 25%.  It is felt that this level of locality targeting was more effective in focusing activity on service users with the most complex barriers and was certainly more transparent and accountable in terms of impact on specific areas and communities. Moreover, because contracts were relatively smaller in scale the level of engagement of third sector agencies in delivery arrangements was greater giving more scope to “buy in” services delivered in a way that was explicitly responsive to local circumstances. Of the 41 WNF contracts linked to Neighbourhood Employment and Skills Plan targets, 18 (i.e. 44%) were awarded to third sector agencies as lead providers- this represented 36% of the total contract value.\n&#xa0;4.2\nImpact of payment by results and price based competitive tendering approach to commissioning&#xa0;DWP, and to a lesser extent SFA commissioning, has in the past  focussed upon payment by results models with small (and tapering) attachment fees and the bulk of contract fees being drawn down in arrears on the basis of achievement and sustainment of outcomes.  This potentially has two effects:\nMoreover, the overtly price competitive nature of much of the commissioning that has occurred (as opposed to placing the balance of tender assessment criteria on quality) has compounded these effects causing Prime contractors to discount their prices in order to win contracts to an extent where significant up front investment in clients is increasingly problematic, and where Primes either chose to retain value by delivering directly rather than entering into sub-contracts with locally based agencies, or seek to sub-contract/ \nspot purchase at meagre fee rates often on a call off, rather than prescribed volume, basis.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\nImpact of commissioning Prime Contractors&#xa0;Both DWP and the Skills Funding Agency have in recent years opted to let ESF funded contracts at a regional level, paying lip service to delivering against local priorities which were not bound up into contracts. The net effect of this approach is that contracts are very large (ESF Families was £28 million over 3 years for the whole of the West Midlands region) thus in effect restricting bidding to large Prime contractors who can both demonstrate pan regional service capacity and coverage, and have the financial resources and cash flow position to effectively manage the risk associated with such contracts. This has advantages for the commissioning body in terms of efficiency- i.e. they are managing a smaller number of large contracts. \nHowever, it is our experience that there is considerable risk that the effectiveness of programmes is compromised. Specifically, this approach limits the ability to tailor delivery based on local knowledge of client group barriers and to route delivery through established community infrastructure which form places of trust for service users.  Obviously the quality of what’s delivered in practice does vary from contractor to contractor. Moreover, the tailoring of local delivery could in theory still occur through proactive delivery relationships between local agencies and the Prime contractors- although locally in Birmingham instances of these relationships being developed in practice are limited \n&#xa0;\n4.4\nAdding value through involving Third Sector in Delivery&#xa0;As a result of the factors described above (and the general reduction in public spending that previously underpinned the Voluntary and community sector through grant sources), many third sector agencies in Birmingham have either had to close, scale down or curtail their employment support/ economic inclusion activities in favour of other, more fundable/ sustainable service activities. This is seen as a significant problem in that the value that such agencies can add around creating responsive services for communities including young people with complex needs in places of trust is lost to the employment support sector in the City. Some successful activities have continued and developed, notably where consortia such as BEST Network have drawn agencies together to act collectively achieving scale, and in the case of BEST winning a DWP Innovation Fund contract in conjunction with a Private sector investor and agreeing a small but increasing level of specialist service purchasing arrangements with Prime contractors around ESF Families and DWP Work Programme.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\nLack of alignment between ESF and other funded programmes&#xa0;Certainly in the case of DWP ESF Families commissioning seems to have lacked depth of thought around the alignment of the programme with other activity notably the DCLG Troubled families initiative.  Similarly, recent commissioning by the Skills Funding Agency around Skills Support for the Unemployed contained an element around the management of apprenticeship incentive grant to employers which appears to cut across recent announcements in respect of similar incentive grants available in core cities through the National Apprenticeship Scheme.\n&#xa0;5IMPLICATIONS FOR EU STRUCTURAL FUNDS 2014-20&#xa0;5.1\nThe devolution of EU (ESF - £110m) and Youth Employment Initiative funds (£19m 2014-16) to the GBSLEP is welcomed. In practice an approach which sought to flow at least a significant element of the available ESF/ structural fund allocation through some form of Integrated territorial Investment vehicle with the Core city local authority (and its surrounding LEP area) at its heart would appear to give the best scope \nfor positively addressing the apparent weaknesses in the commissioning of ESF funded services. Specifically this could;\n&#xa0;5.2\nWhat works?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6THE BIRMINGHAM/GBSLEP RESPONSE&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;Delivery of EU funds 2014 – 2020&#xa0;We believe that the ability to commission against local priorities at a scale that provides the most effective and appropriate support to Birmingham’s young people will deliver better outcomes and be more closely aligned to other local and national initiatives. \nIn short: allow the agencies that are dealing with the problem and consequences of youth unemployment have the resource to deploy in the most effective way. .In practice what we need to achieve now is an approach which sought to flow at least a significant element of the available ESF/ structural fund allocation through some form of Integrated territorial Investment vehicle with the Core city local authority and the surround LEP area at its heart would appear to give the best scope for positively addressing the apparent weaknesses in the commissioning of ESF funded services. Specifically this could;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;6.2What types of Actions?&#xa0;We will be looking at actions that will:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The key point here is not \nwhat support is provided;  \nhow that support is delivered can be even more significant (ie: In depth, non-time limited, personal coaching relationship between client and adviser exploring motivation and seeking to achieve appropriate balance between nurturing support and the challenging of limiting self belief and behaviours. Integrated partnership approach delivered in community settings and places of trust. In addition we need to ensure that the provision that is offered \ndirectly relates to the labour market or a pathway to the opportunities that greater economic growth engendered by the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership as part of a “youth guarantee”.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;In order to add value to current and future government programmes particular emphasis needs to be placed on young people from neighbourhoods and communities of interest where they face disproportionate barriers to, and exclusion from, the labour market.\nSpecific priority groups identified are;\n&#xa0;\n6.3Determining Success&#xa0;\nSuccessful interventions need to be measured not simply on the volumes of outcomes but the impact on a broader spectrum of indicators such as the rates of unemployment/crime levels/NEETs/educational qualifications. The tracking of clients through is being explored in Birmingham by looking at the piloting of a Young Person’s SMART IT and “credit accumulation tool, which will record progress by recording and evidencing gained competencies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n20 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership\n&#xa0;\n"
