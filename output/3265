default&#xa0;defaultBackgrounddefault1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis document is a response to the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee’s consultation about the role of the judiciary if there were a codified constitution.
default It was produced by Northumbria University’s Student Law Think Tank, which is a School of Law student society. The aim of the Student Law Think Tank is to involve students with policy work and get students’ voices heard across society. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAimsdefault2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe aim of this document was for Northumbria University School of Law students to take up the invitation to contribute to the debate about the role of the judiciary if there were a codified constitution.  Whilst some staff 
defaultwere
default involved in helping the proj
defaultect come to fruition the content of the response is entirely the work of the students.  
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis Student Law Think Tank decided to focus upon question 3 of the consultation:
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the UK were to have a codified constitution, what powers should the courts have 
defaultif they held that a piece of legislation was unconstitutional?
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat would be the implications of these powers on existing constitutional doctrines, including parliamentary sovereignty and judicial review?
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the context of question 3, what can we
default learn from the interaction between the UK courts and the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights?
default&#xa0;
defaultApproachdefault4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe comments below were collected over a series of large group meetings over the course of three weeks in which the contents of the response were questioned and debated.  This document is the work of 
default22 students.
default  It takes into account the opinions of all 
defaultof the contributors to the response, and although it has been edited and reformatted, it aims to record both the areas of consensus which were reached as well as reflecting the areas where divergence of opinion emerged.

default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen deciding what powers the Courts should have if they held that a piece of legislation was 
defaultunconstitutional, stud
defaultents of Northumbria University 
defaultfocussed primarily upon two different types of powers:
defaulti)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeclaration of invalidity;
defaultii)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDeclaration of incompatibility. 
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese powers were identified as being the actual powers the Courts should possess when 
defaultdealing with unconstitutional legislation. Below these two powers are discussed on their merits:
defaultDeclaration of invalidity:default  This is the Courts’
default ultimate power in terms of opposing legislation that it deemed to be unconstitutional. A declaration of invali
defaultd
defaultity would represent the Court’s
default view that the legislation is for any reason totally incompatible with the UK constitution and that it should therefore be struck down immediately by way of the Court’s judgment. This power echoes the power of the US Supreme 
defaultCourt in declaring law unconstitutional. 
defaultDeclaration of Incompatibility: defaultThis is a lesser power, but may be preferable in the bulk of instances. A declaration of incompatibility would be used when the Courts rule that legislation, if enacted (or once enac
defaultted), would be incompatible with the UK constitution. The Courts could use this power to inform Parliament that a statute should be rectified to ensure that it compatibility with the constitution. 
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough it was debated whether or not the Courts should p
defaultossess either or both of these powers, it was widely considered that these would be the key powers of a judiciary equipped to deal with a written and codified constitution. 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Think Tank then moved to discuss when and how the Courts would employ these p
defaultowers and as such a number of key questions were raised: 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWhen Would The Above Powers Be Used? default10.
default&#xa0; 
defaultDiscussion centred around two main questions with regards to when the Court would be entitled to exercise the above powers:
default&#xa0;
default11.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClearly each approach has advantages and disadvantages of how they would operate in 
defaultpractice,
default however at this point during the discussion a vote was taken by members on which approach was favoured. This vote was taken under the assumption that Courts 
defaultwould be awarded both the power to declare legislation invalid, and the lesser power of declaring law incompatible with the constitution.
default It was favoured by members that a
defaultllowing the Courts to use the powers 
defaultbefore and afterdefault implementation of
default the legislati
defaulton. 
default&#xa0;
default12.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt was decided that the Courts should be allowed to challenge the law prior to implementation, for example by stating during the House of Lords stage, that it is foreseeable that the law could be unconstitutional if raised as part of a claim. Allowin
defaultg the judiciary to raise any foreseeable issues to Parliament prior to 
defaultimplementation benefits the procedure as a whole as it seeks to maintain clarity in the law. Also the obvious benefit to this approach is that it seeks to prevent challenges in Courts r
defaultesulting from the proposed law after it has been enacted. If the judiciary are able to comment on the law prior to its implementation then it allows both law makers and the judiciary to exchange views and expertise, which in theory should lead to better qu
defaultality legislation. 
default&#xa0;
default13.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt was largely agreed that it was essential that the Courts be able to rule legislation either invalid or incompatible with the constitution in conjunction with judgments on an ad-hoc basis. If the Courts were allowed to exercise this 
defaultpower in regard to declaring a law invalid, then it was decided that the best route for the judiciary would be that the Court could send the law back to Parliament with notes on its concerns over its constitutionality. It was suggested that the Court
default shoul
defaultd
default have the power to impose a time limit on parliament in such an instance, during which time the legislation would, in effect, be temporarily invalid. This method was favoured as a principal power for the Courts, in contrast with allowing the Courts to str
defaultike down l
defaultegislation
default outright. 
defaultWhich Courts/Judges should have the powers to declare legislation incompatible/invalid?default14.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis question resulted from the above discussion. If UK Courts are afforded these powers, which Courts specifically?
defaultWith regard to the first question above, the following issues were addressed by members:
default15.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFirstly, which Co
defaulturt(s) would be afforded the powers to decide on constitutional issues? Discussion mainly focused around the issue of whether a separate Constitutional Court would be required or whether the current Court structure would be able to deal with constitutional
default issues. Members took time to examine the hierarchy of Courts in other jurisdictions which include Constitutional Courts such as 
defaultin 
defaultIreland and South Africa, 
defaulthowever a majority of members were in favour of affording powers to only the Senior Courts (High C
defaultourt and above). One issue raised against this notion was whether the Courts would be able to cope with any increase in caseload brought on by constitutional law actions. Another issue raised was that of established appeal routes and how these would be aff
defaultected by the introduction of a Constitutional Court. With members initially against the 
defaultintroduction of a separate Constitutional Court it was decided that actions on constitutional matters should be issued initially in the High Court. 
default&#xa0;
default16.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe introduction o
defaultf a Constitutional Court was not ruled out by members however. It was unanimously agreed that any such Court would have to sit at the same level as the UK Supreme Court in terms of hierarchy, given the powers it would possess. The main points of discussion
default on the necessity for a Constitutional Court were as follows:
default&#xa0;
default17.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA lot of discussion centred on
default what type of judgment should be given by the Court in relation to constitutional issues. The types of judgments discussed ranged from a simple majority or whether a super majority
default 
defaultwould be favoured,
default for example
default mirroring that of the criminal jury system. 
defaultAgain, members thought it best to take a vote to decide which approach is favoured. Due to the inherent importance of constitutional issues, it was held by the majority that a super majority of judgments was the preferred method. Continuity and clarity in 
defaultthe constitution would also be positive aspects of this method.
default&#xa0;
default18.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe next discussion point was, in a Constitutional Court, how many judges would sit as a panel. Again, by majority, it was held that a panel should mimic that of the Supreme Court; therefore 
defaulta panel ranging between 5-9 judges should sit depending upon the importance of the constitutional issue.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFinally, members debated the type of majority req
defaultuired in a panel judgment when
default the Court has the power to make declarations on the constitutionality 
defaultof legislation. This issue was hotly debated wi
defaultth many members having different
default views. Those in fav
defaultour of publishing all the judge
defaults
default’
default decisions and judgments believed that it was crucial for the public to be able to read obiter statements and reasoning behi
defaultnd the decisions. However, it was marginally decided that due to the nature of the constitution as entrenched law, single judgments would be more appropriate as it would maintain the clarity in the law and allow the law to be 
defaultunderstandable and more easily
default applicable in other cases that come before the Courts. It was thought that publishing dissenting judgments in constitutional cases would lead to an increase in actions and appeals.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFollowing this discussion, the majority of members remained unconvinced t
defaulthat a written and codified UK constitution would necessitate the introduction of a separate Constitutional Court, although the introduction of a separate constitutional division of the High Court was favoured.
default&#xa0;
defaultChapter 
default3
default: Response to question 3a  
default&#xa0;
default21.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMembers predominantly looked at four key constitutional doctrines 
defaultthey
default felt could be affected by the granting of powers to the Courts: 
defaultParliamentary Supremacy:
default22.
default&#xa0; 
default‘The principle o
defaultf Parliamentary sovereignty mean neither more nor less than this, namely that Parliament thus defined has, under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatever: and, further, that no person or body is recognised by the law of Englan
defaultd as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.’ —
defaultA.V. Dicey
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution
default&#xa0;
default(1885)
default&#xa0;
default23.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe conclusion reached in 
defaultrelation to parliamentary supremacy was that 
defaultif the powers discussed above were granted to the C
defaultourts that the doctrine of supremacy would be 
defaultadversely impacted
default. The main concern in this area was that the power of the Courts to challenge laws created by 
defaultP
defaulta
defaultrliament would impact upon the traditional doctrine that it is f
defaultree to create any law it wishes, and that the Courts cannot challenge a parliamentary enactment.
default  It was felt that the impact upon the doctrine would depend heavily upon the exact powers given
default to the Courts to challenge the unconstitutional piece of legislation. If the Courts had the power to effectively declare a piece of legislation completely invalid as discussed above then it was concluded that the impact of this power upon the doctrine wou
defaultld be quite significant as it would effectively allow the Court to curtail the powers of Parliament in creating laws. It was felt that if the Courts were given the power to simply declare a piece of legislation incompatible and required Parliament to 
defaultchang
defaulte the unconstitutional piece of law to be compatible with the constitution then this would have less of a direct effect on the doctrine itself. 
default&#xa0;
default24.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt was felt that there was a more fundamental problem in relation 
defaultto parliamentary supremacy beyond
default the impact
default any powers granted to the Courts under a codified constitution would have. The main point raised and set out here was that the creation of a codified constitution itself would have a direct impact upon the doctrine as it is difficult to see how the doctri
defaultne would continue to exist and be justified when Parliament would be forced to ensure that any laws created by itself fell in line with the constitution which would need to be entrenched to ensure its continued effectiveness and operation. 
defaultA new constituti
defaultonal settlement would be required, setting out the powers of each of the three branches of the state. 
defaultThe Rule of Law:
default25.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt was felt and concluded by members that set powers for the Courts in relation to protecting the constitution would help to reinforce the doctrine of the rule of law in that it would more clearly set out the powers of the Courts. One issue that was forese
defaulten in relation to this doctrine was the status of the constitution in terms of what Dicey referred to as ‘ordinary law’. 
defaultIf there was a codified constitution this would remove the issue of ‘ordinary law’ by creating a hierarchy of laws stemming from the co
defaultnstitution. This would enforce Lord Bingham’s view that law 
defaultmust be accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable
default.
defaultSeparation of Powers:
default26.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAgain it was felt that any further powers given to the Courts to challenge any unconstitutional
default legislation would help to further protect the doctrine of the separation of powers. In conclusion it was decided that any further clarification of the powers of the legislature, government and the judiciary helped to further the doctrine and ensure that t
defaulthe power
defaults possessed by the 3 branches w
defaultere set out more clearly and effectively. Furthermore it was noted by members that affording more power to the judiciary may 
defaultresult in a better
default balance to a system of checks and balances which is heavily weighted towa
defaultrds the legislature 
defaultand the executive currently. 
defaultJudicial 
defaultR
defaulteview:
default27.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn relation to judicial review it was concluded that the doctrine would not be seriously affected by any powers given to the Courts in relation to challenging unconstitutional legislation. 
defaultIt was felt that there should be no reason why the powers of the Court in relation to a codified constitution should not allow Courts 
defaultto deal with unconstitutional decision making processes of public bodies, hence further increasing the power of the doctri
defaultne of judicial review. It was mooted that the power to challenge the actual decision rather than the decision making process as is currently the case under judicial review could simply be the next organic evolution of the doctrine, especially when one cons
defaultiders the European 
defaultCourt of Human Rights’
default approach of increasing judicial scrutiny of public bodies.
default 
defaultArticle 13 ECHR
default requires that n
defaultational legal systems must provide an effective remedy for breach of Convention rights
default in that the 
defaultEuropean Court 
defaulthas found 
default(several times) that judicial review 
defaultmay not be an effective remedy because cannot investigate merits
default. As such it was felt that a new basis for judicial review could be created similar to the 
defaultincompatibility with convention rights
default basis by having an
default incomp
defaultatibility with the constitution
default basis. 
default&#xa0;
defaultChapter 
default4
default: Response to question 3b
default&#xa0;
default28.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe m
defaultembers 
defaultdiscussed numerous reference points in this area
default, for example
default,
default single judgments
default 
defaultfrom the European institutions. The following were discussed
default the most:
defaulti.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf a
default Constitutional Court
default was
default introduced to the UK, 
defaultshould 
defaultspecialist chambers be formed within it to assure judgments remained clear and properly informed?
defaultii.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf, like in the USA, it was made very difficult to alter the constitution itself, how would the UK cope
default with European directives etc
default.
default and associated timelines?
default&#xa0;
default29.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt was noted that now might be the best time to codify the UK constitution, given the amount of guidance we have already gained from the European institutions, both on EU law and the law of human ri
defaultghts. Some members felt that codifying the UK constitution and entrenching it would create the potential for conflict with the European institutions in situations where the UK constitution was itself incompatible with the European Convention on Human Right
defaults or EU Law. By definition the content of the constitution would be much more difficult to change than traditional statute law. One suggestion for preventing such problems was to include a system of fast-tracking the concerns of the EU and the Convention w
defaulthereby changes to the UK constitution necessary to comply with the European institutions could be made much more quickly.
default 
defaultAll other EU countries and members of the Council of Europe have written constitutions and as such there could be much to learn from t
defaultheir approaches on this issue.
