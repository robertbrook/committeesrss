defaultThe views presented here are entirely my own. They are informed by over 30 years

defaultexperience in a NI based bank, an element of academic challenge and a long term interest in current affairs,

default 
default&#xa0;
defaultFrom the late 1980’s to 2000 when I retired I worked on a number of projects including what became Post Office Financial Services, the joint venture between Bank of Ireland and Post Office. As part of the work-based element of
default 
defaultOpen Unive
defaultrsity
default 
defaultMBA I also documented several other change initiatives which I was involved in.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMy starting point is that 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNorthern Ireland is not a discrete nor self
default-
default contained marketplace,
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultF
defaultinancial institutions do not require a physical presence in NI to service either personal or business/corporate customers. 
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe essentially personal/ micro-small business nature of the marketplace is not attractive to ‘challenger’ banks -Barclays came to N
defaultI when it re-branded Woolwich Building Society, my recollection is that HSBC similarly re-branded another existing group business.

defaultectively zombies and the 4
defaultth
default a poorly performing subsidiary of a Danish bank
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe future structure &amp; governance of banking in NI will be
default largely 
defaultdictated by the outworking of EC/EU State Aids programmes, not solely by bank management or national politicians
default.
default Local politicians will struggle to find effective voices.

default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe four major high street banks operating in NI all are owned externally.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal management
default has limited discretion and is more likely to be involved in administering Group /Corporate policy set in Dublin, Copenhagen or London/Edinburgh.

defaultThree of the four
default high street banks

default.
default5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAlthough Santander for example has a high street presence its NI business customers will have their accounts handled by business banking centres in Glasgow or Newport or London in exactly the same way as any other customer anywhere in the UK and su
defaultbject to exactly the same terms &amp; conditions, charges eligibility &amp; lending criteria. 
default6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe major issue in NI banking is that, bar the Progressive Building Society, there are no locally headquartered 
defaultfinancial services business and therefore no local contro
defaultl of policy.
default7)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe NI banking market has traditionally operated on the basis of cross-border / all-Ireland structures. 
default8)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis model is 
defaultnow 
defaulteffectively dead 
defaultlargely
default for reasons of politics &amp;
default economic nationalism arising out of the need for EU/ECB funding to rescue both the Irish banks &amp; state. 
default9)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis situation arose out of a failure of regulation leading Irish banks to over-extend themselves 
defaultboth 
defaultdomestically &amp; externally.
default10)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis mistake will no
defaultt be repeated, 
defaultpolitical and public opinion will not tolerate 
defaultregulators in ROI
default allowing the
default major 
defaulttax-payer rescued 
default‘pillar’ banks allocating scare capital to support business in 
defaultoutside the state
default a
defaultt the expense of business &amp; individuals within the state.
default11)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere will 
defaultalso be political, business public &amp; social pressure on ROI banks to focus on their domestic market and support local economic growth and development. This is not a narrow political point. In the UK we see the mirror image of this in the withdr
defaultawal of RBS/Lloyds for example from overseas markets and market segments nationally &amp; internationally.
default12)
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe must also recognize the different political &amp; legislative trajectories within &amp; between the UK &amp; Ireland and specifically issues arising from 
defaultregulatory developments within the Eurozone sub-set of countries within the EU and the UK focus on re-negotiations/ opt-outs/ subsidiarity etc.
default13)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe practical consequences for NI are likely to be concentration
default of banking in fewer players, l
defaultess choice, less 
defaultcompetition and higher costs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank.default&#xa0;default14)
default&#xa0; 
defaultResolution of this issue is not solely or even substantially in the hands of RBS management nor UK politicians - 
defaultsomething which seems almost entirely missing from much public debate! 
default15)
default&#xa0; 
defaultYou should note that the EC has recently allowed Bank of Ireland to retain an insurance operation in Republic of Ireland which it had previously decided should be disposed of as a cond
defaultition of State Aid. The EC rationale for this was that there were no realistic buyers for the business in the market.
default16)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe quid pro quo is that BOI must shed its corporate &amp; business banking activities in GB either through run-down or by sale
default 
defaultalthough it i
defaults able to
default 
defaultretain
default 
defaultthose in NI.
default 
defaultThe NI businesses are now exposed in that there will be loss of scope &amp; scale in service provision.
default17)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt should also be noted that the BoI is now focusing on serving 
defaultpersonal business only 
defaultin GB through Post Office Financial 
defaultServices (POFS)
default 
defaultdelivered through PO branches &amp; supported by centralised deposit &amp; lending administration and on-line banking
default 
default18)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe precedent has also been set &amp; the next revision of State Aid for BoI (&amp; there will almost inevitably be one) could require 
defaultthe disposal of its NI corporate &amp; business banking. This would leave the rump of its personal business which could be serviced via POFS. 
default19)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe bank stake in POFS is a saleable asset in the last resort &amp; is now a hostage to fortune in that disposal may be m
defaultandated by EC/EU. The possibility of BoI exiting NI is no longer unthinkable.
default20)
default&#xa0; 
defaultI cannot comment on the status of Allied Irish/First Trust businesses other than to note that there were apparently no buyers when the business was put on the market a number of 
defaultyears ago. Given that Allied Irish remains subject to EC/EU State Aids considerations then that business may also be vulnerable
default regardless of public positions taken by management.
default21)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn this context the price of future State Aid approvals for RBS may well be 
defaultdisposal of at least 
defaultthe Ulster Bank business in RoI regardless of the ‘good bank/bad bank’ arguments propounded by politicians/RBS executive management/board.
default22)
default&#xa0; 
defaultEC rules cannot 
defaulthowever 
defaultprevent individual customers opting to remain with their 
defaultcurrent bank regardless of whether or not ’their branch’ is sold. 
default23)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe best forward-looking solution would seem to be to encourage the full absorption of the Ulster Bank NI business into RBS proper w
defaulthere it would benefit from the full resources of RBS unmediated by a ‘local’ headquarters.
default24)
default&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the lack of buyers for more substantial branch networks being disposed of by
default both
default Lloyds &amp; RBS disposal 
defaultof the Ulster Bank business in NI would not seem to be 
defaulta realistic option.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporationdefault&#xa0;
default25)
default&#xa0; 
defaultI do not know enough about this issue to comment but difficult to see as a significant forward-looking issue
default, 
defaultunfortunate as it may be for the individuals involved. Matters would seem to revolve around employment law &amp; the basis on which Anglo Irish/IBRC operated in the UK 
default&#xa0;
default4 Access to finance particularly for SME’s, default5 Lack of effectiveness of national defaultinitiatives to help aid economic recoverydefault6 Lack of availability of detailed regional lending datadefault&#xa0;
default26)
default&#xa0; 
defaultI regard these issues as being intimately linked. 
default27)
default&#xa0; 
defaultMy recollection is that the NI banks were never more than ‘bit players’ in national ’trade’
default bodies such as British Bankers Association/APACs etc.
default28)
default&#xa0; 
defaultGiven their scope &amp; scale they would tend to be policy takers rather than makers.
default29)
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor that reason I suspect that national initiatives would receive only ‘lip service’ - the minimum necessary &amp; no more.
default Stats will show that use of for example SFLGS by NI banks was pathetic
default,
default the preference being to focus on own in-house products rather than develop the processes &amp; practices &amp; staff training
default 
defaultnecessary to support such initiatives, 
defaultsuch lack of support 
defaultin t
defaulturn stifle
defaultd
default demand - a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy in a sense!
default30)
default&#xa0; 
defaultMy understanding is that much business lending remains in effect asset backed lending
default, security over assets first then looking at profitability &amp; repayment capacity
default 
default31)
default&#xa0; 
defaultFor so long as there is a significant overhang of property, whether warehoused in 
defaultNAMA or elsewhere, then property values will remain under pressure and represent a significant constraint on business lending. 
default32)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn these circumstances access to national init
defaultiatives based for example on partial Govt guarantees for otherwise unsecured 
default&amp; cash-flow based 
defaultbusiness lending will remain essential. 
default33)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe overwhelming proportion of businesses
default 
defaultin NI are in the micro to small category and more likely to benefit from or re
defaultquire cash-flow based rather than asset backed lending. Past experience of SFLGS does not offer much comfort in this respect.
default34)
default&#xa0; 
defaultI think the point needs to be made that ‘SME’s’ are not a single market with common needs. 
default35)
default&#xa0; 
defaultMany SME’s in the micro to small categ
defaultory will be largely locally orientated with substantial demand for transaction handling services - cash/ cheques/card payments - which are expensive to provide and largely unprofitable for banks
default36)
default&#xa0; 
defaultAny borrowing requirements
default 
defaultwill be relatively small and only
default marginally profitable once all admin &amp; overhead costs are considered 
default37)
default&#xa0; 
defaultParadoxically many large businesses operating in NI will have similar profile - transaction-based needs for electronic payments of salaries &amp; wages, suppliers, &amp; receipt of payments wit
defaulth minimum local overnight balances with borrowings /deposits
default 
defaultlargely managed by corporate treasury &amp; held in GB based branches
default38)
default&#xa0; 
defaultBusinesses in the small to medium category are likely to have the more complex needs not just for transaction services but cash 
defaultflow lending (overdrafts) and capital investment (term loans/ equity/venture capital finance, trade related financing. 
default39)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis should /could be a profitable mix for banks but unfortunately banks have spent the last 20 years or so paying extolling the virtues
default of relationship banking whilst at the same time promoting financial promiscuity - by which I mean offering stand-alone products to non-current account holders
default.
default40)
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhilst this promiscuity does bring competition to the market it also fractures the ‘relationshi
defaultp’ model with no 
defaultbank having a clear overall picture of business needs hence driving the imperative for asset based lending and even then there may be differing views as to which lender has prior claim over which assets, all of which acts to constrain lend
defaulting limits
default41)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is no excuse for excluding lending from the proposed post code reporting. How will direct banks with no physical presence in NI report their figures? 
default42)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIf Santander/Tesco/Sainsbury /M&amp;S/First Direct/ for example all report their UK 
defaultlending 
defaultby post code then the ’unclassified’ stuff could be considered NI by default (I know it won’t be that simple but deduction by exception is possible!) 
default43)
default&#xa0; 
defaultRegional lending data must be made available otherwise 
defaultpublic policy making 
defaultwill occur in a partial vacuu
defaultm and risks being uninformed. 
default44)
default&#xa0; 
defaultLikewise banks themselves will be acting in a vacuum, making assumptions about the potential market for financial services which may not be realistic (there are both upsides &amp; downsides to this)
default&#xa0;
defaultAccess to banking in rural codefaultmmunitiesdefault&#xa0;default45)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis is I am afraid essentially yesterday’s issue.
default46)
default&#xa0; 
defaultBranches have been closing for years &amp; the trend - visible across the UK &amp; Europe - will continue and indeed is accelerating. I believe that recent stats based on research 
defaultb
defaulty a UK university confirm this but may not show that rural communities are being anymore affected by this than deprived urban communities.
default47)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt needs to be recognized that t
defaulthe role of the branch has changed over the years, currently configured largely as ‘sa
defaultles outlets’ even that function is becoming redundant with much marketing/sales /account servicing being done remotely by phone /on-line or social media. Salaries &amp; wages &amp; benefits have been paid electronically for decades
default. It is stated Govt policy to enc
defaultourage payment into accounts – the basic bank account is an outrun of this. 
defaultFinancial inclusion policy is about bank accounts for all not dependence on cash transactions.
default48)
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn increasing number of transactions are by card &amp; card technology is changing almost
default by the day. No-one any more has a need to visit a branch
default49)
default&#xa0; 
defaultRecent entrants to the NI personal financial services market - Tesco, Sainsbury &amp; M&amp; S for example- use their supermarket outlets as service points.
default50)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe example of the BOI /Post Office joint venture
default is relevant here with cash transactions available through Post Offices/ATM‘s etc, not branches.
default 
default51)
default&#xa0; 
defaultAll other services including accounting transaction processing, credit scoring for personal lending including mortgages, personal loans &amp; credit cards can be
default centralised &amp; handled remotely.
default52)
default&#xa0; 
defaultEven business lending seems increasingly based on ’credit scoring’ principles.
default53)
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is strange to note however than in respect of investment advice ‘past performance is no guarantee of or guide to future performance’ whereas 
defaultbehaviour based credit 
defaultscoring relies precisely on extrapolating past performance to predict future behaviour
default54)
default&#xa0; 
default‘Relationship banking’ no longer seems to require face to face contact being replaced by contact by phone/internet/social media channels - the tra
defaultditional branch has no future and only a limited lifespan.
default55)
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe issue should really be about adapting to new reality rather than preserving the past.
