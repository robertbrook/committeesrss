"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Linkage Community TrustSummaryAlthough Linkage Community Trust are not aware of any of our own service users being particularly affected by housing costs in the reformed welfare system, we are conscious that the impacts on vulnerable people with learning disabilities and th\neir families who live in social housing are being felt far and wide across the country.\nWe have become aware of several initiatives which are being used to support vulnerable people to afford to stay in their homes. These initiatives are outlined in more d\netail in our full response. \nThey clearly highlight the resistance from front-line workers and Local Authorities to the incoming welfare changes, which are seemingly proving more costly to implement and enforce than the previous system. \n&#xa0;\nResponse1. Local authority funding mechanisms1.1.\n \nWe have been made aware that s\nome social workers with real initiative have found a way round some of the \nsocial sector size criteria\n issues. \nUnder the charging system for social care \npeople\n are assessed as to whether they\n need to\n make a co\nntribution towards the service under the Fair Access to Care\n \nServices criteria (\nFACS\n)\n.   \nAny service user who receives housing benefit and has\n a\n bedroom supplement to pay\n,\n i.e. the housing benefit\n is less \nthan the rent\n so the tenant has to pay the \ndifference, can have the top-\nup amount set \nagainst\n the L\nocal \nA\nuthority\n financial assessment. This reduces the contribution they have to make because it should reduce their fairer charge by the same amount as the t\nop-up. \nT\nhey\n \nare able\n to calculate the top-up and then ask the finance \ndepartment\n at the L\nocal \nA\nuthority\n for this to be taken into account.\n \n&#xa0;\n2. Social sector size criteria2.1. \nWe are aware that s\nome \nLocal A\nuthorities are taking another approach. \nFor \nexample, i\nf\n two\n people are living in \nthree\n bedroom soci\nal\n housing accommodation,\n \nthe Local Authority\n \nhas\n re\n-\ndesignated one room as a study. \nT\nhis is because the Local Authority\n ha\ns\n decided that the cost of rehousing would be greater than finding a way roun\nd the \nsocial sector size criteria or ‘\nbedroom tax\n’\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Our own experiences3.1 \nLinkage Community Trust had one service user who moved into a 2-bedroom property in February 2013 as he required sleep-in staff due to his needs. The recent changes to \nhousing benefits may have affected him but, due to staff incurring extra utility costs, Linkage only charged this service user the 1-bedro\nom rent fee to compensate this.\nAlthough most of our service users live in 1-bedroom properties, we are anticipating t\nhat those service users in 2-bed accommodation may be affected by the changes to housing-related benefits in the near future as they are re-assessed for housing benefits. This is because their current housing benefi\nts applications are historical.\n&#xa0;\n23 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
