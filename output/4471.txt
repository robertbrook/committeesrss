[[[1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Population ageing is one of the most significant trends of the 21st century. It has important and far-reaching implications for all aspects of society. By 2050, there will be more over-60s worldwide than children under 15. 

[[[2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Population ageing is progressing fastest in developing countries, including those that have a large population of young people. Of the 15 countries that currently have more than 10 million older people, seven are developing countries. 

[[[3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Population ageing has an important gender dimension. Women and men age differently, with women living on average 3-5 years longer than men. 

[[[4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lifetime inequalities of income, education, employment, health and gender are likely to increase with age. Issues of equality and equity are therefore essential to the wellbeing of older people with disabilities, as they are to other age groups. Tackling inequalities through policy, practice and monitoring is therefore crucial to sustaining development progress and improving the wellbeing and capabilities of current and future generations of older people. &#xa0;

[[[5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Age, gender, socio-economic status, physical and cognitive health, and psychosocial factors have all been identified as key determinants of disability. The ageing process may increase economic vulnerability, as it reduces the framework of capacity for individuals, accumulating their disadvantage and making their escape from chronic poverty less likely. Reduced physical and mental capacity arising from the ageing process is also potentially a cause of chronic intergenerational poverty. 

[[[6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Older people may not self-identify as having a disability – considering failing sight, hearing and decreasing mobility as natural accompaniments to ageing. Increased levels of functional disability and lower rates of labour force participation may lead to a reduced capacity to earn an income as people grow older, resulting in economic vulnerability in old age. Barely one fifth of the world’s older population is in receipt of a secure pension. The consequences of this vulnerability are not limited to older people only, but may be shared by their families and a significant proportion of the wider population. For example, in Bangladesh, nearly one third of the general population live in households containing an older person. 

[[[7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Injuries in older people, particularly those caused by falls, are often unrecorded but are frequent. They may start a downward spiral in health status, resulting in death or long-term care needs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 28-35 per cent of people over the age of 65 fall each year and injure themselves, increasing to 32-42 per cent of those aged more than 70 years. Falls may lead to post-fall syndrome, which includes increased dependence, loss of autonomy, confusion, immobilisation and depression.

[[[8]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Poverty in old age has a strong gender dimension. Older women are more likely to lose their partner, and less likely to remarry. Lower education levels and the need to combine work with childcare means that women are more likely to work in the informal sector and are often paid less than men, with the result that they are likely to have lower pension income in older age. WHO has found that particular groups of older women are more at risk of poverty in all countries, including those who are widowed, divorced or with disabilities, and those caring for grandchildren and children orphaned by AIDS. Older women may be subject to extreme sexual violence and encounter discrimination and exclusion on account of their age and gender. 

[[[9]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Securing a sustainable livelihood is a challenge for over 180 million older people in low- and middle-income countries who live in poverty, with no savings, assets or pensions. Research in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Tanzania found that older people have only limited access to microfinance institutions (MFIs) and banks. Inconsistent information about formal savings and loan services, including MFIs, further discourages older people. 

[[[10]]]&#xa0; A range of studies demonstrates that effective ways to reach older women and men who are disabled and living in poverty is by ensuring income security through social protection and livelihoods support. This needs to be combined with effective, appropriate, safe and affordable healthcare, backed up by robust information services, citizen guarantees and a reliable complaints system to ensure entitlements are upheld.  

[[[11]]]&#xa0; Lack of data disaggregated by age is a critical issue. In 2013, HelpAge constructed the first global index to&#xa0;rank countries by how well their ageing populations are faring. Based on four key enablers of older people's wellbeing – income, health, employment and education, and enabling environment – the Global AgeWatch Index uses data from a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The construction of the Index has highlighted a serious lack of data in key domains and geographical regions including Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. The Index explores the difference between years lived in good health and years lost through disability. Further work is needed on the collection of quality data on disability in later life.&#xa0;

[[[Prevalence and nature of disability in agein]]]

[[[g populations]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[12]]]&#xa0; Ageing is associated with a higher probability of living with a disability. Worldwide, of nearly 810 million people aged 60 or over (11 per cent of the world’s population), more than 46 per cent live with disabilities. More than 250 million older people experience moderate to severe disability. Disabled people are ageing, and disability in older age is a consequence of accumulated health risks across a lifespan of disease, injury and chronic illness. Key causes of old-age disability are visual impairment, hearing loss, dementia and osteoarthritis. While the link between ageing and impairment is inevitable, there is a less direct link between ageing and disability. The key factors that stop impairment becoming disability are access to healthcare and an enabling environment (such as appropriate housing, care and transport). However, these interventions are often not available in low- and middle-income countries. As a result, many older people, even with impairments such as hearing or eyesight problems that can be resolved at little cost, are disabled. 

[[[13]]]&#xa0; In 2011, the first-ever High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases recognised ageing as one of the four drivers of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, in 2010 accounting for 34.5 million of the 52.8 million deaths worldwide, with 80 per cent of these deaths occurring in the poorest countries. Some 75 per cent of deaths from NCDs in low- and middle-income countries occur in people over 60. The 2011 World report on disability reports that people with disabilities are at risk of premature ageing and those with developmental disabilities show signs of ageing in their 40s and 50s. 

[[[14]]]&#xa0; Older men and women in developing countries are more likely to have a disability than those living in developed countries, with older women tending to have higher levels of disability. This may be partially explained by their having less access to healthcare over the life course. There are also significant barriers to accessing affordable and appropriate healthcare, even when health conditions can be managed at low cost and interventions would make significant differences to families and individuals. Currently there are more than 40 million older people in developing countries with significant hearing impairment, 32.5 million with significant visual impairment from cataracts, and 39.8 million with significant visual impairment from refractive errors.

[[[15]]]&#xa0; Dementia is probably the greatest cause of years lost to disability worldwide. The total number of new cases of dementia each year worldwide is nearly 7.7 million, equivalent to one new case every four seconds. The total number of people with dementia worldwide in 2010 is estimated at 36 million. The number is projected to nearly double every 20 years, to 66 million in 2030 and 115 million in 2050. Critically, by 2050, over 70 per cent of dementia cases will be in the developing world.

[[[16]]]&#xa0; Disability incurs major costs to people and families, as well as health systems. The total estimated worldwide costs of dementia in 2010 were US$604 billion, approximately 1 per cent of global GDP. In developing countries, direct social care costs are small, with costs of informal care (unpaid care provided by the family) predominating. Dementia is overwhelming not only for those that have it but also for their carers and families.

[[[Age and disability in emergencies]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[17]]]&#xa0; Older people often make up a high proportion of people living in displacement camps. For example, in Gulu District, Northern Uganda, 65 per cent of people still living in displaced people’s camps in 2009 were aged over 60. In crises, older women are subject to gender-based intimidation, including sexual violence and rape.

[[[18]]]&#xa0; Even though older and disabled people make important contributions to their families and communities, their needs and capacities continue to be widely overlooked at all stages of emergency responses. This was first highlighted in a 2010 review of the Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP). The review showed that fewer than 5 per cent of the projects proposed for recent crises made any reference to older people as a vulnerable group. Fewer than 1 per cent of proposed projects and only 0.2 per cent of funded projects included activities targeted towards older people. Further research on humanitarian funding targeted at older people and people with disabilities in 2010 and 2011 showed similar results, with less than 1 per cent of humanitarian aid targeting these two groups. 

[[[19]]]&#xa0; Recent research on the impact of the crisis in Syria conducted by HelpAge International and Handicap International illustrates challenges encountered by older people and people with disabilities at the various stages of the emergency.

[[[20]]]&#xa0; In contexts of displacement, the protection challenges for older and disabled people fall into three main areas – being left behind, being more dependent and vulnerable, and facing increased risks due to reduced capacity to adapt and to respond to information. Older people who are left behind lack support and protection. Besides facing isolation, they are more exposed to physical risk or harm than younger, able-bodied people who have fled and are better able to protect and support themselves. Older people, especially older women, may also find themselves with small children in their care but little means of protecting and fending for them. For older people who are able to flee, a new environment can make them more dependent. Increased dependency, combined with stretched or reduced family support, can exacerbate their experience of neglect, discrimination and violence. Visual or sensory disabilities can present obstacles to accessing information about the emergency, the changing security situation, and the availability of humanitarian assistance and rights protection services. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Sightsavers, HelpAge International, ADD and Alzheimer’s Disease International, We can also make change, 2013, a briefing based on We can also make change, a report from Voices of the Marginalised, a research project in Bangladesh, p.9&#xa0;&#xa0;World Health Organization research based on The Global Burden of Disease: 2004 update, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2008 Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and Oxfam International, “Now, the world is without me”: An investigation of sexual violence in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Cambridge MA and Oxford, 2010December 2013
