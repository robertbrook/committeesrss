default quality patient information and e

defaults can reduce the chance of developing lymphoedema or limit its consequences (

default). This approach is reliant on both healthcare professionals and those at risk knowing about the
default 
defaultcondition and risk reduction factors. The LSN produces a wide range of patient information that is available via NHS Choices and the Information prescription initiative. Patients who are in contact with the LSN report that many GPs and community and hospital nurses have an alarming lack of knowledge about the condition and it is certainly true that the recognition, prevention and management of lymphoedema is not a priority in nursing, medical or physiotherapy training programmes. Last year the LSN commissioned

defaultTreatmentdefaultAlthough lymphoedema is not currently a curable condition

default treatmen
defaultt
defaults are available to reduce and control the associated swelling and skin changes and reduce the

defaultKo DSC et al (1998) Effective treatment of lymphoedema of the 
defaultextremities
default. Atch surgery; 133; 452-458). 
defaultThese treatments include
default: 
default- External compression – via multi-layer bandaging, intermittent pneumatic compression devices and, most commonly, compression garments.
default- Skin care
default- Exercise and movement
default- Specialised massage – manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) or a 
defaultself-administered
default version of this called simple lymphatic drainage (SLD)

defaultEmerging technologiesdefaultNo drug therapies have proven to be consistently effective for most types of lymphoedema. 
defaultA number of important new technologies are being developed which will influence the future management of the condition – these include genetic, new methods of compression, surgical techniques such as lymph node transplants, liposuction and low level laser therapy.
default&#xa0;default4.1 
defaultCellulitisdefaultDue to the impact on the immune system that lymphoedema has
default,
default the most common complication of lymphoedema is cellulitis. This serious infection is a significant burden on the National Health Service. NHS Choices states that 
default‘
defaultIn England in 2009, around 80,000 people were
default&#xa0;
defaultadmitted to hospital as a result of cellulitis.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe number of annual cases of cellulitis has increased three-fold over the past 15 years.’ The cost of hospital admission for cellulitis in Derbyshire, Nottingham and Lincolnshire was approximately £4.1 million in one year against a population of 
defaultApprox.
default 2.5 million. An average admission for cellulitis associated with lymphoedema 
defaultin the previously mentioned Wandsworth study was 12 days and an estimated cost of £2,300.

defaultImpact on the individualdefaultStudies have demonstrated the significant impact lymphoedema has on the lives of those living with it (

default graphically demonstrated these issues. A 63 year old gentleman developed lymphoedema as a complication of long term venous leg disease – for 18 months his case had been overseen by the community nursing team who had struggled to manage extensive ulceration. Lymphorrhea and the emotional, physical and social burden of illness that the gentleman was living with. He was finally referred to a specialist lymphoedema service with the patient identified goals at commencement of treatment being ‘to stop smelly fluid leaking from my legs, to be able to play with my children again, to reduce my pain, to be able to get back to work and stop claiming benefits
default 
defaultand to get my life back’. The cost of his medical treatment over these 18 months had been £20,560 and this did not include his benefits or other social costs. Following just 9 sessions of treatment, at a total cost of £1,041 the gentleman’s legs were no longer leaking, his pain was significantly reduced, his swelling had reduced from the original 63% larger to just 5% larger, he had been reinstated to his job and was no longer claiming benefits, he said he had his life back! – he also required no visits from community nursing teams and was being supported in his 
defaulton-going
default management by his GP.

defaultLack of appropriate initial ass4essment and treatment as well as a failure to support long term management is undoubtedly costing the NHS both in direct terms and in staff time and resources as well as causing many lymphoedema patients to be claiming benefits and needing significant social services input due to reduced mobility, pain and infection.
