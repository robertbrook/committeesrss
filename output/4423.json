"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by World Vision UK&#xa0;World Vision is the world's largest international children's charity. We are \na child focused Christian relief, development and advocacy organisation dedicated to working with children, their families and communities to overcome poverty and injustice. \nWe\n work in 100 countries to improve the lives of 100 million people worldwide.  \n&#xa0;\nWe welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Committee on\n World Vision’s approach to \ndisability-inclusive programming.\n&#xa0;\nSummary1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApproximately 15% of the global population live with some form of impairment\n. People with disabilities, and children in particular, \nface an array of challenges. They are disproportionally likely to live in poverty and experience \nhigher\n rates of violence and abuse. Often stigmatised by their communities, they are denied access to v\nital services such as an education and healthcare. \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBy neglecting to include children with impairments in the development process, \ntheir risk of vulnerability increases\n. \nTherefore, to lift individual\ns\n and \ncommunities out of poverty, it is essential to inc\nlude adults and children with disabilities in development interventions. Attention must be targeted towards breaking down the social barriers experienced by individuals and equip them \nwith tools \nto \nbe able to \nactively participate in their own development. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK Department for International Development had once made disability-inclusive programming a key priority\n. However, it has slipped down the agenda. For instance, l\nack of disaggregated data on DFID programmes makes it \nhard \nto see if the department is truly having an impact on the lives of those with disabilities, or are even including them in \nprojects. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the recent highlighting of disability issues by DFID, and Lynne Featherstone MP in particular. This must turn i\nnto practical action, inc\nl\nuding f\nunding \nbeing made\n available to \nenable \nDFID and its partners the resource to mainstream disability across all their programmes and to better measure disability-inclusive impact. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUNICEF estimates for every 1 child that is k\nilled as a consequence of armed violence, 3 children are left with permanent, life-long injuries or disabilities\n. Therefore, in fragile contexts \nefforts must be made to ensure children and adults with disabilities are not ‘forgotten victims’\n in the event of natural disasters or conflicts but instead are considered and included in all preparedness and recovery plans.   \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;A need for UK Government to focus on disability&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt \nWorld Vision \nwe \nseek the sustained well-being of children within their families and communities, especially the most vulnerable. \nC\nhildren \nand adults \nwith disabilities are \noften \namong the most vulnerable people in the communities \nin which we work\n. \nIn World Vision’s latest \nresearch on Most Vulnerable Children programming, both child and adult respondents identified children with disabilities (CWDs) among groups of most vulnerable children\n. \nThe\nre are a range of causes of vulnerability including:\n poverty, lack of opportunitie\ns, deprivation of rights, serious stigma and discrimination, inaccessibility to facilities and services\n such as education and healthcare\n, lack of self-confidence\n. \n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChildren with disabilities are also more vulnerable to abusive relationships\n. For example\n in Kenya\n \nit was estimated that 15-20% of CWDs experience \ngrave \nlevels of physical and sexual violence\n.\n \nN\natural disasters \nand conflicts \ncan also increase the vulnerability \nwhere\n, for example,\n physical impairments may cause individuals to be less mobile. \nThe UN committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has described individuals with disabilities currently living and fleeing Syria were the ‘forgotten victims’ of the conflict\n. They have become extremely vulnerable and face grave violations of the\nir rights as they struggle to access essential services. \nEmergency response programmes aren’t always well catered for people with disabilities (PWDs)\n either\n. \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nApproximately 15% of the global population live with some form of impairment\n,\n \nwith\n p\neople with \ndisabilities\n, children in particular, disproportionately more likely to live in poverty\n. \nThe inter-linkages between poverty and disability\n have been \nwidely \nacknowledged and \nalso \nfeature \nin the \nUK government’s \ndisability strategies, most noticeably the \nDep\nartment for International Development (DFID) \nDisability, poverty and development\n.\n \nHowever, \nit is also recognised\n that these groups are often excluded from development processes\n.T\nhe statistics \naccompanying\n children with disabilities remain shocking;\n 8\n0\n% of \nthe 200 million children with disabilities\n \nliving in \ndeveloping countries\n and over 90% of children with disabilities still not receiving education\n. Furthermore, \nin countries \nthat have been praised for r\neduc\ning\n under-five mortality rates to less than 20 percent, experts believe the figure for children with disabilities could \nactually \nbe as high as 80 percent mortality\n.\n \nT\nhere \nneeds to be\n a renewed push from the international \ncommunity \nto ensure disability-inclus\nive programming remains central to the \nglobal \ndevelopment discourse.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nO\nn\ne of the major criticisms of \nthe Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) \nset out by the United Nations remains to be the\n absence of a \nfocus on disability\n.\n \nIt could be argued that t\nhe lack of \ninclusion of\n \nC\nWDs in development programming caused one of the prominent barriers to achieving the MDGs.\n For example, in the 2007 UNESCO Education for All Global Monitoring Report, it was estimated that one third of the 77 million children missi\nng out on education were disabled\n and in Africa, fewer than 10% of disabled children attended school\n. It has become clear that if we \nwere to achieve MDG2\n -\n u\nniversal primary education\n -\n there would have to be a deliberate focus on mak\ning education \naccessible to all\n,\n and ensuring the inclusion of disabled children would be an integral part of that.\n With\n 57 million children still out of school in 2013\n achieving MDG2 seems unlikely. \n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs we approach the 2015 deadline, \nconversations have \nnow \nbegun arou\nnd disability in the post-\nMDG\n agenda. \nWorld Vision \nparticularly \ncommends Permanent Undersecretary of State for International Development, L\nynne Featherstone and DFID in leading in these\n global\n discussions\n.\n World Vision agrees that \nin order to tackle \npoverty, we must address the needs of the people with disability\n and welcomes the Minister’s commitment to make disability rights a key development priority\n. \nWe believe that to truly bring communities out of poverty\n we must eliminate the social stigma an\nd discrimination \nC\nWDs experience and ensure that disability inclusion should be mainstreamed in all development interventions.\n \nA particular focus on challenging the social norms and stigmatisation towards CWDs needs t\no be embedded in all interventions and \nDFID should make funding available to make this \nachievable\n.\n \nAs the post-2015 framework is beginning to take shape, we should not see disability-inclusion as a stand-alone goal, but rather a cross-cutting theme relevant to all development issues.\n&#xa0;\nChanging attitudes and behaviours towards disabilities is vital&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to the UN Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child\n, \nchildren \nwith disabilities have the right to \na \nfull\n and decent life\n, \nto \nequally and meaningfully participate in and benefit from humanitarian\n assistance and development processes in their communities\n. However\n,\n the rights of \nthese \nchildren \nmay be violated by attitudinal, institutional or environmental barriers that exist in any given society. Every community or society has barriers that prevent\n some of its members (especially those with physical, sensory or intellectual impairments) from participating in activities that other members of society enjoy. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorld Vision works according to the \nsocial model of disability\n. Our approach to disability \ninclusion focuses on the social, programming and rights issues\n.\n World Vision seeks to raise awareness of disability to ensure that disabled people’s human rights are respected, to reduce social stigma, break down barriers and to ensure that disabled people\n are included in and not excluded from their community’s development.  World Vision partners with disabled peoples organisations (DPOs) and other organisations to achieve this aim.\n We recognise that not all with disabilities \nwill \nbe categorised as ‘most vu\nlnerable’\n.\n \nH\nowever World Vision works on the basis that \nonly \nwhen inclusion with equal access to development opportunities is achieved, \nwill \nmost\n individuals\n with disabilities become \nless \nvulnerable.\n \n&#xa0;\nWorld Vision’s approach to disability-mainstreaming: our programmes and projects&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorld Vision promotes ‘disability mainstreaming’ ensuring that the \nrights \nof disabled people are met\n and as equally represented\n.\n \nDisability is recognised as relevant for World Vision programmes and projects \nacross all sectors\n \na\nnd is deliberately considered at all stages \nthroughout their assessment, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The goal is to enable equal access and opportunities for people with disabilities as programme participants and beneficiaries. \n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiv\nen that disabled \nchildren \nare often hidden within population\ns\n, World Vision proactively seeks to understand the ratio in the population and to ensure that the number of \nindividuals \nwith disabilities participating in World Vision programmes and projects \nwill at least reflect it.\n In World Vision’s long-term area development programmes, we seek to reflect this ratio with the number of CWDs included as sponsored children.\n Although our approach is to include disability issues in all our development programmes\n, we also realise that more targeted (including at \nC\nWDs) projects are needed. Inclusive programming alone will not be sufficient to support those who are most vulnerable in the community.\n \nIn this light, we support DFID’s \n‘twin-track’\n approach to disabilit\ny; to promote the deliberate inclusion and \nactive \nparticipation of \nC\nWDs in all areas of development whilst not neglecting to also address the particular needs of those individuals.  \n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2006 World Vision UK was awarded a \nfive\n year grant from DFID as a part of their Programme Partnership Agreement (PPA). From 2008, the PPA grant amounted to approximately £2.5million per year, part of which was earmarked to mainstream disability into World Vision’s programming. Our strategic obj\nective to ‘strengthen the engagement of disabled people in poverty reduction’ \ntook\n a \nlearning \napproach to mainstream disability across \nparticular \nWV partners. Priority was given to developing training on disability issues for WV staff (by 2011 it had reach\ned over 2,500 staff); piloting projects in selected \nDFID priority \ncountries and learning in areas of service delivery such as \nin \neducation; development of external partnerships with national disabled peoples organisations (DPOs); and evaluation\n. \nWe consid\nered a\nll of the\nse\n elements essential to successfully mainstreaming disability\n. These are\n now central components of our development programming\n.\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn 2010 World Vision UK produced a training handbook “\nTravelling Together – how to include disabled people on\n the main road of development”\n,\n which as well as\n highlighting the inequality that disabled people face, provides practical tools to promote inclusion in community development.  This handbook \nis \nwidely used\n, \nraising awareness and promoting the inclusion of\n disabled people in development internationally.\n In designing a disability-inclusive strategy, DFID must take into account that persons with disabilities are diverse and belong to different gender, age, culture, race and ethnicity, socio-economic background, religion, educational background, and family b\nackground. \nResearch by \nthe International Institute for Child Rights and Development (\nIICRD\n)\n and World Vision on Most Vulnerable Children has\n also \ndemonstrated that CWD who are included in development programmes, supported and cared for by family, peers and\n community and have access to education and social opportunities are far less vulnerable and able to play an active role in their own development\n. Thus we recommend that DFID funds and supports programming solutions that promote the full inclusion of CWD,\n by removing barriers to access to education, health, protection and other vital services.\n \nChildren \nwith disabilities also have different types and degrees of impairment, and these should be taken into account for mainstreaming disability into DFID’s progr\namming.\n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA major factor that contributed to the positive progress made in mainstreaming disability throughout the\n 2006-2011 PPA programme\n was training World Vision and its partners’ development workers themselves in a\ncknowledg\ning the\n right\ns of disabled \npeople\n to be included in development programmes\n. \nThis allowed our staff to \nthen educate the community and focus on p\nrogrammes and projects \nof\n inclusiveness and accessibility, not on individuals’ condition or impairments.\n World Vision’s development programming approach deliberately takes a positive, rights-based approach to disability. We focus on the positive ‘assets’ or ‘capabilities’ of individuals, families and communities and seek to build on these, rather than startin\ng with a negative deficits approach. \nWe recommend that DFID provides disability equality orientation and refresher training to key stakeholders including\n DFID staff and leadership. This promotes attitudinal and behavioural changes, accessibility and inclus\nive programming, in order to eliminate discrimination against persons with disabilities in DFID’s programmes. Wherever possible, disability training should be provided by, or in cooperation with, community-based or national disabled people’s organisations.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2011, World Vision UK was awarded a second PPA grant, with a new focus on child protection. \nO\nur goal to ensure ‘children and communities, especially the most vulnerable and those in the poorest and/or most fragile contexts, are cared and protected’ ha\ns mainstreamed disability into its programmes. Baseline and monitoring data for this PPA outcome is disaggregated by disability, to ensure levels of inclusion are measured\n and reflected upon\n. Mainstreaming disability into child protection programming has a\nlso contributed to a change in social norms around \nthe inclusion of certain groups\n in development processes and \nhas \nled to decreased levels of prejudice in the community. What is currently \nmissing\n from DFID reporting is the lack of clear disaggregated data\n on the numbers of PWDs and specifically CWDs in targeted areas, being reached and impacted. We call on DFID to demand clear, disaggregated data from projects they fund. \nIf\n this \nproves logistically challenging, DFID should provide enough funds to ensure th\nis standard of data is still provided\n.\n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProgress has also been made on both an international and national level in raising awareness of the rights of disabled people and World Vision has seen a rise in opportunities to influence decision-makers on this issue. \nFor example, t\nhrough the collaborati\nve efforts of World Vision India and WV International’s Global Advocacy Team, Nisha Das, a 15-year-old girl, represented the voices of children and youth at the thematic debate on Inequality at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York on July 8, 20\n13.  The event, titled “The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order,” was convened by the President of the UN General Assembly, H.E. Mr. Vuk Jeremić.  Nisha was invited to be the sole representative of the youth and gave a statemen\nt during the interactive debate on “Reducing Inequality: Perspectives from Civil Society.”  She is part of World Vision India’s North Kolkata Area Development Program and a leader of the National Forum of Children with Disability in India. World Vision bel\nieves that PWDs must be central to any discussions concerning disability and development. Opportunities \nshould be\n made for those who can best represent the rights and views of citizens with disabilities \nranging \nfrom the global level, at the UN to state gov\nernments and \nin \nparliament, and at the local level\n,\n in the community.   \n&#xa0;\nTargeting disability in fragile states &#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorld Vision UK focuses on reaching the most vulnerable people \nliving \nin the \nworld’s toughest \nplaces. We deliberately choose to work in fragi\nle contexts where communities are often recovering from conflict and in areas where the national government is not fulfilling its responsibilities\n to its citizens.\n Research suggests that children with disabilities experience violence at a greater rate of \n1.7 annually than able-bodied youths\n. \nUNICEF \nestimate\ns\n \nfor every 1 child that is killed as a consequence of armed violence, 3 children are left with permanent, life-long injuries or disabilities. Between\n 1990 and 2001, 6 million more had been left disabled\n. \nIn natural disasters and conflicts, the needs of CWDs are often neglected and these individuals become ‘forgotten victims’\n of the emergency\n.\n In these areas, we are aware that impairments may not only\n affect an individual at birth but it may also be the consequence of living in these conditions\n and our programmes reflect this\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWorld Vision’s child friendly spaces (CFS) – a child protection\n and \nnon formal \neducation\n intervention used to support communities in emergencies – allow staff to identify the most vulnerable\n \nchildren\n, including those with disabilities. \nCFS programmes aim to mainstream t\nhe needs of disabled children, \n(\nboth as a predetermined condition or as a \nresult of the crisis\n)\n, which provide the necessary provisions for those groups as well as maintaining activities essential to a child’s development such as access to education and healthcare. \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA 3 year research programme by Columbia University is currentl\ny assessing the impact of CFS run by World Vision, Save the Children and UNICEF. Its initial findings have found that the effectiveness of child friendly spaces in a camp for Congolese refugees in western Uganda suggest that children who regularly attend C\nFS were able to sustain their psychological well-being, where as those who didn’t attend had a marked deterioration. \nAlmost 50% of children categorised as ‘most vulnerable’ who had scored ‘at risk’ levels of psychological difficulties at the time the basel\nine was conducted were regular attendees of CFS. All children showed a reduction in difficulties to normative levels at a follow up assessment\n. \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe recommend that DFID \nreviews\n \nits humanitarian response strategies to ensure its assistance is reaching the most vulnerable groups, including \nbut \nnot exclusively, those with disabilities. \nWhen working in these challenging contexts, DFID must be prepared to provide both physical and psy\nchological rehabilitation to \nall \nvictims\n \nof armed violence. In its recovery programming, DFID must be flexible and consider the potential need to adapt beneficiaries’ livelihoods to better suit their new circumstances.   \n&#xa0;Conclusion&#xa0;24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn 2000, DFID highlig\nhted the critical need to address disability issues in response to tackling poverty. However\n in the years since,\n \nwe have seen discussions around disability-inclusive programming often neglected\n and\n replaced by other DFID priorities. \nWe applaud Lynne Feathe\nrstone in driving efforts to return DFID’s attention towards this issue\n however more action is required by DFID to ensure assistance is targeted and inclusive of people, particularly children, with disabilities\n. DFID \nshould\n not view disability as a separate agenda for its development programmes but instead\n,\n commit to achieving inclusion of \ndisabled individuals\n,\n \nthose who are excluded or marginalised in the communities DFID and its partners work in\n. \n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID must demand more fro\nm its implementing partners in terms of disaggregating available data by disability, age and gender; \nenabling \nfull transparency \nin measuring \nthe inclusion of disabled individuals \nin the programmes and projects it funds. \nFunding must be made available by DF\nID to ensure disaggregation of data can happen effectively.\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn DFID programmes there needs to be a strong\n focus on tackling the discrimination \nexperienced by people with disabilities in communities. Interventions should celebrate an individual’s capabilities, not their impairments \nand promote active participation in the community. The more positive attention paid to how an individual can contribu\nte to their own development will aid efforts to breakdown social and physical barriers in society. \nParticular attention should be paid to children with disabilities\n, ensuring they have access to education, healthcare and other basic services that will cont\nribute towards the creation of supportive networks for the child. In these instances, they will be less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation often experienced by children with disabilities.\n DFID must recognise that the needs of adults with disabilities and\n the needs of children with disabilities can greatly differ.\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn fragile contexts, DFID must \nmake every effort to reach the most vulnerable children\n. In designing disaster risk reduction strategies, the needs of children with impairments must be considered. In emergency response and medical care must be fully accessible to and inclusive of people with disabilities. The Rights of disabled people and th\nat of children must be upheld during and in the aftermath of emergencies, in areas such as refugee and \ninternally displaced persons\n camps.\n28.\n&#xa0; \nGlobally\n, \nthe space to advocate on the inclusion of different development issues in \na\n post-2015 framework is very cro\nwded\n and it will prove challenging to keep the pressure on disability to be included as a cross-cutting theme\n. If DFID is truly committed to bringing disability-inclusion to the forefront of development, it needs to ensure this topic \nremains\n central to the\n development discourse.\n The voices of disabled adults and children should be heard and considered at all levels of decision-making. Opportunities should be opened up to bring representatives of these groups into the centre of the post-2015 development deba\nte.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWorld Health Organisation and World Bank (2010), \nWorld Report on Disability, \nGeneva, 2011.
