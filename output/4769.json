"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Nisai Group\n&#xa0;\nIssues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating to the performance of local authorities in child protection and services for looked-after children\n&#xa0;\nThere are many positive commitments to ensuring that local \nauthorities provide the best services for looked after children in the Annual Report.  However, there are still some issues that need addressing including:\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, over \n10% of children are still being moved more than three times a year\n \nwith m\nore than half only given a week's notice or les\ns of being moved to another foster home and \na quarter given no notice at all. This\n does \nnot provide a stable context for learning\n, and f\nrequent relocation ranks as poor practice by an authority that neither understands a child’s needs, nor changes their \neducational prognosis.\n&#xa0;\nThis need not be the case. Ofsted’s report also states that better authorities “had robust data systems that enabled virtual schools to monitor and track the progress of children, individually as well as collectively” as well as add\nress specific educational issues through the use of technology.  This means there is support for its wider use in the education of looked after children - a sensible position as technology: \n&#xa0;\nOne example of an online education provider is The Nisai Virtual Academy (NVA).  It is \nan award winning online learning community\n, on a secure e\nncrypted platform that provides a \nreal-time teaching environment\n with CRB checked specialist teachers\n&#xa0;\nthat specialise\n in \nSEN and \npersonalised learning\n. \nIn addition, it provides a secure reporting system that keeps the virtual head informed of attendance, contribution and behaviour meaning that \nthose who are excluded from traditional education\n can \naccess full and proper education online.\n&#xa0;\nEach learner has \ntheir own personal profile based on their ability and the subjects that they want to study.  It \nallows\n students to engage in live lessons with teachers and other students as well as\n providing a \nwell being centre\n to help reduce barriers to learning\n.  Indeed\n, \nthe results speak for themselves. T\nhe students who use the NVA are often those who, in the eyes of the majority, are unlikely to gain any qualifications and/or achieve anything with their lives.  Considering that a quarter\n of looked-after \nchildren still \nobtain no qualifications with a further quarter obtaining fewer than five GCSEs or equivalent, \nthey can be easily placed in this category. \nHowever, last year 91% of the students of Nisai Learning achieved GCSE and A-level qualifications, and 30.6% achieved\n A* to C grades – a figure below the national average but again, considering many of these students would have had no GCSE or A-levels under their belts without the use of the online education, \nthis is \nan impressive achievement. \n&#xa0;\nWith this in mind, action\n needs to be taken to:\n&#xa0;\nIssues and concerns raised in the Annual Report relating to the performance of secure accommodation\n&#xa0;\nThe report states that “28% of young people in secure children’s homes were neg\native about the support they receive with their work or education”.  A terrifying statistic backed up by previous reports that:\n&#xa0;\nEducation is one of the key elements to a young person being able to leave a life of crime behind. However, many offenders in custody are unable to access traditional education; and for that reason online education provision can help these young pe\nople.   Indeed, many young offenders have experienced ‘disrupted education’ in the mainstream system and this often continues once they are in a secure location.   Providing them with access to online learning tools like the Nisai Virtual Academy, would ov\nercome this problem, as they would be able to study from any location, provided they have access to a PC or laptop with a broadband Internet connection. Not only will this provide continuity in their learning whilst they are in custody, but would enable th\nem to continue their studies without interruption once they complete their custodial sentence. Latest figures show there were “just 119 GCSE passes in public sector young offender institutions in 2010/11, the latest year for which figures are available. Th\nis represents a 49 per cent drop on the number of passes for 2009/10, when the figure stood at 232…”\n The opportunity to study in a consistent manner will not only give young offenders the best chance to succeed, but will also support their resettlement an\nd enhance their ability to re-engage with education, training and employment.  It will also mean that young people can engage with the education system without feeling that they are dealing with the “authorities” with whom they may have trust issues becaus\ne of previous treatment or experiences.  \n&#xa0;\nWith this in mind action needs to be taken to:\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n http://1e3de8be9eb9f6172fd3-fbec1a74094b5b55\n67335038623e5584.r36.cf2.rackcdn.com/Social%20Care%20Annual%20Report%20201213.pdf\n http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmeduc/924/924.pdf\n \nChildren's Care Monitor survey of 2,000 children\n Figures provided by the Nisai Group: 1\nst\n September 2010\n \nBreakthrough Britain: Ending the Costs of Social Breakdown\n; Social Justice Policy Group; July 2007\n \nReport of Chief Inspector of the Adult Learning Inspectorate \n2004-5\n http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1075367/gcse-passes-offenders-halv\nes\n"
