[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]Do you agree with the list of measures falling within the Ministry of Justice’s responsibility that the Government proposes the UK should seek to rejoin after exercise of the block opt-out? Do you consider that the UK should seek to rejoin measures which are not contained in the Government’s list, or, conversely, do you consider that the UK should not seek to rejoin measures which are contained in the Government’s list?[bold]W[bold]hat is your assessment of the national interest involved in rejoining the measures for which the Ministry of Justice is responsible?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The Law Societies believe that the EAW is extremely important and related to a number of the measures overseen by the Ministry of Justice
[normal] addressed in this response
[normal].  
[normal]The EAW
[normal] could be improved but offers a better and more efficient system than previous arrangements.
[normal]  (We address these points in more detail in our response to the Home Affairs Select Committee's inquiry.)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This provides for a prisoner transfer scheme, which the Law Societies view as helpful 
[normal]in enabling nationals to serve sentences in their own Member States.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Prosecutors regard these measures as particularly valuable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This measure can improve the procedural rights of the accused, for example, in EAW cases.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This 
[normal]will be beneficial 
[normal]to many
[normal] 
[normal]defendants resident in a Member State other than where they are due to stand trial.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]M[bold]easures[bold] within the remit of the Ministry of Justice[bold] omitted from [bold]the [bold]list[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]There are a number of measures that the Law Societies believe should be added to the list
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal matters
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Mutual recognition of judgments and probation decisions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D[bold]o you have any comments on the analysis of policy implications and fundamental rights provided in the Ministry of Justice’s Explanatory Memorandum?[bold]D[bold]o you consider any other factors should be taken into account in deciding whether the UK should seek to rejoin each measure?[bold]European Supervision Order
