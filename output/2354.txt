[[[Robert Kelly – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Until late July 2013 I lived in the Peak District National Park. I am writing to support the proposals of the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) to add further sections to the bill to re-classify unsealed unclassified county roads and unsealed BOATs as restricted byways.&#xa0;Re-classifying unsealed unclassified county roads as restricted byways would remove the need for Surveying Authorities to devote considerable staff time to researching each route and processing the decision on the legal status through the system. This can include investigating a range of historical documents, evaluating user evidence and other reports from the public, writing a council committee paper, publishing an order and in many cases preparing for a PINS (Planning Inspectorate)  public inquiry and attending the inquiry.&#xa0;In larger local authorities whole posts could be removed from the staff complement. If mechanically propelled vehicles are prohibited from using routes they will not need to be maintained to such a high standard and therefore savings will be made in maintenance.&#xa0;This is also a good opportunity to resolve the anomalous position unclassified county roads with vehicular rights would be in if the existing uncommenced sections of the CROW Act 2000 relating to the “cut-off” in 2026 were to be commenced. There would be no means of re-classifying unclassified county roads with vehicular rights as rights of way (BOATs, restricted byways etc) and the only means of control of use would be traffic regulation orders (TROs). The situation has some analogies to the treatment of RUPPs in 2006.&#xa0;Some non-motorised users are deterred from using unsealed unclassified county roads and unsealed BOATs by the thought of meeting 4x4s and trail motorcycles and by damage these vehicles do to routes. If these routes were re-classified as restricted byways more use would be made of them with benefits to health and local economies.&#xa0;I would encourage the committee to support the inclusion of further sections in the bill dealing with this issue.&#xa0;6 September 2013     &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                            &#xa0;                            &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
