"&#xa0;\nBNI0025&#xa0;Supplementary written evidence from the Consumer Council&#xa0;\nThe Consumer Council gave oral evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on 11 September 2013 on how the Northern Ireland (NI) retail banking market affects NI \nconsumers\n. We were asked for further information on a range of subjects as follows:\n&#xa0;\nStatistics on access to daily banking services- NI consumersThe Family Resources Survey (FRS) collects information on the incomes and circumstances of private households in Northern Ireland. It has been running in Great Britain since October 1992, but \n2002/03 saw the introduction of Northern Ireland for the first time. The latest report was published in February 2013 and summarises the results for the 2010/11 survey in which 1,896 households were interviewed.\n \nAll adults questioned in the Family Resour\nce\ns Survey were\n asked about the types of accounts they have held over the last 12 months. \n&#xa0;\nInformation on the numbers of people/households with access to bank accounts is an important indicator for financial inclusion. The Consumer Council’s ‘Price of Being\n Poor’\n report shows that consumers on low incomes that cannot access mainstream financial services end up paying more, a “poverty premium”, for the services they need (for example, higher gas and electricity bills because they cannot get direct debit disc\nounts). \n&#xa0;\nTable\n 4.1 \non the following page \nshows the percentage of households with one or more current, savings or investment accounts and those with one or more direct payment accounts, including and excluding Post Office Card Accounts (POCAs).  This has b\neen measured across all areas of GB and NI. \n&#xa0;\nA POCA allows c\nonsumers to withdraw cash at the Post Office but there are no facilities to set up direct debits to manage money and pay bills.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 4.1 shows that \n13 per cent of households in NI do \nnot have a current account with access to direct debit and overdraft facilities.\n&#xa0;\nIt also shows that \nonly \n95\n per cent of households in NI had\n any type of\n account including POCAs.\n \nThis was the lowest proportion for any region in the UK, with the exception \nof East Midlands (which was equal to NI), an\nd compared to a UK average of 98\n per cent. \nAge profile of consumers without a current account&#xa0;\nWe \nwere \nasked to provide further data on the age profile of consumers who do not have a current account and the p\nroportion of consumers who do not have an alternative such as a Post Office Card Account.\nTo do this, we had to request\n further data from the Family Resources Survey which is specific to Northern Ireland adults\n (individuals)\n only. 18 per cent of NI adults \n(individuals) \ndid not have a current account at t\nhe time of the survey in 2010/11.\n Please see the age\n profiles of those consumers below:\n&#xa0;\nAge group\nNumber (000's)\nPercent\n16-24\n                                   167 \n13\n25-34\n                                   242 \n18\n35-44\n                                   250 \n19\n45-54\n                                   240 \n18\n55-59\n                                     97 \n7\n60-64\n                                     90 \n7\n65-74\n                                   143 \n11\n75-84\n                                     84 \n6\n85+\n21\n2\n&#xa0;\nBank branch coverage in NIWe were asked to provide clarity on our written submission of paragraph 28 which gives details on branch closures\n in the past two years. The following table shows the number of branches that are currently open, provided by the four largest banks in NI.\n&#xa0;\nBank of Ireland\n35\nDanske\n Bank\n53\nFirst Trust\n32\nUlster Bank\n79\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Building Societies in NIThe main building \nsocieties with branch facilities\n in NI\n are Nationwide and the Progressive. Nationwide offer a range of curren\nt account services. They have 14\n main branche\ns.\n As mentioned at the committee meeting on 11 September, there have been closures of agency services\n \nprovided by\n Nationwide in the past. Nationwide previously had nine agencies (private insurance brokers and estate agents) operating in NI that carried a small float to service customers with current accounts. All of these agencies closed in 2008. Consumers must now v\nisit one of the 14 branches for face to face service.\n&#xa0;October 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Price of Being Poor.\n \nThe Consumer Council.\n June 2011.\n"
