"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nWest Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel\n [PCC Progress 32]\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe West Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel covers the five West Yorkshire Districts of\n: \n the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council\n;\n \nthe Metropolitan Borough Council of \nCalderdale;\n \nthe Metropolitan Borough of \nKirklee\ns;\n \nLeeds \nCity Council \nand the City of Wakefield Metro\npolitan District Council. \n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Committee’s inquiry\n.  \n \nWe feel well-placed to comment on the lines of inquiry identified by the Committee as a result of the \nunique combination of police and crime challenges\n facing West Yorkshire and in light of \nthe Panel\n’s achievements\n over the last 15 months:\n1.2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n fir\nst Panel to meet formally\n following a period of intensive preparation;\n1.2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne of \nthe most active Panels \nin the country, having met \n11\n \ntimes \nin its first year \nand undertaken \nfurther development activities; \n \n1.2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeveloped a\n structured way of working with the CSPs and Scrutiny Committees\n which has been drawn-upon in other areas; \n1.2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe first Panel to have devised a scrutiny and support framework for directing \nits\n work and using ‘rapporteur’ roles to help Panel \nMembers gain deeper, specialist knowledge\n; \n1.2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe first Panel to\n meet with HMIC to learn more\n about respective roles and triangulation of information, in light of findings that the West Yorkshire Force was one of only two large forces that were poorly positioned to respond to continued austerity measures; \n1.2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nddressed a\n series of high-profile police and crime issues\n \nof\n pu\nblic interest alongside the\n the Police and Crime Commissioner \nincluding\n:\n the implications of the Savile\n abuse scandal; \nquestions of \ntrust f\nrom the Hillsborough tragedy and the safe hosting of the Grand \nDépart\n Yorkshire; \nand,\n \n \n \n1.2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nfirst Panel to produce \nan Annual Report to account \nfor its work \nto the constituent authorities and local residents. \n \n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel would be pleased to further support the Committee’s work by providing oral evidence if required. \n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBefore explain\ning how the Panel has held the C\nommissioner to account, \nwe should\n reflect our interpretation of the \nrole of the P\nC\nC.  It is, by design\n and like many \npublic roles\n, two-\ndimensional\n:\n \nt\no be the\n \nelectorate’s representative in \nthe \nlocal \npolic\ning service\n and to be the public face of policing in loca\nl communities.  The Panel’s role is thus to scrutinise and support the PCC in how \nhe or she b\nalance\ns\n \nthese roles\n effectively\n.   We are absolutely clear that it is not our job to decide if the PCC is doing a good job; the electorate will have its say.  \nThe Panel’s role is to look into the decisions taken by the PCC and ensure that the public has access to information to make its choice. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legislative role of \nPolice and Crime P\nanels \nincludes very specific requirement\ns\n. \nFor each example, we have tried to provide brief comment about the value that we or others feel has been added.  \nDuring the past 12 months, the Panel has:\n&#xa0;\n2.2.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReviewed and approved the Police and Crime Plan2.2.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nReviewed and approved the appointment of the Chief Constable and Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner2.2.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsidered and approved the policing precept&#xa0;\n2.2.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nProvided for the PCC to present and answer questions on his Annual Report2.2.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConvened two Sub-Panels to consider complaints matters&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, \nthe legislation also provides \nscope for panels to \n“review or scrutinise decisions made, or othe\nr action taken, by the relevant Police and Crime C\nommissioner in connec\ntion with the discharge of the C\nommissioner’s functions”\n.  \nWe feel this is important for three reasons\n as it pr\novides for the opportunity for P\nanels to add greatest value to the governance of policing and crime reduction\n:\n&#xa0;\n2.3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn provides for Panels to play important roles in ensuring that the \nstrategic direction of all partners relates to common goals expressed in the Police and Crime Plan.\n  This rests on the Panel’s work on local policing priorities and its links to Community Safety Partnerships and local Scrutiny Committees, as explained in more detail in section 3 below.  In addition, however, the Panel has also been greatly encouraged by how the PCC and other partners, including from local criminal justice agencies, have shown a commitment to work together to deliver the Police and Crime Plan. \n2.3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nPanel is able \nto \nsupport the PCC make the strategic links with local authorities.  In \npractice, \nthe Panel Chair briefs Council Leader\ns on significant issues in order that they are aware of contextual information, and any concerns or views the Panel has, so that Leaders’ work with the PCC is as constructive and informed as possible. \n2.3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire has a total budget \nof approaching £2bn during a full\n term of office.  \nWhere major policy positions are decided upon, the \nPanel can ask the PCC to explain why a decision was taken and what the expected implications might be.  Although currently the Panel has been disappointed that the online record of the PCC’s decisions has been regularly out-of-date, we look forward to this being rectified in future in the interests of public accountability. \n2.3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA good example of this discretionary work in action was the PCC’s response to a critical report by HMIC in July 2013.  The Panel took the initiative to meet with HMIC Inspectors to fully understand the context and future implications of the \nwork.  In responding to the \nreport, \n \nt\nhe Police and Crime Commissioner has assured the Panel that, in his reviews with the Chief Constable, he will seek improvement plans in respect of not only burglary but rape, serious sexual assaults and other areas where West Yorkshire is at the low end n\nationally amongst\n its group of similar forces.\n2.4\n              \nWell-informed scrutiny and support is crucial.  Therefore, t\nhe Panel has \nbeen very pleased at the Police and Crime Commissioner’s strong and proactive stance in \nraising with the Home Secretary and Office for National Statistics\n,\n concerns about the \nrestrictions on \npublish\ning\n timely information on \ncrime trends and comparative \nperformance.  \nCurrently, the Panel and PCC are only able to use comparative data that is between three\n \nand six \nmonths\n old.\n  \nT\nhe Panel feels frustrated \nthat it is not able\n to give the public of West\n Yorkshire the\n up-to-date position\n and we would urge the Committee to support the collective work of the Panel and PCC for West Yorkshire to broker a better approach nationally. \n&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel has excellent links with local Community Safety Partnerships and Crime and Disorder Scrutiny Committees.  \nThese relationship are underpinned by Principles of Engagement and, in a practical sense, local partners provide a quarterly ‘Local Perspective’.  This highlights areas where the PCC is working well with\n local partners and has provided real evidence that they and the PCC have regard to each other’s priorities\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nIn a very practical sense, the\n Panel has raised important issues on the PCC’s approach to commissioning and supported his pass\n-\nporting of funding for community safety and crime prevention work\n until October 2014\n.\n On behalf of partners, the Panel has urged the PCC to share, and consult on his emerging commissioning framework for activity beyond October 2014, at the earliest possible opportunity. \n  \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is through the \n‘\nLocal Perspectives\n’\n process that the Panel has noted and supported the PCC on the significant commitment he has shown to get out and engage with community groups, partners and residents across West Yorkshire.  The Panel feels this is crucial for him to be able to understand and promote local policing priorities. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel has also supported the PCC in his commitment to refresh the Police and Crime Plan for West Yorkshire, underpinned by a major \n‘Listening to You’\n \nconsultation \nexercise. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn annual meeting of the Panel with CSP and Scrutiny Committee chairs also allows partners to identify where learning can be shared and joint or coordinated work undertaken.  Following the meeting in July 2013, CSPs have shared information and approaches on common issues including a pilot Restorative Justice project in Bradford and approaches to tackling d\nomestic violence in Leeds.  Similarly, the Scrutiny Committees agreed to undertake a coordinated exercise about the roles of\n,\n and local authority contribution\ns\n to\n,\n PCSOs in West Yorkshire.  All of these measures have helped provide decision-makers at the appropriate level with better information about how they can help deliver the outcomes in the Police and Crime Plan. \n&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Police and Crime Commissioner has over £400m per year to spend on making people in West Yorkshire safer and feeling safer.  The majority of this is delegated to West Yorkshire Police and under the control of the Chief Constable, with the remainder spent on community safety projects that help prevent crime, support victims and achieve\n the other priorities within\n the Police and Crime Plan.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel’s role is to scrutinise and support the Police and Crime Commissioner’s decisions about the use of resources in West Yorkshire.  Over the last 12 months, we have:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt’s good news that crime in West Yorkshire is falling and the Panel recognises the vital role played by those who work in our local communities to make them safer.  The Panel feels it would be helpful for residents to have clearer milestones and contextual information to allow them to reach their own judgements about the Police and Crime Commissioner’s \nprogress.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe PCC holds fortnightly Community Outcome meetings with the Chief Constable, which is the principal route by which he is held to account.  The Panel understands its role to be to ask the PCC to explain how he has ensured that the Chief Constable is ensuring the outcomes in the Police and Crime Plan are achieved.  This includes priorities the PCC has identified alongside the Chief Constable to focus on; the evidence that has been used to identify those priorities and what tangible improvements the PCC and Chief Constable expect to see. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel also seeks to understand how the PCC and Chief Constable respond to financial information about the Force’s Programme of Change and its overarching budgetary position. \nAgain, the Panel looks to triangulate information from meetings with evidence from the OPCC or external partners like HMIC.  \n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs Forces across Yorkshire and the Humber move to a new model of regional collaboration through a ‘lead force’ model rather than a collective resource, the Panel will look for evidence that the PCC is holding the Chief Constable to account for those areas where West Yorkshire leads, and to make sure that local residents are being well-served on issues that are led by colleagues elsewhere. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Police and Crime Panel has made contact with other Panels across Yorkshire and the Humber to explore the appetite for sharing le\nssons and information about the collaborative activities\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCollaborative arrangements with other local partners such as local authorities have been discussed in other sections.\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel has taken interest in the division of functions and staff through the Stage 2 transfer.  Keen to undertake as much of its work as possible in public, the Panel was keen to look into the agreed Stage 2 process at its meeting on 13\nth\n December.  However, to our knowledge the Home Office’s response to the local proposal was not received within the indicated timeframe of the end of November. \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel remains keen to look into the agreed position in a public setting at the earliest opportunity.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel has\n a Memorandum of Understanding with the PCC on the sharing of information and respective roles on detailed \nprocesse\ns like complaints.   After one year of operation, this is un\nder review based on the experience\n of the last 12 months\n and will also take the opportunity to clarify the nature, quantity and format of information required by the Panel to enable it to exercise its role effectively\n. \n&#xa0;\n8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBroadly, the Panel is pleased with the PCC’s commitment to place information onto his website that is not classified as Restricted.  Whilst further work is needed for this to always be up-to-date, we are confident that learning and better working practices after the Stage 2 transfer will help. \n The Panel feels that \nby the PCC publishing a clear forward plan and\n more up-to-date information\n, the Panel’s scrutiny and support role might become even more effective.  \n \n&#xa0;\n8.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Panel would also reiterate to the Committee the transparency and reporting issues it raised in point 2.4 about the inability to use comparative \niQuanta\n information in a timely manner. \n&#xa0;\nCouncillor Alison Lowe, Chair,West Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel December 20137\n&#xa0;\n s.28(6a) of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011\n"
