"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Scope (PEX 0022)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1 \nScope exists to make this country a better place for disabled people and their families. We do this by running a range of services, raising awareness of the issues \nthat disabled people face and influencing change across society.\n&#xa0;\nWe provide support, advice and information for more than a quarter of a million disabled people and their family members every year.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 Scope welcomes the opportunity \nto submit written evid\nence to the \nCommittee’s Inquiry and would be happy to provide oral evidence if requested.\n Our submission focuses on the questions relating to \npublic expenditure on \nsocial care.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1 Social care is the support that enables disabled people to liv\ne independently and with dignity. It supports\n \nthem to \ndo essential day to day tasks such as washing, dress\ning, eating as well as living independent lives in their community.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 Working aged disabled people make up one third of social care users - i\nn 2012\n/13\n, there were \n434\n,\n775\n working-aged disabled people in the social care system - out of a total of 1,332,995\n. However, demographic changes mean the numbers of working-aged disabled people needing care are projected to rise by 9.2%\n from 2010 to 2020. \n&#xa0;\n3. The impact on the provision of adult social care of the 2010 spending review settlement and the ability of local authorities to make the necessary efficiency savings&#xa0;\n3.1 \nScope welcome\nd\n the Government’s commitment to investing \nan extra \n£1bn in social ca\nre in the 2010 Spending Review\n which was an important recognition of the increasing pressures on the social care system.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 However as funding for social care is not ring-fenced, th\nis investment must be seen in the context \nof a 33% cut in local \ncouncils’ budgets by 2014/15\n and the chronic long term \nunderfunding of the social care system\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3. \nO\nver the past three years, £2.68 billion has been cut from adult social care - 20 per cent of net spending\n. \n \n With\n the increasing numbers of disabled adults who need care and support\n,\n \nwe are concerned that the Government’s investment will not ensure the sustainable funding of the social care system\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n4\n \nAs a result of these \npressures\n, alongside an ageing population, \nmany local authorities have been raising the threshold at which disabled people become eligible for support. \nHowever this trend began even before 2010. \nIn 2005, 50% of local authorities set their eligibility criteria at ‘\nModerate’ needs but\n \nb\ny 2012, 84% ha\nd set their eligibility criteria at\n the \nhigher ‘substantial’ needs\n, meaning t\nhat s\nince 200\n7/\n8 the number of people using care has \ngradually \nfallen by at least \n347\n,000\n (see table below)\n.\n \nAs a result, just 14% of those with ‘moderate’ FACS needs are \nreceiving care\n, while \nat least\n 800,000 people with care needs are not receiving any support at all\n.  \n&#xa0;\nChange in number of social care recipients\nYearNumber (000s)Year-on-year change (000s)2007/08\n1275\n-\n2008/09\n1259\n-16\n2009/10\n1209\n-50\n2010/11\n1075\n-134\n2011/12\n1022\n-53\n2012/13\n928\n-94\n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nUnless a sustainable source of funding for adult social care is found, this situation is only likely to get worse. The \nLGA has\n estimated that spending on social care will \nsur\npass 45% of council budgets by \n2019/20\n, meaning that councils will have to cut social care further or drastically reduce budgets for other services\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.\n6\n Research\n by Scope and four oth\ner leading disability charities in “\nThe Other Care Crisis\n”\n report \nhas found that \nthis chronic underf\nunding of social care has had a significant impact on disabled people’s lives:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n7\n But recent e\nconomic modelling by Deloitte, contained in the \nEnding the Care Crisis\n report, has shown that\n investment in social care can lead to significant financial savings for \nthe NHS, central \nGovernment and Local Authorities\n. \n&#xa0;\nFor example, a £1.2 billion investment in care for people with ‘moderate’ level needs would result in:\n&#xa0;\nA\n £570 million saving to the NHS and local government\n:\n&#xa0;\nA\n £700 million saving to Central Government:\n&#xa0;\n3.8 \nAs evidenced above, there are\n clear \nlong term \neconomic benefits to local authorities, the NHS and the Treasury of \ninvesting in care for people with lower level needs\n.\n \nW\ne \ntherefore \nrecommend the Government sets the new ‘national eligibility threshold’, as set out in the regulations accompanying the Care Bill, at a level \nequivalent\n to\n \n‘Moderate’ \nunder the current \nFACs\n s\nystem\n.\n4. The impact on NHS plans of decisions currently being made by local authorities and the use of the additional funding for social care being made available through the NHS budget4.1 \nWe \nwholly\n welcome the \ncreation of a £3\n.8bn \nIntegration Transforma\ntion Fund (including a £2bn transfer from the NHS budget) to ensure better integration between health and social care announced \nin the Spending Review in June this \nyear\n, \nparticularly \nthat \nit will be spent through Health and Wellbeing Boards. \n&#xa0;\n4.2 \nWe also \nwelcome the conditions that are attached to the funding which will ensure a joint approach to assessments and care planning will be taken, as well as there being a professional who will be accountable where funding is used for integrated packages of care.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 However, given the extent of the long-term underinvestment in social care, we have strong concerns that this transfer of funding will be inadequate to meet the growing needs of working-aged disabled people and additional investment is needed.\n&#xa0;\n4.4 Mor\neover, t\nhe Integration Transformation Fund is predominantly to support people being discharged from hospital- the majority of whom are likely to older people and therefore the vast majority of younger working age d\nisabled people may not benefit. \n&#xa0;\n4.5 By f\nocussing on delayed transfers of care, emergency admissions and readmissions into hospital, and out of hours/weekend packages\n, it is also \nlikely \nthat the ITF will \nreduce existing \nproblems rather than unmet need. Therefore it i\ns likely that investment in mo\nre \npreventative, \ncommunity- based \ns\nervices will \ncontinue to\n be neglected.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n Community Care Statistics 2012/13, Health and Social Care Information Centre, \n Fernandez J-L et al (2012) Implications of setting eligibility criteria for adult social care services in England at the moderate needs level, PSSRU\n \nwww.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg.../dg_191696.pdf\n ADASS annual survey results, http://www.adass.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=914&amp;Itemid=489\n Figure 3, page 8: Care in Crisis, Age UK (2012)\n \nCommunity Care Statistics 2012/13, Health and Social Care Information Centre,\n \nFigure 3, \npage 8: Care in Crisis, Age UK (2012)\n Forder and Fernandez (2012), Analysing the costs and benefits of social care funding arrangements in England: 2nd Edition: PSSRU Discussion Paper 2644/2\n \nhttp://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10171/3624637/NEWS-TEMPLATE\n \nhttp://www.scope.org.uk/sites/default/files/The_Other_Care_Crisis.pdf\n http://www.scope.org.uk/sites/default/files/Ending_the_other_care_crisis.pdf\n"
