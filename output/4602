[normal]AFS0047[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Submission to the Education Select Committee from[bold]Written evidence submitted by[bold] ‘[bold]Hands Off Our Schools[bold]’[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]INTRODUCTION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]‘
[normal]Hands Off Our Schools
[normal]’
[normal] is a campaign group comprising local parents, teachers
[normal], governors and councilors, which
[normal] monitor
[normal]s
[normal] local schools and campaign
[normal]s
[normal] against 
[normal]academisation and free schools in the Nottingham and Nottinghamshire area.
[normal] It is not affiliated to any political party.
[normal]  The group is clear in its aims
[normal]:
[normal] we oppose 
[normal]a
[normal]cademy
[normal] conversions
[normal] and 
[normal]f
[normal]ree 
[normal]s
[normal]chools because we see this 
[normal]development 
[normal]as a loss of 
[normal]community
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]ontrol of our local schools, combined with a
[normal]n
[normal] incoherent and chaotic approach to 
[normal]the provision of 
[normal]school place
[normal]s
[normal]. Our view is that within such a system
[normal], 
[normal]democratic control will diminish whilst 
[normal]educational inequalities are likely to increase.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SUMMARY
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]In our experience, detailed in this submission, we are already seeing our concerns being 
[normal]realis
[normal]ed.  However, of equal concern,
[normal] is 
[normal]that the process
[normal]es
[normal] by which 
[normal]a
[normal]cadem
[normal]ies
[normal] and 
[normal]f
[normal]ree 
[normal]s
[normal]chools are emerging are far from clear.  The
[normal]r
[normal]e are key questions about the 
[normal]community use of public money and yet we have consistently experienced attempt
[normal]s
[normal] to 
[normal]stifle 
[normal]or avoid 
[normal]public 
[normal]debate 
[normal]on these key issues
[normal] by those pursuing particular agendas. This is sometimes achieved by refusing to engage in meaningful consultation, but in o
[normal]ther instances it is achieved through acts of bullying and intimidation
[normal], of employees and ourselves
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]Our concerns therefore
[normal] centre on several issues
[normal] and can be summarized as follows
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]i.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]loss of democratic oversight of schools
[normal] (including school place pla
[normal]nning)
[normal]; 
[normal]ii.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]lack of democratic procedures in the process of academisation and the setting up of free schools; 
[normal]iii.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]growing
[normal] 'conflicts of interest' emerging in the academy/free school 'world'
[normal] (and associated opacity in relation to these)
[normal]; 
[normal]iv.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the 
[normal]increasingly ineffic
[normal]ient use
[normal] of resources for 
[normal]items
[normal] that are not 
[normal]directly related 
[normal]to education
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SUBMISSION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]This submission
[normal] 
[normal]give
[normal]s
[normal] case study examples from our area of 
[normal]all 
[normal]these issues
[normal] [within the submission we have anonymised all schools 
[normal]–
[normal] the 
[normal]full list of schools 
[normal]mentioned, with brief descriptors, is provided at the end of this submission]
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]We have been struck by the way those who are 'for' academy status are unprepared to engage in debate with those of us who oppose. In our experience, those 'pushing' for aca
[normal]demy status are often the head and chair of governors of a school. Typically, they will arrange for the governing body to be addressed by another proponent of academies who gives all the arguments 'for' whilst no-one is invited to put the case 'against'
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]w
[normal]here we have been invited we have been 
[normal]well-received.) 
[normal]Sometimes the academy proponent is portrayed as a ‘neutral’ who is giving 
[normal]‘the facts’ in an unbiased way. 
[normal]'Consultation' with parents usually follows the same pattern and staff are 
[normal]often
[normal] simply informed. The impression is given that the change is going to happen, 
[normal]it is non-controversial and 
[normal]that 
[normal]everyone agrees it's self evidently a 'good thing'. 
[normal]We are aware of many instances where staff feel afraid to express opinions that might oppose 
[normal]a potential academisation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]In our area,
[normal] F
[normal] Primary was going through the process
[normal] of academisation, to become par
[normal]t
[normal] of the G Trust
[normal]. The staff of another local primary
[normal], B
[normal], who were also facing academisation 
[normal]as part of the G Trust 
[normal]and who were anxious about
[normal] it, arranged 
[normal]a meeting for all 
[normal]staff 
[normal]from local schools 
[normal]to d
[normal]iscuss it. No-one from F
[normal] 
[normal]attended and
[normal] we have 
[normal]been informed by a reliable source
[normal] that letters 
[normal]about the meeting that were 
[normal]ind
[normal]ividually addressed to 
[normal]School 
[normal]F
[normal] teachers were, on the orders of the he
[normal]ad teacher, 
[normal]intercepted and 
[normal]destroyed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]At A
[normal] P
[normal]rimary school, the upcoming academisation was 
[normal]publicly 
[normal]announced on the website of the
[normal] 'parent' school (G
[normal], of which, more later) whilst the so-called 'consultation' period was still ongoing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal]The G
[normal] Trust is a developing organisation in our area
[normal], centred on the G 
[normal]secondary 
[normal]school. It is gathering to it a number of local primary schools, those that might be considered in its local 'family'
[normal], though not all
[normal]. In those schools, the arguments 'for' include
[normal] the benefit of c
[normal]lose working with G
[normal]. This is an arg
[normal]ument being put at B
[normal] Junior School but whilst that debate has 
[normal]continued
[normal] (the staff are active in opposition) it is clear the school has continued to 
[normal]work closely with G
[normal],
[normal] so academisation would appear to b
[normal]e un
[normal]necessary. C Primary Academy
[normal] was an early 
[normal]‘
[normal]converter 
[normal]academy’ 
[normal]as part of the G
[normal] Trust and the head has been active in promoting academy status to others. He acted as a kind of '
[normal]super head'/adviser to E Primary. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. 
[normal]Th
[normal]e Chair of Governors at A
[normal] Primary i
[normal]s a former V
[normal]ice Principal at G
[normal], 
[normal]who now runs a consultancy which 
[normal]has done work for G
[normal]. The senior
[normal] office manager at 
[normal]C
[normal] is Chai
[normal]r of Governors at 
[normal]G
[normal]. 
[normal]The wife of the B 
[normal]Chair of Governors 
[normal]is a former deputy at the 
[normal]same 
[normal]school, later a local headteacher herself a
[normal]nd then independent adviser to Nottinghamshire CC. She now runs her own ed
[normal]ucation consultancy and has done
[normal] some training at G. Recently she was 
[normal]co-opted o
[normal]nto the governors at H and became Chair of the Finance Committee
[normal] straight away
[normal], at the instigation of the headteacher. No suggestion is made that
[normal] anyone has broken any laws but it concerns us that 
[normal]an ‘inner circle’ of networked individuals is emerging in which a relatively 
[normal]small number of people who clearly know each other well are 
[normal]making significant and critical decisions 
[normal]about
[normal] the future of schools 
[normal]in our area.  There is no meaningful community involvement in these decisions and there is no democratic process whereby the local community has a meaningful voice in 
[normal]the 
[normal]decisions
[normal] being
[normal] made
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]A final 
[normal]decision has 
[normal]not 
[normal]y
[normal]et been made over academisation at B 
[normal]in part, we think, because of the active opposition of many staff there, supported and encouraged by us. However, another 
[normal]explanation is that the governors are 
[normal]waiting for the loc
[normal]al authority to foot the bill for a much needed new roof, before then taking the school out of local authority control.  If this is the case, it illustrates how key decisions about local management of our community schools are being driven by concerns that
[normal] have nothing to do with educational arguments, or debates about community control 
[normal]–
[normal] but 
[normal]everything to do with principles of accountancy. We do not 
[normal]believe
[normal] 
[normal]this is in the interests of the effective stewardship of public finances, let alone the best interes
[normal]ts of our children.  
[normal] Something similar a
[normal]ppears to be happening at H
[normal], a large primary school, where expansion is likely to 
[normal]happen
[normal] with funding from the LA. However, meetings of governors have taken place with the head autocratically driving the a
[normal]genda. 
[normal]This is illustrated by t
[normal]he head
[normal]teacher
[normal] of C
[normal] 
[normal]being 
[normal]invited
[normal] to a governors’ meeting
[normal] to present the ‘academy’ case
[normal] (no-one was invited to put the case ‘against’) 
[normal]: governors were told they could only ask questions if these had been submitted in advance. 
[normal]We be
[normal]lieve this is extraordinary.  How can governors have an intelligent and open debate about a critical issue if they are not able to respond to points raised in the presentation
[normal] at the meeting
[normal]?
[normal] It exemplifies very clearly how important debates are 
[normal]often 
[normal]one-
[normal]sided
[normal], stage managed and closed down.  In 
[normal]this same school (H)
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]e
[normal] have been
[normal] reliably informed that the staff governors are not elected but appointed by the head
[normal]teacher
[normal], in rotation, fo
[normal]r 'staff development' purposes! 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]In recent months, much of our effo
[normal]rts have been put into opposing two proposed free schools 
[normal](L and M) 
[normal]in our area. The DfE approved one of these, the 
[normal]M Free School
[normal]: b
[normal]oth of the schools were mooted
[normal] by J K 
[normal]Trust 
[normal]which is, effectively, J Comprehensive and the K
[normal] School, a failing school w
[normal]hich 
[normal]the 'outstanding' J
[normal] has been supporting
[normal] (NB an OFSTED judg
[normal]ment made in December 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]here is no shortage of secondary places in the Sherwood area of Nottingham where the M Free School will, apparently, be located. 
[normal] We believe that the introduction of a 
[normal]f
[normal]ree 
[normal]s
[normal]choo
[normal]l
[normal] into the area will badly de
[normal]s
[normal]tabilise existing provision and will be both inefficient and a threat to quality.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. 
[normal]We have 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]continued to oppose the 
[normal]M Free School
[normal], aiming to influence 
[normal]the parents of 
[normal]potential recruits, through letters a
[normal]nd statements to the local press and by handing out leaflets at primary schools and at open meetings publici
[normal]sing the 
[normal]F
[normal]ree 
[normal]S
[normal]chool. The J K 
[normal]Trust has not engaged 
[normal]with us 
[normal]via the media but reacted very strongly to our leaflets, issuing a threatening letter, t
[normal]aking issue with our statements - and 
[normal]the 
[normal]questions raised - in the leaflet. We are satisfied that none of their complaints are justified: for example, we made much of the fact that currently there 
[normal]was (and still 
[normal]is
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]no publicly announced site for the new school and that as it is a new school parents couldn't talk to existing parents and pupils or view an OFSTED report or check examination outcomes. These are self-evident facts, 
[normal]yet J K Trust
[normal] seemed to think that becau
[normal]se they could raise counter arguments, what we had said was a 'malicious falsehood'. Although we were conf
[normal]ident in what we had said, J K 
[normal]'s letter threatened legal action and as a small voluntary group with little in the way of funds, we couldn't afford le
[normal]gal advice or representation and therefore we have had to stop issuing the
[normal] leaflet. None of the
[normal] 
[normal]consequential 
[normal]actions 
[normal]threatened by J K 
[normal]have been pursued but we do feel as if we have been bullied into silence. We think this might in part be because we were
[normal] instrumental in an article in the local press 
[normal]that
[normal] revealed the sums earned
[normal] 
[normal]by the Chief Executive of J K  (the former headteacher of J
[normal]) and other local 'executive principals' including at 
[normal]G
[normal]. As the Nottingham Post said, these are well in excess of 
[normal]the pu
[normal]blished pay scales for headteachers in maintained schools and we believe they offer another example of how resources are being misdirected in the new school system
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. 
[normal]The development of academies has involved expenditure that we think would have been be
[normal]tter spent directly on education. Several schools or ‘trusts’ have executive principals or CEOs in addition to headteachers, several of whom are paid ex
[normal]tremely well (
[normal]as reported in the Nottingham Post
[normal] - 
[normal]http://www.nottinghampost.com/Heads-Notts-academies-e
[normal]arn-PM/story-19840343-detail/story.html
[normal]); 
[normal]a wide range of 
[normal]posts are proliferating at academies as evidenced by the Jobs Section of the Not
[normal]tingham Post
[normal].  These posts may perform important roles
[normal], however we question
[normal], for example,
[normal] the educational value of a ‘
[normal]Publicity Officer’ (
[normal]recently advertised by 
[normal]J K Trust) that
[normal] appears to have more to do with marketing than teaching children in classrooms
[normal]. Moreover
[normal] we question whether the move away from local authority provision has resulted in the reduction of bureaucracy that was always claimed by advocates of academisation
[normal].
[normal] Indeed, as multi-academy trusts
[normal] in our area grow, many have established business premises 
[normal]located away from schools.  This again suggests that the argument that academisation would direct resources away from town halls and into schools is proving 
[normal]misguided.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Rather we are seeing new bureaucracies being created, in one case located in 
[normal]a 
[normal]premium 
[normal]location in the 
[normal]business district
[normal] of 
[normal]Nottingham. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. 
[normal]We wonder also how much money the New Schools Network 
[normal](a publicly funded quango run by people close to Michael Gove) 
[normal]h
[normal]as put into supporting the J K
[normal] free schools
[normal] (L
[normal], 
[normal]M
[normal] and N
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]The original two
[normal] had website
[normal]s
[normal] from early on, which featured children apparently wea
[normal]ring the L 
[normal]Free School uniform; the same child models and people pretending to be teachers
[normal] appeared
[normal] on the ‘sister’ M Free School web site (the L 
[normal]FS site has been taken down after the DfE f
[normal]ailed to support it
[normal] and, in its place, at the same address, a website for the N Free School has appeared. 
[normal]H
[normal]ow much public money 
[normal]has been
[normal] wasted there?). In passing, we also question whether the adults and young people who appeared 
[normal]– and still appear - 
[normal]in t
[normal]he website pictures were paid models or member
[normal]s of staff/students at J
[normal] or 
[normal]K
[normal]? If the latter, were proper permissions and procedures followed? Whatever the case, public money has been – and is being – spent to promote these schools, one of which at least wil
[normal]l not come to pass.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CONCLUSION
[normal]14. 
[normal]In short, therefore, those who promote academies and free schools in our area do not engage in debate or proper consultation with those who might be considered legitimate stake-holders, preferring to further their cause 
[normal]by more underhand means including, where they feel it necessary, threat and intimidation. They also appear to be engaged in an undemocratic behind-the-scenes 'network' of dubious conflicted interests, with clear financial benefits for some at the top.
[normal] Fina
[normal]lly, posing as both more effective and efficient than local authority schools, academies and free schools 
[normal]actually 
[normal]appear to waste public money
[normal] - on
[normal] additional management/admin posts or promotion - 
[normal]that could be 
[normal]better spent on the education of children.
[normal] A
[normal]s yet, we have seen little evidence locally that academies are more effective than their local authority predecessors and counterparts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. 
[normal]In conclusion, 
[normal]we very much welcome the Select Committee review, and the opportunity to present our arguments.  As we indicate, we are a relatively small group, and we are all volunteers.  We have no resources of an appreciable nature.  We are clear that we are opposed t
[normal]o 
[normal]a
[normal]cademies and 
[normal]f
[normal]ree 
[normal]s
[normal]chools, for the reasons indicated.  However, our concerns are not just that our criticisms of 
[normal]a
[normal]cademies and 
[normal]f
[normal]ree 
[normal]s
[normal]chools 
[normal]appear
[normal] 
[normal]to be 
[normal]well
[normal]-
[normal]founded, 
[normal]but that genuine community debate on these issues is often being stifled.  As a group 
[normal]of local people, we are well connected to parents, governors and those who work in schools.  We therefore hear what is happening in schools, and how decisions are being made. We know what is going on.  However, as a small group of local campaigners, with v
[normal]ery few resources, we are left with anecdot
[normal]al
[normal] rather than systematic evidence.  
[normal]We also understand that those who seek to stifle debate in the ways we have described have no interest in opening themselves up to serious research
[normal] into
[normal] their processes of gove
[normal]rnance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. 
[normal]Our view is 
[normal]that 
[normal]there is an urgent need to commission serious, detailed and independent research into many of the issues identified in this submission.  There is much that is rotten in the governance of schools currently if our stories are re
[normal]plicated on a much wider scale
[normal] across the country
[normal].  Much more difficult and penetrating questions need to be posed, and 
[normal]appropriate
[normal] 
[normal]research undertaken, if we are to develop a
[normal] 
[normal]more authentic understanding of what is really happening in our schools.  We 
[normal]hope that the Select Committee Review is the start of this process, and that much more work will be undertaken as a result.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key to Case Study schools[bold]:
[normal]A [bold]Primary Academy
[normal], recently ‘converted’; 
[normal]B [bold]Junior School, a school which has been considering and debat
[normal]ing becoming an academy for about a year
[normal];
[normal]C[bold] Primary Academy
[normal], an ‘early converter’;
[normal]E[bold] Primary
[normal], run by the local authority;
[normal]F [bold]Primary School
[normal], a recent ‘converter’;
[normal]G[bold] Academy, a large secondary,  the
[normal] ‘parent’ of a growing cluster of schools, run by the associated G Trust
[normal];
[normal]H [bold]Primary, a large primary which has so far remained
[normal] with the local authority;
[normal]J [bold]Comprehensive, an ‘outstanding’ academy
[normal];
[normal]K[bold] School, less successful secondary school, being supported 
[normal]by J
[normal];
[normal]JK [bold]Trust: schools J and K have become an ‘academy trust’, led by the former headteacher of J
[normal] and has recently added another school which was already an academy;
[normal]L[bold] Free School, a free school proposed by the JK Trust (turned down by DfE)
[normal];
[normal]M [bold]Free School
[normal], a free school, proposed by the JK Trust and approved by the DfE, due to open in September 2014
[normal];
[normal]N [bold]F
[normal]ree School
[normal], a free school proposed by the J K Trust to open on September 2014, close to the area in which the L Free School was proposed, whic
[normal]h was 
[normal]rejected by the DfE; the N
[normal] Free School has been submitted for approval by the DfE but a decision has not yet been made.
