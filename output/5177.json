"&#xa0;\nWRITTEN EVIDENCE FROM ANDREW DUFF MEP1. \nI understand that you wish to focus your enquiry on the \nlegal \nramifications of the emerging \ncorpus of\n \njudicial \ninterpretations in\n national and European courts of\n the Charter of Fundamental Rights\n, and in particular \non the meaning of Protocol \nNo \n30. One\n \nmay \nlook forward to reading the advice \nof the \nlawyers. Ultimately, however, the question \nof British respect for the Charter \nis a political one and requires a parliamentary response. \n2\n. \nMy standing in the matter is as a member of the original \nConvention which drafted the Charter\n and \nof the \nsubsequent \nconstitutional Convention on the Future of Europe\n. \nI \nthen \nrepresented the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference which negotiated the Treaty of Lisbon. \nI \nwas the Parliament's co-Rapporteur on the Charter and then \nR\napporteur on the application by the Czech Republic to \njoin Protocol \nNo \n30, an exercise which \nhas resulted\n in the first negat\nive Opinion by the Parliament against\n a revision of the EU Treaties\n (Article 48(3) TEU)\n.\n \n3\n. No doubt your report will recognise\n,\n first, that the European Union is an integral part of the system of government of the United Kingdom and, second, that \nthe UK is a full member state of the EU on a par with other member states. Unless and until the UK \nnegotiates either to secede from the Union or to settle for a \nyet-to-be-formulated type\n of EU associate membership short of full membership, the UK is bound to respect the terms of its membership as established in international, EU and UK law. \nThe status of the Charter has been determined under the Treaty of Lisbon which the UK, having ratified the treaty, is bound to honour. T\nhe Charter of Fundamental Rights is installed as \na key \npart of the corpus of the primary law of the EU: in the hierarchy of norms, the Charter therefore has primacy over EU secondary legislation and over dome\nstic British law in so far as the Charter\n is applicable. \n4\n. \nWe are all \nwell aware \nof the complex and\n competitive nature of \nEurope's \nmulti-layered rights regime\n, and \nthis phenomenon was explored by\n the House of Commons during the passage of the \nHuman Rights Act \nin \n1998\n whose purpose wa\ns to make more directly applicable the European Convention on Human Rights\n (ECHR)\n. However, since the Human Rights Acts came into being, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been interspersed as a \n'much wider' \nbinding instrument at the level of the EU\n, offering, in its Article 52(3),\n ‘more extensive protection’ than \nthe ECHR.\n \nSo\n e\nven if \nthe ECHR were to be relegated by a repeal of \nthe Human Rights Act, the EU Charter would remain part of \nBritish\n domestic law. \n5\n. \nThe Charter is now mandatory for the EU's ‘institutions, bodies, offices and agencies’ – in other words, all statutory authorities in the Union – when and in so far as they are applying or interpreting EU law or implementing its decisions.\n (Article 51 of the Charter says 'only when they are implementing' Union law: a clearer formulation, in my view, and one closer to the case-law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), would be 'when they act within the scope' of Union law.\n) In any case, t\nhe Charter binds the UK as a member state of the Union and \nwill therefore have\n \nsome\n effect \nor other \nwithin the UK \nin all matters where competences are conferred on the Union or powers \nare \nvested in the EU institutions and its agents \n– of which the UK \nGovernment\n is one \n(Articl\ne 6(1) TEU).\n \n6. The salience of fundamental rights to the history and evolution of the European Union should not be underestimated. Today the promotion of \na \nrights\n-based EU citizenship\n can be considered as \ncentral to\n the integration process. The Charter is the legal manifestation of the Union's political commitment. It articulates the rights and principles which shape the actions of the institutions and sets the benchmarks for countries which seek to join the Union. A serious and persistent breach of the Charter would jeopardise continuing membership of the Union. \n7. The Charter was drafted, famously, 'as if' it were to become mandatory, and was treated with respect - certainly by the European Commission and European Parliament - since its signature at Nice in 2000. The \nECJ\n, too, began to make references to the \ndocument as one of its \ninterpretative \nsources before the Charter\n actually took on binding character at the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in December 2009. \n8. I labour these points somewhat because while the Charter has been underestimated in Britain it is seen elsewhere as \na key part of the constitutional order of the Union, \nhelping\n to bridge the credibility gap between the EU and the citizen. \nThe Charter lends itself to good governance, suitable for all, convenient for none. \nIt is a comprehensive and visible catalogue of the rights, values and principles which \nshape\n contemporary Europe. It makes the Union and its states better prepared for subsequent advances in integration as well as for further enlargement. It sets a uniform standard of rights across the Union which is the highest in the world. \nThe elusive\n ‘future of Europe’\n would be unthinkable without the Charter which, reflecting as it does \na \nbroad \nco\nnsensus between left and right, religious and \nsecular\n, \nestablishes the template for EU citizenship. \n9\n. \nThe British, it is clear, seem exceptionally sensitive to the impact of the Charter. Yet the Charter Convention was\n in no doubt that \nall EU \nstates would have to adjust their national approaches to fundamental rights once the Charter became binding, and that this process of adjustment would also be a process of approximation between common law and Roman law traditions. The conferral of competences on the Union in the field of justice and home affairs would accelerate and add e\nxtra point to the\nse processes, and the Charter has rightly become\n a basic document in the efforts being undertaken to increase\n mutual cooperation between national public administrations, customs, police and judicial authorities. The EU’s \nrecent \nenlargement, the emergence of a wide range of common security measures in reaction to terrorism and international organised crime, data protection, border management, visa policy and efforts to forge common asylum and immigration policies all impinge directly and sensitively upon the terrain of hum\nan rights and civil liberties. As the emerging case law of the ECJ bears out, t\nhe Charter is highly relevant to the EU institutions as they both formulate and implement policy in all these areas. \n10\n. \nIn the Charter Convention, as well as subsequently, the UK \nGovernment\n has stressed the importance of the Charter's \nfour horizontal articles which \naim to \nset out its scope and limitations, its field of application, the difference of interpretation between rights and principles, the level of protection afforded, and the prohibition of abuse of the rights. Typically, the UK \nalso put weight on the \nCharter’s explanatory memorandum\n which was \ndrafted by the Praesidium of the Convention as a useful tool of interpretation\n.\n These explanations \nare not in themselves justiciable – and were never intended to be so\n, but they \nassist the courts in defining what is a ‘right’ which applies directly and what is a ‘principle’ which requires to be given form in EU legislation before it becomes justiciable. \n11\n. The e\nxplanations \nare \nuseful in order to elucidate cases where the Charter goes further than the comparable provision of the ECHR, thereby providing a level of protection which is wider than that provided for in the UK Human Rights Act. One good example is Article 1 of the Charter (human dignity), which does not appear in the ECHR. Likewise, the right to good administration (Article 41 of the Charter) has no equivalent in the ECHR. Article 47 of the Charter (right to an effective remedy and a fair trial) is meant to afford wider protection than its ECHR eq\nuivalents (Articles 6 and 13). \nThe explanations are also pertinent to the understanding of those\n provisions of the Charter that stem from provisions of Protocols of the ECHR which the UK has not ratified. One good example concerns the principle of \nne bis in idem\n whose formulation in Article 4 of Protocol 7 of the ECHR is weak. Article 50 of the Charter, on the other hand, following case law at the Court of Justice in Schengen cases, is trenchant. \n1\n2\n. Uniform application is a very important objective of the Charter. The Charter addresses the system of the Union \nas a whole and not just part\n of it\n: it has\n to be applied uniformly in order to ensure legal certainty and coherence throughout the Union, applicable to all member states equally. This is the \nin principle \nline to be taken by the \nEuropean Court of Justice\n and \nit will be likely followed in this matter by \nthe E\nuropean Court of Human Rights\n (ECtHR)\n. \nIt falls to the ECJ to assess the compliance of national law which implements EU law with the provisions of the Charter. \nHere the existence of Protocol No 30 is a problem should its purpose be to erect flood barriers against the tide of EU rights law which is intended to find its way up into Lord Denning’s famously English rivers and estuaries. The sight of the European Union being picky and choosy with its own rights regime is hardly edifying, and the UK’s launch of a Protocol which it sold \nto the British public and \nParliament\n as a tool to limit the force of the Charter in the UK won no plaudits from Britain’s EU partners.\n \nThere was always the risk that where Britain led others would follow. Poland, for its own reasons, joined Protocol No 30 and the Czech Republic later sought to do so. One \nmay note, too,\n that \nHungary has recently \nadopted a cavalier approach to the constitutional norms of the European Union\n, \nthereby setting up \npotential conflicts of interpretation between the Hungarian and EU courts. \n1\n3\n. The exposure of English common law to the law of other nations is large and continuing, and not just consequential on the formal international conventions to which the UK is a party. Over the years, the British Law Lords have made impressive contributions to the development of international comparative law. Where the ECHR is concerned, British judges have been rightly mindful of the need to maintain as uniform an interpretation as possible despite the heady variety of different legal cultures across the now 47 states of the Council of Europe. As Lord Bingham warned, ‘national application, beyond the margin of national appreciation for which the Convention allows, must inevitably lead to significantly differential application between state and state’.\n \n14\n. While the ECHR remains among the general principles of the U\nnion’s law (Article 6(3) TEU)\n, it is the Charter \nup\non which the Union seeks to build a superior rights regime under the jurisdiction of the supranational Court at Luxembourg which, all things considered, and as part of the Union framework, can be expected to be more consistently reliable than its much larger and more diverse international counterpart at Strasbourg. The risk of incoherence between the two courts will be reduced by the imminent accession of the EU to the ECHR\n, as ordained by the Lisbon treaty (Article 6(2) TEU)\n. \nThe accession by the EU to the ECHR was required not least by the UK \nGovernment\n as the \nquid pro quo\n for agreeing to give the Charter mandatory status. \n15\n. The effect of this accession will be twofold. First, the EU will enjoy much the same relationship with the ECHR and the Strasbourg Court as that enjoyed by its member states. The \nECtHR\n \nwill become the external supervisor of the\n \nECJ\n as \nthe latter\n \ndevelops human rights law specifically to cater for the scope and field of application of the law of the European Union. \nAfter accession is completed, \nthe \nECHR \nwill have to be seen and interpreted in and by the UK \nnot only directly \nby virtue of the Human Rights Act\n \nbut also \nthrough the prism of the Charter at least in so far as Eu\nropean Union law is concerned. \nAccession will allow cases to be brought at Strasbourg against the EU institutions for alleged violations of the classical human rights as prescribed in the ECHR. A key issue in the accession negotiations is how to ensure that the Luxembourg Court will be able to judge on all matters of EU law before it may be said that all domestic remedies have been exhausted, after which exhaustion the route to Strasbourg is open. \n16\n. Pending the delivery of the\n \nanticipated preliminary ruling of \nthe ECJ, the process of the EU’s accession to the ECHR is not yet concluded, and\n I will not deal further with the matter here.\n But I do believe that the overall settlement will be wholly beneficial to both courts and to the quality of rights jurisprudence in Europe. I am confident that the Court of Justice will soon act as a reference point for the ECtHR, setting high standards of case law in areas where the Charter goes further than the Convention, notably in cross-border and trans-national issues and in the ‘new’ areas of social, civil and environmental rights. \nI cannot see why it is in the interests of British citizens to be isolated from these developments. \n1\n7\n. In the light of the close association between the ECHR and the Charter, it \nis paradoxical\n that the then Labour \nGovernment\n chose to treat these two comparable European instruments in very different ways. While the intention of the Human Rights Act was to give the ECHR direct effect in the UK, that same \nGovernment\n and \nParliament\n sought to blunt and obscure the effect of the Charter in the UK by insisting on Protocol No 30 to the Lisbon treaty\n. \nIn 2000 \na\n \nBritish \nMinister of Europe, more than usually erratic, expostulated \nto the press \nthat the Charter \nwould be\n ‘no more binding \nthan the Beano\n’\n. \nIn 2007 t\nhe \nPrime M\ninister \nboasted to\n the House of Commons: \n‘\nIt is absolutely clear that we have an opt-out from both the Charter and judicial and home affairs\n’\n.\n \nThe self-evident air of superiority or exceptionalism \nin rights matters \nevinced by \nsuccessive British ministers\n \nwa\ns\n and is\n, in my view,\n \nbadly \nill-judged. \nOne recalls that t\nhe original drafters of the ECHR, many of whom were British, presumed that the Convention would not apply much to the UK but, rather, to those European states which had succumbed to fascism, Nazism and communism. But, as we now know, many judgments of the ECtHR have in the event been levelled at the UK, especially in the fields of security of the person, right to fair trials and right to privacy where English law can be said to be deficient. \n18\n. \nWhatever the political argument behind Protocol\n No 30\n, it has had the effect of disturbing the principle of the uniform application of EU law. The \nUK’s attempt to shield itself against the full ju\nsticiability of the Charter \nimpair\ns\n the Charter’s value for everyone else. \nParticularly worrying is \nthe Protocol’s assertion that UK courts will apply and interpret that Charter ‘st\nrictly in accordance’ with the \nfamous \ne\nxplanations\n – a statement which would seem to diverge radically \nfrom the Treaty which says, merely, that the courts will pay ‘due regard’ thereto.\n \n19\n. Likewise, all states accept\n \nthat the Charter in itself does not extend ‘in any way’ the competences of the Union.\n But the bald statement in Protocol No 30 that the Charter ‘does not create new rights or principles’ goes some way further than the Charter itself, which says \nsimply \nthat it ‘does not extend the application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks as defined in the Treaties’.\n The Protocol may well \nbe found in \nconflict with the EU legal doctrine of implied powers, espec\nially as and when the legislature\n chooses to codify\n relevant Court of Justice case-\nlaw \ngrounded\n \ninter alia\n on the basis of the Charter. \n2\n0\n. The UK’s main justification of its Protocol appears to have been an apprehension that Title IV of the Charter, entitled Solidarity, could lead to the demolition of its \nown f\nlexible labour markets. \nThe UK sought to limit the possibility that the Charter would give the EU new cause to legislate in areas, notably labour law, which would breach its \nbrazen\n \n'\nred lines\n'\n. \nHowever, w\nhile \nbeing \nwholly \nconsistent with the E\nCHR, and as the famous e\nxplanations explain, Title IV has \na wider scope to address the needs\n, anxieties and aspirations\n of contemporary European society. It draws not only on the ECHR but also on the European Social Charter (1961), the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers (1989)\n, on standard ILO norms reflected by collective bargaining agreements at national and EU level,\n \non extensive EU legislation and \non case law of the Court of Justice. The Charter’s principles in respect of social policy become significant only \nas and \nwhen articulated in terms of EU legislation or executive action. \nArticle 153(5) TFEU specifically precludes EU interference in matters of pay, the right of association, the right to strike and the right to impose lock-outs. Article 153(4) already lays down that no social policy provision of the EU shall affect the right of a member state to establish its own social welfare system or to affect the financing thereof. \n21\n. In addition to these sector specific safeguards, there is the general obligation on the Union to respect the national identities of the member states ‘inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional’ (Article 4(2) TEU). Moreover, the Charter must always be applied with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity\n (Article 5(3) TEU)\n.\n \n22\n. Given \nall of \nthe above, t\nherefore, it is difficult to conceive of any circumstances in which litigation using t\nhe Charter \ncould actually overturn the nostrums of British labour law or pay, social security, and employment policy\n. \nAttempts to approach the Court of Justice either directly or indirectly by an aggrieved somebody who is unemployed or homeless in search of a job or a house will certainly fail. The Court will be assuredly conservative in its treatment of these issues (unless a case can be shown to concern directly and individually an employee of one of the EU institutions).\n23\n. \nIt is worth recalling \nhere \nthat Poland\n, the other signatory of Protocol No 30,\n was keen to stop the Charter from curbing its own right to legislate in matters of public morality, family law, abortion, gay rights etc.\n Bizarrely, Poland also sought to emphasise, in adopting the British Protocol which was defensive against social rights as laid down in Title I\nV, that it (unlike the UK) ‘\nfully re\nspects social and labour rights’\n in the spirit of the Solidarity movement.\n \nSubsequently, the Protocol appears to have been of no importance to the Polish judiciary, being regarded as an expression of the ideology of the then Law &amp; Justice party government\n of the Kaczynski brothers\n. A \nPolish \nconstitutional mechanism has \nsince \nbeen devised whereby Poland \ncan\n decide to amend or to withdraw from the Protocol\n, and such a \npossibility \nremains under review\n. \n24\n. \nThe Czech Republic\n, at\n the behest of its President\n Klaus\n, took the more eurosceptic stance. It achieved at the time of the \nLisbon\n negotiations, its own categorical Declaration 53 which speaks of its concerns about the impact of the Charter on the principles of subsidiarity, conferral of competences, respect for national constitutions\n and international agreements. \nThe official grou\nnd\n on which \nMr Klaus\n \nwas later to insist\n that the Czech Republic should join Protocol \nNo 30 \nwas \nhis\n concern about the \ncontinuing\n v\nalidity of the Benes Decrees\n \nthat dealt with \nthe expropriation of the property and deportation of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia aft\ner the Second World War.\n \nMr Klaus’s initiative was of questionable \nlegal merit, not least because the matter of the Benes Decrees was comprehensively and definitively dealt with in the Czech treaty of accession to the EU. Moreover, s\nuch concerns had been\n absent from the political debate until early 2009 and were not \nmentioned in submissions to the Czech c\nonstitutional court in either of \nits\n \njudgments\n on the Lisbon treaty\n.\n Indeed, in the then government\n'\ns official mandate for the negotiation of the \nLisbon\n treaty it was a priority to establish a uniform standard of protection of human rights. \nIt is important to note that subsequent to the negative Opinion of the European Parliament and to the retirement of Mr Klaus, the Czech bid to join Protocol No 30 has been dropped – presumably for good.\n25\n. \nWe cannot, therefore, look to Warsaw or Prague for enlightenment as to the nature of Protocol No 30 beyond saying that its existence complicates matters. I still marvel at the \nassertion\n i\nn the Court of Appeal\n by\n the repre\nsentative \nof the UK \nGovernment\n th\nat the purpose of the Protocol wa\ns \n‘\nnot to prevent the Charter from applying to the UK, but to explain its effect\n’\n.\n \nWhatever else the Protocol is, self-explanatory it is not. It is unsurprising in these circumstances that t\nhe High Court incline\nd\n towards the view that Protocol \nNo 30 \ncould be construed as a general opt-out from the Charter, \nassuming\n that the Charter does not have direct effect in the UK. \n26\n. \nMy own view, on the other hand, inclines to that of \nAdvocate-General Trstenjak \nin her Opinion of \n22 September 2011. \nFirst, with regard to the Preamble of the Protocol, \nt\nhe eighth recital of the Preamble establishes that the purpose of the Protocol is to \n‘\nclarify certain aspects of the application of the Charter\n’\n. The seventh and twelfth recitals make it clear that, regardless of the Protocol, all other EU law applies fully to \nPoland\n and the \nUK\n. \nThe Protocol is only relevant, therefore, if the Charter were to add to the existing general principles of EU law, or \nto be\n wider in scope, or \nto reduce\n the limitations on rights in comparison to the general principles. \nI agree with A-G \nTrstenjak\n that\n the Preamble reaffirms the \n‘\nfundamental validity\n’\n of the Charter. \n27\n. Second, with regard to the f\nield of application\n,\n \nArticle 1(1) \nof the Protocol \nsupplements Article\n 51(2) of the Charter. Its intention is not to \nextend\n the ability of the courts to find that \nUK\n law is inconsistent with the Charter. However, neither does it seek to \ncurtail\n the ability of the courts to assert a fundamental rights jurisdiction by reference to the provisions of the Charter. And in any case the courts must abide by fundamental rights as prescribed in the ECHR and as part of the general principles of EU law under the provisions of Article 6 TEU. The general principles enjoy constitutional status and may be relied upon by individuals in the courts. In this regard, people in \nPoland\n and the \nUK\n would seem to be in exactly the same position as people in all other EU states. \n28\n. Third, with regard to s\ncope\n, t\nhe principles in Title IV \nof the Charter \nare required to have become\n the subject of national legislation before they become justiciable. Article 1(2) \nof the Protocol \nconfirms Article 51(1) of the Charter that the Charter does not create justiciable rights as between private individuals. It also attempts to clarify Article 52(1) of the Charter, and may have been conceived as an attempt to blunt the direct effect of the Charter. Yet it remains unclear which articles of Title IV would be regarded by the Court of Justice as having direct effect. And wherever \nPoland\n and the \nUK\n have provided for such rights in national law, there is no prohibition of justiciability on behalf of the ECJ. Moreover, as noted above, to the extent that Title IV represents general principles of EU law, the courts in \nPoland\n and the \nUK\n are bound to apply its provisions directly. \n29\n. Fourth, with regard to i\nnterpretation\n, \nArticle 2 of the Protocol seeks to clarify Article 52(4) and\n (6) of the Charter. Where the Charter refers to national laws and practices\n,\n \nit\n refers specifically, in relation to \nPoland\n and the \nUK\n, to Polish and British laws and practices, respectively. (It could hardly be otherwise.)\n3\n0\n. \nIn conclusion, Protocol \nNo 30 \ndoes not exempt \nthe \nUK and Poland from the binding provisions of the Charter. It is not an \n'\nopt-out\n'\n. It does not amend the Charter. Yet the very existence of the Protocol has given rise to legal uncertainty and political confusion\n not only in Poland and the UK but to all other states\n. \nI\nf \nthe Protocol \nwere ever to be interpreted as having the effect of limiting the scope or force of the Charter\n'\ns provisions, the result would be to lower the protection of fundamental rights afforded to people in Poland and the UK, and would therefore undermine the efforts of the EU to reach and maintain a uniformly high level of protection. \n31\n. \nAs it stands, however\n,\n the Protocol would seem not to alter the legal position which would pr\nevail if it were not to exist. That being the case, the effect of i\nts provisions\n, if any,\n would seem to apply \nas much to other \nmember states\n as it applies to Poland and the UK\n.\n \n3\n2\n. All in all, i\nt is \ndifficult to avoid the judgement that the UK \nGovernment\n launched Protocol No 30 in the first place for entirely political reasons and not because it harboured genuine legal concerns about the Charter. \nMy \nrecommendation\n to your \nCommittee, indeed, is that in the interests of legal certainty and political solidarity \nyou recommend to \nParliament that the UK\n abrogates Protocol No 30 at the next available \nordinary \nrevision of the EU Treaties.\n \n33\n. One \nfinal \nrelated \nissue\n concerns \nthe number of ECHR Protocols to which the EU should accede\n when it signs and ratifies the Convention\n. The European Parliament argues that the EU should sign up to all Convention Protocols which are compatible with the Charter \nof Fundamental Rights \non the grounds\n not only\n that the Union is \nmore than \nan aggregate of its member states \nand \nenjoys a federal character \nsui generis\n, but also\n \nthat the Charter is addressed in the first instance to the \nEuropean \nUnion and \nonly in the second instance \nto the states\n by virtue of their membership of the Union\n. \nThe UK \nGovernment\n, h\nowever, \ntake\ns\n the view that the Union should sign up only to those Convention Protocols to which all member states are signatories – in effect only Protocols No 1 and 6\n ECHR\n. I hope your \nCommittee\n will support the European Parliament in this matter in order to avoid any regression from the Charter: it would surely be wise \nfor the House of Commons \nto follow the logic of the Lisbon treaty which sought to \nattain\n the highest level and most uniform and comprehensive protection of\n rights\n for all citizens of the European Union – not excluding th\nos\ne \nof British nationality and of other EU nationalities residing in the United Kingdom\n. \n34\n. \nIt would appear that the debate about creating \na separate UK Bill of Rights\n has run its course. That being the case\n, the British parliaments and courts must learn to take full cognisance of the EU Charter as the main source of rights law \nthroughout the Union and at all levels\n. The Charter is \nthe essential prism through which the ECHR must henceforth be interpreted\n in so far and as long as \nthe UK remains a full member state of the EU. An essential condition of full membership is allegiance to the ECHR and the Charter. \nAny attempt to reduce the UK’s legal and political adherence to the ECHR and the Charter will jeopardise Britain’s membership of the European Union. Your \nCommittee\n would do well to make this point. \nJanuary 2014\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2013-208\n \nAs Mr Justice Mostyn opines in AB v.
