defaultWritten evidence submitted by Kimberly defaultGilmpourdefault (WSC106)defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe number of women in STEM academic careers decline as women move up the career ladder for both professional and personal reasons.  There are limited senior women to 
defaultact as mentors and role models for junior women. This is particularly true for senior women with children. Many senior women chose not to have children and therefore the predominant role model if that of a childless scientist. This may not be true, but it 
defaultis the perceived image. Also, scientific research often requires working at odd hours and this is not always compatible with having children or other (older parents) caring responsibilities.
defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? 
defaultWhat are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
defaultMany women transition to careers where they can use their scientific skills in a different context. These careers include journalism; medical w
defaultriting/editing, working for a pharmaceutical/clinical trials company where they can work fixed hours, and teaching. Their scientific skills re useful/required in all these sectors.
defaultWhat should universities and the higher education sector do to retain women
default graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
defaultCancer research UK when it was ICRF had a maternity program where a woman took 4 months full pay maternity leave, then returned to work ½ time on full pay for an addition
defaultal 2 months before returning back full-time. 
defaultThis encouraged woman
default to take slightly shorted maternity leave and 
defaultencouraged
default them to write papers, startup cell lines/mouse experiments during the 2 month ½ time transition periord. It also meant that women did
defaultn’t ‘fall behind’ their male colleagues when they 
defaulthad

defaultchildren.
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the retention of women in academic STEM careers? 
defaultThe government should encourage alternative patterns of work and leave. Currently women fe
defaultel they should to take 6-9 months maternity leave and few companies offer financial incentive for women taking shorter leave periods. Greater flexibility of sharing leave with the other partner (not just some of it, but all of it) would help.
