[[[Written evidence submitted by The Crown Estate (CCS19)]]]

[[[Summary:]]]

[[[The key messages articulated below can be summarised as the following:-]]]&#xa0;The Crown Estate welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Commons Select Committee inquiry into carbon capture and storage (CCS).  The focus of our response is on the offshore transport and storage components, as this is where we are able to bring to bear an in-depth understanding of the potential benefits that CCS could have, as well as the barriers to development and ways to overcome them.  The statements contained are in the context of The Crown Estate’s role and responsibilities with regards to rights to leasing of carbon dioxide transportation and storage infrastructure within areas on and beneath the UK seabed that we manage.  The Crown Estate has been working with the CCS industry on project specific cases, (including power station developers, potential industrial users and potential storage providers) as well as through the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force in 2012/13, which was chaired by the CCSA, to identify ways of helping to reduce the cost of deploying CCS infrastructure and promoting an intelligent systems design in the 2020s. The Task Force signalled the importance of storage to the cost and deployment of this technology and highlighted aspects such as storage site availability and store viability as being critical to its delivery.  We are now leading an industry Transport and Storage Development Group to take forward recommendations of the Task Force and assist delivery of proven storage sites and transport infrastructure.During the past year, we signed the UK’s first two Agreements for Lease for the permanent geological storage of CO2, representing a positive milestone in the plan to build a demonstration project in the UK. These agreements provide exclusive time-limited options with pre-agreed terms for leases, allowing developers to progress their projects through to a Final Investment Decision (FID).We suggest that any policy developed for CCS needs to enable opportunistic deployment for all sectors that can make use of the infrastructure, e.g. the offshore oil and gas sector (enhanced oil recovery (EOR) &amp; enhanced gas recovery (EGR)), natural gas processing, coal and gas fired power generation, and industrial processes such as iron and steel.  In order to de-risk the delivery of the UK’s aspirations for energy security, decarbonisation and retention of its industries in a low carbon world, we believe that domestic policy should support a clear route to market across all these sectors that can leverage an early clear route to market for the power sector.In our view policy should help drive both ends of the CCS chain (capture, along with transport and storage) towards deployment of full chain infrastructure (through incentives and obligations), as well as clearly setting out how this sits alongside the wider discussion on energy security.  This should include providing incentives for bringing storage forward at a pace that delivers de-risked stores, in parallel with designing and developing new low carbon fossil fuel power stations.&#xa0;

[[[Questions posed in call for evidence:]]]Each of the questions asked by the Committee has been considered in turn.  We have focused the submission of evidence primarily on those in which we can add most value from the experience we have gained in our role at The Crown Estate.It was clear from our work on the cost reduction taskforce that capture technology providers will be able to answer this in far more precise detail than we could offer on post-combustion, pre-combustion or oxyfuel techniques and product delivery.  The capabilities of CO2 transport and storage technologies have been demonstrated elsewhere, for example in North America and Norway, over many years and experience in these operations is best provided by the oil and gas industry.It is widely acknowledged that tackling climate change requires a global response.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) considers successful deployment of CCS as critical to global efforts in mitigating climate change and to keeping global warming temperature rises below 2°C. For the UK, the 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 (as defined by the Climate Change Act 2008) requires a significant change in the way we generate and use energy. Projections from the Committee on Climate Change show that the power sector will need to be largely decarbonised by around 2030 in order to be on track to hit the 2050 targets (given the difficulties in achieving emissions reductions elsewhere in the economy). Many alternate scenarios can be created as to what the energy mix could or should look like in the future; but one thing which seems clear is that by just shifting the fossil fuel use from coal to gas will not in itself deliver the targets that are required in the Climate Change Act (2008) – particularly given the extent of “locked-in” fossil fuel plant, which has been made more certain by the gas generation strategy and the grandfathering of gas plants under the Emissions Performance Standard.  CCS can be used with both coal or gas power stations and therefore early deployment of transport and storage infrastructure can provide an effective hedge, keeping options open for either fuel within the nation’s low carbon portfolio.Both DECC and the Committee on Climate Change identify the primary options for power sector decarbonisation to 2030 as (in no particular order): large scale renewables, nuclear, CCS, and energy efficiency. DECC’s CCS Roadmap identifies that CCS has the potential to be one of the most cost effective technologies for decarbonisation of the UK’s power and industrial sectors. In the power sector, CCS has a unique place in providing a continuing role for flexible fossil fuel capacity that is able to respond to demand in the way that other low carbon technologies cannot. Of course it is understood that the three-stage process of CCS, including transportation and storage, has yet to be demonstrated on large scale power stations, which is why the successful deployment of projects in the DECC commercialisation programme is critical.Beyond the power sector, CCS is almost unique in its potential to help reduce emissions from industries where there are no alternative abatement technologies e.g. cement, fertiliser and steel production processes.  Whilst we feel that CCS power projects are likely to come before industrial CCS; smaller scale industrial projects do need to start sooner rather than later in order to leverage synergies wherever possible to ensure that learning occurs in sufficient time to hit decarbonisation targets beyond 2030.  DECC and the Committee on Climate Change have outlined a wide range of scenarios for the relative contribution of low carbon technologies in recent publications.

[[[ (GW) – note that all the scenarios presented reach a power sector emissions intensity of 50g/KWh]]]Our observations on these scenarios are as follows:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The scenarios demonstrate that CCS could potentially make a very significant contribution to decarbonisation by 2030 – with up to 15GW of capacity envisaged.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As the level of ambition for 2030 power sector decarbonisation increases, the need for CCS to make a contribution also increases. CCS makes a very significant contribution to all of the scenarios which hit 50g/KWh by 2030 (for example 9GW in DECC’s scenarios; 10-15GW in CCC’s scenarios).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; CCS could play an important balancing role alongside other low carbon technologies such as nuclear and renewables.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The risk of not developing CCS is that decarbonisation options become more limited, and power sector decarbonisation becomes much harder to achieve.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst the scenarios show potential for CCS, they also highlight the uncertainty power generators face in making investment decisions without targeted policies that go beyond the renewables focus of the EMR Delivery Plan. In order to give greater confidence to the CCS industry, it will be important for the government to provide early and consistent signals over the level of ambition for decarbonisation; and further details on to how CCS will be supported beyond the current commercialisation programme. It will be important to consider the contribution CCS can make in reducing industrial emissions as well as power sector emissions. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]The storage space (and use of) in the North Sea creates an export opportunity for selling the service of permanently disposed CO2 that originated from European countries needing storage.  Many countries will be looking to the North Sea rather than using dry land storage potential.&#xa0;In relation to a North Sea “storage market”, there is an opportunity for large scale deployment through the development of infrastructure (pipelines to storage) in a coordinated manner. It would seem prudent for the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and other North Sea basin countries to collaborate in order to drive forward early projects.  This would help to increase trade and supply chain opportunities.&#xa0;Potential economic opportunities will exist for UK supply chains that currently support the North Sea oil and gas industry.  If a CO2 transport and storage sector is encouraged to develop it will be possible to transfer skills, services and supply chains from oil and gas construction and operations.  Any decline in North Sea activity could be compensated for in CTS activity.  Growth could also be possible if CTS deployment was to leverage oil and gas activity in both conventional storage and CO2 enhanced hydrocarbon recovery.  Any roll-out of CCS power and industrial plant will increase the need for supply chains providing capture technologies and associated services. &#xa0;The Crown Estate is very supportive of the £1bn commercialisation programme capital grant and contract for difference support being provided by the Government for the two early projects – these projects will help understand deployment and operational barriers along with the viability of full scale CCS power generation. In a European context this is very progressive and an excellent kick-start for the sector.  This section will focus on where we see the barriers that can potentially prevent CCS being a viable option for energy decarbonisation and which can create a gap between aspiration and delivery in the UK.  These barriers can be seen as risks that need to be managed and mitigated.  We have provided some suggestions for mitigating these risks.

[[[Contract]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[ for Difference]]]&#xa0;The EMR framework offers a suite of measures to support and encourage the deployment of non-commercial technologies for energy system decarbonisation. In respect of CCS, it is the Contract for Difference Feed in Tariff (CfD FiT) that will be used initially to remunerate both of the projects that are currently preferred bidders in the DECC commercialisation competition. This FiT is suitable for the first demonstration projects alongside capital grants because they are full chain and have an integrated transport and storage solution allowing for risk and liability sharing to be established ahead of final investment decision (FID).&#xa0;CfD FiT focuses on, and is designed for, the investment risks involved in power generation projects.  As with the first commercialisation projects, this approach only addresses the risk and risk sharing for full chain CCS projects.  However transport and permanent storage of CO2 as a disposal service faces a number of complex investment and deployment issues with risks that are quite different from those in power generation.&#xa0;In order for future CCS projects to benefit from CfD FiTs, they will therefor need to have reached agreement across the full CCS chain.  Power generators generally do not have the expertise to develop CO2 transport and storage solutions, and are dependent on third parties to agree novel business structures and counterparty arrangements to deal with the complex new value chain.  Under the EMR framework there is therefore a significant drag on power generators even being able to negotiate a CfD.  Furthermore, who, without an incentive, could deliver transport and storage infrastructure ahead of a guaranteed income?  &#xa0;Another barrier to the development of efficiently sized CTS infrastructure under EMR arises because CfD FiT  funding is directed to the power generator only.  As power plant developers will not build capture plant without guaranteed assurances of access to a transport and storage solution project development will likely be limited to point to point projects rather than encourage over sizing and sharing of infrastructure.  Key to the success of CCS delivery will be avoiding the uncoordinated deployment of full chain integrated projects over the next decade, as this would do little to promote an integrated transport infrastructure approach or the development of storage hubs – both of which will lead to substantial cost reductions.  Such ‘point to point’ CCS projects will suffer economically from having unnecessarily expensive transport and storage systems.  &#xa0;Because of these timing, business model and coordination barriers, a significant risk therefore exists that CCS will not become a viable option for power generators because the necessary disposal infrastructure will not be independently built.  The Crown Estate is developing an understanding of the market failures that we believe will stand in the way of the development of a mature CTS infrastructure and therefore CCS as a viable power generation option.  Workshops with industry representatives have provided a comprehensive background to various sources of market failures impeding the development of CTS infrastructure. &#xa0;The activities of Capture, Transport and Storage of CO2 differ by industry type, risk/return profile and their development stage and must therefore be tackled appropriately. Storage development lead times can be around 10 years for a new unexplored site compared to an average of 5 years for power generation projects.  Encouraging up-front investment in de-risking storage and providing ’proven and bankable’ stores will need to be a key policy focus. &#xa0;In light of the above, The Crown Estate believes there are risks in the current approach to ‘rolling out’ CCS on power generation beyond the demonstration phase and we see that this could be addressed through enhancing EMR with additional interventions that recognise the particular complexities of the CCS value chain.  The power sector needs to see the requirement and purpose of CCS and needs to have the storage solutions delivered to them.&#xa0;

[[[Capacity Market]]]We suggest that existing government policy for CCS and the EMR capacity mechanism in combination with the gas generation strategy and Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) creates a further barrier to the development transport and storage infrastructure due to no clear imperative for developers to invest in CO2 disposal.  &#xa0;The Capacity Market is designed to ensure there is sufficient capacity in place to cope with peaks and troughs in demand.  This can, however, lead to a large amount of money being spent on plants with ever-decreasing load factors over the next 15-20 years.  The alternative is that this plant is fitted with CCS and efficiently utilises a transport and storage infrastructure solution that has been facilitated through smart policies in addition to EMR.  ETI energy system modelling has indicated that deployment of CCS-equipped power generation will lead to a lower overall cost of decarbonisation for the UK economy. &#xa0;

[[[Carbon Price]]]Carbon pricing can only influence power generator behaviour not that of the companies who are potential CTS infrastructure developers.  Whilst the carbon price floor can be a market mechanism to drive investment by producers of carbon emissions it does exacerbate the timing, coordination and phasing problem highlighted above.  Without a penalty on emissions commensurate with the cost of building the full CCS chain there are not likely to be investments in CTS infrastructure.  With the current carbon price floor trajectory there is a high risk that investment decisions on CCS-equipped gas power plants would not be influenced until the mid-late 2020s.&#xa0;

[[[Industrial CCS]]]Industrial decarbonisation is likely to require its own bespoke set of policies and support interventions.  However, it will require CTS infrastructure to be in place in advance if the least cost pathway is to be achieved and to ensure that industry is not adversely affected.  Logically this means that the use of CTS in power should be planned and designed with the whole system in mind.&#xa0;

[[[ the barriers]]]To de-risk the viability of CCS as cost effective decarbonisation option policy interventions are required to address the structural problem that CO2 transport and storage needs a development pathway in parallel to EMR.  As it stands, EMR requires all CTS infrastructure to be funded from payments made to the power station (a trickle-down funding approach).  An alternative would be a direct revenue stream for transporting and storing CO2, which results in removing (or lowering) one element of contractual risk for both the power station and the transport/store operator.  As all of the initial projects would by definition, need to be full chain, direct funding for the CTS infrastructure would not significantly impact the risk for early projects.  Any payment to the Transport and Store would net directly off payments that would have been made to the power station under EMR.  Once multiple CCS projects are operating in the UK, direct funding can reduce risk for all parties by providing greater price certainty and lower contractual risk.  The eventual contracting structure that arises in the industry will partially dictate the impact of this intervention.  &#xa0;Revenue could most likely come from the CfD FiT funding body that is paid via a levy on suppliers and be delivered in the form of a fee per tonne of CO2.  If the revenue would otherwise have been supplied by a CfD FiT such a scheme could be reasonably cost-neutral. &#xa0;Information on most of the potential storage sites in the UKCS is still sparse.  Collection of the necessary data is time-consuming and at the later stages of site characterisation costly. The gap between initial site screening and operation therefore puts significant capital at risk.  This will be most noticeable when developing new geological formations.  Not surprisingly, storage is therefore currently regarded as the most risky part of the CCS chain for project developers. Specifically targeted storage exploration subsidies focused on early-stage development of the industry, could be used to target ‘new’ areas of storage or incremental work at existing storage sites (which would bring wider benefits).  A lower limit on pre-FID exploration and appraisal cost is likely to be in the region of +£50m per storage site.  The incentive could be relatively revenue neutral for Government if it was associated with a project which would otherwise have required a higher CfD FiT.  Any exploration subsidies could encourage early appraisal of storage and provide benefits through the de-risking of the wider storage area and gains from knowledge sharing to the CTS industry.Investment in storage site appraisal could also be encouraged through different tax break options. One option is a cross-sector tax break which would allow losses or some form of ‘allowances for investment’ to be transferred from the CCS industry to other activities undertaken by the same company even if it is completely outside the CCS sphere.  For example if a potential storage developer was able to expense &gt;100% of their exploration cost against oil/gas income this could act as a sufficient primer.  This can change the perspective of oil and gas operators late in a field life if they could appraise from their platform and potentially convert the facility.  Its key benefit would be to encourage companies who would otherwise not be involved in CCS to get involved and provide equity at the early stage of the industry roll-out.  It could help to incentivise oil companies who due to their skills and expertise are seen as key stakeholders but have no incentive to get involved at present into the sector. Tax breaks could be relatively revenue neutral for Government as an improvement in project economics through a tax break should enable a lower CfD FiT price to be paid to power stations offsetting the loss in tax revenue.  &#xa0;The setting of targets / emission drivers offer an understandable and robust commitment that would offer the power and storage industry the level of security it needs to invest in CCS.  The lack of targets / emissions drivers for CO2 emissions inevitably creates uncertainty for investors.  A target could be seen as a positive rather than a negative thing to pursue.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]Taking CCS from an early stage technology to a commercially viable one which is suitable for private sector development and widely adopted, will require reducing the overall costs,  including the cost of capital sufficiently enough to make CCS commercially competitive with traditional generating technologies.  While the outcome from DECC’s commercialisation programme may result in one or two projects being successfully developed, the challenge will be how to maintain momentum among other projects which have been unsuccessful in obtaining DECC funding and to scale up the industry beyond that.&#xa0;Support beyond EMR for follow-on projects needs to be progressed if the sector is to be capable of ramping up, lowering costs and making a large scale contribution to the energy mix throughout the 2020s.  The first follow-on CCS projects will need to progress (potentially to FID), before many learnings have emerged from the projects supported by DECC’s commercialisation programme.  Given the challenges identified for the sector, there is a real risk that without targeted intervention, follow-on projects will not emerge.  In the long run, projects need to be investable without the benefit of public funding.  This will require significant progress on a range of issues and is not able to be delivered by the market on its own.  Further targeted intervention is required to facilitate these developments and deliver these opportunities.  This is not about capital grants as they do not resolve structural failings; instead smart design of policy drivers is required to bring forward the sector to invest in the technology on a realistic scale.

[[[&#xa0;]]]We would propose that the two best starting places to cover these issues are the EU CCS Directive, which places very stringent requirements related to storage site selection, characterisation and monitoring, along with the FAQ’s that can be found at (http://www.ccsassociation.org/faqs/ccs-general/. The CCSA has a working group dedicated to this area.

[[[&#xa0;]]]On a wider global scale, it can be seen that the drivers for delivery of projects in Australia, Canada and the USA are all very different to the UK and largely derive from assistance such as grants and loan guarantees that support a semi-viable conventional business model.  Examples include development of (15%) CO2-rich gas fields for LNG export, tar sand oil fields combined with EOR, or commercial EOR operations.  In North America, CO2 has a commercial value and can be sold for use in oil production using EOR.  Therefore there is no obvious cross-over to the UK model, although we do agree that all the deploying countries offer lessons to be learned.  Capture plants are being built on power stations in both Canada and the USA. &#xa0;Norway incentivised the use of CCS in offshore gas production through a carbon tax, however similarly to the countries above there is an associated conventional business model in the production and sale of natural gas.  Norway has plans to deploy CCS on the combined heat and power plant at Mongstaad (with government support), where there is an industrial scale test facility currently using waste gas from the refinery.&#xa0;In contrast to these countries, the UK’s approach for encouraging CCS beyond the commercialisation programme relies on a mixture of policies using “carrots” and “sticks”, including CfD FiTs, Carbon price floor and the emissions performance standard.  It is our view that carbon floor prices are not a driving force in the short to medium term unless they go immediately to £50 /tonne (or thereabouts).  This also means that the ETS is unlikely to drive European projects. By way of contrast, the Norwegian carbon tax was set at a level that meant avoiding emissions was the preferred outcome.  &#xa0;In relation to the pricing of CO2 emissions as a penalty and its role in the delivery of CCS, we note that under the current UK carbon floor price trajectory of £30/tonne in 2020 rising to £70/tonne in 2030 the level at which power generators would be incentivised to build CCS CCGTs rather than pay the penalty would unlikely occur until the mid-late 2020’s at the earliest.  Therefor unabated gas will remain a preference and transport and storage infrastructure will not be built until beyond the mid 2020’s.  This delay in deployment will mean costs will not be reduced ahead of essential use of the technology in the 2030’s for achieving emissions targets in both power and industry.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]The roadmap was important in setting out the need for CCS and stating its role as a key technology in the fight against the dangers of climate change. However, the roadmap did not set out a route to market for the transportation and storage segments of CCS. Without the delivery of this infrastructure we believe the viability of CCS as an option for decarbonisation is at risk. &#xa0;Key risks to CCS development not addressed by the roadmap include:  &#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; finance and cost (lack of suitable incentives and drivers to encourage projects and make them viable); -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; storage (the need to provide up-front proven bankable stores, how they can be accessed and delivered to the market);-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; development of transport and storage infrastructure independent of power generation decisions; and-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; the lack of real power sector economics and drivers (and therefore desire) for CCS deployment.&#xa0;As discussed earlier, we suggest that any policy developed for CCS needs to enable opportunistic deployment for all sectors that can make use of the infrastructure.  This means creating incentives and pathways that can work as proxies for the business models existing in other countries.  We believe the whole financial model for delivery also needs to be re-explored by collaborative regional groups such as the UK, with Norway and the Netherlands.  The North Sea Basin is an asset that can be used for Europe and will be needed to meet European decarbonisation aspirations.  Hence the energy system will need infrastructure so that CO2 could be transported from countries without the benefit of offshore storage solutions.&#xa0;Quite simply we would flag that the IEA has said CCS is essential. To stimulate an industry, by demonstrating the UK’s ability to achieve delivery of CCS in a complicated offshore environment, then it will contribute to the confidence that CCS is a “real” solution, both in a European and global context.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;We trust that you will find these comments constructive and we would be very willing to provide additional information on any of the points we have raised above.  All of this response may be put into the public domain and there is no part of it that should be treated as confidential.September 2013&#xa0; Energy Act 2008 – “GISZ” Gas importation and storage zone DECC (July 2013) Consultation on the Draft Electricity Market Reform Delivery Plan; Committee on Climate Change (May 2013) Next steps on Electricity Market Reform – securing the benefits of low-carbon investment ZEP (Zero Emissions Platform) actually suggests a medium case for a large unexplored aquifer could be c£300m, whereas the lower amount could refer to a known reservoir site.
