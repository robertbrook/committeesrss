[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some farmers only grow one crop because the produce from that crop is fed to their livestock (poultry farmers).  They will now have to grow three crops, two will have to be sold and taken off farm by lorry and feed bought to replace the loss of produce, this will have to be brought onto the farm by lorry – more CO2 emissions.  No benefit there to the environment&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Some farmers grow two crops because that is what their land is suited to and fits in with their farming system&#xa0;-      Others farmers, usually large farmers, will have no difficulty in growing three or more        crops.  It may be that more than one crop is fed to their livestock (dairy farmers) with  the other crops sold off farm&#xa0;-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What will be classed as a crop:-              will only arable crops be eligible as part of a three crop rotation-              will grassland used for hay and silage but not grazed be eligible for part of a three               crop rotation&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The British Government always bends over backwards to keep the European Commission happy even though the  British Government, with taxpayers money, pays into the European Union more than the Government gets back.  Is it not time for the British Government to say that any changes to the CAP will in no way disadvantage British farmers even if the European Commission are not happy with that.&#xa0;With the population of his country increasing rapidly it should be more important to ensure food production for the majority of the people in this country, even to the extent of being self sufficient in some foods, rather than environmental benefits which benefit to the few.&#xa0;British farmers are well aware that this Government would like to do away with subsidies but would the general public be happy having to pay more for food.  The farmer may get a subsidy but in fact so do the general public as the subsidy keeps down the cost of food.  The Government should ask itself: do you want cheap food to help keep the cost of living down and so keep the general public happy or food production with no subsidy that forces food prices and the cost of living up.&#xa0;8 October 20134&#xa0;
