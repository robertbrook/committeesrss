[[[Marsden]]], Principal Physicist (Clinical Scientist), Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, and 

[[[Dr Nicola Patron]]], Head of Synthetic Biology, The Sainsbury Laboratory, gave evidence.

[[[Q1 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first session of our inquiry on women in STEM careers. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel in this inquiry. An awful lot has been written and many reports have been published over the years, but there is still a substantial problem, so we are trying to filter out the best of what has been said in the past and focus on some actions that perhaps might improve the situation, unless somebody comes up with a brilliant new idea that has not been thought of. I would be grateful if, just for the record, you would introduce yourselves.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I am Jenny Marsden, and I am principal physicist at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I am Nicola Patron, head of synthetic biology at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: I am Bryn Jones. I have been an astrophysicist, though I have now left research. I am a visiting fellow at the university of Bristol.&#xa0;

[[[Q2 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Let’s start off straightforwardly: what made you choose to embark on a STEM career?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I had the advantage of having excellent science teaching when I was at school. I went to a state comprehensive, but it was a girls’ state comprehensive, which may also have influenced my feeling that I could achieve in science, because there were no boys in the school anyway. I went to sixth form where I studied physics. While there I chose to self-study a module in medical physics. I thought that was great; you could choose to use science in the medical arena, helping and caring for people but actually being a scientist. I thought that was fabulous, and from when I was 17 I have always wanted to do what I am doing now.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I don’t think I knew what I wanted to do until I started as an undergraduate.&#xa0;

[[[Q3 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] But you did science at A-level.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: Yes, I did science at A-level, and mathematics, and at my university I had the opportunity to do an undergraduate project in a laboratory. While I was there the excitement of discovering new things that nobody else had understood before was irresistible, and that was when I decided that I wanted to have a career in research.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: I developed an interest in science when at school. I was very keen to study science at university. Although I found the university first degree interesting, I wanted a closer involvement in science and I chose to do a PhD. Then I wanted further involvement, exploring science in more detail, and continued through to a postdoctoral post.&#xa0;

[[[Q4 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can any of you remember what the first switch-on to science was, in your dim and distant past?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: In my case, it was probably when I was a fairly small child in the early 1970s during the moon missions.&#xa0;

[[[Q5 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Without being rude, were those primary school years?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: Maybe just starting primary school. I was bought a book about the moon missions and there was a section within it about the solar system. It showed the orbits of the planets. I was intrigued that there was order in the cosmos&#xad;&#xad;—that the planets followed specific paths; that it was not all chaos out in the universe, but there were specific laws that governed how celestial bodies moved.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: When I was five or six we spent time living in the United States. My cousin, who is older than me, was studying chemical engineering. He was explaining to me why glass is a liquid. At the age of five or six I remember pouring water, which is much more like a liquid, from a glass on to a table and slowly understanding that glass was also a liquid. From that time I thought it was amazing.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I have lots of memories from when I was growing up. My parents influenced me to do sport and science and find out new things, but as a child I remember going with my great-uncle to chemistry lectures at Hull university, and seeing all the whizz-bangs, pops and explosions inside the lab—actually being inside the university thinking, “Wow! These people do really cool things.”&#xa0;

[[[Q6 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] To come a bit more up to date, let’s talk about short-term contracts, which seem to be a feature of many academic careers. Do you see that as a problem in terms of the issue we are dealing with today?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: It is a problem. Even for science in itself it is a problem. If you employ somebody in your laboratory for two years, which is probably all you can employ them for, because your grant is not very big or not for a very extended period of time, and let’s say they are postdocs—you have employed them post-PhD—for the first six months they will be completely distracted by writing up papers from their previous job or from their PhD, and for the last six months they will be completely distracted by writing fellowship applications and job applications for their next job. They are 100% focused on their current project for only half the time you have employed them, so it is not very constructive either for the project they are employed on or for their own career if they are completely distracted about where they are going to work in 18 months’ time.&#xa0;

[[[Q7 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Does that particularly affect women?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: No, it probably affects everybody.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I do not have a great deal of experience of short-term contracts because I work for the NHS, so I am in a position of relative luxury.&#xa0;

[[[Q8 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Dr Jones, in your evidence you talked about an extreme imbalance between early career researchers on short-term contracts and longer-term contracts. Would you like to elaborate?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: The system in this country, and probably across the western world generally, is that we train considerable numbers of people to PhD standard through studentships for postgraduate research from research councils. The number of those is much greater than the number of research assistant posts. That is not itself such a bad thing, because many people choose to leave academic research—academia—after completing a PhD. There is also an imbalance in the number of research assistant posts compared with the number of fellowships, and then with the number of long-term, that is to say permanent, positions in academia. Most of the long-term permanent positions in academia are university lecturerships, readerships and professorships. They are permanent academic posts. We train a very large number of people to PhD standard. There is a much smaller number of research assistant posts. That is not itself such an issue, but the number of permanent positions is very small, so there is a pyramid structure.&#xa0;

[[[Q9 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] You would like that reversed.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: No. I am a supporter of the pyramid structure, but I want something that is more vertical than the pyramid we have now. The problem is that the imbalance is too severe. In my old field of astronomy—my own research field—I estimate that there are about 15 times more people trained to PhD standard than there are long-term, that is to say permanent, university positions available. Perhaps only one in three people trained to PhD standard will choose to stay in academic research, but that still means there is something like a five-to-one imbalance in the number of people who embark on a research career in universities and the number of people who can stay on in the long term. It is a severe imbalance.&#xa0;

[[[Q10 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] The ScienceGrrl Twitter campaign has highlighted that the years spent working to secure academic independence and a permanent position are also the years when many people choose to settle down and start a family, as Jenny Marsden alluded to just now. How does the academic research culture affect men and women who take a career break?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I would never chance taking a career break. I do not think I would ever be able to get back if I took a break. That is the reality.&#xa0;

[[[Q11 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Not to have children?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: Or to do anything—to look after elderly relatives, or anything.&#xa0;

[[[Q12 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] I thought we had maternity leave for things like that.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: You can have maternity leave, but to secure new funding when you come back you have to have had consistent publications. You can put on paper that you have had a career break and they will take the six or 12 months you have had off, but everybody knows that having children is not six or 12 months off; it is six or 12 months off, plus another however many years. It is impossible.&#xa0;

[[[Q13 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] How could scientists taking parental leave be better supported in returning to work with minimal disadvantage compared with their peers? How do we deal with this problem? What is the way forward?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: There are some fellowships to support people returning to work, particularly women who have taken a period off to have children. There is a small number and we could see more of these. There is a Daphne Jackson fellowship within astronomy, and I think some of the research councils have something similar, so there are systems in place. We can query whether there are enough and whether there should be more of them.There is also the issue we have just heard about—prejudice within the community against people who stop publishing for a period. That needs to be addressed in terms of the culture within universities and the research community, so that people are prepared to discount time taken out from the research publication record and allow for that.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: It is a general thing in almost all careers. There is one woman MP here today, so the representation is poor. What could be done is to promote much better parental leave rights for all workers, which will benefit women in science as well as men in science. We need to promote child caring for both genders more equally, as in Sweden, for example, where they have a recent policy about sharing out paid parental leave for mothers and fathers. You can commute only certain parts of it. That is changing the culture, so there is not the unconscious bias in employing women that they might go off and have children. You employ someone between the ages of 20 and 40 and, whether they are male or female, they may have a career break for children or something.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: There is maternity leave if you have a permanent position, but, if you are on a two-year contract and you take 18 months off, what do you do with your last six months? Your project has gone completely and someone else has done it. You can come back for six months, but you can’t achieve in six months of a two-year contract. You cannot do a two-year project in six months, so effectively you lose that entire postdoc. It impacts your career for more than the time taken off.&#xa0;

[[[Q14 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Do you think that the massive developments in IT communications—laptops and iPads; we all have them—have a bearing on this? Is that going to make it easier in the future?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: No, I do not think it does. It may do so for a few people, but for laboratory-based careers we are talking about the years when people are at the bench all the time. You need to be at the bench. PhD students and postdoctoral scientists in their 20s and 30s will be at the bench doing physical experiments—not always: some people working in bioinformatics or mathematical modelling will be at their computers, and for sure they could commute some of those things and do them at home. It could help, but it would not have helped me.&#xa0;

[[[Q15 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Dr Patron, you were very blunt in your response to Mr Tredinnick’s first question. If we had the research councils round the table they would say, “No, no, no. There are mechanisms in place to ensure fairness for women taking maternity leave.” You do not think that is true, do you?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I do not think it is true. I am sorry. No.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I do not think that could be true. No matter what happens, if a woman chooses to have a child she has to have some time off, even two weeks. That time cannot be gained back if it is at a crucial stage of someone’s career, or it is a crucial change in the environment you are working in—reorganisation times and things like that. There is also a bias towards presenteeism in the workplace. I disagree with that, because you can do some work outside hours remotely—some, not all—and there is no reason why some people could not flex their day, do some hours in the office, some hours of research and then some outside, maybe when the children are in bed or caring responsibilities are over. It is about balancing that. Presenteeism and the fact that you have to be there and seen to be doing something, even though you may not be very effective during that time, is the sort of culture we have to get at. Promoting maternity leave and proper flexible working is the key to that in research, the workplace and careers in further education for women and men in STEM.&#xa0;

[[[Q16 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] I would like to go back to what Dr Patron was speaking about. Am I right in thinking that there is a whole series of two-year contracts? You get a contract to do a piece of research and then you have to compete to get another contract and another. Is that the normal pattern for a researcher?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: That is correct.&#xa0;

[[[Q17 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] Without full-time employment, I quite understand that the idea that you can take maternity leave, or do flexible working, is just not going to work. You are suggesting that to enable somebody to continue their career something would need to happen along the lines of funding being given. Say you could plan everything so well that you came to the end of your two-year contract and published your research and then you were funded for a particular period of time to have your family. Any sorts of barriers would then be removed, which would acknowledge the fact that there was a time when you did not do research and did not publish. Then you could compete for another contract. Is that the sort of thing you are saying would have to happen to enable women who want to to have a family and continue in research?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: There is that option. For everyone to be planning their lives around two years is brutal. Five-year contracts would be a massive improvement for the standard of science and for everybody’s lives. There is also a problem for the person who is running the laboratory, say the lecturer. If they have a postdoc on a two-year contract who takes maternity leave, what happens to their project? Their career is also being affected because someone in their laboratory is having a child. I certainly would not say that I have ever experienced a situation where people do not want to employ you because you are a woman of child-bearing age, but I am sure that people worry about it, because their own career would be affected. If they are on a tenure track and do not manage to publish what they need to, everyone’s career is affected. There are lots of stresses at play for everybody.&#xa0;

[[[Q18 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] In that contract environment, have you ever come across a situation where perhaps a woman researcher wants to have a family and is friends with another woman researcher who also wants to have a family, or already has one? Is there ever a possibility that two women on a job-share basis, who are similarly qualified to undertake the research and deliver that contract, work together so they can have that flexibility?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I have never worked in a place where people were not competitive.&#xa0;

[[[Q19 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] There was not a job-share set-up?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: No. As Bryn said, the pool of jobs that everyone is competing for is extremely small, which means that everyone is competing against each another. The competition is sometimes quite fierce.&#xa0;

[[[Q20 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] It seems that for some of us round the table, who have worked in other occupations, the sorts of models which help women achieve their potential and have children are simply not available in this two-year contracting cycle. Jenny, moving on to what you said, you are now working in the NHS, which is a different environment. You were talking about flexible working as a very good tool to enable both men and women to continue work and manage their caring responsibilities, whether for an elderly parent or children. I completely agree with you, but how much is that perceived to be a good thing in your experience? Do people readily welcome that, or do you have to fight for it within, say, the area of the NHS where you are employed?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: There is a difference between policy and enacting policy. There is a flexible working policy for most workplaces, but the enacting of the policy is a problem, especially in senior roles. This Committee is looking into women in STEM. The problem is that, as you become more senior, the idea of presenteeism—“You need to be there”—is even greater. I have been told in the past that someone would never consider a physicist being allowed to go part time, for example; I work full time. It has to meet the needs of the service, and it is the worker’s responsibility to prepare their case to show how it will not affect the service—to find a friend to do a job share or work out their annualised hours—or how it will benefit the workplace, not just the individual. In my experience, the higher you go the harder it is to prepare those cases; you get more specialised so there are fewer people to share the work load with. It is an unfortunate circle. The ridiculousness of the situation is that once you are in that senior post—if you can get in there—you have more autonomy over your work load, so you can choose. You can say, “I’m going to come in an hour late because I’ll just do that this evening.” Once a woman or man is in that role there is more space to work flexibly, but I do not know whether any woman or man looking at a job would ask, “Is this senior job open to part-time or flexible working?” because they may be criticised for asking it at that stage. It may show, wrongly, that they are not committed to that role.&#xa0;

[[[Q21 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] You are quite right. What you are talking about is what we see in so many industries. While there is good policy on paper, we do not get women into senior roles. They fall out before then because it is just too difficult to combine caring responsibilities with career progression, and from what you say it is very cultural.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Very cultural.&#xa0;

[[[Q22 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] That affects men and women. As you were saying, it’s presenteeism—there is only one way to do this job, and it is the way it has always been done. Is there anything we can do? We are talking about big cultural changes, but are there any practical things that you feel could be done to strengthen workers’ rights, or other things that could be done to enable more flexible working?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: There are, yes. I referred in my written evidence to advertising senior roles as flexible, part-time higher grades. As long as the work is completed, there should not be any problem about when it is done, surely. If we can get women to interview, which is another question in itself, there is the option for having someone on the interview panel with experience of successful flexible working policies. You cannot help but put your own bias when you are interviewing someone for a post that is similar to yours; it is very difficult to remove yourself from that. Having someone who has successfully worked flexibly, or worked part time, for part of their career, would really help to encourage more people into senior roles in STEM where they may wish to consider working flexibly and part time.&#xa0;

[[[Q23 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sarah Newton:]]] Role models. You are looking to see that some men and women are given these opportunities, and they are seen to succeed in that.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Yes. The organisations could also report on the number of senior staff who take up flexible working. I know that in the NHS there is a lot of part-time working in lower grades. In NHS trusts generally, about 80% are women, or something ridiculous like that, but if you look at the published equality and diversity statistics for all the trusts by grade, you see the number of women go to something like nothing in the senior grades. There is no representation for engineers, scientists, policymakers and those making management decisions in STEM at that point.&#xa0;

[[[Q24 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] Dr Patron, in your evidence there is a lot of talk about the international nature of scientific research. You say that scientific careers tend to be global. You have highlighted your own situation, moving to four different cities and the like. Why is it important for researchers to have that international experience?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: If you work on two-year contracts and have to move to a new institute, inevitably you will at least be moving city, because you will be moving to a different university. Hardly anybody will get a postdoctoral contract renewed in the same institute; it very rarely happens. If you are looking for a new job, mostly you are moving to a different university. That will inevitably be in a different city. If you want to be successful in science, you need to have a record of attracting funding independently, to yourself. The way this happens most usually is that younger scientists will apply for fellowships. For most of the fellowships in Europe the rules, at least in the life sciences—I cannot comment on those for physics because I do not know about them, but I believe they are similar for chemistry—require that to be eligible you have to move to a country different from the one where you were born, different from the one where you did your PhD and, in many cases, as I think I put in my written evidence, a country in which you have not done any previous work. In order to build a successful career you have to move countries—frequently.&#xa0;

[[[Q25 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] Why would they put in that specification? Why would they encourage you to do that?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: The rationale for it that I have heard is that it strengthens relationships between institutes, so it encourages collaborative research. If you employ a PhD student from Germany, they are going to bring with them this relationship, and you will continue having collaborative research with that institute. People try actively to recruit people from laboratories that are excellent but with which they also want to share work. It is a good way of sharing research and ideas and forwarding research, but it is not the only way.&#xa0;

[[[Q26 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] Is part of the issue that some of the work you do is so specialised that there are only a few locations globally that are suitable for your skill set, and vice versa? Is that part of the problem?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: That is part of the problem. Yes.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: I think this applies to European funding sources. The European Union provides research funding. It does not apply, as far as I am aware, to any of the British funding by United Kingdom research councils.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: Yes, it does; it applies to Royal Society fellowships, does it not?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: I did not think that applied to moving to other countries. This is a problem that affects European sources of funding, and they are very important. There are restrictions on universities in Britain where you can hold United Kingdom research council fellowships.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: But they are not available to postdoctoral or independent researchers. The most popular fellowships that people apply for in the life sciences all require moving country. If there were a large number of fellowships available within the UK that did not require you to do that, I am sure people would be applying for them and they would be extremely competitive. In the institutes I work in, the most common fellowships that progress your career are Marie Curie, EMBO and Royal Society fellowships. All of those require that you move institute, so at least you have to move city, and in the case of the first two they require that you move country.&#xa0;

[[[Q27 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] Do you think there is anything specific to a career in science research that makes things more difficult? I am in my early 40s. My peer group have children who are eight to 10 years old, so women have been through the process of having children and the children are growing up. Some of my friends have gone back to work and are pursuing very successful careers; others have decided to go down the full-time motherhood route and given up their very successful careers in banking, scientific research or politics. Is there anything specifically related to scientific research that makes it different from the other wide range of careers that women pursue?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: How many fathers have given up their careers to look after their children, in your peer group?

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] Funnily enough, my best friend has just given up his job as a teacher in Birmingham.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Good; fantastic.

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] They moved to Switzerland because of his wife’s job. They moved there about three weeks ago. It does happen, but it is not as common.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I do not think science is particularly different in that respect; it is quite general, but there are so few women scientists anyway that their loss is even more pronounced.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: The difference is that the stage at which scientific careers are at their most competitive is the age at which you have to make that decision. For example, at the stage when medical careers are most competitive you are a little bit younger, so you can do all your competing; you can have a job and then decide. You have a good job and a stable career; you have already been successful, so you can decide to take maternity leave, have a family and come back, or not, because you are established. But in science you are establishing yourself between the ages of 25 and 35. Therefore, career breaks in that period are extremely disruptive for your career. That is the difference.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I agree but I also disagree. I know of medics who have found it incredibly difficult to justify the fact that they are leaving their F1 or F2 medical training, or whichever part it is, to have a child. “At this time? Terrible. How are you going to succeed?”

[[[Dr Patron]]]: It is never a great time.&#xa0;

[[[Q28 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Mosley:]]] Given the international nature of research, I was struck by the number in your evidence—16,741, which is a very big number. How do you find the difficulties of maintaining a normal life when you have partners all over the world? Not partners—sorry about how that came out; it was more of a general term. You know what I mean.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: It is awful.&#xa0;

[[[Q29 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] Some of what I wanted to cover has already been covered. Ms Marsden, you referred to a huge lack of women in science. That is true across STEM generally, but in some areas not others. I accept what you said earlier about grading. It is not just a question of volume; it is a question of quality as well as quantity. Medical schools, for example, have been producing a majority of women graduates for the past few years, and that has certainly been true for veterinary medicine for even longer. What happens, given the fact that it starts off with broadly comparable numbers, so that, as careers develop and the management structure increases, women do not appear in anything like the same volume?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: We still have a bit of a lag from the fact that women are only just getting into these careers, so age is an issue at the moment. I am hoping that in 20 years’ time it will look a bit better. We are still recovering from the lag of women going into science subjects: medicine, veterinary medicine and all these things. There is still the cultural belief that women are somehow the main carers. I am at pains to suggest that this is not just children but, in the next few years, it will be parents and other people as well. The gender pay gap also influences that. For example, you spoke about maternity leave. Maternity leave and maternity pay are based on your rate of pay, normally. If a woman is paid less than a man, it makes sense in a partnership, for example, for the man to continue working and the woman to surrender her pay and have maternity pay as a proportion of that. The gender pay bias also affects the problem in the choices couples make when they decide to have a family.&#xa0;

[[[Q30 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] Clearly, there is bias against women in science and STEM more generally. Do any of you feel that the bias is conscious or unconscious, or is it innately structural?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Both.&#xa0;

[[[Q31 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] What about the institutions themselves, the universities in particular, and other employers? Are they doing enough? First, do they grasp that it is a problem—I know this is a generalisation—and, secondly, are they doing enough to address it?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: I have been very interested to hear what has been said, because I can detect differences in practice between research councils and different fields. A problem I experienced in astronomy was that research council practice often prevented me, as someone on fixed-term contracts, from taking initiatives. For example, I could not apply for the kind of grants Dr Patron was talking about; I was forbidden to do it. I could not apply for fellowships of my own choosing but had to have approval from a department. More recently, there have been quite tight restrictions on the number of fellowship applications that departments can put forward. There was a strong need for me to get approval or support from established academics. Sometimes they gave that. Some departments were excellent, but others did not give it. When you do not get it you do not know why. You do not know whether it is because you are not considered good enough, or that you are good enough but another candidate is preferred for the fellowship application, for example. I am conscious that there is a danger of unconscious bias in favour of loud men who are confident.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I read that in your evidence, and I completely agree. In my practice I have seen cases where quiet men have been overlooked.

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] Welcome to the House of Commons.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: You may have seen me itching to say things here but holding back. That is my character, and I think I suffered because people had not seen me push myself forward in universities because I was trying to be polite.&#xa0;

[[[Q32 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] In response to the question I asked about whether the institutions are doing enough about this, I conclude from what you are saying that they are not. They are saying basically, “This is the way we operate and you’ve got to fit in with it.”

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: They are disappointed that there are not more women in science, but they are not making the changes to provide funding during two or three-year contracts; they are not even making provision for child care on site, or crèches or anything like that. We do not have a crèche.&#xa0;

[[[Q33 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] In part the reason for the scarcity of women in science in particular is the way the organisations are established.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: Some of it is; some of it is that not enough women apply for those posts.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: That is true. Why would you want to be a senior scientist if you perceive it means working all hours and every day, with frequent international travel and moving around every two years?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: And if you are not able to be competitive because you have had to take a career break you just do not apply, full stop.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: We need to be very careful about how we express this. There is an imbalance between men and women at different stages: at undergraduate level—indeed at A&#x2011;level—in science and in different fields within science.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: There isn’t in life sciences, but, even 20 years after the numbers of women going into life sciences met and exceeded the number of men going into life sciences, there are still fewer women in senior positions. It is not the input to the pipeline; women are dropping out.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: They are definitely dropping out.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: I am saying that we need to be careful to look at the proportion of men to women at each stage and see how it changes to try to understand what the pressures are and how much more those pressures affect women than men. When it comes to A-level physics, we tend to find a majority of male students in classes, and that is something that progresses through the system. I have heard much evidence that it becomes worse and men predominate; the proportion changes as one goes through PhD, research assistant level, fellowship level, lecturership, readership and professorship.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: There is an unconscious bias among people choosing the successful applicants in fellowships. How are they chosen? Who are the people on the panel choosing them? If you are choosing someone to take your place behind you, you cannot help but choose someone similar to yourself.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: That is true.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: In my case, I am also conscious of that at application level, because in my old field you cannot choose to apply yourself for a fellowship alone; you need the formal support of a department. That raises issues about unconscious bias. For example, as a man I wanted to apply for what was then an advanced fellowship that had been repackaged under another name, but I did not have the support of departments to do that. Only one department I worked in supported fellowship applications. At that time they were unsuccessful. Perhaps it was a bit early in my career, but later there were departments where I could apply for fellowships but did not have the support of those departments. I went on to become a fixed&#x2011;term lecturer and was successfully included in the research assessment exercise, and I believe I did well in that. I think I should have been able to apply for fellowships.What concerns me is that the same process may affect women to a slightly greater extent than men, and predominantly male academics would choose to support fellowship applications from aggressive male candidates, or maybe just people like themselves. If the academic community is predominantly male, they will choose people they think are good because they happen to be like themselves, and what they are is what they imagine to be good.&#xa0;

[[[Q34 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] I want to make a point that is a variation on what you said, Dr Jones. Ms Marsden said, and it was agreed, that women rule themselves out. Do they do that too early in the process? Is that lack of confidence or an unwillingness to take part?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: That has been studied. I am going to quote this wrongly. Women will look at a job application and say, “I don’t meet all those criteria, so I won’t apply.” Men will look at the job advert and say, “I meet 50% of that. I’m going to apply.”&#xa0;

[[[Q35 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Jim Dowd:]]] Is that lack of confidence or excess of candour?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: It is the psychology of girls when they are very young: “I can’t do it if it’s difficult.” I was interested in the Girlguiding evidence about what girls at Brownies and Guides want to be. Early on they have the perception that it is difficult and they cannot do it. I do not have an answer for how you can fix that easily, other than supporting all people to do things that they enjoy and are challenging at school. I do not know how we can fix that.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: One of the ways to fix it is for there to be better role models. Children look at who they are going to be and say, “I can be like that person; I can identify with that person. That’s something I can do,” but, if I go to an international conference and look at the plenary speakers, none of them will be like me. It is very hard to see a route for my career to reach that point, when I have nothing in common with those people.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: And the people who do succeed do it regardless; they do not have any boundaries to their perceptions.&#xa0;

[[[Q36 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Metcalfe:]]] You are painting quite a bleak picture of what it is like to be a scientist, full stop. You have created a vision of a combative environment that is very competitive, with people working 26 hours a day to try to outdo the person sitting next to them. Is there a benefit to that culture? Is there a balance? Is there an upside that drives forward scientific endeavour by doing that, or is it just to outdo the person sitting next to you?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I do not feel that competitiveness in my job. We work as a really good team, especially in what I do. I do not know if you want to comment on whether competitiveness is a good thing.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I would not say it was quite that bad; I would not say it has been that bad for me at all. Having said that, I have had friends in laboratories who describe exactly that situation, particularly immunologists. I have three friends who are immunologists. That is how they describe their career to me. It is an extremely competitive field, and quite an exciting field. I think the best advances in science have been made from teamwork.&#xa0;

[[[Q37 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Metcalfe:]]] Good. You accept, therefore, that there is a cultural problem. Someone described it as a sink-or-swim culture. You have to get on, do it yourself and drive yourself forward. I think you used some of those words yourself. Is that culture being perpetuated by those who have gone through it, and because they feel they have earned their spurs they want to pass it on to the next generation, who have to achieve in the same way as they did, as opposed perhaps to moving towards a more teamwork-based culture?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: It is, but the whole system of competing for funding brings out the competitive nature. All the science councils release a competitive funding round. That is what it is called.  It is a competition. We are a set of scientists competing for a small amount of money. It is competitive; it is silly to pretend that it is not. Then you have to publish. You are competing to complete your experiments before the other laboratory completes theirs and publishes first; otherwise, you are scooped and you cannot publish, and then you have wasted all that money and all of your career. It is competitive.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: The ownership of projects and of papers is quite a divisive thing. I have found that when I publish things or have been involved in publications.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: It is very interesting to see projects succeed when scientists decide they are not going to do that. Recently, the laboratory that I worked in received funding to tackle ash dieback, which you will have heard about because it was in the news quite extensively. They decided to do this on an open research platform. They have done a lot of genome sequencing and released it on the web. They said, “We need to tackle this disease. Any laboratory that would like to work on this and contribute, please do so and contact us. We are just acknowledging each other in what goes forward.” It has been tremendously successful, and it would be great if more projects worked like that.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: There are perhaps two types of competition: positive competition, which drives up standards and is very strong in science, with different groups and different researchers competing against each other to be first to publish and get good results. There is also negative competition, where there is too much competition and those who do not succeed are defeated and almost destroyed by the system. When it comes to the career system, there is too much negative competition. There are too few prizes and too many failures; and there are also too many really good people who are destined to fail because the career system is overly competitive.&#xa0;

[[[Q38 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Metcalfe:]]] I understand the positive side of laboratory competing against laboratory in bidding for money. What concerns me is the culture, perhaps within laboratories themselves, about putting in hours and so on and that being perpetuated. Most PhD students require some form of mentoring and someone to work with. Are those mentors perpetuating that type of culture, or is there more they can do to try to improve the situation? Is there a bias towards a more masculine, male approach rather than a female, feminine approach?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I think there is.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: Yes, there can be. Different people respond differently and behave differently. Some people may be very supportive of others; some people may be aggressively competitive and expect others to be aggressively competitive, so it depends on the individual, but there are some problem areas and there is some macho culture. I was in one group that had a very strong macho culture. I did not fit into it; I am not that kind of person. It was not one based on fair competition; in that particular research group it was survival of the fittest under any circumstances. It does vary.&#xa0;

[[[Q39 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Metcalfe:]]] Taking all those comments together, what can we do that may start to shift the cultural balance away from that masculine approach to something that is perhaps more in tune with where the rest of industry might have moved to? Do we need better HR, better lines of reporting and management and support from outside academia so there is somewhere you can chat through problems? I do not know the answers, but those are some of the areas we might like to explore. What would be your views?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Early in my career I took advantage of the mentoring service MentorSET, but funding for that has now been withdrawn.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: The culture in universities has been changing substantially. Human resources departments are having more influence and there is more good practice within departments, so the culture is changing substantially. The problems I had in that regard were 15 or 20 years ago.&#xa0;

[[[Q40 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Metcalfe:]]] Do you think that more HR involvement will support more women to get further in their careers? Do you think it will erase some of the imbalance?

[[[Dr Jones]]]: It could be helpful. For example, there is the concordat on research careers. There is very little understanding of that among some academics, so human resources departments could raise awareness of that and of good practice. Just getting human resources departments to explain to academics that these principles apply could be very helpful.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: We need believable role models as well. I agree that we need role models, but I have not always found them particularly helpful. If you look at the world of business, key female role models all seem to be super-women with nannies, au pairs and cleaners. That is something I do not relate to when I am up at 5 in the morning with my child. I do not know how you would be able to do this. You need to promote the personal as well as the professional benefits of a career. We are now going to be working for a long time, so nine months out once or twice in the entire 45 years is a very small time. Maybe we can also look at bringing women back into science, where they feel that is appropriate. There is no reason why they should be lost forever if they have decided to have a long career break, apart from the question of how to get into research if you have to change jobs every two years. That would support the argument for having five-year or longer research-type funding.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: Some research councils are moving towards not five years but a consolidated grant approach, which is three years with a decision about continuity. It is a bit more than just three years, with the possibility of a decision about renewal.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: When I was preparing for this meeting I read something about why girls go into science. It is because they have had a family member or friend who was a role model in science, man or woman. The more that women come out of science when they have children, the more it is perpetuating that. We need to keep those mothers, and fathers, in those science careers so they can demonstrate how great and interesting these areas are—how you are at the forefront, doing exciting things and helping people. The dieback stuff is really interesting. Lots of children are interested in natural history, and it is very important that we have local accessible role models.&#xa0;

[[[Q41 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Building on the question about role models, you have already said that some of the people out there are super-humans with a whole string of support services—and presumably they are amazing and able to manage their time better than everybody else—but I put it to you: are both of you not role models? Haven’t you both had exemplary careers that other people should be aware of? These are the kinds of career path we need to advertise.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I would not like to advertise my career path.

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[: ]]]You wouldn’t? 

[[[Dr Patron]]]: No. I feel that I have been just about hanging on by my fingernails for the last 12 years on short-term contracts. I have often, often thought that if there was anything else I could do now I would do it.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: It’s more like you survived it.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I really love science. I do not want to give it up. I am desperate to succeed and to be able to get a permanent job. I feel that I am more than capable of it, but every year  when you get close to the end of your contract you think that one little experiment did not go exactly the way I wanted it to, or somebody else got there first and therefore I won’t publish and therefore I won’t get that fellowship. Therefore, I won’t have a job at all. What am I going to do now that I am almost 40 and have invested 15&#xa0;years in this career, which is not particularly useful for any other career whatsoever? What am I going to do? One of the reasons I wanted to do this is that younger scientists talk to me. They want mentoring, and I think, “If I could tell you to do something else, I would.” I know that is the wrong thing to say to them. I want to be able to give them good advice, but I do not know what to tell them.&#xa0;

[[[Q42 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] But you are still a role model in terms of application. You may be disappointed about the size and number of hoops you have had to go through, but you have still battled through. Surely, for young students what you have done is very creditable and something they should admire and try to emulate.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: If in 18 months my contract is not renewed and I do not get another one, will I then be a good role model, having got to the age of 40 and having no career? I don’t think so. I’m sorry.&#xa0;

[[[Q43 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Ms Marsden, what do you think about that?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I think you are under-selling yourself, Nicola—I’ll say that for nothing.&#xa0;

[[[Q44 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] You started out as a radiotherapist with Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust, and then you managed to become a chartered scientist, chartered physicist and member of the Institute of Physics. Surely, you have a pretty clear path that people would admire, would they not? Young scientists would look to you as somebody who has been successful and has a daughter, who is partly looked after by your partner. You have found a way through the maze, and many people are doing that nowadays.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: You said to Nicola that she had succeeded in the battle. It should not have to be a battle.

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] But life is a battle. We battle to get here as Members of Parliament. Every four or five years we are up for election, and there is a fair cull; there are 100-plus new Members.

[[[Chair:]]] We understand short-term contracts.

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] From memory, the life expectancy of a Member of Parliament is about nine years, so anybody who gets a longer time here than that is a bit lucky.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Are we good role models? That was your question.&#xa0;

[[[Q45 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Yes. It is one of the questions. I am just curious. Listening to you, I think you are good role models. I am wondering how we get people to know what you have done and how we get a wider understanding of your kind of success, not the people on the front page of magazines—fashion icons—but people who are doing the hard work in the labs.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: To a certain extent we are successful and we would be good role models. On the other hand, I am working full time and I am not doing flexible working to see my daughter in the week. That is not really appropriate for where I am in my career at the moment, and that is my choice. I have done various other things. I dipped out of science for a while because it was just not very nice for a bit.&#xa0;

[[[Q46 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Did any role models inspire either of you?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I have had the pleasure of working for some spectacular female scientists. I would not say that I felt they were role models, and the reason is that word “spectacular”. All the women I know in senior roles are amazing scientists; they are elite scientists. All the men I know in senior roles in science are not elite scientists. Lots of them are people I can identify with. The only women who seem to have succeeded are in that top one percentile, and it’s great. I would love to aspire to be that, but to think that the only way you can succeed is to be the absolute best is going to put off a lot of people.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: When children are young we excite them with science. We say it is going to be great; we’re going to do some really cool things in laboratories. We’re going to be able to play with test tubes—whizz-bang pops, lots of colours—and look at the stars, think about mechanics, and things like that. Once you sell science to these people and they do their undergraduate degrees and go on, the reality is that in the workplace it is still going to be difficult. It may not be what they expected. Perhaps it does not bring the rewards they thought it would, both financially and in doing the work and having the personal gratification of finding out things, especially when someone publishes it a month before you do. It is difficult. They are sold something that may not be entirely true, so that is probably why we are losing some as well.&#xa0;

[[[Q47 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[David ]]]

[[[Tredinnick]]]

[[[:]]] Do you think many women would not really welcome becoming a role model because such activities could be detrimental to their career, or could be an additional burden or not be properly recognised or rewarded? Is there resistance to becoming a role model?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I do not know that there is resistance to becoming a role model. I have read in some of the evidence that the problem is that when you are successful as a female scientist in your niche you are held up as a sort of model.&#xa0;

[[[Q48 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Roger Williams:]]] Many of us who have taken part in the Royal Society scientist pairing scheme are fully aware of the problems that short-term contracts pose for postdoctoral scientists, particularly at the time they are forming relationships. One of them is in Aberdeen and the other in Portsmouth because there are limited numbers of places where they can do their work. But science is about excellence, isn’t it, and making sure that the best get to the top? This inquiry is about trying to find out whether some of the best are lost on the way, particularly women who could be doing really great things in more senior posts. One of the sadder things I heard Dr Jones say is that if people leave science that is in some way a failure. Surely, a lot of those people, having got those skills, go on to be very successful in other fields. Perhaps you could tell me a little about your experience of colleagues who have left science, what they have gone on to do and whether they are successful in that.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: Perhaps I should answer that because I have left science. I reached the end of the career and dropped out. I have not been able to find another career yet; I am still searching. It is difficult to comment on what people do. I know more about what happens when people leave after PhDs. In astrophysics they tend to go into things like computing and teaching. I can identify certain things they can do at that level.It is much more difficult to say where people go after they leave a research career—that is to say, they work as research assistants, fail to get permanent jobs and they are out. There are fewer career options for those of us like me in that position. I was talking about this to Dr Patron before the session began. We do not know the destinations of so many people who leave research.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I have just come back to the UK after working in Canada and Australia for the last 10 years. On coming back, it was quite natural for me to try to reconnect with all the people who were my peers when I was working here. It has been quite easy to connect with people who are in research. People who have left research will not return my calls. They are completely destroyed. They are failed and destroyed; they will not speak to people who are still in research. It is heartbreaking to put so much into a career and to reach your late 30s, late 40s even, and be unemployed, and in some cases unemployable, because being a scientist does not train you to do a whole lot else.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: That is very sad. I disagree. Science education—undergraduate and PhD—means you have skills that maybe you are not aware of but are important to so many careers.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: But if nobody helps you to understand those, and no one prepares you for another career, what do you do?

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Maybe we need to look at the careers choices of people who have achieved these wonderful PhDs in cut-throat science. It trains you to do all sorts of things that maybe you are not aware of. The careers training in this country is quite poor. When you are 15 you do not realise how many different job possibilities there are and what sort of skills you need.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q49 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] As a Labour Member it is not normal for me to say this, but Margaret Thatcher did not do badly. She was originally a scientist.

[[[Jim Dowd: ]]]Very few people can marry millionaires.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: Remember that Margaret Thatcher, after whom this room is named, was an industrial chemist. She left chemistry and science for law and politics. She left science. That is an example.

[[[Roger Williams:]]] That is what we are asking for.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: That is exactly what you are asking for. The trouble is that she did it comparatively early. She did not do a PhD. She had a few years in industrial chemistry and then left. It becomes very difficult for those like me who persist with an academic career and achieve some success but are then forced to leave because there are insufficient jobs for us in academia. What do we do? We face prejudice from employers.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: Are we mis-selling the academic route? Do we make students believe that once they have their PhD they can go on to be a postdoc and succeed and succeed, and is that not true?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: It is not true. Very few group leaders and PhD supervisors encourage careers. There was a paper in the United States not so long ago which said that, even though only 30% of PhD graduates would have a career in academia, 80% think they are going to have a career in academia; and 95% had only been spoken to about careers in academia, so they are not preparing themselves for other careers.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: So we are selling it wrongly.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: Absolutely.&#xa0;

[[[Q50 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Roger Williams:]]] You are telling me that people who leave academia, particularly women who leave academic careers, are being pushed out, rather than being pulled out by very attractive options outside what they thought would be their career.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: I raised this in my written submission. We ought to have better connections with companies and people looking for top-quality science graduates and science PhD students. There ought to be more joined-up thinking by companies, and they should sell it by saying they offer good flexible working practice and join up with PhDs better, because we are losing so much quality.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: Could I interject? I am looking for a new career. I am absolutely convinced that I could be brilliant at many things, but I am just not going to get the opportunity, because employers out there fear that people with PhDs will be more expensive to employ and will expect higher salaries. That is not the case. They expect that people with PhDs employed in a company at a lower, or perhaps normal, salary will do the job for a year and then disappear off to a better-paying company elsewhere. They think we expect a premium because of our PhDs and research experience, which is not necessarily the case.There are also fears among employers that people with specific experience in research are not adaptable. That is the exact opposite of what is true. If you work at a high level in research in science you have to be adaptable, but employers do not understand that. Employers out there simply do not understand in any detail what high-performing scientists are capable of doing. That is a major problem in transferring, but we need vastly improved careers advice to help those of us who have left the academic system to find new jobs.

[[[Jenny Marsden]]]: There are many careers now. The workplace has changed; you can have many careers during your working life, and that ought to be promoted as well. Studying science is one way to access lots of different things you could do, if it is properly sold.&#xa0;

[[[Q51 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Roger Williams:]]] Listening to you, it seems to me that one of the differences between science and business is that, if you are in business and do not believe your skills are being properly rewarded, you can go off and do it on your own, but in science it would be almost impossible to do that because you depend so much upon the whole architecture of science itself. From your experiences, are there any examples of women who have left academic-type careers, gone into something else and come back into research? Is it easy to re&#x2011;enter?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: I do not know anyone who has ever left research and come back into it. They may exist, but I do not know of anyone.

[[[Roger Williams:]]] We can only ask about your experience.

[[[Dr Jones]]]: That is my experience. I do not know any women or men who have left research in universities and returned. The reason is probably that if you leave there is someone behind you who does not leave and can take the job, simply because there are so many good people in the system fighting for so few jobs.

[[[Dr Patron]]]: If the route to your next job is your track record, how do you explain your break? I do not think anyone buys “I wanted to do something else for a while.” Occasionally, people will take a sabbatical to write a book, but it will probably be a science book, so it is not really a career break.&#xa0;

[[[Q52 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] In other countries—for example Germany—it is quite common for people to switch careers between industry and academia, so what makes it special there?

[[[Dr Patron]]]: But it is still research. You will still have patents, which will be taken like papers. You will still be doing research. You can switch between academic and industrial research, provided you can show a track record for what you have done, and you can show a track record in the form of patents.&#xa0;

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you very much for your attendance this morning.&#xa0;              Oral evidence: Women in STEM careers, HC 701                            20
