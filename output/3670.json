"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nCallum\n Bowler\n \n(CYS 0003)\nThe biggest danger \ncyclistâ€™s\n face is from poor drivers, particularly those who hate cyclists and drive in an aggressive manner.\nIf the rules in the Highway Code were enforced then cycling would be safer, feel safer and many more people would be inclined \nto try cycling.\nThe police, CPS, magistrates and Judges need to stop regarding cyclists as less worthy. \nDrivers who kill cyclists hardly ever get custodial sentences. Driving bans and fines are minimal.\nThe cyclist hating motorists know that should they in\njure or kill a cyclist they are likely to get a minimal punishment and this encourages them to persist in their behaviour.\nI am asking for nothing more than enforcement of the law and appropriate punishment when the law is broken. I believe this is no more\n than my right and the failure to provide justice is the greatest deterrent to cycling.\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
