[[[Nosheen’s]]]

[[[ case]]]&#xa0;Nosheen came to the UK on a spousal visa in 2006 to join her British national husband and in-laws following an arranged marriage in Pakistan. From the outset of her marriage, she was repeatedly abused, imprisoned and forced to conceive. She was forbidden from having contact with her family in Pakistan or relatives in the UK. She was not allowed to attend her GP surgery unless accompanied by her mother-in-law. She therefore had little opportunity to fully disclose her experiences of abuse and imprisonment to outside agencies. Her family and relatives to whom she had disclosed her experiences, told her to ‘adjust’ to her new surroundings and to make her marriage work. &#xa0;Within 7 months of her arrival in the UK, Nosheen was found set alight in her garden. She was taken to hospital having sustained 60% burns. Nosheen was responding well to treatment and at the first opportunity she had, she told the hospital that she did not want her husband or in-laws to visit her. The hospital did not act on her wishes and instead allowed her husband and in-laws unrestricted and unsupervised access to her. Following one of their visits, she suffered catastrophic brain injury. The oxygen ventilator to which she was connected, inexplicably became dislodged. As a result of her brain injuries, she is now cortically blind, minimally conscious and needs 24 hour care. Her condition is life-long.&#xa0;In this condition, the UKBA tried to deport her. She was appointed an official solicitor and an immigration lawyer as she could not give instructions. The decision to deport her was challenged on medical grounds at an appeal tribunal. Considerable medical evidence was presented to show that she would not survive the plane journey and even if she did, she would not receive the specialised medical care she needed in Pakistan. She won her appeal.&#xa0;Despite her horrific injuries, to date, there has been no effective State investigation into how she came to suffer serious harm at her home or at the hospital. The police undertook a very superficial investigation based on an initial suspicion that she was the victim of an honour crime, although they failed to warn the hospital authorities about their suspicions. Following her brain injury, the police suspended all investigations. The hospital too failed to undertake any investigation into how Nosheen came to suffer her brain injury. Nosheen’s father has been left without any explanation as to why there has been no state scrutiny to bear on the matter. He visits Nosheen on a daily basis at a nursing home where she resides in a near vegetative state.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Dorothy]]]

[[[’s case ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In November 2008, Dorothy, a Nigerian National, arrived in the UK on a visitor’s visa to join her husband, a British National. Her two children were born in the UK. Following the birth of her second child, her husband began to abuse her and assault her on almost daily basis. In February 2013, he abandoned her and the children. This was the second occasion that he had abandoned her but she remained hopeful that he would return. After a couple of weeks, Dorothy ran out of money and food. She was breastfeeding her second child at the time. She turned to social services for help and they agreed to assist her for 28 days. Dorothy also tried to obtain immigration advice when she realised that her husband had done nothing to regularise her stay in the UK. He had also taken the children’s British passports with him when he left. However, as she had no documentation regarding her immigration status, she was unable to resolve her immigration problems within the 28 days. At the end of the 28 day period, social services cut off her support and accused Dorothy of not sorting out her immigration matter. The told her that they would take the children into care. Dorothy became homeless. She instructed a community care solicitor to act for her and SBS assisted her for a limited period through our ‘No Recourse Fund. This is an emergency fund operated by SBS to help abused, destitute and homeless women with insecure status. Dorothy’s solicitor successfully challenged social services’ decision on the basis that it was unlawful to terminate support to her and her children.&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Mwahasi]]]

[[[’ case]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Mwahasi, an Ethiopian National, was forced to marry her husband when she was 16 years old. In August 2012, Mwahasi joined her husband in the UK on a ‘post-flight’ spouse visa. This means that she could apply for settled status at a later date. Within a few days of her arrival in the UK, she was subjected to repeated domestic and sexual violence by her husband. He took her earnings and often threatened to send her back to Ethiopia.  &#xa0;Mwahasi felt trapped in her marriage and started self- harming. She feared returning to Ethiopia as a disgraced woman. By February 2013, Mwahasi’s husband’s behaviour deteriorated to such an extent that she had no choice but to call the police. She was taken to a night shelter but her immigration status prevented her from claiming welfare benefits. SBS assisted Mwahasi in finding temporary accommodation from a charitable organisation and in submitting an application for the DDV Concession, made on the basis that she had been treated by the immigration authorities as a spousal visa applicant. Her application was refused. &#xa0;In April 2013, Mwahasi’s immigration solicitor challenged the UKBA’s refusal by way of judicial review. The case is currently pending at the High Court which has decided that her case raises an important public interest matter relating to the proper remit of the DDV Concession. In the meantime, she has been given temporary leave to remain by the UKBA, which allows her recourse to public funds. &#xa0;The Legal Aid Agency also refused Mwahasi’s application for exceptional case funding to make an application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK under the DV Rule. She was told that it would only be granted if there was a successful outcome of the judicial review proceedings in respect of the DDV Concession. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ase ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Sudarshan, a 57 year old Pakistani National, was detained by the UK Border Agency

[[[ ]]]during an immigration raid in 2007. She spent three years in immigration detention during which she was ill treated and denied access to urgent medical treatment. She states that immigration officials often shouted at her and treated her like an ‘animal’ causing her to suffer a complete mental health breakdown. With the assistance of immigration lawyers, she was eventually able to leave the detention centre and was granted refugee status for five years. She brought a claim against the UKBA for unlawful detention and ill-treatment experienced during detention. Her claim was settled in September 201 and she was awarded 42,500 in damages. Her detention and ill - treatment has had a permanent impact on her mental health. She is suffering from chronic post - traumatic stress disorder.&#xa0;&#xa0;
