[normal]Responses to the questions of the Science and Technology Committee
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are UK policies governing who can donate blood and blood products, tissues and organs sufficiently evidence-based? Is NHS Blood and Transplant overly restrictive about who can donate, or should greater precautions be taken to further reduce risk?

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It remains the case that the risk of transmission by blood or blood products or organs from infected but asymptomatic donors is unknown and there are, as yet, no effective treatments to remove prion infection from the blood or indeed for prion disease itself.

[normal]What are the strengths and weaknesses of NHS Blood and Transplant’s strategy, “Taking Organ Transplantation to 2020”? What further changes could be made to safely increase the supply of blood and blood products, tissues and organs?
