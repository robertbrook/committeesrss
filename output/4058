[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The main point
[normal] of this submission is that the imposition of a tax on the use of a television set, in order to finance a particular broadcaster, is unjustifiable.
[normal]There are now multiple broadcasters in the UK and there is no need for the government to finance one broadca
[normal]ster in preference to the others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Details
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Television Licence is an anachronism. The imposition of 
[normal]a what
[normal] is effectively a tax on the use of a television set, in order to finance the BBC, cannot be justified.
[normal]The tax is regressive because it is a flat
[normal] rate tax on all households, regardless of income. The 
[normal]regressiveness
[normal] of the tax is even greater because BBC programs are, on average, watched and listened to by the better off, paid for by all, including the worse off.
[normal]The high level of prosecutions for n
[normal]on-payment of the licence fee clearly demonstrates the reluctance to pay the fee, in many cases for a service that is not wanted or used.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The introduction of digital broadcasting throughout the UK provides a simple way of charging for BBC programs. By cha
[normal]nging to a subscription based service, the need for a tax could be removed and the financing of the BBC could be legitimised.
[normal]Charging a subscription would decriminalise what should be a personal, commercial choice and would render obsolete the whole archa
[normal]ic process for prosecuting those who   do not want to pay for a BBC service that they do not want.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are now a large number of broadcasters in the UK and the BBC should compete with them on an equal basis. Government policy should be to promote variet
[normal]y and competition in broadcasting, not to protect the BBC.
[normal]If the government needs to own broadcasting channels, these should be paid for out of general taxation and should be clearly designated as government channels, in a similar way to how the BBC World
[normal] Service is operated.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Eventually, when the BBC is operating as a viable commercial entity, the organisation should be privatised.
