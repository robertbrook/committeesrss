defaultSummary
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main point
default of this submission is that the imposition of a tax on the use of a television set, in order to finance a particular broadcaster, is unjustifiable.
defaultThere are now multiple broadcasters in the UK and there is no need for the government to finance one broadca
defaultster in preference to the others.

defaultThe Television Licence is an anachronism. The imposition of 
defaulta what
default is effectively a tax on the use of a television set, in order to finance the BBC, cannot be justified.
defaultThe tax is regressive because it is a flat
default rate tax on all households, regardless of income. The 
defaultregressiveness
default of the tax is even greater because BBC programs are, on average, watched and listened to by the better off, paid for by all, including the worse off.
defaultThe high level of prosecutions for n
defaulton-payment of the licence fee clearly demonstrates the reluctance to pay the fee, in many cases for a service that is not wanted or used.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe introduction of digital broadcasting throughout the UK provides a simple way of charging for BBC programs. By cha
defaultnging to a subscription based service, the need for a tax could be removed and the financing of the BBC could be legitimised.
defaultCharging a subscription would decriminalise what should be a personal, commercial choice and would render obsolete the whole archa
defaultic process for prosecuting those who   do not want to pay for a BBC service that they do not want.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are now a large number of broadcasters in the UK and the BBC should compete with them on an equal basis. Government policy should be to promote variet
defaulty and competition in broadcasting, not to protect the BBC.
defaultIf the government needs to own broadcasting channels, these should be paid for out of general taxation and should be clearly designated as government channels, in a similar way to how the BBC World
default Service is operated.
default&#xa0;
defaultEventually, when the BBC is operating as a viable commercial entity, the organisation should be privatised.
