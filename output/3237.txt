[[[ Forest Trust]]]&#xa0;The Knoydart Forest Trust (KFT) is pleased to have the opportunity to submit a response to the open consultation on land reform in Scotland.  KFT wish to express support for the Community Woodland Association response submitted to this consultation and the points expressed therein.&#xa0;KFT, a community led organisation, was established in 1999 to manage and develop woodland on the community owned Knoydart Estate.  As custodians of 17,200 acres of land the community of Knoydart via KFT has developed the woodland resource to deliver a wide range of benefits – environmental, economic and social (refer to Appendix for detail) - to the local community and wider public.  &#xa0;We hope that the outcome of the review enables more communities to successfully acquire the land that they live on and other assets.  &#xa0;With regard to our own situation, 14 years down the line of community ownership, it is our hope that there is clarification regarding state aid rules which have the potential to impact on the growth and sustainability of established community organisations.  Further more recognition is required that investment of public funds in community land organisations is distinct form investment in privately owned land, achieves better value for money and brings multiple benefits.KFT is the major conduit of environmental services in the Knoydart Peninsula and is a significant contributor to the biodiversity works in north Lochaber. It delivers environmental improvements through co-operative working with neighbouring estates and with smaller private landowners and outcomes include:&#xa0;KFT has brought an average of £90,000 per annum of external funding into the economy of Knoydart since 2002. Over the life of the Trust the direct financial benefit to Knoydart through KFT is of the order of £1.4million. This is direct income and does not take account of voluntary effort; indirect benefits (bed nights of contractors, etc.) plus the increased asset value of woodland and land through woodland management activities. Over the lifetime of KFT has employed an average of 4 FTE per annum and has provided work opportunities for at least 5 local and external contractors.  Economic outputs include:&#xa0;KFT is part of the fabric of the Knoydart community and has assisted and supported the Knoydart Foundation in a wide range of community activities. Social outcomes include:-&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013
