Written evidence submitted by Reprieve (LAI 0066)default&#xa0;
defaultReprieve is a legal charity which works on death penalty cases around the world and human rights abuses committed as part of the ‘War on Terror.’  
default&#xa0;
defaultReprieve has serious concerns about the range of proposals set out in ‘Transforming Legal Aid,’ but this ev
defaultidence will focus on the ‘residence test,’ as this has most direct relevance to our area of work.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough slight changes to the proposals have been set out in the MoJ’s recent ‘Next Steps’ consultation, the fundamental problems remain.
default&#xa0;
defaultFirst, by denying
default access to legal aid for those not resident in the UK, the proposals will in many cases put the Government beyond the reach of the rule of law when it comes to its activities overseas.  Those who have been wronged by the activities of the UK Government ove
defaultrseas will be denied the funding they need to secure legal redress.

defaultExamples include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSecond, although the Government claims its aim is to exclude only those without a “strong connection to the UK,” the residence test will still shut out British citizens and residents si
defaultmply because they are not in the country at the time of applying – a situation which may be unavoidable should they be detained overseas at the time.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThird, the test will still shut out those who, although not resident in the UK, have provided significant services on behalf of the UK, and therefore should arguably considered to have a ‘strong connection.’  Notable examples include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe residence test will therefore, despite recent tweaks, still shut out deserving cases, including those brought by British citizens or those with clear links to the UK.  
default&#xa0;
defaultCrucially, it will exempt much of the British Government’s behaviour overseas – wh
defaultere some of the most serious human rights abuses have taken place – from being held accountable through the courts.  It is worth noting that the Justice Secretary’s parallel moves announced earlier this year to introduce “
defaulta tighter test for standing
default” will 
defaultfurther contribute to this effect.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultIt therefore does not seem far-fetched to see in these measures an aim not merely to reduce costs – the Government itself 
defaulthas not identified any savings from the introduction of the residence test
default –
default but rather to redu
defaultce the ability of the public to hold the state accountable through the courts.
default 
default  This is an alarming move, which cannot be justified on the grounds of savings, and must be resisted.
