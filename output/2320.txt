[[[Thelma Rowell – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I should like to draw the attention of the Committee scrutinising the deregulation bill the obvious commonsense observation that sealed and unsealed roads are entirely different in function and use and should not be classified in the same way and therefore should not be subjected to the same regulation.&#xa0;In this I support the contention of Action Groups countrywide, including the Yorkshire Dales Green Lane Alliance.&#xa0;If unsealed roads were reclassified as restricted byways, which would automatically exclude recreational motor use, it seems to me that traffic regulation orders for them would become unnecessary.  The unreasonable situation that there is not right of appeal against a local authority refusing to grant a TRO would automatically be resolved.&#xa0;&#xa0;30 August 13&#xa0;
