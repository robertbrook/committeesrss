&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from NECTAR (SRN 023)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road               users, whilst also improving the environment?                                          It is difficult not to see a contradiction within this question: policies as such improve nothing&#xa0;                                          until they have been put into place.&#xa0;Meanwhile, environmental improvement, for many people, road&#xa0;                                          users or not, could be seen to involve reduction of road traffic that&#xa0;produces harmful emissions,&#xa0;                                          plus greater positive encouragement to non-motorists - not just cyclists and pedestrians using the                                          road itself (where they have permission to do so), but those of all types trying to cross one of the&#xa0;                                          defined "strategic" roads.&#xa0;                                          Over and above all these considerations, NECTAR considers that the effective and lasting&#xa0;                                          enhancement&#xa0;of 

[[[safety]]]&#xa0;for all road users should always be a fundamental, indeed an automatic,&#xa0;                                          required output.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;2                             How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport&#xa0;                            modes?                                          It depends where you look, and (often) on which 'other' transport modes are being planned for.&#xa0;                                          One of the&#xa0;strikingly honest points to&#xa0;emerge from the recent launch of the NECC/IPPR report&#xa0;                                          "Faraway So Close", on&#xa0;international connectivity and the North-East region,&#xa0;is that, too often,&#xa0;                                          transport modes plan with almost&#xa0;complete disregard for any other method of travel but theirs.&#xa0;                                                                                    The Government's&#xa0;policy for roads, insofar&#xa0;as it can be discerned at all, seems similarly blinkered&#xa0;                                          for much of the time. NECTAR takes the view that&#xa0;any improvement to, or changes on, the strategic&#xa0;                                          road network should be made to the benefit of as many&#xa0;people, in as many categories (e.g., as an&#xa0;                                          irreducible minimum, motorist, cyclist, pedestrian, bus/tram/trolley-bus user), as is possible.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;              &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;3a &#xa0;&#xa0;              How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road network?&#xa0;&#xa0;                            In the light of the recently-published National Traffic Survey's figures on traffic for 2012, which&#xa0;                                          show&#xa0;an overall decline&#xa0;compared with those of 10 years&#xa0;earlier, it is tempting to dismiss it out&#xa0;                                          of hand as based&#xa0;on a mixture of wishful thinking&#xa0;and simple guesswork. Worryingly, it assumes&#xa0;                                          that current dips in numbers&#xa0;result solely from present austerity, and so will rise once "growth"&#xa0;                                          returns. We doubt this,&#xa0;given the increasing environmental awareness of the population as a whole,&#xa0;                                          and also the inherent unevenness&#xa0;of such signs of growth already claimed - the numbers of young&#xa0;                                          people acquiring cars, for instance, are in&#xa0;continuing decline, for whatever reason(s) this may be -&#xa0;                                          and it will always be difficult usefully to generalise&#xa0;about individual decisions of any sort.&#xa0;&#xa0;                            &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;The only consistently-upward trend in any mode of transport, which has lasted for at least the last&#xa0;                                          10 years,&#xa0;without exception, is that in passenger rail journeys, recession or no recession. Highways&#xa0;                                          policy in its&#xa0;wider sense must always take this into account.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;3b              &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?&#xa0;&#xa0;                            It is difficult to understand how anyone outside a government may reasonably be expected to advise&#xa0;                                          on this.&#xa0;&#xa0;4a&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network?&#xa0;                                          Without clarifying who, in this context, "we" are, it is frankly impossible to answer this question&#xa0;                                          directly. One&#xa0;might, thinking&#xa0;laterally, suggest that to improve the 'efficiency' of travel on any road                                          it is advisable to pursue&#xa0;policies that give strong&#xa0;incentives to motorised road users to change to&#xa0;                                          other modes of travel, most likely rail,&#xa0;but not ignoring the potential of bus&#xa0;services, insofar as these&#xa0;                                          are available on 'strategic' roads.&#xa0;                            &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;We in NECTAR point out that the movement of large numbers of people into and out of urban&#xa0;                                          employment&#xa0;centres can only be achieved effectively and efficiently with the use of mass transit&#xa0;                                          systems - bus, tram, trolleybus, train - singly or in combination. In practice, we see too many cars&#xa0;                                          carrying 25% or less of their capacity (the driver)&#xa0;clogging up urban roads needlessly, with adverse&#xa0;                                          environmental consequences to match. Sadly, the largely-privatised régimes under which bus and&#xa0;                                          rail systems are now run make a modal change the more difficult - but&#xa0;NECTAR considers that the&#xa0;                                          effort needs to be made nonetheless.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; 4b &#xa0;What impact will new technology have?&#xa0;              &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;Unless, by "new technology", you mean tram and trolleybus routes introduced on existing roads,&#xa0;                                          we are not&#xa0;qualified to answer this in any helpful way. To our native country's enduring shame, the&#xa0;                                          gestation period for UK&#xa0;schemes of this sort holds the&#xa0;world record for longevity, so we assume&#xa0;                                          that they are not what you mean here.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;     5a   What mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic&#xa0;                            roads&#xa0;and attract new investors?&#xa0;&#xa0;                            At a time of conspicuous austerity all round, and with more swingeing cuts announced throughout&#xa0;                                          the country, suggestions of&#xa0;increased investment in a notoriously polluting mode of transport seem in&#xa0;                                          almost totally bad taste. On the other hand, schemes for better 

[[[ma]]]

[[[nagement ]]]of traffic levels, including                            &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;priority as of right for users of an increased network of public transport on strategic roads, regardless&#xa0;                                          of&#xa0;who invested in it,&#xa0;would have our full support.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; 5b &#xa0;&#xa0;Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK?                                          Yes, but not always of the sort that back up the government's assumption of the need for miles of                                          new&#xa0;roads in a country that "Action for&#xa0;Roads" freely admits to be compact by comparison with much&#xa0;                                          of elsewhere&#xa0;in Europe. To take just two examples:&#xa0;&#xa0;                            (i)              the paper quotes France&#xa0;as spending much higher amounts on vastly greater&#xa0;kilometrage of&#xa0;                                          motorways&#xa0;than the UK since 1990, blithely ignoring the fact that              France occupies a much larger&#xa0;                                          area in relation&#xa0;to its population than does the UK. It then mentions the fact that, in the same&#xa0;                                          period, 6 new&#xa0;TGV rail&#xa0;lines have been constructed, involving a similarly impressive total length,&#xa0;                                          but, equally blithely, ignores&#xa0;the obvious reaction - where are&#xa0;their UK counterparts? If there had&#xa0;                                          been an equal enthusiasm, during&#xa0;the same 20+ years, for improving our rail network with similar&#xa0;                                          new&#xa0;high-speed lines, rather than just&#xa0;the one (very successful) HS1 between London and the channel                            &#xa0;              tunnel, might not the alleged need for&#xa0;extra roads have largely disappeared?&#xa0;&#xa0;                            (ii)              &#xa0;as a country whose population density is more comparable to ours, Germany has a far more pro-                            &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;public transport-oriented road and rail policy, which the UK would do well to imitate. Hamburg, for&#xa0;                                          instance, has no problem in providing S-bahn routes at unbelievably low prices to the passenger, along-                                          side its considerable road network (on which, incidentally, a good proportion of commuters cycle, by                                          choice, in full safety). Bavaria also scores highly on its provision of bus/train interchange as a reliable&#xa0;                                          alternative to&#xa0;private motoring.                                                                                    &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 6a                   How should the Highways Agency be reformed&#xa0;to make it “the world’s leading&#xa0;                            highway operator”?&#xa0;&#xa0;                            Informed opinion suggests that the Highways Agency in its present form should, if anything, take&#xa0;                                          on a more&#xa0;arm's length relationship&#xa0;with the Department of Transport when its current agreements&#xa0;                                          expire in 2015.&#xa0;&#xa0;                                          That apart, NECTAR can see no point in aiming to be a&#xa0;"world leader" in a field that is essentially&#xa0;                                          confined to&#xa0;the one country which it is supposed to be working for. Or are we, perhaps, threatened&#xa0;                                          with a Europe-wide open&#xa0;market for competitive bids between the equivalent bodies in other countries&#xa0;                                          for the privilege/right/curse of&#xa0;looking after main roads in any other EU member country?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 6b              &#xa0;&#xa0;What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better&#xa0;                            management of the strategic road network?&#xa0;                            This question assumes more, in our view, than it is entitled to - mainly, but not only, that the&#xa0;                                          network is not&#xa0;              being well managed now and/or&#xa0;that the private sector is, by definition, better&#xa0;                                          qualified to manage it than any&#xa0;public body.&#xa0;&#xa0;This concludes the responses that we as NECTAR wish to send to the committee.&#xa0;NECTAR is the North-East Combined Transport Activists' Roundtable, and we have contributed responses to several&#xa0;other&#xa0;HoC Inquiries on transport-related matters.&#xa0;              &#xa0;Contact details: &#xa0;P J Walker (co-ordinator), 26 Devon Crescent, Billingham, Tees-side.                                          email as above: phone/fax number, 01642.566.396 (also answering-machine)&#xa0;              NECTAR is an open, voluntary, umbrella body, established to provide a forum in which the many organisations with an&#xa0;              interest in&#xa0;sustainable&#xa0;transport in all its forms can develop a co-ordinated view on contemporary transport issues.&#xa0;              NECTAR provides&#xa0;opportunity&#xa0;for the exchange of news, studies and information.&#xa0;&#xa0;              The NECTAR area of interest covers the North-East of England from the North Sea coast to the Pennines, and stretches&#xa0;              from&#xa0;Scotland to North Yorkshire.
