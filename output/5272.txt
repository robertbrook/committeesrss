[[[)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;I am writing further to your invitation to provide evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee on the draft Wales Bill.&#xa0;In advance of the oral session which the Minister for Finance and I are attending on 20January, I thought it would be helpful to provide you with the Welsh Government's initial assessment of the draft Bill.&#xa0;The enclosed paper highlights, on the basis of our preliminary review, the clauses that I believe the Welsh Government will be able to support and those that will require further consideration.  I would be happy to expand upon the Welsh Government's stance on any of the policy related matters when we meet next week.&#xa0;You will appreciate, however, that much of the technical detail of the draft Bill is still under consideration. Whilst I will, of course, endeavour to respond as fully as possible to the Committee’s questions on the draft Bill, the scope to examine its detail may be somewhat limited at this time.&#xa0;&#xa0;15 January 2014&#xa0;

[[[e]]]We are not currently satisfied that the legislative competence conferred under the draft Bill is sufficientlywide to give full effect to the Welsh Government’s objectives.  The Bill should be amended to put beyond any doubt the legislative competence of the National Assembly for Wales to make provision in relation to "local taxes"; and to broaden legislative competence so as to give effect to recommendation 32 of Silk, concerning the need for the National Assembly for Wales to have control over its own budgetary processes in connection with the new fiscal powers being devolved.&#xa0;We are not satisfied that the draft Bill expressly confers legislative competence in respect of the"collection and management" of devolved taxes.&#xa0;&#xa0;
