[[[(AMR0036)]]]&#xa0;The Society for Applied Microbiology (SfAM) is the oldest microbiology society in the UK. &#xa0;SfAM envisages a future where applied microbiology research and development is strong in the UK and beyond, and the applications of microbiology contribute significantly to all global challenges facing humanity, including infectious diseases; the changing environment; sustainability of energy, food, water, and land resources; and economic growth.&#xa0;This response is in addition to SfAM’s endorsement of the Society of Biology submission. SfAM is a member organization of the Society of Biology.&#xa0;Q. How has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q.&#xa0;What are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;It will also be important to understand what resistance reservoir exists in normal human and animal commensal microbiota (even prior to any antibiotic exposure). &#xa0;We need to know:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q. Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q. What measures (including behavioural change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Q. What global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?&#xa0;&#xa0;UK 1970 - The solution - Swann recommendations:&#xa0;

[[[5-year strategy presented on European Antibiotic Awareness Day,18 November 2011 ]]]

[[[ ]]]Holistic approach: public health, food safety, consumer safety, environment, animal health and welfare as well as non-therapeutic use of antimicrobials &#xa0;

[[[WHO Europe strategy on antibiotic resistance ]]]

[[[Seven action areas: ]]]1. Promote national coordination 2. Strengthen surveillance 3. Promote rational use of antibiotics, including surveillance of antibiotic consumption 4. Improve infection control and stewardship of antibiotic use in health care settings 5. Promote surveillance, prevention and control of antibiotic resistance in the food chain 6. Promote research and innovation on new antibiotics 7. Improve awareness on antibiotic use and risk of increasing resistance &#xa0;Fighting antibiotic resistance a priority for WHO/Europe European strategy under development 

[[[2011 publication suggests actions for tackling antibiotic resistance from a food safety perspective ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Key messages for countries ]]]1. Improve overall coordination 2. Improve regulatory framework 3. Reduce the need for and promote prudent use of antibiotics 4. Improve surveillance 5. Advocate and communicate 6. Build capacity and provide training 7. Address knowledge gaps and research needs &#xa0;

[[[Intergovernmental Task Force on AMR, 2007-2010]]] 

[[[Objectives ]]]1. To assess the risks to human health associated with the presence in food and feed of antimicrobial resistant organisms, antimicrobial resistant genes or residues of antimicrobials 2. To develop risk management advice based on that assessment to reduce such a risk

[[[Description: ]]]Develop guidance within the remit of Codex mandate for safe and prudent antimicrobial usage for containment of resistance in food production which focuses on public health, is based on sound science and follows risk analysis principles, and takes into account the work of other international organizations.

[[[&#xa0;]]]Q. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?&#xa0;Strengths:  realisation that there is a problem and that measure should be undertaken to combat this problem.&#xa0;The Department of Health 5 year strategy states at Point 2.1, page 8; ‘Increasing scientific evidence suggests that the clinical issues with antimicrobial resistance that we face in human medicine are primarily the result of antibiotic use in people, rather than antibiotics in animals’.&#xa0;Weaknesses: lack of willingness to introduce comprehensive legislation to combat resistance development in both the human and veterinary sectors.&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/13/jac.dkt349.full.pdf+html
