"&#xa0;\nFurther written evidence submitted by the Cabinet Office&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe ‘Nudge Unit’ or Behavioural Insights Team did not have any formal discussions with Defra on the proposed plastic bag charge. Although there is good evidence that introducing a 5p charge for single use carrier bags in Wales did dramatically decrease the number of bags issued, specifically by about 80%. \n&#xa0;All the charging schemes in place and proposed across the UK have similar structures.\n&#xa0;\n They put in place a 5p charge on carrier bags in order to reduce litter and the environmental cost of producing all that plastic.\n&#xa0;\nThere are differences across the UK to reflect local circumstances.\n&#xa0;\n In England the charge will focus on plastic bags as it is a targeted, proportionate approach to the problem of carrier bag distribution and littering. The Government will exempt small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce the administrative burden. We also intend to exempt biodegradable bags that meet certain standards.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n21 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
