[normal]Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria [CST0072][bold]&#xa0;[bold]Further to your letter dated 6th December requesting information for your inquiry into crime statistics and in particular the accuracy of police recorded crime and whether the Police and Crime Commissioner can have confidence in crime statistics.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To inform your inquiry please find below responses to the two questions you ask.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. What if any targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording practices?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Police and Crime Plan includes targets within each of the five objectives which are detailed on the attached sheet. The inclusion of targets in police and crime plan should not in any way affect the police crime recording practices as we would expect Northumbria Police's recording practices to be consistent and accurate to ensure that we maintain our current high levels of confidence amongst local communities. Performance is monitored through regular fortnightly meetings with the chief constable and through quarterly performance reviews meetings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]How do you reassure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Chief Constable provides the PCC with an overview of the force's performance in relation to crime statistics recording which is informed by regular internal audits and review of the processes within Northumbria Police. The force also carried out an 'extraordinary audit' which included a significantly larger number of cases than the regular audits, which are still carried out. The findings were reported to the PCC and another audit is planned for the near future.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition we are aware of the value of external audit and evaluation include HMIC reports. Post-election, we were able to consider HMIC reports, including an ASB inspection in 
[normal]20 12 
[normal]and a national thematic inspection, Cutting the Blue Tape: Tackling Police Bureaucracy associated with crime recording. Although it was produced in 20 II the report highlighted Northumbria Police as having a strong performance culture and audit regime and that sampling indicated good levels of compliance under NCRS and no crimes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We will continue to consider the crime recording practices and internal and external audits and inspection as part of our performance management regime.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I trust that this provides appropriate information for your inquiry, if not do not hesitate to contact me.
