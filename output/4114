defaultI cannot understand why more of an effort is not being made to try and move cyclists and traffic further apart from each other. I would imagine, though have no statistics to back it up, that the number of pedestrians killed by cyclists on pavements is virt
defaultually zero annually. Clearly this is not the case with cyclists and vehicles.  
defaultIf this is agreed as accurate – surely many lives could be saved by simply finding ways for cyclists and pedestrians to share pavements, as happens in some (seemingly randomly 
defaultallocated)areas, and certainly happens in other countries. This is one area in which Boris could simply use differently coloured paint to some effect.
