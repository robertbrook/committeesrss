[normal]I cannot understand why more of an effort is not being made to try and move cyclists and traffic further apart from each other. I would imagine, though have no statistics to back it up, that the number of pedestrians killed by cyclists on pavements is virt
[normal]ually zero annually. Clearly this is not the case with cyclists and vehicles.  
[normal]If this is agreed as accurate – surely many lives could be saved by simply finding ways for cyclists and pedestrians to share pavements, as happens in some (seemingly randomly 
[normal]allocated)areas, and certainly happens in other countries. This is one area in which Boris could simply use differently coloured paint to some effect.
