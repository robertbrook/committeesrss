[[[Background.]]]&#xa0;Although I withdrew from the electrical trade in 2011,  I was an NICEIC Approved Contractor when the Part P Scheme was introduced in 2005.  Initially ( as evidenced by an article I published in the Observer newspaper in January 2005) I welcomed the scheme as a probable solution to the problem of “cowboy” electricians.&#xa0;Between 2005 and 2009  worked under contract to the NICEIC as an Associate Assessor, during which time I carried out around 1300 inspection visits on contractors registered under the Domestic Installer Scheme.  I was therefore in a good position to observe both the effectiveness of the scheme and the efficiency of the NICEIC, as the largest Part P scheme operator.&#xa0;The question for the Committee should not be whether a single scheme would be an improvement, but rather whether the scheme operators are doing a proper job.&#xa0;My contract was abruptly terminated by the NICEIC in June 2009, for reasons which I believe call into question their motivation and priorities.  During my time as an Assessor I was aware of many examples from my own experience of the failure of the NICEIC to carry out the requirements of the scheme.&#xa0;Most of these examples were reported by me to my supervisor or to the NICEIC  office at the time, without any action being taken.  When my contract was terminated I wrote to Jim Speirs (the head of the NICEIC), pointing out their lamentable record, and received a reply which not only ignored most of the points I had raised, but gave inadequate and erroneous replies to the others.  I wrote again to point this out, and received a letter from Emma Mc Carthy (now Emma Clancy) which bluntly stated their refusal to discuss the matter further.&#xa0;I then set up a website (Part P Survival.co.uk), which I kept online for one year, the purpose of which was to publicise the  many errors and failings of the Part  P scheme, with specific reference to my experience with the NICEIC.&#xa0;

[[[Experience.]]]&#xa0;Having carried out 1300 visits, and having been complimented on my reliability and competence,  my contract was terminated on the basis of 6 complaints received from contractors I had visited.  The substance of these complaints was that I had behaved in a discourteous manner.&#xa0;The significant factor was the reluctance of the NICEIC to support me against these accusations, despite evidence that they were largely unjustified.  I formed the view that they were more concerned with keeping contractors on the scheme, and hence paying subscriptions, than with maintaining the standards of the scheme. I consider it impossible to carry out such inspections without occasionally giving offence; in my subsequent discussion with my supervisor it was clear that I was expected to refrain from offending, even when such an approach made it impossible to conduct the inspection.&#xa0;

[[[Observations.]]]&#xa0;During my years as an Assessor I noted the following failures of the NICEIC from my own experience:&#xa0;a) Many contractors were failing to notify work as required – the worst case was one who had 120 unnotified jobs over 2 years, without any action being taken.&#xa0;b) Contractors misusing the NICEIC logo, by claiming to be Approved Contractors when they were in fact Domestic Installers.  &#xa0;c) Failure to take positive action against contractors when dangerous work had been observed.&#xa0;d) Lack of on-going training of Assessors, leading to a highly individualistic and non-standardised inspection process.  I saw many examples of significant non-compliances with the scheme which had not been noted by previous Assessors or Area Engineers.&#xa0;e) Poor communication from supervisors.&#xa0;f) Many contractors were incompetent, and should not have been accepted on to the scheme in the first place.&#xa0;g) I received a number of complaints to my website from clients of NICEIC contractors, stating that they had been of no help in resolving problems caused by sub-standard work.&#xa0;h) It was far too easy for contractors to show me two “good” sites for inspection, when the rest of their work remained unexamined.  This was a point I raised with my NICEIC supervisor, and was told not to press the point.  I know from my own experience as a contractor that there are many ways to “fool” an inspector, thus rendering the process meaningless.&#xa0;  

[[[Misleading statistics.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]As part of the research I carried out for my website I investigated the claims made by the NICEIC and ESC concerning the number of house fires.  I see that they are still using the figure of 12,500 annually, although I could find no basis for that anywhere.&#xa0;In his letter, Jim Speirs stated that the figures came from RoSPA.  When I checked I found that they had no such data available, and had not supplied any figures to the NICEIC.  RoSPA  did produce a figure  of 2788 injuries subsequently quoted by the NICEIC and ESC, without seeing fit to mention that the figure was an estimate!  The actual recorded figure was 136.&#xa0;RoSPA told me that their figures came from the ONS, who in their turn told me thay they do not keep figures for individual causes of accidents, only total numbers.&#xa0;It remains a mystery where the NICEIC gets its statistics from, but it is verging on the fraudulent to quote such statistics without a proper source.&#xa0;

[[[5)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Misleading advertising.]]]&#xa0;a) Following a list published by the ESC, I contacted Building Control offices in nine UK cities.  According to the list, these were towns in which people  were most likely to carry out DIY electrical work, and by implication should show a number of Building Control notifications to comply with Part P.&#xa0;None of the offices I spoke to could report a single case of action taken against a homeowner for non-compliance, probably making this the only law never to have been broken!  All of the Building Inspectors I spoke to said they were heartily sick of Part P and wished that it could be scrapped.  &#xa0;b)  The very low figures for public awareness of the scheme are in themselves wildly optimistic.  I have met hundreds of householders who had no idea what it meant.&#xa0;6)  

[[[Response from contractors and their clients]]]&#xa0;Nearly all contractors I visited were completely cynical about Part P, regarding it as an unfair and  unnecessary tax on their business.  They also resented the notion that they had  regularly to prove their competence.&#xa0;All of the emails (except one) sent to my website reflected this view.  As stated above, I also received complaints fron the client of NICEIC-registered contractors, to the effect that the organisation had failed to resolve problems caused by shoddy work.&#xa0;

[[[7) Conclusions]]]&#xa0;a) The obvious flaw in the scheme is that the operators receive subscriptions from those they regulate.  As I have  always asked, would road safety improve if Driving Test Examiners got a bonus for each pass?  There is a clear conflict of interest, and a corresponding temptation to go easy,  to “turn a blind eye”  during inspections, in order to keep up the numbers of enrolled contractors.&#xa0;b)  The raison d'etre for the scheme was the the supposed high numbers of fatalities and injuries caused by faulty electrical wiring.  I could find no evidence to support this. There are in fact very few deaths, most of which take place in industrial and commercial premises, which are not covered by Part P.&#xa0;House fires are caused by misuse of equipment (eg. hanging wet clothes over electric heaters) or bycandles etc., rather than by fixed wiring.  Again, Part P only applies to fixed wiring.   Better design of appliances and increased public awareness of risk would be far more effective in saving lives.   In any case, it is generally known that house fires are often attributed to electrical faults, when no other cause can be found.&#xa0;c)  The fitting of an RCD (residual current device) to a domestic installation would go a long way to preventing death or injury.  If it was required by law to fit an RCD, the work required to ensure its correct action in older installations would soon bring all house wiring up to a safe standard.&#xa0;d) The NICEIC, as the largest scheme operator, often failed to carry out its stated function, and showed no interest in doing so even when its failing were pointed out; the chain can only be as strong as its weakest link.  The standard of inspection to ensure compliance among contractors was in my experience very low.&#xa0;e)  The lack of enforcement of Part P, and indeed the impossibility of effective enforcement, lends weight to the idea that it should be scrapped, and that we return to the position prior to 2005.  It was and is an ill-considered and poorly-administered scheme.  &#xa0;f) In my view it is not possible to legislate for a sense of personal responsibility.  Electricians have this in common with surgeons, bus drivers and pilots; that their mistakes can kill! If that is not sufficient to bring them to an awareness of their responsibility, then Part P will not.  Surely existing laws (such as the Health and Safety at Work Act) are enough to deal with unsafe work?&#xa0;
