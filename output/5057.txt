[[[Points of Clarification in response to the uncorrected transcript]]]&#xa0;In response to Q241 I wish to add the following to provide a more detailed chronology to assist the Committee. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I was also asked at Q243 how many police information notices has Sussex Police issued last year? I can confirm that we have recorded two thousand and four (2004) police information notices between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2013. &#xa0;I hope this is helpful.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
