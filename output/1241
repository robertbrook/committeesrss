defaultOne
default of the founding principles in the introduction of all staff
default when first joining Royal Mail
default is that the company 
defaultremains a social ne
defaulttwork for isolated communities. B
defaulty the inevitable introduction of economic value placed on these communities they would become even more isolated and due to the fact nationwide broadband is falling behind schedule we will see the elderly
default in particular cut off from family and friends.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default This has been highlighted in reports from Charities representing the elderly in the UK. Many of the postal staff that 
defaultis
default on rural deliveries have been on that delivery for a number of years, and become frie
defaultnds of their customers
default?
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf there is no impact on the USO by the privatisation, how is it possible for the competitors (TNT) to deliver within central London only every other day per household?  With their staff employed on zero 
defaulthour contracts and minimum
default wage?
default&#xa0;

defaultbe removed?

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs Postcomm 
defaultand now Ofcom are
default unable to make a decision whether or not the Business Collection, be part of the USO, 
defaultwould privatisation impact greater on

defaultEnd to end competition in the postal sector Ofcomdefault (as defaultreferreddefault to by the Secretary of State).default&#xa0;defaultThe Ofcom’s statutory duty reproduced below has limited protection for the USO.defaultOfcom’s statutory duty, under section 29 of the Act, is to secure the provision of a universal service (see section 29(2)). In carrying out this duty, Ofcom must have regard to: default defaultThe need for the provision of a universal service to be financially sustainabdefaultle. This expressly includes the need for the universal service provider to make a reasonable commercial rate of return on expenditure incurred for the purpose of, or in connection with, the provision of the univdefaultersal service (see s29 (4)); anddefault The need fordefault the provision of a universal service to be efficient before the end of a reasonable period and for its provision to continue to be efficient at all subsequent times. 3.5 Any regulatory conditions imposed by Ofcom must take account of these duties. defaultTherefdefaultore if the need for financially sustainable would the impact be greater on rural areas, where even Royal Mail have admitted adefaultre loss making and subsidized defaultby urban areasdefault so the withdrawal of services on a dadefaultily basis is not in fact guaranteed.defaultThe defaultcondition does not give Ofcom the power to accept or reject an operator’s proposals. It is not akin to an authorisation process but simply a system of advanced notification. Ofcom has the powerdefault5 defaultto impose general universal service conditions (“GUSCs”) on odefaultperators providing a service within the scope of the universal service. Services within the scope of the universal service are defined in section 40 of the Act. General universal defaultservice conditions are generally applicable and are not specifically attacheddefault to an individual operator. default7.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the USO is already at a minimum, and allows Royal Mail competitors to give a minimum service, w
defaultith the 
defaultlimits
default place on Ofcom would not the ideal method for the future Royal Mail be to follow TNT’s method and limiting the del
defaultivery to every other day over a 
default6-day
default period.

defaultIs 
defaultthe protection of 
defaultthe USO,
default stated by the Secretary of Stat
defaulte,
default limited and open to abuse?
default7.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith the removal of licensees and the sale of Royal Mail I feel the privatisation will impact on an increasing unmanag
defaulteable postal market with a increased drive to the bottom, in both profits and services, as refle
defaultcted in the Dutch postal system?
default7.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI believe the Secretary of State has misunderstood the relationship between customers, delivery staff and the history behind ce
defaultnturies of the service given by generations of postal employees.
default&#xa0;
defaultShare issue and impact on staffdefault&#xa0;
defaultI also have concerns that if the staff accepts the offered shares would they issued under the Growth and infrastructure Act 2013 Para 31, Employee shareholddefaulter where there is removal of basic rights such as redundancy payments, the right to claim unfair dismissal and impact on maternity rules.default&#xa0;

default Is the threat of crown office closure just another way of privatizing the POL network by individually selling off crown office to sub postmasters or companies su

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultExecutive summary:default&#xa0;defaultThe Secretary of State statement fails to recognize the progress that Royal Mail, CWU and members of staff have made since the Hooper Report. This progress has been seen in both the modernization of the business and idefaultncreases in profits since the pension bailout.default&#xa0;defaultMy greatest concern is as indicated the USO is set as a minimum and fails to protect the bulk of the mail that staff deliver on a daily basis 6 days a week. If Royal Mail’s competitors are not faced the same rdefaultestrictions, they will increase in the number of deliveries in urban areas, which will increase the economic pressure on Royal Mail to cut back on uneconomic deliveries and collections.default&#xa0;defaultThe Secretary of State fails to take on the concerns of the staff, of all grades within Royal Mail, with the consultative ballots results showing the bulk of staff against privatisation. default&#xa0;defaultIf privatised my concerns is that we will follow the Dutch Post roudefaultte of zero hour contracts, having the mail dropped off and delivering from their homes.default&#xa0;default28 July 2013
