"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nCllr. Roger Seabourne\n [PCC Progress 49]\n&#xa0;\nThe views expressed below are my personal observations of and participa\ntion in the Hertfordshire PC\nP\n, during its nascent year and \ndo not \nnecessarily reflect the views of the organisations I represent or\n apply to \nother\n Panels.\n&#xa0;\nI have f\nocussed my comments \nmainly \non \nthe role of the PCP i\nn holding to account the PCC, which I consider to be far from satisfactory.  While I started from a position of not being supportive of the principle of an elected, political Police Commissioner, I am still open minded, waiting to be convinced of its \nmerits;\n \nhowever, I\n have serious concerns about \nthe lack of clear guidance and \nsome of the detail\n of the new governance arrangements\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. \nI believe there was \na lack of understanding about the role \nand remit of the Panel by their office\nr\ns and some members of the \nPanel\n itself.\n&#xa0;\nI\nt is \nwidely \naccepted\n that PCPs \nshould \nperform a scrutiny function for PCCs by acting as a critical \n“\nfriend\n”\n.   However, critical cronies tend not to do this and this invaluable assistance can be lost which leaves some PCCs seriously disadvantaged.\n&#xa0;\nWhile it is now quite common for a scrutiny committee to be of a si\nmilar political make up as the E\nxecutive body they scrutinise, in my personal experience they learned very early on that it was in everyon\ne’s interest, particularly the E\nxecutive\n itself\n, for there to be robust scrutiny.  The PCP, perhaps because of its\n lack of understanding, \nmake up or lack of balance\n,\n seemed to follow not so much a “light touch” scrutiny as a “light stroke”.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst I admire Paul Darby’s submission [PCC Progress 10] wishing “no PCC or his staff should be over-p\nolitically involved, if at all”, t\nhis might be rather ambitious if not impractical and n\naïve.  I fully support his wish and\n his reasons\n \nfor \nhaving a co-opted member as Chair\n, this\n \nwhile not perfect,\n would be more transparent and a considerable improvement on the current positi\non\n. Particularly because\n they would be independent of the administrative officers and hopefully\n as well\n, more independent of the PCC.\n&#xa0;\nIn my experience, the P\nCP did not \nfully \nunderstand the role of a scrutiny panel, (\nalso \nsee 4 below).  They were defensive towards questions from the public which then developed into a strong culture of denial \nas\n more unanswered questions were followed \nup by further more detailed, more probing \nquestions.  \n&#xa0;\nThe PCP agreed to let the PCC have a \npublic \nquestion &amp; answer session \nat the start of Panel meetings\n allowing the public to scrutinise the PCC\n.  \nI considered \nthis \nto be inappropriate as this was the PCP’s l\nimited allocated time to do this\n, and the PCC \nalready \nhad ample opportunities elsewhere to engage directly with the public\n and could create as many more as he wished.  However, the PCP\n would not, on too many occasions, answer questions from the public themselves when \nthey attempted\n to scrutinise the Panel.\n&#xa0;\nThere was a failure of the Panel to deal properly with and answer questions from members of the public, who were not shown the respect, courtesy and consideration they deserved.\n&#xa0;\nAs the year progressed \nI be\ngan to see\n this was \nmost likely \nthe result of the over bearing influence of the administrative\n officers supporting the P\nCP.\n  \nIt\n \nis also worth considering the point that there is a strong financial incentive and perhaps even a viability issue connected with \nan\n authority (in a non unitary authority) remaining as \nthe PCP’s \nhost authority.  A\ns with any culture, once it became established, it was difficult to change.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. Each Panel has £53,000 of funding from the Home Office to support its Police and Crime Panel. I understand this figure was arrived at from the average funding required, with on-costs, to appoint a scrutiny officer.  Whilst I can see the logic of this in terms of setting a national budget referencing ‘market testing’ and comparative value for money, it bears no relation \nwhatsoever t\no the actual costs incurred to fund a system adequately in order for \nit\n to be able to perform its functions, let alone perform them to a high or even acceptable standard.\n  \nIt would be some coincidence if the vastly differing sizes of Constabularies, geographical as well as numbers employed, with different sized PCC administrations all required exactly the same amount of funding to scrutinise such vastly differing budgets.  \nIt is \nalso \nincongruous for the PCP to scrutinise the PCC’s three year budgetary plan while not being able to have a one year plan for itself.  Funding needs to be decided\n, \nsecured and \nbe \npredicab\nle for at least the medium term, as is done in almost all other similar areas.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. \nIt is widely claimed and publicised that \n“T\nhe public have the information they need to hold their PCC and force to account.”  Provided, of course, it is actually published.\nThe Government expects high standards of transparency and has set out the \ninformation that PCCs must publish to support the public in effectively holding \nthem to account. \n \nBy publically setting rates and requiring full publication of expenses quarterly the Government \nbelieves it \nis ensuring PCCs will be fair and transparent in cla\niming expenses.   \n&#xa0;\nI understand and accept it is not the Government’s role to monitor compliance, \nand \nit is for the Chief Executive, as monitoring officer, to ensure that the PCC has complied with all legal duties.  \nHowever\n, if this does not occ\nur\n, and I witnessed that it did not,\n I \nwas, and am still not\n convinced\n, \nhaving a \nP\nCP that has no powers or sanctio\nns to force compliance is valid, justified\n, helpful\n or useful.\n  \nT\nhe PCC \nis required \nto provide i\nnformation and answer questions, but there appears to be no recourse if non compliance is established.  I\nt would appear it would then be up to a member of\n the public (or perhaps the P\nCP?) to take legal action to ensure compliance, which cannot be expected to happen, not least because of the cost\n.  This is\n unacceptable.\n&#xa0;\nThe widely claimed and publicised belief is only credible if the information is actually published.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. \nThere \nwas, and still is in Hertfordshire, a conflict of \ninterest in members sitting on The County\n Community Safety Board with executi\nve powers, and sitting on the P\nCP to scrutinise decisions\n made by that Board\n, including the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the PCP.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.  There i\ns a wide\nly held perception that the P\nCP has a v\neto on \nthe setting of the \nprecept.  T\nhis is\n, in reality,\n not only misleading, but also erroneous\n and therefore dishonest\n as it only the first propo\nsal, and not the\n subsequent one, that can be vetoed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n. \n“\nIn contrast, 7 in 10 people know about police and crime commissioners.\n”\n \n(\nWritten evidence from the\n Home Office [PCC Progress 01]\n)\n“\nRecent research has demonstrated that over 60% of people have now \nheard of the PCC role.\n”\n \n(\nWrit\nten evidence from Kevin Hurley\n)\n&#xa0;\nThere is a significant difference between “having heard of” and “knowing about”.\n \nHowever, there is a huge gulf between “knowing one could go to a police authority with concerns about policing and crime” and “knowing about /\n \nhaving heard of” PCCs.\n&#xa0;\nLeaving that aside, \ni\nt is very misleadin\ng to claim “O\nnly 7% of people knew that they could go to their police authorities with concerns about policing and crime in their area while \n6o%+ / \n70% know about police and crime commiss\nioners”.\n  \nIt begs the question - \nwhat has gone on that that has made people\n (more)\n aware of PCCs?\n  \nUnfortunately, the \ncause of the raising of the level of awareness appears to be\n more the negative media reports concerning some of the quite outrageous conduct of a few PCCs\n \nrather than the, no doubt, \nsound\n work of the majority.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7\n. \nWhist t\nhe local electorate \nhas the option of \njudg\ning\n whether PCCs are making best use of public money and hold them\n to account at the ballot box, they have not given the indication that they intend to do so.  This not only does not ensure \nPCCs are making \nthe best use of public money, but also might, in reality, actively discourage it.\nBy not allowing each candidate the free\n \npost \nthat candidates for M\nembers of Parliament enjoy, the importance of the post\n \nof PCC \nwas devalued in the electorates’ eyes and it contributed to the very low turnout.\n  \nHolding them to account in this way only works \nof course \nif they \nstand for \nr\ne-election………..\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n. I concur, from m\ny personal experience of one P\nCP, \nwith the \nLocal Government Association\n’s submission that “…..\nPanels have come to realise that the formal powers, such as they are, have at best been of little use\n………………”\n \n&#xa0;\n9\n. \nThe appointment\ns\n of Deputy PCC\ns\n \nin Hertfordshire (one post, two appointments\n following the resignation of the first incumbent\n) were\n, at best, poorly handled\n.  T\nhe public were left with the widespread perception that the PCC ha\nd appointed ‘one of his mates’, \ntwice\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere is a strong case for \nelecting a Deputy PCC at the same time and for the same term as the PCC.  \nThis would be more transparent and might, in some cases, even achieve a better political balance.\n&#xa0;\nIt is also of note and some concern that the appointment of a Deputy PCC is subject to verification, \nbut the appointment of\n \nan “Assistant” PCC is not.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1\n0\n. \nIt is inconsistent to give the PCP a significant \nstatutory\n role in scrutinising their PCC’s decisions in respect of the appointment and the removal of a Chief Constable but not to be given the same \nstatutory \nresponsibility of scrutinising the PCC’s decision to extend or not to extend a Chief Constable’s fixed term appointment. \nGiven the respective four and five year terms of office of PCCs and Chief Constables, a PCC \nhaving serious concerns about the competence or performance of a \nChief Constable \nwhich warrants consideration of dismissal would\n, at certain points in the term,\n almost certainly be\n inclined\n to\nwards inertia, \n‘let\nting\n the clock tick’\n and tolerating the situation thereby\n avoid\ning\n scrutiny\n rather than grasping the issue and dealing \nwith it.\n  \n&#xa0;\n11. The legislation was rushed and the implementation even more so.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nConclusion.\nIn the final analysis, it is the effectiveness of the police force and the level of crime and disorder that matters most.  I have seen nothing \nin this new governance arrangement \nthat raises either the general public\n’s\n perception of the police or the public’s expectations\n \nof them.\n&#xa0;\nIn fact I believe\n \nbecause of \nthe adverse publicity some of the \nPCCs\n’ antics have\n attracted, and as the public do tend, unfairly and unfortunately, to \n‘lump them all together’, \nthe \npublic confidence in the Police Force is lower now that it has been for some time.  That in itself is not only a very worrying aspect but also, more critically, makes \nthe job of the police more difficult than it would otherwise be and \ncrime reduction itself much more difficult to achieve.\n&#xa0;\nAs it seems unlikely the governance arrangements will be abolished, it requires some serious amendment and fine tuning in the light of the experience and evidence.\n&#xa0;\nCllr.
