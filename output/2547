[normal]&#xa0;[bold]No assessment of[bold] the[bold] impact on children[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]While our analysis of equalities impacts is focussed on the protected 
[normal]              
[normal]characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010, we have, throughout, 
[normal]              
[normal]considered carefully the impact of our proposals on vulnerable groups, with 
[normal]              
[normal]particular regard to the best interests of children, as addressed in the 
[normal]              
[normal]relevant chapters, the IAs and th
[normal]e equality statement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However,
[normal] this is not evident in the vari
[normal]ous documents, including Annex F: Equality Statement and the Impact 
[normal]Assessments, particularly the Impact Assessment
[normal] entitled 'Cumulative Legal Aid Reforms' and those with the IA numbers MoJ194
[normal], MoJ195 and MoJ198. None of these documents mention the best interests of children.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]As a result of the procedures outlined ..., in particular the provision of 
[normal]              
[normal]advo
[normal]cacy services and the ability to refer cases to Local Authorities, the 
[normal]              
[normal]statutory Monitor or PPO, we consider that adequate support is prescribed 
[normal]              
[normal]and available to ensure that under 18 prisoners are supported and provided 
[normal]              
[normal]for and can resolve claims throug
[normal]h alternative channels such that criminal 
[normal]              
[normal]legal aid for prison law is not required apart from in the circumstances set 
[normal]              
[normal]out in the scope criteria
[normal] the removal of criminal legal aid for prison law as 
[normal]              
[normal]proposed should not detrimentally impact on them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning children (art. 3(1)), and that all the provisions of the Convention are respected in legislation and polic
[normal]y development and delivery at all levels of government demands a continuous process of child impact assessment (predicting the impact of any proposed law, policy or budgetary allocation which affects children and the enjoyment of their rights) and child 
[normal]im
[normal]pact evaluation (evaluating the ac
[normal]tual impact of implementation). 
[normal]This process needs to be built into government at all levels and as early as possible in the development of policy.

[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]Children should have the right to their own legal counsel and representation, in their own name, in proceedings where 
[normal]there is, or could be, a conflict of interest between the child and the parents or other involved parties.
[normal]3.8  
[normal]Children should have access to free legal aid, under the same or more lenient conditions as adults.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The residence test[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This goes against Article 16 of the Refugee Convention 1951, which provides that ‘[a] refugee shall have free access to the courts of law on the terr
[normal]itory of all Contracting States’ and that ‘[a]
[normal] 
[normal]refugee shall enjoy in the Contracting State in which he has his habitual residence the same treatment as a national in matters pertaining to access to the Courts, including legal assistance and exemption from
[normal] cautio judicatum solvi.’
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This leaves many other types of case that relate to safeguarding childre
[normal]n subject to the residence test. This includes
[normal] for example age dispute judicial reviews 
[normal]that determine whether someone is a child (the safeguarding consequences of which 
[normal]are extremely serious including a child potentially being detained in an adult prison or immigration removal centre or housed in unsupervised accommodation with adults). This also includes 
[normal]any other judicial review of the practice of local authorities or o
[normal]ther public bodies in 
[normal]relation to their duties to protect
[normal] children. 
[normal]The 
[normal]proposed residence
[normal] test noticeably 
[normal]still applies to
[normal] cases concerning section 17 of the Children Act 1989 - duties to children in need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The exempti
[normal]on thus 
[normal]leaves very significant gaps in the civil legal aid that trafficking 
[normal]victims can access. They will not have access to civil legal aid in public law, leaving them unable to bring a judicial review. This is striking because the only way to challenge 
[normal]a negative reasonable or conclusive grounds decision is by judicial review. They will not be able to access legal aid in community care, for example if a child or young person is unlawfully denied services by a local authority or unlawfully age disputed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The immigration applications contained in the exemption are very narrow: it is only where a
[normal] victim of domestic violence can make specific applications that they access civil legal for this. In our experience, many victims of domestic violence would not fall into these exemptions in relation to their immigration applications.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Moreover, the resid
[normal]ence test remains in relation to significant areas of civil law relevant to victims of domestic violence and forced marriage, including public law, community care, civil actions and actions against the police. For example, if an undocumented migrant mother
[normal] was the victim of domestic violence, had to leave the home and was facing destitution with her children, and the 
[normal]local authorit
[normal]y
[normal] failed to meet its duties to the children, she would not get legal aid for a community care or public law lawyer to challenge 
[normal]this.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This means tha
[normal]t applications for bail made by those held in immigration detention are covered. However, immigration detainees will not be able to access civil legal aid in many important areas. This includes civil actions for damages for unlawful detention
[normal], or civil cla
[normal]ims arising from mistreatment in detention or discrimination
[normal]. Very significantly, age-disputed children held in immigration detention as adults will not be able to access community care or public law legal aid to challenge an unlawful age assessment by a l
[normal]ocal authority.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This leaves an enormo
[normal]us array of judicial reviews 
[normal]subject to the residence test. To take some examples from CCLC’s practice, we will not be able to challenge unlawful age assessments where a child does not pass the residence test; we will not be able to challenge unlawful failures by local authorities to 
[normal]meet duties to 
[normal]children where children do
[normal] not pass the residence test; and we will not be able to bring judicial reviews to challenge the manifest failings of the Home Office in relation to children and young people where they do not meet the residence tes
[normal]t. Whole developing areas of law around 
[normal]the rights of 
[normal]those who do not have leave in the UK
[normal], some of the most vulnerable people in this country, are likely to
[normal] disappear. We believe limiting access to the courts in this way has extremely significant constit
[normal]utional implications, thr
[normal]eatens the rule of law, and undermines
[normal] the government’s obligation
[normal]s to protect
[normal] human rights, and particularly
[normal] children’s rights.

[normal]              
[normal]Respondents raised particular concerns about the lack of assessment of the 
[normal]              
[normal]impact on children and specifically child victims of human trafficking. Many 
[normal]              
[normal]responses highlighted the protections afforded to children by the United 
[normal]              
[normal]Nations Convention on the Ri
[normal]ghts of the Child (UNCRC).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, the government says: ‘We do not accept the view that the proposed residence test would result in contravention of our domestic and international legal obligations ... we would ensure that legal aid will continue to be 
[normal]available where necessary to comply with our obligations u
[normal]nder EU or international law set
[normal] out in Schedule 1 to LASPO.’
[normal] This is based on the supposed availability of except
[normal]ional funding as a 
[normal]safeguard for those excluded from legal aid by the residence tes
[normal]t.
