defaultWhile our analysis of equalities impacts is focussed on the protected 
default              
defaultcharacteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010, we have, throughout, 
default              
defaultconsidered carefully the impact of our proposals on vulnerable groups, with 
default              
defaultparticular regard to the best interests of children, as addressed in the 
default              
defaultrelevant chapters, the IAs and th
defaulte equality statement.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever,
default this is not evident in the vari
defaultous documents, including Annex F: Equality Statement and the Impact 
defaultAssessments, particularly the Impact Assessment
default entitled 'Cumulative Legal Aid Reforms' and those with the IA numbers MoJ194
default, MoJ195 and MoJ198. None of these documents mention the best interests of children.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultAs a result of the procedures outlined ..., in particular the provision of 
default              
defaultadvo
defaultcacy services and the ability to refer cases to Local Authorities, the 
default              
defaultstatutory Monitor or PPO, we consider that adequate support is prescribed 
default              
defaultand available to ensure that under 18 prisoners are supported and provided 
default              
defaultfor and can resolve claims throug
defaulth alternative channels such that criminal 
default              
defaultlegal aid for prison law is not required apart from in the circumstances set 
default              
defaultout in the scope criteria
default the removal of criminal legal aid for prison law as 
default              
defaultproposed should not detrimentally impact on them.
default&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
defaultEnsuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning children (art. 3(1)), and that all the provisions of the Convention are respected in legislation and polic
defaulty development and delivery at all levels of government demands a continuous process of child impact assessment (predicting the impact of any proposed law, policy or budgetary allocation which affects children and the enjoyment of their rights) and child 
defaultim
defaultpact evaluation (evaluating the ac
defaulttual impact of implementation). 
defaultThis process needs to be built into government at all levels and as early as possible in the development of policy.

defaultChildren should have the right to their own legal counsel and representation, in their own name, in proceedings where 
defaultthere is, or could be, a conflict of interest between the child and the parents or other involved parties.
default3.8  
defaultChildren should have access to free legal aid, under the same or more lenient conditions as adults.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe residence testdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis goes against Article 16 of the Refugee Convention 1951, which provides that ‘[a] refugee shall have free access to the courts of law on the terr
defaultitory of all Contracting States’ and that ‘[a]
default 
defaultrefugee shall enjoy in the Contracting State in which he has his habitual residence the same treatment as a national in matters pertaining to access to the Courts, including legal assistance and exemption from
default cautio judicatum solvi.’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis leaves many other types of case that relate to safeguarding childre
defaultn subject to the residence test. This includes
default for example age dispute judicial reviews 
defaultthat determine whether someone is a child (the safeguarding consequences of which 
defaultare extremely serious including a child potentially being detained in an adult prison or immigration removal centre or housed in unsupervised accommodation with adults). This also includes 
defaultany other judicial review of the practice of local authorities or o
defaultther public bodies in 
defaultrelation to their duties to protect
default children. 
defaultThe 
defaultproposed residence
default test noticeably 
defaultstill applies to
default cases concerning section 17 of the Children Act 1989 - duties to children in need.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe exempti
defaulton thus 
defaultleaves very significant gaps in the civil legal aid that trafficking 
defaultvictims can access. They will not have access to civil legal aid in public law, leaving them unable to bring a judicial review. This is striking because the only way to challenge 
defaulta negative reasonable or conclusive grounds decision is by judicial review. They will not be able to access legal aid in community care, for example if a child or young person is unlawfully denied services by a local authority or unlawfully age disputed.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe immigration applications contained in the exemption are very narrow: it is only where a
default victim of domestic violence can make specific applications that they access civil legal for this. In our experience, many victims of domestic violence would not fall into these exemptions in relation to their immigration applications.
default&#xa0;
defaultMoreover, the resid
defaultence test remains in relation to significant areas of civil law relevant to victims of domestic violence and forced marriage, including public law, community care, civil actions and actions against the police. For example, if an undocumented migrant mother
default was the victim of domestic violence, had to leave the home and was facing destitution with her children, and the 
defaultlocal authorit
defaulty
default failed to meet its duties to the children, she would not get legal aid for a community care or public law lawyer to challenge 
defaultthis.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis means tha
defaultt applications for bail made by those held in immigration detention are covered. However, immigration detainees will not be able to access civil legal aid in many important areas. This includes civil actions for damages for unlawful detention
default, or civil cla
defaultims arising from mistreatment in detention or discrimination
default. Very significantly, age-disputed children held in immigration detention as adults will not be able to access community care or public law legal aid to challenge an unlawful age assessment by a l
defaultocal authority.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis leaves an enormo
defaultus array of judicial reviews 
defaultsubject to the residence test. To take some examples from CCLC’s practice, we will not be able to challenge unlawful age assessments where a child does not pass the residence test; we will not be able to challenge unlawful failures by local authorities to 
defaultmeet duties to 
defaultchildren where children do
default not pass the residence test; and we will not be able to bring judicial reviews to challenge the manifest failings of the Home Office in relation to children and young people where they do not meet the residence tes
defaultt. Whole developing areas of law around 
defaultthe rights of 
defaultthose who do not have leave in the UK
default, some of the most vulnerable people in this country, are likely to
default disappear. We believe limiting access to the courts in this way has extremely significant constit
defaultutional implications, thr
defaulteatens the rule of law, and undermines
default the government’s obligation
defaults to protect
default human rights, and particularly
default children’s rights.

defaultRespondents raised particular concerns about the lack of assessment of the 
default              
defaultimpact on children and specifically child victims of human trafficking. Many 
default              
defaultresponses highlighted the protections afforded to children by the United 
default              
defaultNations Convention on the Ri
defaultghts of the Child (UNCRC).
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the government says: ‘We do not accept the view that the proposed residence test would result in contravention of our domestic and international legal obligations ... we would ensure that legal aid will continue to be 
defaultavailable where necessary to comply with our obligations u
defaultnder EU or international law set
default out in Schedule 1 to LASPO.’
default This is based on the supposed availability of except
defaultional funding as a 
defaultsafeguard for those excluded from legal aid by the residence tes
defaultt.
