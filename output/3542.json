"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Health and Safety Executive (ESG 34)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\n1. \nThe Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) is \nthe \nhealth and safety regulator in \nGreat Britain\n for work related activities, including those associated with shale gas.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nHSE’s role is to ensure that operators of shale gas activities are adequately managing and controlling risks to the health and safety of people, whether workers, contractors, or members of the public. \n&#xa0;\n3. \nHSE has no role in setting energy policy and deciding what is the right mix of energy sources.  HSE is also not involved in \nenvironmental protection, \nlicensing or planning decisions related to shale gas.\n However, HSE does work collaboratively with the bodies responsible for overseeing such areas.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nFor shale gas operations, HSE focuses on ensuring gas wells are designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and ultimately decommissioned to ensure that the flow of gases and\n \nfluids in the well, whether fracking fluids or extracted gas or water is controlled and stays within the well. This is called ‘well integrity’ and is equally important for safety as well as environmental protection.\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the main process safety hazards?&#xa0;\n5. \nThe e\nffective management and control of well integrity is key to safe shale gas operations and mitigating the risk of environmental pollution.\n&#xa0;\n6.  \nThe main\n hazard\n from shale gas operations\n is \nthe \nuncontrolled release of hydrocarbon gas due to a failure of the well structure, which may then reach a source of ignition leading to a fire or explosion. A well\n-\ndesigned and constructed well will reduce the risks of a release of \ngas or \nfluids\n \nas low as is reasonably practicable. The actual level of risk varies, depending on how quickly and easily any release can be controlled, and on geological conditions. \n&#xa0;\n7\n. \nWhere there is a loss of well integrity, there is also the possibility of fracking fluids or water being released to the surrounding rock strata or at surface, which may have environmental consequences depending on the location of water aquifers.\n&#xa0;\n8\n. \nThe occupational health and sa\nfety risks to workers from shale gas\n pilot activities are considerably lower than for other mineral extraction industries (e.g. coal mining and offshore oil and gas). People are generally working at ground level on sites with traditional health and safety risks comparable to a simple construction site, including \nfalls or being hit by something.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;The health and safety regulatory regime&#xa0;\n9\n. \nHSE’s regulatory regime is long established\n and is \ngoal \nsetting. \nThe \ngeneral duties under the \nHealth and Safety at Work Act \netc \n1974 (HSWA) \nrequire \nrisks to workers and the public to be reduced so far\n as is reasonable practicable. \nThis is \nsupplement\ned\n with more specific regulations particular to \nthe \nextraction of gas and oil through wells, which includes shale gas operations.   \n&#xa0;\n10\n. \nThe specific regulations are:\n&#xa0;\nThese regulations require notifications to be made to HSE about the design, construction and operation of wells\n,\n and a health and safety plan which sets out how risks are managed on site;\n and\n \nThese regulations include specific requirements for all wells, whether onshore or offshore, and include well integrity provisions which apply throughout the life of shale gas wells. They also require a well operator to provide HSE with regular reports of any activities on the well and to appoint an independent well examiner to undertake regular assessments of well integrity.\n \n&#xa0;\n1\n1\n. \nThis combination of duties ensures that HSE is provided with information at key stages in the lifecycle of a well and allows \nHSE\n to assess whether risks are being adequately controlled and, if not, to intervene.  \n&#xa0;\nHow does HSE conduct its interventions?&#xa0;\n12\n. \nHSE’s intervention approach has two elements. \n&#xa0;\n13\n. \nThe first has been to contribute to the development of best practice standards for the industry as a whole with the \nUnited Kingdom Onshore Operators Group\n.\n These standards \nwere published in February 2013.  Such guidance, and existing industry codes dealing with well design and operations, sets clear expectation between HSE and operators as to how the general goal of reducing risks so far is reasonably practicable can be met. \n&#xa0;\n14\n. \nThe second element is to focus HSE interventions with particular sites and operators on the key risk control measure of ensuring well integrity. For this, HSE uses its team of expert wells engineers who cover all types of hydrocarbon wells both on and offshore. As an oil or gas well is a complex engineered construction, most of which is not accessible to visual inspection, HSE takes a lifecycle approach to well integrity. \n&#xa0;\n15\n. \nThis lifecycle \napproach \nconsists of: \n&#xa0;\nThis allows HSE to assess the well design before construction starts. This is a key phase of work where the vast majority of issues likely to have an\n impact on well integrity\n will be identified and addressed by the well operator. It includes ensuring that safety features are incorporated into the design.  \n&#xa0;\nThis provides HSE with the assurance that the operator is constructing and operating the well as described in the notification\n.  W\nhen they are not, HSE can take the appropriate action.\n&#xa0;\nThis includes site inspections to assess well integrity during the operational phase\n. \nF\nor new and first time shale gas operators\n,\n HSE and \nthe Environment Agency \nwill meet and advise them of their duties and conduct a joint inspection of their key operations. \n&#xa0;\nThe independent well examiner&#xa0;\n16\n. \nHSE’s regulatory\n approach is supplemented by the requirement \nin DCR \nfor an independent well examiner to assess \nwell \ndesign, construction and maintenance. The well examiner is an independent competent person separate from the immediate line management of the well operations \nbeing\n examin\ned\n. The well examiner can be an employee of the operating company or\n, as is normally \nthe case for \nUK\n onshore wells\n, \na contractor. \n&#xa0;\n17\n. \nThe examiner’s task is to review the proposed and actual well operations to confirm they meet the operator’s policies and procedures, comply with DCR and follow good industry practice. This may include periodic site visits.\n&#xa0;\n18\n. \nHSE checks that the operator has these arrangements in place. The well examination scheme and involvement of the well examiner is for the complete lifecycle of the well from design through to final plugging and decommissioning.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;HSE resources&#xa0;\n19\n. \nHSE has sufficient wells expertise to cope with the current exploratory phase of shale gas\n. \nIt will \nreassess the situation if \nshale gas\n moved into large-scale production.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Coordinated approaches&#xa0;\n20\n. \nHSE has long\n-\nestablished arrangements to ensure joint working wi\nth DECC, \nthe Office for Unconventional Gas and Oil \n(\nOUGO\n),\n the environment agencies (E\nnvironment \nA\ngency\n, S\ncottish \nE\nnvironment \nP\nrotection \nA\ngency\n and N\natural Resources Wales\n) and \nth\ne relevant planning authorities. \nHSE works closely with these bodies to share relevant information and to ensure that there are no material gaps between the safety, environmental protection and planning authorisation considerations, and that all material concerns are addressed.\n&#xa0;\n21\n. \nIn \nEngland\n, t\nhe E\nnvironment Agency\n and HSE have a Memorandum of Understanding in place that sets out the day-to-day arrangements for managing the broad range of operations that fall under their regulatory control. \nThis includes how they will work together to r\negulate shale gas developments.\n22\n. \nHSE and \nthe \nE\nnvironment \nA\ngency\n have agreed jointly to inspect the next series of hydraulic f\nracturing operations in \nEngland\n. \nFor new and f\nirst time shale gas operators HSE and \nthe \nE\nnvironment \nA\ngency\n will\n \nmeet and advise them of their duties under\n the relevant legislation; and \nconduct a joint inspection of the key operations\n, such as cementing.\n \n23\n. \nIf shale gas drilling was to be undertaken in \nWales\n, HSE would look to enter into similar arrangements with \nN\natural Resources Wales.\nHSE’s involvement with onshore oil and gas wells in Wales24\n. \nThere have been no shale gas wells drilled in \nWales\n.  \n25\n. \nHSE \nrecords currently show a total of 22 \nother \nwells in \nWales\n; th\ne earliest dates back to \n1941.\n \nIn the last 10 \nyears,\n HSE\n ha\ns\n processed 9 well notifications. Many of these have been for coal bed methane\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;1\n&#xa0;\n"
