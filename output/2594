[normal]Equality and Human Rights Commission – Written evidence[bold]1.0[bold]              [bold] [bold]Introduction[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Draft Deregulation Bill contains a number of proposals to reduce 
[normal]              
[normal]unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape which have an impact on equality and 
[normal]              
[normal]human rights law and the functions of the Commission. 
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission’s view is that there is fundamentally little or no conflict 
[normal]              
[normal]between its goals and those of the Government in relation to the Draft Bill: the 
[normal]              
[normal]aims of equality and growth are often linked and mutually supportive. A more 
[normal]              
[normal]equal society, in which people’s prospects 
[normal]are
[normal] determined by merit rather than 
[normal]              
[normal]by other considerations, is a more productive society. Likewise, as the 
[normal]              
[normal]economy improves, it will become easier to realise the aims of equality. 
[normal]The 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission
[normal] 
[normal]is therefore fully supportive of the need to ensure economic 
[normal]              
[normal]growth.
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission shares the aspirations behind the Bill, welcoming the 
[normal]              
[normal]opportunity to review the way it operates to understand business needs, costs 
[normal]              
[normal]and burdens better. We have
[normal] no wish to impose needless costs on business
[normal]; 
[normal]              
[normal]i
[normal]ndeed, much of what we have done in the last two years has been 
[normal]aimed at
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]enabling the private sector to redu
[normal]ce the costs of complying with e
[normal]qualit
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]requirements, and working with business
[normal]es to achieve that. 
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]However, our analysis of the proposals in the Draft Bill has shown up some 
[normal]              
[normal]significant concerns to which we draw the Joint Committee’s attention. These 
[normal]              
[normal]require further scrutiny and re-consideration by Government. In this response 
[normal]              
[normal]to the Joint Committee's call for evidence, we have focused on those 
[normal]              
[normal]proposals of most concern to the Commission, which are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]Although we have structured this response to address concerns about these   
[normal]              
[normal]clauses, rather than answering individual questions in the Joint Committee's 
[normal]              
[normal]call for evidence, our response is most relevant to questions 7 and 17 to 22, 
[normal]              
[normal]and may also assist the Joint Committee’s deliberations on other questions.
[normal]2.0[bold]              [bold]Summary [bold]of the Commission's overall analysis[bold]2.1 
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission continues to 
[normal]strongly disagree with the proposal to remove
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]e
[normal]mployment 
[normal]t
[normal]ribunals
[normal]’
[normal] wider recommendation making powers
[normal]. For reasons 
[normal]              
[normal]explained further below, it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the power 
[normal]              
[normal]which has been in force only over the last three years. The available evidence 
[normal]              
[normal]suggests that the power has been used proportionately, and that there are 
[normal]              
[normal]important clear benefits for all concerned (including employers and 
[normal]              
[normal]employees) in exercising the power to clarify necessary remedial action, and 
[normal]              
[normal]this helps to prevent further discrimination and to reduce litigation.
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]After careful scrutiny, our analysis is that 
[normal]there are very compelling
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]reasons why the growth duty should not apply to the Commission
[normal]. First, the Commission does not have many of the functions of a non-economic regulator that the growth duty proposals are intended to affect. Equality and human rights law is proposed by Government, determined by Parliament, interpreted by the courts and tribunals, so the
[normal]              
[normal]Commission does not set the relevant standards. In addition, there are formidable legal problems in applying the growth duty to the Commission in the way the Government intends. Parliament has already provided in the Equality Act 2006 that the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability of subjecting the Commission to as few constraints as possible, and 
[normal]this conflicts
[normal] with the growth duty proposals. Finally, the application of the growth duty to the Commission undermines the requirement for the Commission to be independent from the Government in the respects required for compliance with the United Nations Paris Principles for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI). We believe the application of the growth duty to the Commission creates a real risk that our United Nations 'A' status NHRI accreditation will be lost. DCMS have made considerable effort to retain and protect this status, with the strong support of FCO. The ‘A’ status of EHRC as a NHRI is important to the exercise of British soft power. 
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Taken individually or together, these concerns provide a compelling basis to 
[normal]              
[normal]remove the Commission from the list of regulators to which the Government 
[normal]              
[normal]currently proposes to apply the growth duty.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.0[bold]              [bold]Removal of e[bold]mployment [bold]t[bold]ribunals' power [bold]([bold]in s[bold]ection [bold]124[bold] Equality [bold]              [bold]              [bold]Act 2010) [bold]to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission has specific statutory duties and powers to enforce the 
[normal]              
[normal]equality enactments and to work towards the elimination of unlawful 
[normal]              
[normal]discrimination and harassment (under section 8 Equality Act 2006). 
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]Our approach to exercising our statutory functions is to enable duty-holders to 
[normal]              
[normal]comply with the legislation and take enforcement action only where it is 
[normal]              
[normal]necessary and proportionate to do so to ensure legal compliance in practice.
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The Equality Act 2010 represents the main domestic equality enactment over 
[normal]              
[normal]which the Commission has a guardianship role as a statutory enforcer. That 
[normal]              
[normal]guardianship role can be exercised in part by issuing codes of practice and 
[normal]              
[normal]guidance to improve understanding of rights and obligations and to support 
[normal]              
[normal]legal compliance. It also encompasses use of specific legal powers - such as 
[normal]              
[normal]holding inquiries, carrying out investigations, or supporting litigation through 
[normal]              
[normal]courts and tribunals - to identify and challenge non-compliance. 
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]UK equality law has been proposed by Government, scrutinised and enacted 
[normal]              
[normal]by Parliament and is interpreted by tribunals and courts. One of the general 
[normal]              
[normal]aims and principles underpinning the legislation is that prevention of 
[normal]              
[normal]discrimination is preferable to remedy after the event, and this is supported by 
[normal]              
[normal]sections 124 and 149 of the Equality Act 2010. That Act had broad cross-party 
[normal]              
[normal]political support during its Parliamentary passage. 
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]To complement the judicial system (without acting as a substitute for it), the 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission carries out follow-up work to ensure tribunal recommendations 
[normal]              
[normal]have been carried out in practice. 
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]In August 2012 the Commission responded to the Government's consultation, 
[normal]              
[normal]on proposals that included the removal of employment tribunals’ wider 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations power. Our reasons for opposing the removal of this power 
[normal]              
[normal]were:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission still believes that the ability to make "wider" 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations is an important one which should be retained. Its removal 
[normal]              
[normal]would limit the powers of tribunals to make recommendations to those cases 
[normal]              
[normal]where the recommendations would alleviate the discrimination only for an 
[normal]              
[normal]individual claimant.
[normal] So long as the current recommendations are followed, the 
[normal]              
[normal]exercise of the power benefits:
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]In the period Oct 2010 to June 2012 the Commission 
[normal]considered 
[normal]372 
[normal]employment tribunal 
[normal]decisions
[normal] decided in favour of the claimant
[normal].
[normal] Recommendations were made in 13
[normal] of th
[normal]e
[normal]se cases. It is not always clear from the decisions 
[normal]which power has been exercised; h
[normal]owever, th
[normal]e recommendations in 8 of these cases appear to have been made under the wider power
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]3.9
[normal]              
[normal]The relatively low number of recommendations might be explained by 
[normal]              
[normal]c
[normal]laimants not be
[normal]ing
[normal] aware that they can 
[normal]ask
[normal] tribunal
[normal]s to
[normal] make 
[normal]wider 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations in their case. Neither the current ET1 form nor the 
[normal]guide to 
[normal]              
[normal]making a claim
[normal] refer
[normal] to the possibility of 
[normal]such 
[normal]recommendations being made.
[normal] 
[normal]3.10
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission analyses the employment tribunals’ decisions in which wider 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations are made. In judgements without full written reasons it is 
[normal]              
[normal]difficult to assess the effectiveness and proportionality of the 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations because the detailed facts of the case are not known. 
[normal]              
[normal]However in cases where there is sufficient information, the Commission's view 
[normal]              
[normal]is that tribunals generally do act proportionately, taking into account the size 
[normal]              
[normal]and resources of an employer in making its recommendations. 
[normal]3.11
[normal]              
[normal]The effectiveness of recommendations is harder to establish because there is 
[normal]              
[normal]no automatic method for enforcing wider recommendations. The Commission 
[normal]              
[normal]is aware that some tribunals include in their recommendations a requirement 
[normal]              
[normal]that the employer report back to the tribunal to confirm that steps have been 
[normal]              
[normal]taken. 
[normal]3.12
[normal]              
[normal]The Commission also treats cases with a recommendation from an 
[normal]              
[normal]employment tribunal as a priority for follow up action. It is in contact with some 
[normal]              
[normal]employers to whom recommendations have been directed, both under the 
[normal]              
[normal]current and the previous recommendation making powers, in order to 
[normal]              
[normal]ascertain whether the employers have implemented the recommendations 
[normal]              
[normal]fully. 
[normal]3.13
[normal]              
[normal]It is not appropriate to discuss outcomes in specific cases, as this would 
[normal]              
[normal]breach confidentiality. However, the Commission's experience is that 
[normal]              
[normal]employers respond in different ways. Some employers accept the 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations as a useful framework for addressing the problems 
[normal]              
[normal]identified by the employment tribunal.  Other employers seem unwilling, or in 
[normal]              
[normal]some cases lack the organisational capability, to implement the 
[normal]              
[normal]recommendations effectively. 
[normal]3.14
[normal]              
[normal]In its consultation paper the Government stated that an employer has "no way 
[normal]              
[normal]of knowing how or when a tribunal may make [a wider] recommendations; or 
[normal]              
[normal]whether it is feasible or affordable for them to comply." 
[normal]  We do not agree with 
[normal]              
[normal]this view:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.15
[normal]              
[normal]The Government's consultation noted that the British Chambers of Commerce 
[normal]              
[normal]believes that the power is not required because employers often make 
[normal]              
[normal]changes to their policies anyway.
[normal] The Commission agrees that in some cases 
[normal]              
[normal]employers take proactive steps to address the discrimination identified by the 
[normal]              
[normal]tribunal. The tribunal is unlikely to make a recommendation where there is 
[normal]              
[normal]evidence that an employer is already taking steps voluntarily
[normal].  For these 
[normal]              
[normal]employers the power to make recommendations is not likely to be an 
[normal]              
[normal]additional "regulatory burden".
[normal]3.16
[normal]              
[normal]However, in the Commission’s experience some employers do not take action
[normal] 
[normal]voluntarily, as they do not accept that their policies or practices need to 
[normal]change despite losing a discrimination case
[normal]. The Commission's view is that it is appropriate that a proportionate "regulatory burden" should fall on these employers as a result of failing to adhere to the law.
[normal]3.17
[normal]              
[normal]The power to make wider recommendations has only been in force since 
[normal]              
[normal]October 2010. The Commission's view is that this time period does not provide 
[normal]              
[normal]a sufficient evidence base to assess whether the power is being used 
[normal]              
[normal]effectively and proportionately and whether it is a disproportionate burden on 
[normal]              
[normal]business. 
[normal]3.18
[normal]              
[normal]A better evidence base might also clarify whether
[normal] removal of the power might 
[normal]              
[normal]have more of an impact on people with some protected characteristics und
[normal]er 
[normal]              
[normal]the Equality Act 2010. An a
[normal]nalysis
[normal] of this
[normal] would contribute to ensur
[normal]ing that the 
[normal]              
[normal]Secretary of State
[normal] 
[normal]gives ‘
[normal]due regard
[normal]’ to the P
[normal]ublic Sector Equality Duty in 
[normal]              
[normal]s.149 of the Equality Act 2010.
[normal]3.19
[normal]              
[normal]We urge the Joint Committee to seek clarification from the Government as to 
[normal]              
[normal]whether they have plans to carry out a review before any decisions are taken 
[normal]              
[normal]on whether this proposal should be included in the Bill. We believe that a 
[normal]              
[normal]review is necessary and 
[normal]reasonable because it would allow: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]4.0[bold]              [bold]Exercise of regulatory functions (t[bold]he Growth Duty[bold]) clauses 58 to 61[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]This section of the paper analyses the implications for the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] of
[normal] imposing
[normal] the proposed Growth Duty. We 
[normal]then
[normal] consider
[normal] 
[normal]a related voluntary measure, the Accountab
[normal]ility
[normal] for Regulator Impact (ARI) Guidance
[normal],
[normal] which came into operation in July 2013. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]Commission
[normal] is 
[normal]listed 
[normal]in the Annex to the consultation response 
[normal]amongst
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]the organisations proposed to 
[normal]be covered by the growth duty. 
[normal]The lack of 
[normal]              
[normal]detail in the proposals (
[normal]for example 
[normal]on the meaning of economic growth in 
[normal]              
[normal]practice, or guidance on how to discharge the growth duty) creates problems 
[normal]              
[normal]in fully predicting the legal position. 
[normal]However our
[normal] assumption is that the 
[normal]              
[normal]Government’s current intention is to include, by order, all the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s 
[normal]              
[normal]'regulatory' functions within scope of the growth duty. 
[normal]Our
[normal] 
[normal]principal 
[normal]activities 
[normal]              
[normal]likely to be captured by the duty 
[normal]are
[normal] producing codes and guidance, 
[normal]              
[normal]conducting inquiries, using enforcement powers and bringing, supporti
[normal]ng or 
[normal]              
[normal]intervening in litigation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]There are 
[normal]three distinct
[normal] and individually 
[normal]exceptionally compelling
[normal] 
[normal]reasons
[normal] why 
[normal]              
[normal]both the growth duty and the ARI should not be applied to the Commission
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]              
[normal]Firstly
[normal], 
[normal]definitional[bold] 
[normal]issues 
[normal]in the characterisation of 
[normal]Commission as a ‘regulator’ for the purposes of the growth duty. 
[normal]The Commission do
[normal]es
[normal] not have most of the functions of a regulator 
[normal]of the sort 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]the growth duty proposals are intended to affect. We agree with the Government’s previously expressed view 
[normal]              
[normal](see para 4.10  below) that the Commission should not be treated in the same way as other regulators, which (unlike the Commission) typically have responsibility over a particular sector or activity, and the power to set standards and impose sanctions for that sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 5 
[normal]              
[normal]Secondly
[normal], 
[normal]legal[bold] concerns 
[normal]about 
[normal]the compatibility of these provi
[normal]sions with 
[normal]              
[normal]relevant legislation. They raise a
[normal] potential conflict with the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s 
[normal]              
[normal]statutory duties
[normal] 
[normal]and, crucially, 
[normal]a
[normal] conflict 
[normal]with the statutory protection
[normal] of 
[normal]its 
[normal]              
[normal]independence.
[normal] 
[normal]To help secure the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'s independence, Parliament 
[normal]              
[normal]provided in the Equality Act 2006 that the Secretary of State must have regard 
[normal]              
[normal]to the desirability of ensuring that 
[normal]it
[normal] is subject to as few constraints as possible 
[normal]              
[normal]in its activities, timetable and priorities. However, in its consultation response 
[normal]              
[normal]on the growth duty
[normal], the Government states its view that: ‘
[normal]all non-economic 
[normal]              
[normal]regulators and regulatory functions should be covered by this measure unless 
[normal]              
[normal]there is an exceptionally compelling case for their exclusion’
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]              
[normal]Government's approach to the application of the growth duty to the 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission
[normal], as set out above, appears 
[normal]not to have regard to the Equality Act 
[normal]              
[normal]2006 duty set out in paragraph 4.21
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6 
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]hirdly 
[normal]the proposed imposition of additional constraints on the Commission’s 
[normal]              
[normal]independence[bold] greatly threatens our ‘A’ status as a National Human Rights 
[normal]              
[normal]Institution (NHRI), to which the Government has repeatedly stated that it 
[normal]              
[normal]attaches great value.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7 
[normal]              
[normal]For these reasons, and although 
[normal]we are
[normal] happy to work to realise the aims of 
[normal]              
[normal]these measures (e.g. 
[normal]by 
[normal]greater consultation with businesses on 
[normal]any
[normal] costs to 
[normal]              
[normal]them of 
[normal]the Commission
[normal]'s activities), it would not be appropriate, legally sound 
[normal]              
[normal]or politically beneficial for the Government to 
[normal]require
[normal] 
[normal]the Commission
[normal] to 
[normal]              
[normal]comply with the requirements of the growth duty
[normal]. Looking at each in more 
[normal]              
[normal]detail:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a) Definitional issues[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Commission
[normal] is often described as a regulator; however, the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] does not make regulations. We have no role in setting 
[normal]standards
[normal], or in
[normal] 
[normal]promulgating new regulations. In the UK, the relevant requirements, restrictions, conditions or standards 
[normal]for 
[normal]equality and human rights issues 
[normal]are 
[normal] set
[normal] by Parliament and
[normal] 
[normal]initiated by Government
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.9
[normal]              
[normal]Consequently, 
[normal]since the Commission
[normal] does not 
[normal]determine 
[normal]the content of the 
[normal]              
[normal]requirements
[normal], it does not impose 
[normal]costs on business through regulation, 
[normal]set  
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]requirements 
[normal]with which 
[normal]others have to comply 
[normal]or determine their 
[normal]costs 
[normal]in 
[normal]              
[normal]doing so. For example, the recent regulation on age discrimination in services 
[normal]              
[normal]was put forward by the GEO, and the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] has no power to change its 
[normal]              
[normal]terms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.10
[normal]              
[normal]The Government acknowledged the distinction between the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] and 
[normal]              
[normal]typical regulators in its response to the consultation on reform of the 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission
[normal].
[normal] The Government decided against its original proposal in the 
[normal]              
[normal]consultation to amend section 8 of EA 2006 to define the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s role 
[normal]              
[normal]as an 'equality regulator', having concluded that it was unrealistic and 
[normal]              
[normal]undesirable to expect the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] to 'regulate' every part of society on 
[normal]              
[normal]equality. It drew a clear distinction between the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] and sector-
[normal]              
[normal]specific regulators such as Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, and 
[normal]              
[normal]stated that it was more appropriate to regard the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] as a 'strategic 
[normal]              
[normal]enforcer' than as a regulator.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.11
[normal]              
[normal]Nevertheless, 
[normal]w
[normal]e 
[normal]are
[normal] currently included in the list of affected organisations in 
[normal]              
[normal]Annex A to the growth duty consultation response
[normal], alongside regulators such 
[normal]              
[normal]as the Health and Safety Executive, 
[normal]the 
[normal]C
[normal]are 
[normal]Q
[normal]uality 
[normal]C
[normal]ommission
[normal], 
[normal]the 
[normal]Food 
[normal]              
[normal]Standards Agency and Ofsted. We agree that we are fundamentally different 
[normal]              
[normal]in character from regulators like these, which have responsibility for oversight 
[normal]              
[normal]of defined sectors or fields of activity, and typically have the power to set 
[normal]              
[normal]standards and to enforce them through inspections and sanctions. We 
[normal]              
[normal]therefore believe that our distinctly different position and limited remit, in 
[normal]              
[normal]comparison to 
[normal]these more typical 
[normal]regulators, strongly supports the argument 
[normal]              
[normal]that we should be removed from the list of organisations to which the duty 
[normal]              
[normal]applies.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b) Legal concerns[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.12
[normal]              
[normal]Since the ARI guidance does not have legal force, this section on legal issues 
[normal]              
[normal]focuses principally (though not entirely) on the proposed statutory growth duty. 
[normal]              
[normal]We have identified a number of legal problems in the 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]application of 
[normal]              
[normal]the growth duty to the 
[normal]Commission
[normal], which provide cogent and persuasive 
[normal]              
[normal]reasons for not including the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] within scope of the growth duty at 
[normal]              
[normal]all. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.13
[normal]              
[normal]The current breadth of coverage of the growth duty is problematic. It is a 
[normal]              
[normal]particularly critical omission 
[normal]that 
[normal]the 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]legislation
[normal] does not expressly 
[normal]              
[normal]render 
[normal]the growth duty subject to other requirement
[normal]s
[normal] affecting the ex
[normal]ercise of 
[normal]              
[normal]regulatory functions, since it is currently unclear how it interacts with other 
[normal]              
[normal]legal obligations or with the standards for better regulation.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.14
[normal]              
[normal]We understand the Government’s intention is to define economic growth 
[normal]in 
[normal]relation to specific businesses and economic sectors. There are constraints on the Secretary of State's powers to define growth
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]on 
[normal]what can be covered in the growth duty guidance, which limits the potential value and assistance offered through 
[normal]              
[normal]those sources. A definition of economic growth cannot include irrelevant considerations. The guidance on the meaning of economic growth cannot exclude 
[normal]a
[normal] matter relevant to economic growth from consideration, as the Secretary of State's approach appears to contemplate. Nor can it specify what must be taken as compliance with the growth duty, or purport to determine the performance of other legal duties. Even if the Government’s intention is tenable, we foresee considerable challenges ahead in this regard. For example, it may be said that the consequence of exercising regulatory 
[normal]              
[normal]functions is that whilst growth is promoted for one business, 
[normal]this 
[normal]is at the expense of 
[normal]growth for 
[normal]another. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.15
[normal]              
[normal]Our firm view
[normal], based on legal advice,
[normal] is that the growth duty cannot justify a failure to discharge the Commission’s statutory duties or its objectives (under 
[normal]the Equality Act 2006 and Equality Act 2010), or justify acting in a way that is incompatible with European Union law and/or the Human Rights Act 1998. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.16
[normal]              
[normal]For example, the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] could not lawfully refuse to take enforcement 
[normal]              
[normal]action where there is a breach of equality law or violation of human rights, 
[normal]              
[normal]simply on the basis that a failure to act will promote economic growth 
[normal]              
[normal](whatever that concept embraces). Consequently, we believe it is incorrect for 
[normal]              
[normal]the Government to state that the growth duty will provide the framework for 
[normal]              
[normal]regulators (in which category the Government 
[normal]seeks to 
[normal]include the 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission
[normal]) explicitly to balance growth with their duties to protect. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.17
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst in general it is recognised that equality is good for business, individual cases might occur in which legal complexities arise from the need to balance growth and eq
[normal]uality considerations
[normal]. For example, would the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] be justified in desisting from the promotion of equal treatment in respect of pay on the ground that it would damage economic growth by increasing costs to the detriment of competitiveness
[normal]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]18
[normal]              
[normal]Our analysis of the potential impact of the growth duty is that it appears to 
[normal] insert
[normal] an incongruous consideration in
[normal]to
[normal] the exercise of the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'s enforcement or litigation powers, and that 
[normal]this 
[normal]might also be the case in relation to exercising regulatory functions concerning inquiries and issuing codes of practice or guidance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]19
[normal]              
[normal]We also take the position that there is a 
[normal]fundamental incompatibility between the 
[normal]growth duty and the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'s competence and functions in protecting and promoting human rights 
[normal]if 
[normal]the promotion of economic growth 
[normal]were considered paramount
[normal] regardless of other considerations in every case. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]0
[normal]              
[normal]In public law terms, the effect of the growth duty is that the promotion of economic growth (whatever that concept may embrace) 
[normal]would have 
[normal]to be considered whenever the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] is 
[normal]contemplating the exercise of
[normal] specified regulatory functions. Attempts to invalidate regulatory decisions 
[normal]could 
[normal]succeed on growth duty grounds on the basis that the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] ha
[normal]d 
[normal]failed to have regard to the desirability of promoting economic growth or the Secretary of State's guidance, or that it ha
[normal]d
[normal] misdirected itself on the meaning of economic growth, or 
[normal]that it had 
[normal]failed to obtain the information necessary to determine reasonably what the effect 
[normal]of its actions 
[normal]on the promotion of economic growth 
[normal]was
[normal] likely to be and/or reached irrational conclusions. Furthermore, the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] would have to have cogent reasons for 
[normal]departing from the Secretary of State's guidance. The growth duty guidance 
[normal]would be 
[normal]likely to place additional requirements in practice upon regulators 
[normal]that go 
[normal]beyond the regulators
[normal]’
[normal] code.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]1 
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] Secretary of State is under a legal obligation (contained in Schedule 1, paragraph 42 (3) of the Equality Act 2006) to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that there are as few constraints as possible imposed upon the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] in its activities, timetables and priorities
[normal]. This obligation 
[normal]reflect
[normal]s
[normal] the need to preserve the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'
[normal]s independence from Government, in relevant ways, 
[normal]whose activities the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] is empowered to scrutinise
[normal] and 
[normal]is 
[normal]highly 
[normal]relevant 
[normal]to any consideration of 
[normal]whether the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] should be covered by the growt
[normal]h duty. 
[normal]A failure to consider this factor properly 
[normal]would potentially render a 
[normal]Ministerial decision 
[normal]to include
[normal] some or all of the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s functions 
[normal]in
[normal] the growth duty
[normal] unlawful
[normal]. In our view, these legal problems constitute exceptionally compelling reason
[normal]s for the growth duty not to be
[normal]              
[normal]applied to the 
[normal]Commission
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c) Independence and NHRI status[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]A 
[normal]further exceptionally compelling reason why it would not be in the Government’s interests to impose the growth duty or ARI guidance on the 
[normal]Commission
[normal], is that it would present a significant further threat to 
[normal]the Commission retaining
[normal] 
[normal]'
[normal]A
[normal]' status 
[normal]as an NHRI.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Ministers have repeatedly signalled their strong commitment to 
[normal]retention of
[normal] 'A' status; for example, t
[normal]he 2 May 2013 letter
[normal] to the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s Chair from Helen Grant MP, Minister for Women and Equalities, stated that: ‘
[normal]The Government is committed to the 
[normal]Commission
[normal] being a strong, effective and independent equalities and human rights body, and to retaining the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s ‘A’-rated status as a National Human Rights Institution’
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Other ministers, including Lord McNally and Baroness Stowell of Beeston, have echoed this commitment.

[normal]at the UK has 
[normal]an 'A' status NHRI is a vital part of the Government’s human rights record at home
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]his issue has wider impact for Government, in particular in relation to 
[normal]its foreign policy priorities: 
[normal]which naturally affects its reputation at the UN and in its bilateral relations. For example, the Foreign Secretary and Baroness Warsi have given strong support to the UK’s 
[normal]candidacy for election to the UN Human Rights Council, and we expect our NHRI status to be considered when votes are cast. Activities such as the recent high-profile launch of the Government’s action plan on business and human rights would also carry less credibility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Despite Government commitments, and recent improvements to the 
[normal]              
[normal]Framework Agreement between

[normal] and 
[normal]the

[normal]ffice
[normal], the

[normal]’s 'A' status remains under scrutiny by the United 
[normal]              
[normal]Nations International Co-ordinating Committee Sub-Committee on 
[normal]              
[normal]Accreditation (SCA). Our next five-yearly scheduled review by the SCA will be 
[normal]              
[normal]in 2015, but we were added to the agenda of the SCA’s last meeting in May 
[normal]              
[normal]2013, and were subsequently asked to provide further information on the 
[normal]              
[normal]application of spending controls, in advance of a likely further discussion on 
[normal]              
[normal]our independence at the SCA’s next meeting in November of this year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]26
[normal]              
[normal]There is an incompatibility between the growth duty and the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'s 
[normal]              
[normal]objectives, duties and competence as a National Human Rights Institution 
[normal]              
[normal](NHRI) under the United Nations Paris Principles. Our considered judgment is 
[normal]              
[normal]that there is a real risk that the SCA will perceive the imposition of the growth 
[normal]              
[normal]duty as undermining the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s independence from Government, 
[normal]              
[normal]risking removal of

[normal] UN accreditation as an ‘A’ status NHRI.

[normal]5.0[bold]              [bold]Accountability for Regulator Impact[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Accountability for Regulator Impact (ARI) Guidance
[normal] 
[normal]sets out expectations for engagement with business by national non-economic regulators in respect of their regulatory policy and practice. It is expected regulators 
[normal]will 
[normal]publicly commit to principles covering engagement with business 
[normal]by 
[normal]publishing draft impact assessments for comment and sharing evidence, and 
[normal]providing 
[normal]mechanisms for businesses to complain 
[normal]that
[normal] they have not been properly engaged by regulators. In the event of disputes about regulatory assessments, the Government's Regulatory Policy Committee potentially becomes the final arbiter. The Government appears to believe that the ARI should be applied to the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s work, although it recognises 
[normal]the guidance’s voluntary nature
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]As a matter of choice
[normal],
[normal] and with the 
[normal]agreement 
[normal]of our Board, we would seek to adapt and evolve our approach to deliver the aims of the growth duty and the principles of ‘Accountability for Regulator Impact’
[normal], 
[normal]but
[normal] would
[normal] do so in a way 
[normal]which 
[normal] 
[normal]is
[normal] compatible with our statutory duties and which does not 
[normal]risk 
[normal]the UN downgrad
[normal]ing 
[normal]the UK’s 'A' status as an NHRI. To this end, we would be happy to discuss and agree with GEO a protocol whereby 
[normal]the Commission commits to implementing 
[normal]the outcomes and approaches of the growth duty and ARI guidance - including engaging with business and assessing their costs - 
[normal]and to applying this 
[normal]proportionately to those areas of the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]'s work where it acts like a regulator.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]The Accountability for Regulatory Impact (ARI) measure assumes 
[normal]that the 
[normal]              
[normal]regulators to whom it applies are accountable to Government departments for 
[normal]              
[normal]taking particular decisions. If a dispute arises as to the likely impact of change, 
[normal]              
[normal]a regulator is, in the final analysis, expected to accept and 
[normal]to 
[normal]act in 
[normal]              
[normal]accordance with what
[normal]ever
[normal] the Government's Regulatory Policy Committee 
[normal]              
[normal]determines to be correct. The ARI measure could, therefore, undermine the 
[normal]              
[normal]Commission
[normal]'s independence in practice, resulting in loss of our NHRI 'A' 
[normal]              
[normal]status.

[normal]              
[normal]The

[normal]is 
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]prepared to agree

[normal]taking
[normal] 
[normal]a voluntary approach which will meet these aims. 
[normal]              
[normal]Howe
[normal]ver
[normal] 
[normal]the measures in the proposed legislation
[normal] would
[normal]:
[normal] constrain our 
[normal]              
[normal]freedom to 
[normal]exercise our statutory duties;
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] not proportionate or 
[normal]              
[normal]appropriate to the 
[normal]Commission
[normal]’s functions; 
[normal]do
[normal] not accord with the relevant 
[normal]              
[normal]legislation; and would 
[normal]restrict 
[normal]the 
[normal]Commission's independence with 
[normal]              
[normal]consequences that we have outlined above. T
[normal]he
[normal]y
[normal] are exceptionally compelling 
[normal]
