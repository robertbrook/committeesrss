defaultEquality and Human Rights Commission – Written evidencedefault1.0default              default defaultIntroductiondefault1.1
default              
defaultThe Draft Deregulation Bill contains a number of proposals to reduce 
default              
defaultunnecessary bureaucracy and red tape which have an impact on equality and 
default              
defaulthuman rights law and the functions of the Commission. 
default1.2
default              
defaultThe Commission’s view is that there is fundamentally little or no conflict 
default              
defaultbetween its goals and those of the Government in relation to the Draft Bill: the 
default              
defaultaims of equality and growth are often linked and mutually supportive. A more 
default              
defaultequal society, in which people’s prospects 
defaultare
default determined by merit rather than 
default              
defaultby other considerations, is a more productive society. Likewise, as the 
default              
defaulteconomy improves, it will become easier to realise the aims of equality. 
defaultThe 
default              
defaultCommission
default 
defaultis therefore fully supportive of the need to ensure economic 
default              
defaultgrowth.
default1.3
default              
defaultThe Commission shares the aspirations behind the Bill, welcoming the 
default              
defaultopportunity to review the way it operates to understand business needs, costs 
default              
defaultand burdens better. We have
default no wish to impose needless costs on business
default; 
default              
defaulti
defaultndeed, much of what we have done in the last two years has been 
defaultaimed at
default 
default              
defaultenabling the private sector to redu
defaultce the costs of complying with e
defaultqualit
defaulty
default 
default              
defaultrequirements, and working with business
defaultes to achieve that. 
default1.4
default              
defaultHowever, our analysis of the proposals in the Draft Bill has shown up some 
default              
defaultsignificant concerns to which we draw the Joint Committee’s attention. These 
default              
defaultrequire further scrutiny and re-consideration by Government. In this response 
default              
defaultto the Joint Committee's call for evidence, we have focused on those 
default              
defaultproposals of most concern to the Commission, which are:
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultAlthough we have structured this response to address concerns about these   
default              
defaultclauses, rather than answering individual questions in the Joint Committee's 
default              
defaultcall for evidence, our response is most relevant to questions 7 and 17 to 22, 
default              
defaultand may also assist the Joint Committee’s deliberations on other questions.
default2.0default              defaultSummary defaultof the Commission's overall analysisdefault2.1 
default              
defaultThe Commission continues to 
defaultstrongly disagree with the proposal to remove
default 
default              
defaulte
defaultmployment 
defaultt
defaultribunals
default’
default wider recommendation making powers
default. For reasons 
default              
defaultexplained further below, it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the power 
default              
defaultwhich has been in force only over the last three years. The available evidence 
default              
defaultsuggests that the power has been used proportionately, and that there are 
default              
defaultimportant clear benefits for all concerned (including employers and 
default              
defaultemployees) in exercising the power to clarify necessary remedial action, and 
default              
defaultthis helps to prevent further discrimination and to reduce litigation.
default2.2
default              
defaultAfter careful scrutiny, our analysis is that 
defaultthere are very compelling
default&#xa0;
defaultreasons why the growth duty should not apply to the Commission
default. First, the Commission does not have many of the functions of a non-economic regulator that the growth duty proposals are intended to affect. Equality and human rights law is proposed by Government, determined by Parliament, interpreted by the courts and tribunals, so the
default              
defaultCommission does not set the relevant standards. In addition, there are formidable legal problems in applying the growth duty to the Commission in the way the Government intends. Parliament has already provided in the Equality Act 2006 that the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability of subjecting the Commission to as few constraints as possible, and 
defaultthis conflicts
default with the growth duty proposals. Finally, the application of the growth duty to the Commission undermines the requirement for the Commission to be independent from the Government in the respects required for compliance with the United Nations Paris Principles for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI). We believe the application of the growth duty to the Commission creates a real risk that our United Nations 'A' status NHRI accreditation will be lost. DCMS have made considerable effort to retain and protect this status, with the strong support of FCO. The ‘A’ status of EHRC as a NHRI is important to the exercise of British soft power. 
default2.3
default              
defaultTaken individually or together, these concerns provide a compelling basis to 
default              
defaultremove the Commission from the list of regulators to which the Government 
default              
defaultcurrently proposes to apply the growth duty.

default3.1
default              
defaultThe Commission has specific statutory duties and powers to enforce the 
default              
defaultequality enactments and to work towards the elimination of unlawful 
default              
defaultdiscrimination and harassment (under section 8 Equality Act 2006). 
default3.2
default              
defaultOur approach to exercising our statutory functions is to enable duty-holders to 
default              
defaultcomply with the legislation and take enforcement action only where it is 
default              
defaultnecessary and proportionate to do so to ensure legal compliance in practice.
default3.3
default              
defaultThe Equality Act 2010 represents the main domestic equality enactment over 
default              
defaultwhich the Commission has a guardianship role as a statutory enforcer. That 
default              
defaultguardianship role can be exercised in part by issuing codes of practice and 
default              
defaultguidance to improve understanding of rights and obligations and to support 
default              
defaultlegal compliance. It also encompasses use of specific legal powers - such as 
default              
defaultholding inquiries, carrying out investigations, or supporting litigation through 
default              
defaultcourts and tribunals - to identify and challenge non-compliance. 
default3.4
default              
defaultUK equality law has been proposed by Government, scrutinised and enacted 
default              
defaultby Parliament and is interpreted by tribunals and courts. One of the general 
default              
defaultaims and principles underpinning the legislation is that prevention of 
default              
defaultdiscrimination is preferable to remedy after the event, and this is supported by 
default              
defaultsections 124 and 149 of the Equality Act 2010. That Act had broad cross-party 
default              
defaultpolitical support during its Parliamentary passage. 
default3.5
default              
defaultTo complement the judicial system (without acting as a substitute for it), the 
default              
defaultCommission carries out follow-up work to ensure tribunal recommendations 
default              
defaulthave been carried out in practice. 
default3.6
default              
defaultIn August 2012 the Commission responded to the Government's consultation, 
default              
defaulton proposals that included the removal of employment tribunals’ wider 
default              
defaultrecommendations power. Our reasons for opposing the removal of this power 
default              
defaultwere:
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultThe Commission still believes that the ability to make "wider" 
default              
defaultrecommendations is an important one which should be retained. Its removal 
default              
defaultwould limit the powers of tribunals to make recommendations to those cases 
default              
defaultwhere the recommendations would alleviate the discrimination only for an 
default              
defaultindividual claimant.
default So long as the current recommendations are followed, the 
default              
defaultexercise of the power benefits:
default3.8
default              
defaultIn the period Oct 2010 to June 2012 the Commission 
defaultconsidered 
default372 
defaultemployment tribunal 
defaultdecisions
default decided in favour of the claimant
default.
default Recommendations were made in 13
default of th
defaulte
defaultse cases. It is not always clear from the decisions 
defaultwhich power has been exercised; h
defaultowever, th
defaulte recommendations in 8 of these cases appear to have been made under the wider power
default.
default 
default3.9
default              
defaultThe relatively low number of recommendations might be explained by 
default              
defaultc
defaultlaimants not be
defaulting
default aware that they can 
defaultask
default tribunal
defaults to
default make 
defaultwider 
default              
defaultrecommendations in their case. Neither the current ET1 form nor the 
defaultguide to 
default              
defaultmaking a claim
default refer
default to the possibility of 
defaultsuch 
defaultrecommendations being made.
default 
default3.10
default              
defaultThe Commission analyses the employment tribunals’ decisions in which wider 
default              
defaultrecommendations are made. In judgements without full written reasons it is 
default              
defaultdifficult to assess the effectiveness and proportionality of the 
default              
defaultrecommendations because the detailed facts of the case are not known. 
default              
defaultHowever in cases where there is sufficient information, the Commission's view 
default              
defaultis that tribunals generally do act proportionately, taking into account the size 
default              
defaultand resources of an employer in making its recommendations. 
default3.11
default              
defaultThe effectiveness of recommendations is harder to establish because there is 
default              
defaultno automatic method for enforcing wider recommendations. The Commission 
default              
defaultis aware that some tribunals include in their recommendations a requirement 
default              
defaultthat the employer report back to the tribunal to confirm that steps have been 
default              
defaulttaken. 
default3.12
default              
defaultThe Commission also treats cases with a recommendation from an 
default              
defaultemployment tribunal as a priority for follow up action. It is in contact with some 
default              
defaultemployers to whom recommendations have been directed, both under the 
default              
defaultcurrent and the previous recommendation making powers, in order to 
default              
defaultascertain whether the employers have implemented the recommendations 
default              
defaultfully. 
default3.13
default              
defaultIt is not appropriate to discuss outcomes in specific cases, as this would 
default              
defaultbreach confidentiality. However, the Commission's experience is that 
default              
defaultemployers respond in different ways. Some employers accept the 
default              
defaultrecommendations as a useful framework for addressing the problems 
default              
defaultidentified by the employment tribunal.  Other employers seem unwilling, or in 
default              
defaultsome cases lack the organisational capability, to implement the 
default              
defaultrecommendations effectively. 
default3.14
default              
defaultIn its consultation paper the Government stated that an employer has "no way 
default              
defaultof knowing how or when a tribunal may make [a wider] recommendations; or 
default              
defaultwhether it is feasible or affordable for them to comply." 
default  We do not agree with 
default              
defaultthis view:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.15
default              
defaultThe Government's consultation noted that the British Chambers of Commerce 
default              
defaultbelieves that the power is not required because employers often make 
default              
defaultchanges to their policies anyway.
default The Commission agrees that in some cases 
default              
defaultemployers take proactive steps to address the discrimination identified by the 
default              
defaulttribunal. The tribunal is unlikely to make a recommendation where there is 
default              
defaultevidence that an employer is already taking steps voluntarily
default.  For these 
default              
defaultemployers the power to make recommendations is not likely to be an 
default              
defaultadditional "regulatory burden".
default3.16
default              
defaultHowever, in the Commission’s experience some employers do not take action
default 
defaultvoluntarily, as they do not accept that their policies or practices need to 
defaultchange despite losing a discrimination case
default. The Commission's view is that it is appropriate that a proportionate "regulatory burden" should fall on these employers as a result of failing to adhere to the law.
default3.17
default              
defaultThe power to make wider recommendations has only been in force since 
default              
defaultOctober 2010. The Commission's view is that this time period does not provide 
default              
defaulta sufficient evidence base to assess whether the power is being used 
default              
defaulteffectively and proportionately and whether it is a disproportionate burden on 
default              
defaultbusiness. 
default3.18
default              
defaultA better evidence base might also clarify whether
default removal of the power might 
default              
defaulthave more of an impact on people with some protected characteristics und
defaulter 
default              
defaultthe Equality Act 2010. An a
defaultnalysis
default of this
default would contribute to ensur
defaulting that the 
default              
defaultSecretary of State
default 
defaultgives ‘
defaultdue regard
default’ to the P
defaultublic Sector Equality Duty in 
default              
defaults.149 of the Equality Act 2010.
default3.19
default              
defaultWe urge the Joint Committee to seek clarification from the Government as to 
default              
defaultwhether they have plans to carry out a review before any decisions are taken 
default              
defaulton whether this proposal should be included in the Bill. We believe that a 
default              
defaultreview is necessary and 
defaultreasonable because it would allow: 
default&#xa0;default4.0default              defaultExercise of regulatory functions (tdefaulthe Growth Dutydefault) clauses 58 to 61default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThis section of the paper analyses the implications for the 
defaultCommission
default of
default imposing
default the proposed Growth Duty. We 
defaultthen
default consider
default 
defaulta related voluntary measure, the Accountab
defaultility
default for Regulator Impact (ARI) Guidance
default,
default which came into operation in July 2013.

defaultThe

defaultCommission

defaultlisted 
defaultin the Annex to the consultation response

defaultthe organisations proposed to 
defaultbe covered by the growth duty. 
defaultThe lack of 
default              
defaultdetail in the proposals (
defaultfor example 
defaulton the meaning of economic growth in 
default              
defaultpractice, or guidance on how to discharge the growth duty) creates problems 
default              
defaultin fully predicting the legal position. 
defaultHowever our
default assumption is that the 
default              
defaultGovernment’s current intention is to include, by order, all the 
defaultCommission
default’s 
default              
default'regulatory' functions within scope of the growth duty.

default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultThere are 
defaultthree distinct
default and individually 
defaultexceptionally compelling
default 
defaultreasons
default why 
default              
defaultboth the growth duty and the ARI should not be applied to the Commission
default:
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
default              
defaultFirstly
default, 
defaultdefinitionaldefault 
defaultissues 
defaultin the characterisation of 
defaultCommission as a ‘regulator’ for the purposes of the growth duty. 
defaultThe Commission do
defaultes
default not have most of the functions of a regulator 
defaultof the sort 
defaultthat
default 
defaultthe growth duty proposals are intended to affect. We agree with the Government’s previously expressed view 
default              
default(see para 4.10  below) that the Commission should not be treated in the same way as other regulators, which (unlike the Commission) typically have responsibility over a particular sector or activity, and the power to set standards and impose sanctions for that sector.
default&#xa0;
default4. 5 
default              
defaultSecondly
default, 
defaultlegaldefault concerns 
defaultabout 
defaultthe compatibility of these provi
defaultsions with 
default              
defaultrelevant legislation. They raise a
default potential conflict with the 
defaultCommission
default’s 
default              
defaultstatutory duties
default 
defaultand, crucially, 
defaulta
default conflict 
defaultwith the statutory protection
default of 
defaultits 
default              
defaultindependence.
default 
defaultTo help secure the 
defaultCommission
default's independence, Parliament 
default              
defaultprovided in the Equality Act 2006 that the Secretary of State must have regard 
default              
defaultto the desirability of ensuring that 
defaultit
default is subject to as few constraints as possible 
default              
defaultin its activities, timetable and priorities. However, in its consultation response 
default              
defaulton the growth duty
default, the Government states its view that: ‘
defaultall non-economic 
default              
defaultregulators and regulatory functions should be covered by this measure unless 
default              
defaultthere is an exceptionally compelling case for their exclusion’
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
default              
defaultGovernment's approach to the application of the growth duty to the 
default              
defaultCommission
default, as set out above, appears 
defaultnot to have regard to the Equality Act 
default              
default2006 duty set out in paragraph 4.21
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.6 
default              
defaultT
defaulthirdly 
defaultthe proposed imposition of additional constraints on the Commission’s 
default              
defaultindependencedefault greatly threatens our ‘A’ status as a National Human Rights 
default              
defaultInstitution (NHRI), to which the Government has repeatedly stated that it 
default              
defaultattaches great value.
default&#xa0;
default4.7 
default              
defaultFor these reasons, and although 
defaultwe are
default happy to work to realise the aims of 
default              
defaultthese measures (e.g. 
defaultby 
defaultgreater consultation with businesses on 
defaultany
default costs to 
default              
defaultthem of 
defaultthe Commission
default's activities), it would not be appropriate, legally sound 
default              
defaultor politically beneficial for the Government to 
defaultrequire
default 
defaultthe Commission
default to 
default              
defaultcomply with the requirements of the growth duty
default. Looking at each in more 
default              
defaultdetail:
default&#xa0;
defaulta) Definitional issuesdefault&#xa0;
default4.8
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCommission
default is often described as a regulator; however, the 
defaultCommission
default does not make regulations. We have no role in setting 
defaultstandards
default, or in
default 
defaultpromulgating new regulations. In the UK, the relevant requirements, restrictions, conditions or standards 
defaultfor 
defaultequality and human rights issues 
defaultare 
default set
default by Parliament and
default 
defaultinitiated by Government
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.9
default              
defaultConsequently, 
defaultsince the Commission
default does not 
defaultdetermine 
defaultthe content of the 
default              
defaultrequirements
default, it does not impose 
defaultcosts on business through regulation, 
defaultset  
default 
default              
defaultrequirements 
defaultwith which 
defaultothers have to comply 
defaultor determine their 
defaultcosts 
defaultin 
default              
defaultdoing so. For example, the recent regulation on age discrimination in services 
default              
defaultwas put forward by the GEO, and the 
defaultCommission
default has no power to change its 
default              
defaultterms. 
default&#xa0;
default4.10
default              
defaultThe Government acknowledged the distinction between the 
defaultCommission
default and 
default              
defaulttypical regulators in its response to the consultation on reform of the 
default              
defaultCommission
default.
default The Government decided against its original proposal in the 
default              
defaultconsultation to amend section 8 of EA 2006 to define the 
defaultCommission
default’s role 
default              
defaultas an 'equality regulator', having concluded that it was unrealistic and 
default              
defaultundesirable to expect the 
defaultCommission
default to 'regulate' every part of society on 
default              
defaultequality. It drew a clear distinction between the 
defaultCommission
default and sector-
default              
defaultspecific regulators such as Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission, and 
default              
defaultstated that it was more appropriate to regard the 
defaultCommission
default as a 'strategic 
default              
defaultenforcer' than as a regulator.
default&#xa0;
default4.11
default              
defaultNevertheless, 
defaultw

defaultare

defaultin character from regulators like these, which have responsibility for oversight 
default              
defaultof defined sectors or fields of activity, and typically have the power to set 
default              
defaultstandards and to enforce them through inspections and sanctions. We 
default              
defaulttherefore believe that our distinctly different position and limited remit, in 
default              
defaultcomparison to 
defaultthese more typical 
defaultregulators, strongly supports the argument 
default              
defaultthat we should be removed from the list of organisations to which the duty 
default              
defaultapplies.
default&#xa0;
defaultb) Legal concernsdefault&#xa0;
default4.12
default              
defaultSince the ARI guidance does not have legal force, this section on legal issues 
default              
defaultfocuses principally (though not entirely) on the proposed statutory growth duty. 
default              
defaultWe have identified a number of legal problems in the 
defaultproposed 
defaultapplication of 
default              
defaultthe growth duty to the 
defaultCommission
default, which provide cogent and persuasive 
default              
defaultreasons for not including the 
defaultCommission
default within scope of the growth duty at 
default              
defaultall. 
default&#xa0;
default4.13
default              
defaultThe current breadth of coverage of the growth duty is problematic. It is a 
default              
defaultparticularly critical omission 
defaultthat 
defaultthe 
defaultproposed 
defaultlegislation
default does not expressly 
default              
defaultrender 
defaultthe growth duty subject to other requirement
defaults
default affecting the ex
defaultercise of 
default              
defaultregulatory functions, since it is currently unclear how it interacts with other 
default              
defaultlegal obligations or with the standards for better regulation.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.14
default              
defaultWe understand the Government’s intention is to define economic growth 
defaultin 
defaultrelation to specific businesses and economic sectors. There are constraints on the Secretary of State's powers to define growth
default,
default and 
defaulton 
defaultwhat can be covered in the growth duty guidance, which limits the potential value and assistance offered through 
default              
defaultthose sources. A definition of economic growth cannot include irrelevant considerations. The guidance on the meaning of economic growth cannot exclude 
defaulta
default matter relevant to economic growth from consideration, as the Secretary of State's approach appears to contemplate. Nor can it specify what must be taken as compliance with the growth duty, or purport to determine the performance of other legal duties. Even if the Government’s intention is tenable, we foresee considerable challenges ahead in this regard. For example, it may be said that the consequence of exercising regulatory 
default              
defaultfunctions is that whilst growth is promoted for one business, 
defaultthis 
defaultis at the expense of 
defaultgrowth for 
defaultanother. 
default&#xa0;
default4.15
default              
defaultOur firm view
default, based on legal advice,
default is that the growth duty cannot justify a failure to discharge the Commission’s statutory duties or its objectives (under 
defaultthe Equality Act 2006 and Equality Act 2010), or justify acting in a way that is incompatible with European Union law and/or the Human Rights Act 1998. 
default&#xa0;
default4.16
default              
defaultFor example, the 
defaultCommission
default could not lawfully refuse to take enforcement 
default              
defaultaction where there is a breach of equality law or violation of human rights, 
default              
defaultsimply on the basis that a failure to act will promote economic growth 
default              
default(whatever that concept embraces). Consequently, we believe it is incorrect for 
default              
defaultthe Government to state that the growth duty will provide the framework for 
default              
defaultregulators (in which category the Government 
defaultseeks to 
defaultinclude the 
default              
defaultCommission
default) explicitly to balance growth with their duties to protect. 
default&#xa0;
default4.17
default              
defaultWhilst in general it is recognised that equality is good for business, individual cases might occur in which legal complexities arise from the need to balance growth and eq
defaultuality considerations
default. For example, would the 
defaultCommission
default be justified in desisting from the promotion of equal treatment in respect of pay on the ground that it would damage economic growth by increasing costs to the detriment of competitiveness
default?
default&#xa0;
default4.
default18
default              
defaultOur analysis of the potential impact of the growth duty is that it appears to 
default insert
default an incongruous consideration in
defaultto
default the exercise of the 
defaultCommission
default's enforcement or litigation powers, and that 
defaultthis 
defaultmight also be the case in relation to exercising regulatory functions concerning inquiries and issuing codes of practice or guidance. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default19
default              
defaultWe also take the position that there is a 
defaultfundamental incompatibility between the 
defaultgrowth duty and the 
defaultCommission
default's competence and functions in protecting and promoting human rights 
defaultif 
defaultthe promotion of economic growth 
defaultwere considered paramount
default regardless of other considerations in every case. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default0
default              
defaultIn public law terms, the effect of the growth duty is that the promotion of economic growth (whatever that concept may embrace) 
defaultwould have 
defaultto be considered whenever the 
defaultCommission
default is 
defaultcontemplating the exercise of
default specified regulatory functions. Attempts to invalidate regulatory decisions 
defaultcould 
defaultsucceed on growth duty grounds on the basis that the 
defaultCommission

default5.1
default              
defaultThe Accountability for Regulator Impact (ARI) Guidance
default 
defaultsets out expectations for engagement with business by national non-economic regulators in respect of their regulatory policy and practice. It is expected regulators 
defaultwill 
defaultpublicly commit to principles covering engagement with business 
defaultby 
defaultpublishing draft impact assessments for comment and sharing evidence, and 
defaultproviding 
defaultmechanisms for businesses to complain 
defaultthat
default they have not been properly engaged by regulators. In the event of disputes about regulatory assessments, the Government's Regulatory Policy Committee potentially becomes the final arbiter. The Government appears to believe that the ARI should be applied to the 
defaultCommission
default’s work, although it recognises 
defaultthe guidance’s voluntary nature
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultAs a matter of choice
default,
default and with the 
defaultagreement 
defaultof our Board, we would seek to adapt and evolve our approach to deliver the aims of the growth duty and the principles of ‘Accountability for Regulator Impact’
default,

defaultwhich 
default 
defaultis
default compatible with our statutory duties and which does not

defaultthe UN downgrad
defaulting 
defaultthe UK’s 'A' status as an NHRI. To this end, we would be happy to discuss and agree with GEO a protocol whereby 
defaultthe Commission commits to implementing 
defaultthe outcomes and approaches of the growth duty and ARI guidance - including engaging with business and assessing their costs - 
defaultand to applying this 
defaultproportionately to those areas of the 
defaultCommission
default's work where it acts like a regulator.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThe Accountability for Regulatory Impact (ARI) measure assumes 
defaultthat the 
default              
defaultregulators to whom it applies are accountable to Government departments for
