defaultSubmission from defaultWolverhampton City Councildefault (FDC24)defaultExecutive SummarydefaultRecommendations defaultWolverhampton City Council asks for the following recommendations to be considered. That central government:
defaultLifts the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing and encourages prudent borrowing to stimulate growth.
defaultResponses to questionsdefault&#xa0;defaultThere are already a number of schemes 
defaultwhich 
defaultoperate on a Black Country basis, including 
defaultoffsetting local priorities for
default 
defaultfunding streams from the European
default Regional Development Fund
default and
default the
default European Social Fund
default. 
defaultIt
default would be sensible to create the devolved area along Black Country lines, where relationships and structure
defaults already exist and new powers c
defaultould work alongside existing schemes. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCentralised skills and employment training do not meet Wolverhampton’s needs. If such public services were fully devolved they could be adapted to fit business demands, offering 
defaulttraining 
defaultin
default 
defaultskills areas in line
default 
defaultwith 
defaultlocal 
defaultva
defaultcancies
default. 
defaultRather than just ‘complementing’ devolution, these public services should be an integral part of de-centralisati
defaulton
default.
default This would enable them to provide a holistic approach to service provision and 
defaultuse funding in the most e
defaultffective
default way. 
defaultHowever such devolution would need to be complemented with sufficient investment from central government to tackle problems 
defaultprevalent in
default deprived areas like the Black Country. 
defaultResolving issues
default around employability and skills gaps would need to be 
defaulta key
default par
defaultt of the devolution process, or regional growth could not be realised. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThe Black Country devolved area would be governed via the joint committee model. 
defaultThis structure 
defaulthas 
defaultalready been established to
default 
defaultdeal with the Government’s agenda for greater local decision making under
default the
default City Deal and Growth Deal
default, and existing relationships 
defaultcould
default be 
defaultexpanded
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAny decision made by the Joint Committee is in law a dec
defaultision of all four councils’ Cabinets. The membership of the Joint Committee is made up of the four leaders of the Black Country councils. The chair of the LEP has a right to attend and speak at meetings but cannot cast a vote. There is also an existing sup
defaultplementary Advisory Group which presents proposals to the Joint Committee. Such proposals 
defaultcan come from
default any of the councils, individually or jointly, and/or the Black Country Consortium and LEP. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis existing structure would be used to implement fiscal d
defaultevolution in the Black Country. Each council would remain independent in other matters and hold their own elections. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe devolved area would be governed by the existing joint committee structure. Each authority would maintain its independence and hold its own elections. There would also be a local authority representative on each LEP board. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultThere is already evidence of suc
defaultcessful joint working in Wolverhampton.
default Recently, Jaguar Land Rover 
defaultselected
default the i54 si
defaultte as the location for its new engine plant
default.
default This was brought about by joint working between 
defaultWolverhampton City Council
default, Staffordshire County Council and South Staffords
defaulthire 
defaultDistrict 
defaultCouncil.  
defaultMOOG also opted to move its new plant to
default 
defaulti54 and stay within the region. This was only made possible 
defaultwith support from Wolverhampton City Council, Staffordshire County Council and Staffordshire Council. 
defaultWolverhampton City Council
default and Staffordshire County Council have borrowed £37 million against the business rates they will receive from the Enterprise Zone. This loan will fund the changes to the M54 slip road, 
defaultgiving
default 
defaulteasier access to the Zone. It
default is believed that this 
defaultis the first
default time local authorities have been responsible for funding major changes to a motorway. Evidently, greater economic freedoms coupled with effective partnerships allow more innovative ways of working. 
defaultGreater economic control would incentivise more private i
defaultnvestment in joint ventures, and would enable Wolverhampton to plan for the long term. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFiscal devolution to the Black Country would provide wider geographical benefits. The subsequent economic growth would act as a catalyst for wider growth and enable further opportunities for expanded partnership w
defaultork. Additionally, a vibrant job market in the Black Country would
default create jobs for both Black Country residents and our catchment areas whilst
default encourag
defaulting
default relocation to its surrounding areas.  
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultReform of the existing system is essential, but t
defaulthere is no preference as to whether it would precede or be part of large scale constitutional change, as long as it happened. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAll of the taxes mentioned above would be welcomed as part of 
defaulta 
defaultdevolution
default scheme
default. Even if the regulation of council tax was relaxed, instead of fully devolved, the impact 
defaulton Wolverhampton 
defaultwould be positive. 
defaultRe-banding properties and the removal of the referendum threshold would give far greater freedom
default and enable the local authority to respond to local needs
default. The de-centralisation of stamp duty would enable 
defaultWolverhampton City Council
default to encourage regeneration in
default certain
default local areas
default, by reducing
default or waiving stamp duty. The tax could also be used to discourage development in overcrowded areas. 
defaultThe devolution of business rates
default has the potential to be beneficial
default, if such devolution is comp
defaultlemented by Single Pot funding
default. It would enable 
defaultWolverhampton City Council
default to invest to save
default,
default and enter into long term commitments with LEPs and other private sector partners, 
defaultwith 
defaulta secure funding stream
default in the future
default. 
defaultIt would cut red tape, by enabling t
defaulthe local authority to give reductions when appropriate
default to encourage economic growth
default, rather than businesses having to negotiate a complex system of applying for a discount. Business owners would be able to scrutinise more closely the setting of business ra
defaulttes, as they would be established on a local basis. It would enable the authority to 
defaultbetter 
defaultengage with business leaders
default,
default and react more quickly to changing economic circumstances across the city. 
defaultHowever such freedoms would only produce economic growth if
default they were supplemented by LEP Growth Deal funding to help tackle the barriers to growth in the Black Country. 
defaultThese include contaminated land and a lack of infrastructure. 
default&#xa0;
defaultFlexibility regarding council tax and business rates would be welcomed in the short term before full devolution 
defaultoccurs.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultWolverhampton City Council
default would welcome the 
defaultremoval
default of the c
defaultap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing. This would enable increased housing construction and a future revenue stream 
defaultof rents
default paid to the council. Some l
defaultevel of monitoring could remain
default to ensure 
defaultsensible construction
default. 
defaultIf councils were given full control o
defaultver business rates and their revenue, then more borrowing would not 
defaultnecessarily be needed. 
defaultFurthermore, a secure revenue stream would give councils more confidence to borrow. There should also be a change in the dialogue surrounding borrowing - rather than
default being seen as bad 
defaultdebt it should be encouraged, if carried out prudently 
defaultand sensibly, to stimulate growth. 
defaultSupport from central government and Europe 
defaultfor land remediation
default 
defaultwould be necessary in order to make such projects financially viable for private investors. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most appropriate scope would be to enable 
defaultlocal authoritie
defaults to raise funds by any means, 
defaultbut not levy new taxes, unless they were accompanied with a very low administrative burden. 
defaultRevenue raising methods such as a local VAT would most likely result in excessive amounts of
default local
default 
defaultbureaucracy
default and re
defaultd tape.
default 
defaultTraded and non-statutory services should be allowed to make a profit, which would be re-invested back into the council. The local authority should have full discret
defaultion regarding fees and charges
default, including services such as licensing and planning. 
defaultFurthermore, such discretionary charges could help discourage undesirable licenses being granted, or mitigate their effects, in a similar way to the night time levy (which should also be discretionary to adapt to local circumstance
defaults
default).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultRedistribution of 
defaultthe 
defaultproceeds 
defaultof growth 
defaultwould need to be treated carefully. Some areas will still suffer from disproportionate stagnation and will need add
defaultitional funding, but local authorities should
default not
default be dis-incentivised to succeed. The level of revenue allowed before being re-distributed should be proportionate to the levels of deprivation within the area – the level of reward should match the effort in
defaultvested. If some areas are very successful solely because of their location, their threshold should be lower. 
defaultThe economic landscape of 
defaultBritain
default is not a level playing field and such 
defaultfinancial 
defaultredistribution should 
defaultbe used to 
defaulthelp 
defaultaddress
default this inequity. 
defaultWolverhampton City Council
default strongly emphasise the need for fairness in the redistribution of funds, and for the levels of deprivation within each devolved area to be taken into account when allocating funding.
