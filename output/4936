[normal]Submission from [bold]Wolverhampton City Council[bold] (FDC24)[bold]Executive Summary[bold]Recommendations [bold]Wolverhampton City Council asks for the following recommendations to be considered. That central government:
[normal]Lifts the cap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing and encourages prudent borrowing to stimulate growth.
[normal]Responses to questions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]There are already a number of schemes 
[normal]which 
[normal]operate on a Black Country basis, including 
[normal]offsetting local priorities for
[normal] 
[normal]funding streams from the European
[normal] Regional Development Fund
[normal] and
[normal] the
[normal] European Social Fund
[normal]. 
[normal]It
[normal] would be sensible to create the devolved area along Black Country lines, where relationships and structure
[normal]s already exist and new powers c
[normal]ould work alongside existing schemes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Centralised skills and employment training do not meet Wolverhampton’s needs. If such public services were fully devolved they could be adapted to fit business demands, offering 
[normal]training 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]skills areas in line
[normal] 
[normal]with 
[normal]local 
[normal]va
[normal]cancies
[normal]. 
[normal]Rather than just ‘complementing’ devolution, these public services should be an integral part of de-centralisati
[normal]on
[normal].
[normal] This would enable them to provide a holistic approach to service provision and 
[normal]use funding in the most e
[normal]ffective
[normal] way. 
[normal]However such devolution would need to be complemented with sufficient investment from central government to tackle problems 
[normal]prevalent in
[normal] deprived areas like the Black Country. 
[normal]Resolving issues
[normal] around employability and skills gaps would need to be 
[normal]a key
[normal] par
[normal]t of the devolution process, or regional growth could not be realised. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Black Country devolved area would be governed via the joint committee model. 
[normal]This structure 
[normal]has 
[normal]already been established to
[normal] 
[normal]deal with the Government’s agenda for greater local decision making under
[normal] the
[normal] City Deal and Growth Deal
[normal], and existing relationships 
[normal]could
[normal] be 
[normal]expanded
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any decision made by the Joint Committee is in law a dec
[normal]ision of all four councils’ Cabinets. The membership of the Joint Committee is made up of the four leaders of the Black Country councils. The chair of the LEP has a right to attend and speak at meetings but cannot cast a vote. There is also an existing sup
[normal]plementary Advisory Group which presents proposals to the Joint Committee. Such proposals 
[normal]can come from
[normal] any of the councils, individually or jointly, and/or the Black Country Consortium and LEP. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This existing structure would be used to implement fiscal d
[normal]evolution in the Black Country. Each council would remain independent in other matters and hold their own elections. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The devolved area would be governed by the existing joint committee structure. Each authority would maintain its independence and hold its own elections. There would also be a local authority representative on each LEP board. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]There is already evidence of suc
[normal]cessful joint working in Wolverhampton.
[normal] Recently, Jaguar Land Rover 
[normal]selected
[normal] the i54 si
[normal]te as the location for its new engine plant
[normal].
[normal] This was brought about by joint working between 
[normal]Wolverhampton City Council
[normal], Staffordshire County Council and South Staffords
[normal]hire 
[normal]District 
[normal]Council.  
[normal]MOOG also opted to move its new plant to
[normal] 
[normal]i54 and stay within the region. This was only made possible 
[normal]with support from Wolverhampton City Council, Staffordshire County Council and Staffordshire Council. 
[normal]Wolverhampton City Council
[normal] and Staffordshire County Council have borrowed £37 million against the business rates they will receive from the Enterprise Zone. This loan will fund the changes to the M54 slip road, 
[normal]giving
[normal] 
[normal]easier access to the Zone. It
[normal] is believed that this 
[normal]is the first
[normal] time local authorities have been responsible for funding major changes to a motorway. Evidently, greater economic freedoms coupled with effective partnerships allow more innovative ways of working. 
[normal]Greater economic control would incentivise more private i
[normal]nvestment in joint ventures, and would enable Wolverhampton to plan for the long term. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Fiscal devolution to the Black Country would provide wider geographical benefits. The subsequent economic growth would act as a catalyst for wider growth and enable further opportunities for expanded partnership w
[normal]ork. Additionally, a vibrant job market in the Black Country would
[normal] create jobs for both Black Country residents and our catchment areas whilst
[normal] encourag
[normal]ing
[normal] relocation to its surrounding areas.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reform of the existing system is essential, but t
[normal]here is no preference as to whether it would precede or be part of large scale constitutional change, as long as it happened. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]All of the taxes mentioned above would be welcomed as part of 
[normal]a 
[normal]devolution
[normal] scheme
[normal]. Even if the regulation of council tax was relaxed, instead of fully devolved, the impact 
[normal]on Wolverhampton 
[normal]would be positive. 
[normal]Re-banding properties and the removal of the referendum threshold would give far greater freedom
[normal] and enable the local authority to respond to local needs
[normal]. The de-centralisation of stamp duty would enable 
[normal]Wolverhampton City Council
[normal] to encourage regeneration in
[normal] certain
[normal] local areas
[normal], by reducing
[normal] or waiving stamp duty. The tax could also be used to discourage development in overcrowded areas. 
[normal]The devolution of business rates
[normal] has the potential to be beneficial
[normal], if such devolution is comp
[normal]lemented by Single Pot funding
[normal]. It would enable 
[normal]Wolverhampton City Council
[normal] to invest to save
[normal],
[normal] and enter into long term commitments with LEPs and other private sector partners, 
[normal]with 
[normal]a secure funding stream
[normal] in the future
[normal]. 
[normal]It would cut red tape, by enabling t
[normal]he local authority to give reductions when appropriate
[normal] to encourage economic growth
[normal], rather than businesses having to negotiate a complex system of applying for a discount. Business owners would be able to scrutinise more closely the setting of business ra
[normal]tes, as they would be established on a local basis. It would enable the authority to 
[normal]better 
[normal]engage with business leaders
[normal],
[normal] and react more quickly to changing economic circumstances across the city. 
[normal]However such freedoms would only produce economic growth if
[normal] they were supplemented by LEP Growth Deal funding to help tackle the barriers to growth in the Black Country. 
[normal]These include contaminated land and a lack of infrastructure. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Flexibility regarding council tax and business rates would be welcomed in the short term before full devolution 
[normal]occurs.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Wolverhampton City Council
[normal] would welcome the 
[normal]removal
[normal] of the c
[normal]ap on Housing Revenue Account borrowing. This would enable increased housing construction and a future revenue stream 
[normal]of rents
[normal] paid to the council. Some l
[normal]evel of monitoring could remain
[normal] to ensure 
[normal]sensible construction
[normal]. 
[normal]If councils were given full control o
[normal]ver business rates and their revenue, then more borrowing would not 
[normal]necessarily be needed. 
[normal]Furthermore, a secure revenue stream would give councils more confidence to borrow. There should also be a change in the dialogue surrounding borrowing - rather than
[normal] being seen as bad 
[normal]debt it should be encouraged, if carried out prudently 
[normal]and sensibly, to stimulate growth. 
[normal]Support from central government and Europe 
[normal]for land remediation
[normal] 
[normal]would be necessary in order to make such projects financially viable for private investors. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The most appropriate scope would be to enable 
[normal]local authoritie
[normal]s to raise funds by any means, 
[normal]but not levy new taxes, unless they were accompanied with a very low administrative burden. 
[normal]Revenue raising methods such as a local VAT would most likely result in excessive amounts of
[normal] local
[normal] 
[normal]bureaucracy
[normal] and re
[normal]d tape.
[normal] 
[normal]Traded and non-statutory services should be allowed to make a profit, which would be re-invested back into the council. The local authority should have full discret
[normal]ion regarding fees and charges
[normal], including services such as licensing and planning. 
[normal]Furthermore, such discretionary charges could help discourage undesirable licenses being granted, or mitigate their effects, in a similar way to the night time levy (which should also be discretionary to adapt to local circumstance
[normal]s
[normal]).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Redistribution of 
[normal]the 
[normal]proceeds 
[normal]of growth 
[normal]would need to be treated carefully. Some areas will still suffer from disproportionate stagnation and will need add
[normal]itional funding, but local authorities should
[normal] not
[normal] be dis-incentivised to succeed. The level of revenue allowed before being re-distributed should be proportionate to the levels of deprivation within the area – the level of reward should match the effort in
[normal]vested. If some areas are very successful solely because of their location, their threshold should be lower. 
[normal]The economic landscape of 
[normal]Britain
[normal] is not a level playing field and such 
[normal]financial 
[normal]redistribution should 
[normal]be used to 
[normal]help 
[normal]address
[normal] this inequity. 
[normal]Wolverhampton City Council
[normal] strongly emphasise the need for fairness in the redistribution of funds, and for the levels of deprivation within each devolved area to be taken into account when allocating funding.
