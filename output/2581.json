"&#xa0;\nWritten submission submitted by the Film Distributors’ Association [OLS0051]&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1\n.\n              \nFilm Distributors’ Association (\nFDA\n)\n is the trade body for UK theatrical film distributors, the \ncompanies that release films \nin cinemas \nand promote them to audiences, propelling the film value chain into motion\n. The feature films brought to market by FDA\n’s diverse membership\n—\nranging widely from international blockbusters to classic revivals; and fr\nom British films to productio\nns of 42 other countries in 2013\n—\naccount for 99\n% of UK cinema admissions. Lord \nPuttnam\n of \nQueensgate\n \nCBE\n is FDA’s President. \nEvery theatrical film release is effectively a joint-venture between its distributor and the exhibitors willing to play it, \nwhile\n distributors’ launch campaigns typically involve a host of partners, suppliers and media.\n&#xa0;\n2\n.\n              \nTheatrical film distribution is \na sophisticated, competitive and dynamic business that depends on \nproduct\n and the extent to which it connects with \naudiences\n. With 1% of the global population, the UK generates 7% of global \nc\ninema box-office receipts (£1.1\n billion from 172.5 million admiss\nions in 2012\n). \nThe\n sector operates \neffectively\n and delivers a significant contribution to the economy in terms of revenue and jobs, as well as the consequent cultural and creative impacts. An economic multiplier effect applies: for every £1 spent on cinem\na\n tickets, at least a further £3\n is pumped into the economy on directly related expenditure\n.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n              \nFDA\n welcomes the opportunity to \ncontribute\n to the inquiry into Online Safety\n. F\nilm distributors \ntake child protection \nmatters very\n seriously\n.\n \nDistributors\n have worked effectively\n and consistently\n \nto safeguard against\n \nchildren\n accessing \ninappropriate\n \nmaterial\n throughout the last ce\nntury. \nSome\n \nfilm \ndistributors are established\n,\n family-trusted brands\n,\n \nknown\n in their own right\n \nworldwide, while\n many others partn\ner \non particular projects \nwi\nth \nbrands that appeal to children and young people. \nFor many years\n,\n t\nhe whole industry\n \nhas worked\n in collaboration with the \nindependent \nBritish Board of Film\n Classification (BBFC)\n, \nin \nhelping to \nconne\nct audio-\nvisual works with \nage-\nappropriate audience\ns, and better inform those audiences about the content of the works on offer.\n \nWe know that\n, in such matters,\n it is essential to retain public trust.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n              \nWe sh\nould like to \npoint out\n two areas of concern\n:\n&#xa0;\n              \ni\n)\n              \nG\nreater \npotential for \nconsumer \nconfusion\n \n \n \n(item 5 below);\n              \nii)\n              \nD\nangers inherent \nin\n the online piracy of audio\n-\nvisual titles\n \n  \n(item 6 below).\n&#xa0;\n5\n.\n              \ni\n)   \nG\nreater potential for consumer c\nonfusion\n&#xa0;\nFilm d\nistributors have \nalways \nworked collaboratively \nwith the B\nBFC\n,\n \nwhich celebrated its centenary in 2012\n. \nThis relationship is \nrelied upon by \nnational and local g\novernment\n,\n \nwhile\n \nthe\n published \nfilm-specific \nadvice is \ntrusted \nby the \npublic\n \n– for home/mobile viewing as well as cinema\n visit\ns. \nLast year’s anno\nuncement\n that\n \nthe BBFC\n was\n \nto be responsible for the classification of content on mobile \ndevices was greatly welcomed as ensuring\n consistency \nacross\n devices and platforms.\n   \n&#xa0;\nHowever, \nthis\n does \nfurther underline \nthe potential for public uncertainty \nwhere \ntwo separate regulator\ny bodies \nare responsible for \nthe classification of audio-\nvisual products of\n significant simil\narity. \nSuch\n confusion is most likely to arise \nwhen\n \na feature film classified by the BBFC and a video game classified by PEGI are based on the\n same intellectual property (\ni.e. share a \nsource of narrative and characters, such as \nThe Hobbit\n). Inevitably this \narise\ns\n with\n many of\n the most \npopular franchises.\n \nOur concern is that parents will naturally make their decisions to purchase/access a video g\name based on \ntheir reliance on the long-established BBFC film classifications, perhaps unaware that the BBFC and PEGI \napproaches\n are\n quite\n different.\n&#xa0;\nIn response to consumer research, the BBFC provides clear and detailed information regarding the \ncontent\n \nof \nevery film \nclassified\n in the UK.\n \nThis is relayed by film distributors and cinema operators on a film by film basis, so that parents may make more informed choices. The more fragmented the regulatory regime across entertainment properties, the greater th\ne scope for user confusion.\n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n              \nii\n)   \nD\nangers inherent \nin\n the online piracy of audio\n-\nvisual titles\n&#xa0;\nThe film industry\n \nhas always taken a \nrobust\n approach to \nrestricting\n young people\n’s access\n \nto inappropriate material\n—\nthrough the \nBBFC \nclassification sy\nstem, paid for title by title by film distributors\n. \n&#xa0;\nAs\n the \ntechnological \ninnovation\ns\n of video and, in turn, \nD\nVD\n \nplaced\n \nmore \nresponsibility \non\n parents, \nthe industry \ncontinued to take\n seriously its obligation to provide clear information to enable \nparents\n \nto make appropriate decisions for their \nown \nchildren.\n \nToday,\n t\nhis is becoming increasingly difficult\n, as\n young people \ncan\n access material\n \nonline \nin the ab\nsence of parental supervisi\non\n—\nrendering them\n vulnerable to what they may find.\n \nThis problem may be \nexacerbated by the fact that young people are often more technically profi\ncient than their parents.\n \n&#xa0;\nFDA\n \nsupports\n recent calls by Government and\n consumer groups \nfor\n \nInternet Service Providers \nto\n filter (with age restrictions) and\n appropriately\n label \nthe c\nontent they make available and monetise.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
