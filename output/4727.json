The S-92® aircraft is comparable to the fixed wing Part 121 scheduled airline at 0.15 accidents per 100,000 flight hours.\n&#xa0;\nThere have been \ntwo accidents in the S-92® helicopter’s history, one in South Korea in 2008 and one off the Newfoundland coast in 2009. The comparison of fatal accident rates has the S-92® helicopter at 0.16 per 100,000 flight hours, with the comparable aircraft model at \n0.67 per 100,000 flight hours.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-76™ aircraft also has a world-class accident rate in its market segment, at 1.42 per 100,000 flight hours, as compared to its competition at 1.58 per 100,000 flight hours. The comparison of fatal accident rates shows t\nhe S-76 at 0.50 per 100,000 flight hours, with the competition at 0.92 per 100,000 flight hours.\n&#xa0;\nS-92® Aircraft:\n&#xa0;\nThe S-92® aircraft is the first and only helicopter in its class certified to the latest U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Part 29 require\nments and European airworthiness safety standards incorporating the latest specifications for flaw tolerance, bird strike capability and turbine burst protection. The S-92® helicopter’s design has the highest crashworthy standards and also exceeds the egre\nss requirements.\n&#xa0;\nThere are 189 S-92® aircraft in operation in 24 countries around the world. The 200th completed aircraft was delivered in September 2013, and the fleet has flown more than 625,000 hours, 90 percent of which are logged in the off-shore oil\n transportation. Offshore oil S-92® helicopters fly an estimated 90-110 hours per month; the high time aircraft has surpassed 15,000 flight hours to date. There are now four aircraft with more than 13,000 flight hours.\n&#xa0;\nSome of the key safety features of \nthe S-92® helicopter include energy-absorbing landing gear, high visibility crew station, traffic collision avoidance system, APU in-flight emergency power, redundant hydraulics and flaw tolerant flight controls, reduced workload EFIS cockpit, high energy \nturbine burst protection, large cabin emergency exits, RIG Approach, emergency beacon, 20g crash retention, enhanced ground proximity warning system, HEELS, Sea State Six, push-out window exits for each row, crash- worthy fuel system separated from cabin (\npassengers), energy-absorbing passenger and crew seats, bird strike certification, lightning strike protection and emergency life rafts.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-92® helicopter’s lube system fully isolates external leaks, maintains cooling in the event of a pump failure and\n has redundant pump drives. Both the external leak and pump failure modes were tested in excess of three hours.\n&#xa0;\nS-92® Helicopter Continuous Improvements:\n&#xa0;\n. Sikorsky introduced more than 10 new product improvements to the fleet in 2012. More are in work\n for 2013. .

ADS-B - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast is the next generation of air traffic control safety equipment. The functionality provides aircraft and \nair traffic controllers with real-time satellite-based position and heading data, and will replace current radar-based systems. Norway will require ADS-B in the 2014 timeframe. The U.S. will require most aircraft to have some form of ADS-B OUT (broadcast) \nby 2020. Sikorsky is collaborating with vendor Rockwell Collins and an operator to offer an FAA and EASA-certified DO260B ADS-B system. . TCAS II - Traffic Collision Avoidance System with the addition of verbal and visual annunciations to the \npilot that ad\nvise actions to take to avoid a collision (ascend, descend, etc.). Sikorsky is also pursuing integration into the cockpit displays. Development is paced by an upgrade of the Aircraft Management System (AMS). . Rig Approach - A safety enhancement that provi\ndes the ability to conduct fully coupled, GPS based approaches to offshore platforms (rig) in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) using waypoints. Sikorsky has invested millions of dollars to design, flight test and certify this capability. This is \naccomplished using latest FMS and GPS technology integrated with next generation Flight Control and avionics management algorithms, requires special software and equipment such as next generation AFCS computers, AHRS and WAAS capable GPS/FMS, and revised A\nFCS Control interfaces. Pilots from the FAA, EASA and PHI (who were an early advocate for the system) have flown in the simulator and some in the flight test aircraft, with strong endorsement for the enhanced capabilities the system provides including oper\nations in bad weather and at night. FAA certification was received in May, and PHI flew its first operational customer flight in November. The Sikorsky Aircraft Performance Application is a key element to a tablet based Electronic Flight Bag which reduces \ncarry on weight and cockpit clutter. The app automatically calculates weight and balance plus all required performance data to include information for Cat \nA\n \ntakeoff\n and landing, cruise, hover, and maintenance auto. Ground level helipad, elevated helideck, \nand runway procedures are all included.\n&#xa0;\nIncreased Capabilities\n&#xa0;\n. Engine Inlet Barrier Filter - A barrier filter for sand and dust is being developed. Completion is pending acquisition of a flight test aircraft. It will be made available for retrofit.\n&#xa0;\n. Gross Weight Expansion (GWE) Program - The maximum allowable take-off gross weight of the aircraft is being increased from 26,500-pounds to 27,700- pounds. Although primarily a change to published limits and supporting data, there will be minor change\ns to airframe. At this time the capability is planned to be offered as an option and most likely will be implemented into the baseline aircraft, although that decision has not yet been finalized. . Hydraulic Heat Exchanger – Improved design being developed\n. This component has been a high DOC driver. . Upgraded Engine (GE CT7-8A6) - The CT7-8A6 will replace the current 8A engine. The engine will provide additional one engine inoperative (OEI) capability and improve our Cat A and PC2E performance.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-9\n2® aircraft is designed to the newer FAA regulations without exception. It is FAA-certified with flaw tolerance design throughout. It meets the FAA lubrication failure regulation, without exception, and exceeds FAA requirements for crashworthiness. It has \nthe highest number of fleet hours and the lowest accident rate. Sikorsky continues to invest millions of dollars on safety, technology and innovation.\n&#xa0;\nS-76D™ Aircraft:\n&#xa0;\nThe S-76™ helicopter fleet maintains its strong position in the market and is the \naircraft of choice for many of the world’s largest helicopter offshore operators. For offshore oil transportation, it commands a dominant market share in its class. The S-76™ worldwide fleet \nhas approximately 706 active aircraft and has now accumulated mor\ne than 6.2 million flight hours. The venerable and evolving S-76™ product celebrated its 36th birthday this year.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-76D™ helicopter is the latest in the long line of successful and reliable S-76™ aircraft.\nMajor offshore oil helicopter companies \nincluding Bristow and Milestone Aviation have selected the S-76D™ aircraft and delivery of this product is in progress. On Oct. 31, 2013, the S-76D™ helicopter achieved FAA-certification for offshore oil operations. This milestone enabled Sikorsky to begin\n delivering completed off-shore oil configured S-76D™ aircraft to customers. The FAA-certification increases the S-76D™ helicopter’s maximum gross weight to 11,875 pounds and allows up to 12 passengers for operations in the offshore oil configuration. In a\nddition, the S-76D™ helicopter also received an expanded baseline certification, allowing the aircraft to operate in a wider range of environments.\n&#xa0;\nKey to the S-76D™ helicopter’s safety features are the new advances in technology that are incorporated i\nnto the aircraft.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-76D™ helicopter features Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW210S engines, the \nTopDeck\n® cockpit developed by Thales and new composite main and tail rotor blades with an optional Rotor Ice Protection System. These technologies, along with t\nhe aircraft’s performance, give the operator the best-in-class option in today’s under-12,500 pound helicopter class.\n&#xa0;\nThe PW210S engines have been successfully certified as fulfilling the engines’ technology goals aimed at high power-to-weight ratios wh\nile maintaining low fuel consumption. EASA certification is expected in quarter one of 2014, Canadian Type Certification was issued October 2011, FAA TC was received in December and multiple additional foreign certification validations are in progress.\n&#xa0;\nInitial certification of the Thales Top Deck avionics system was completed in conjunction with aircraft certification in October 2012. Efforts are ongoing to increase the certified capability of the avionics systems in areas including WAAS – LPV, ADSB-Out,\n Flight Following and XM Weather. SAR AFCS modes have completed shakedown tests to be followed by final tuning of these search and rescue autopilot modes.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-76D™ helicopter will also benefit from several airframe upgrades. Energy- attenuating crew s\neats are in the baseline aircraft and machined floors are planned for high-strength applications in the cabin area to include accommodation of energy- attenuating seating in all cabin seats. Optional Type IV egress windows are available in the both the for\nward and aft cabin.\n&#xa0;\nThe S-76™ family of helicopters is safe at the foundation and highly reliable, both made available through a combination of robust technical designs and customer-focused support programs.\n&#xa0;\nSikorsky again thanks the Transport Co\nmmittee for the opportunity to share our thoughts and vision on helicopter safety and capability.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
