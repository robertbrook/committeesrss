defaultaiming to 
defaultwork towards the behaviour change needed 
defaultand 
defaultto 
defaultcontribute towards a reduction in heat energy demand. 
defaultResearch indicates that be
defaulttween the years 2000–2011 there has been a 20% reduction in domestic gas consumption (Ricardo-AEA: 
defaulthttp://www.politics.co.uk/comm
defaultent-analysis/2013/05/23/comment-cutting-demand-is-the-blind-spot-in-britain-s-great
default). 
defaultTools such as the 
defaultNational Heat Map
default give a good indication of the heat density across the UK; it would be a 
defaultuseful addition if this map was able to illustrate reductions in the heat use over time. 
defaultIt would also appear though that more time and effort is being invested in supply side management than in demand side management – i.e. heat (and energy) demand reduc
defaulttion. Domestic and commercial users of energy are interested in reducing the use of heat energy as it in turn reduces their fuel bills but this is proving to be challenging for many. 
default&#xa0;default2. defaultWhat progress is the government making on reducing the demand for hedefaultatdefault? defaultIt is clear that steps are being taken in the right 
defaultdirection;
default however, with heat still accounting for 
defaultnearly
default 50% of the UK’s energy use
default, it is difficult to 
defaultsee
default how quickly t
defaulthe demand for heat is reducing or if it is government policy which is behind 
defaultthe reduction.
default3. defaultBiomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives.default&#xa0;default What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picturedefault? defaultNo comment. 
default4. defaultThere are sustainability gdefaultuidelines for biomass, do these go far enoughdefault? defaultNo comment. 
default5. defaultWhat will the local environmental impact (for example air pollution) be from the use heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP unitsdefault? defaultThere is zero local environmental impact from the u
defaultse of ground source heat pumps in urban areas (no emissions, no noise, no visible impact, as ground source heat pumps provide invisible heating systems and
default 
defaultare the most unobtrusive heating (&amp; cooling) technology available on the market.
default6. defaultWhat are the reldefaultative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumpsdefault? defaultThis depends on the efficiency of the power station in converting gas to electricity (normally around 50%) and the Co-efficient of Performance (CoP) of the domestic heat pumps (normally around 400%). If heat pumps are poorly installed there is a danger tha
defaultt the CoP could fall to 200% and, at that level, there would be no merit in using heat pumps. 
default With the planned decarbonisation of the electricity grid the case for well installed ground source heat pumps gets stronger and stronger.
defaultGround source heat pump
defaults in well insulated buildings can be set to provide background heating at night (when electricity supply is significantly cheaper).
default7. defaultWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UKdefault? defaultHeat Networks in the UK currently provide less than 2% of the UK
default’s heat demand (DECC), although an assessment in 2009 suggested “that in the right conditions heat networks could supply up to 14% of the UK’s heat demand.”
defaultLegal problems and custom have held back district heating schemes in the UK, as well as issues of m
defaulteasuring heat used by
default customers of district heating even though meters specifically for this purpose have been available for many years in mainland Europe.
defaultCHP has advantages in the heating season – but only marginal advantage in summer, unless connected t

default8. defaultWhat are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solutiondefault? defaultNo Comment.
default9. defaultShould the government take any further any specific actions in relation to coolingdefault? defaultWe know that DECC are opposed to the idea of subsidising cooling by air conditioning: we are very much in sympathy with the idea that standard air conditioning should not be encouraged – because there are large carbon emission implications. This is because
default the standard approach to cooling – heat exchange with hot air – is expensive in electricity [and therefore carbon emissions].  
defaultHowever in warmer parts of Europe (and the World) where building cooling is recognised as being important to maintaining productivity, considerable work has been invested in developing Renewable Energy driven cooling systems and in balancing heating and co
defaultoling loads which if correctly executed can be the most energy efficient solution. Thermal Energy storage is at the heart of the systems and in this context providing heating can be considered as recharging the store with coolth and cooling as recharging t
defaulthe store with warmth.  In either case the heat is moved and stored rather than created.
defaultThe CoP (Coefficient of Performance) of a roof-mounted chiller can be as low as 1.5 on a hot day [1 kilowatt of electricity is needed to provide 1.5 kW of cooling].  Ho
defaultwever, some cooling is necessary, and there is a very much more effective way of achieving this – by employing ground source energy and allowing heat to escape to cold ground instead of forcing heat into hot air.  The CoP of “free cooling” (heat exchange w
defaultith cold ground by means of a circulation pump) can be as high as 25. The CoP of Renewable Cooling (heat exchange with cold ground assisted by a reversible heat pump) can 
defaultfrequently achieve a CoP of 8.
default Further this has the additional benefit of improving h
defaulteating CoP the following winter as the ground has been recharged and is therefore warmer. Improvements in heating CoP can be dramatic lifting the annual heating CoP from around 4 to around 5 in many cases.
default 
defaultThe carbon emission savings of using Renewable Co
defaultoling, instead of standard Air Conditioning, are huge and we believe that DECC will come to see that these should be encouraged
default as part of the fight to reduce carbon emissions
default.
defaultThere will need to be appropriate safeguards, which could be defined in terms o
defaultf requiring a high CoP before Renewable Cooling is recognised and requiring a high temperature set point so that Cooling is only used when necessary (rather than as an indulgence).
defaultDECC has been inclined to reject subsidy for renewable cooling as their int
defaulterpretation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) is that it would not count as “renewable” although it would save significant CO2 emissions. We think that DECC, which frequently claims that the RHI is a “world first”, should be making the case to Brusse
defaultls, rather than following DECC’s own timid interpretation of the RED.
default10. defaultWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfullydefault? defaultThe practical effect of DECC policy (although not the intention) has been to suppress the heat pump market:

defaultDECC also introduced the unscientific idea of “naturally occurring energy” which confused the market and prevented Ofgem from accrediting any ground source heating

defaultGround source heat pumps can also recycle energy from summer to winter and, throu

defaultThe RHI provides an annual subsidy to reduce the annual cost of using renewable heat. The barrier to installing a ground
default source heat pump is not the annual running cost (which is small) but the up-front capital cost (which is large).
default11. defaultHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?defaultThis may depend on the efficiency with which the RHI is administered by 
defaultOfgem. This, in turn, may depend on the complexity of the regulations Ofgem is asked to administer.
default12. Thermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand both diurnally and annually.default&#xa0;default What is government policy doing to prodefaultmote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?defaultThermal storage using seasonal thermal energy storage is a simple and practical method of balancing energy demand which is already in use in the UK. Government policy has not yet recognised the merits of this approach in saving carbon emissions. The miscon
defaultceived policy of “naturally occurring energy” held back market developments in this innovative technology. DECC has recognised that this was inappropriate, but the Statutory Instrument of 28 November 2011 has not yet been updated. 
defaultGovernment policy urgent
defaultly needs to recognise and promote Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage as a means of saving carbon emissions. The Government should also encourage all forms of Heat Recovery where this can be used in conjunction with thermal storage in order to save carbon emis
defaultsions.
