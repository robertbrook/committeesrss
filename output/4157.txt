[[[DACS submission to the Culture Media and Sport Committee Inquiry into the Future of the BBC]]]&#xa0;DACS welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Culture Media and Sport Committee inquiry into The Future of the BBC.&#xa0;Established by artists for artists, DACS is a not-for-profit visual arts rights management organisation representing over 80,000 artists, photographers, designers and illustrators from the UK and abroad. &#xa0;Part of a global network of visual arts collecting societies, DACS is committed to transforming the financial landscape for visual artists and estates so that their artistic practice is sustained and their works protected. In 2012 DACS paid royalties of £9.7 million to visual artists.&#xa0;DACS has worked with the BBC over many years. The BBC licences many of our members’ works, the royalties from which represent 3% of the copyright licensing royalties we paid to artists in 2012. In addition, many of our members have benefited from commissions from the BBC.&#xa0;The BBC has played a major role in fostering the UK’s creative industries, the success of which is envied around the world. The UK produces high quality, innovative content much of it supported by the BBC. In addition, it provides a valuable route to secondary markets which have been a source of licensing income for artists.&#xa0;The continuation of the Licence Fee is essential if the BBC is to thrive and continue to invest in the production of high quality content which in turn represents investment in the UK’s creators, not the least of which are visual artists.&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
