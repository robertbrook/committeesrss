[[[.]]]&#xa0;In the remainder of this submission we discuss one such technology, biochar,  to illustrate the principles.CO2 + H2O + sunlight → O2 + (HCOH).That is, using sunlight energy and releasing oxygen, plants combine water and CO2 to form sugars and large structural molecules (HCOH representing one link in a long-chain polymer such as cellulose).  Respiration by animals and microbes (including bacteria and fungi) reverses this process.  These annual natural flows of CO2 to and from the atmosphere are very large compared to anthropogenic emissions but photosynthetic fixation and respiration are nearly in balance.  Preventing the re-oxidation of some of the carbon temporarily fixed by photosynthesis, could shift the balance towards sequestration.This chemical transformation of plant material by the action of heat, pyrolysis, can be deployed on a large scale to convert agricultural residues and other biomass wastes that are presently not used, or used only inefficiently.  Even if confined to this subset of plant materials, the process could potentially increase net withdrawal of atmospheric CO2, by about 3.7 billion (3,700,000,000) tonnes annually, or 1/8 th of current global anthropogenic emissions.  This corresponds to 1 Gt (1 billion tonnes) of carbon.The carbon content of a biochar can be determined reliably and cheaply by chemical analysis. Recently techniques have been developed to assess, with growing confidence, the resistance of biochars to biological and non-biological oxidation, so that they can act as a stable store of carbon for periods far greater than 100 years.  Combining these techniques permits the quantity of carbon stored permanently by a project or on-going business to be measured.New businesses might emerge, specialising in the selection and sourcing of CRS units for onward sale to fuel suppliers.The imposition of post-emission CCS obligations on primary suppliers of petroleum-derived transport fuels would modify the working of the carbon markets.  Those with CRS obligations would only be allowed to purchase certain products within the carbon markets to meet their responsibilities.  Other market participants – those needing to buy units to stay within their cap – could buy existing emission permits, or the new CRS units.   This might raise demand for the CRS units above that needed to retract emissions from mobile sources, but only if-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CRS units were cheaper than the surplus emission permits; or-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CRS units were sought preferentially by companies to burnish their environmental credentials.The first is unlikely until governments tighten the emissions caps significantly.  The second applies to some extent already because Biochar-CRS units are traded in the voluntary carbon markets in small volumes. We anticipate that larger, more liquid markets would be highly competitive.  A second supposition – that the fuel supplier would be liable for the full cost of producing the biochar – is only worth investigating if biochar proved to be the cheapest of the ‘negative energy’ technologies competing in the carbon markets. Biochar producers can draw on several income streams in addition to the carbon-credit price.  It is presently difficult to make a representative estimate of biochar’s value as a soil improver because it depends strongly on soil characteristics and constraints and crop types and values.  The other pyrolysis products, a combustible gas stream or a liquid fuel, may be sold for electricity generation or space heating.  It is highly unlikely that the income from carbon credits, even in a functioning carbon market with an effective CO2 price, will drive a biochar industry, but rather that the costs will be borne by several income streams depending on the installation.  The full cost of making biochar cannot be confidently specified at present because the industry is in its infancy, but an estimate of £160 per tonne has been suggested for production from some sources in the UK.  That cost would add 10.7p to the price of gasoline per litre, but we stress we consider this case to be remote and unlikely.&#xa0;&#xa0;Once incorporated into soil the material is effectively immobilised.  In some situations a fraction of the small char particles may be transported by water. Those particles will be deposited somewhere, often in deep-sea sediment.  These natural processes occur already.  Forest fires have put char pieces and particles onto and into the world’s soils for the past 500 million years.Production of biochar needs to be done in properly-designed kilns that avoid the release of gaseous pollutants.  Registration of schemes for market access offers a means of control.The IBI and other organisations have drawn up and published quality standards for biochar that specify maximum safe limits for potential soil contaminants such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatics and dioxins.Biochar is showing promise as a component of horticultural growing media that could substantially reduce the damaging extraction of peat from environmentally-sensitive areas.  There is a large market for such products in the UK.Biochar may be effective as a delivery medium for chemical fertilizers and as a means of controlling the rate of release of nutrients to crops.September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; Woolf et al, 2010 Nature Communications
