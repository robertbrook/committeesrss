defaultPopulation ageing is progressing fastest in developing countries, including those that have a large
default population of young people. Of the 15 countries that currently have more than 10 million older
default 
defaultpeople, seven are developing countries.

defaultPopulation ageing has an important gender dimension. Women and men age differently, with women 
defaultliving 
defaulton average 3-5 y
defaultears longer than men.
default 
default4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLifetime inequalities of income, education, employment, health and gender are likely to increase with age.
default 
defaultIssues of equality and equity are therefore essential to the wellbeing of older people with disabilities, as they are to othe
defaultr age groups. Tackling inequalities through policy, practice and monitoring is therefore crucial to sustaining development progress and improv
defaulting the wellbeing and capabilities of current and future generations of older people. 
default&#xa0;
default5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAge, gender, socio-economic status, physical and cognitive health, and psychosocial factors have all been identified as key determinants of disability.
default T
defaulthe ageing process may increase economic vulnerability, as 
defaultit 
defaultreduces the framework of capacity 
defaultfor 
defaultindividuals, accumulating their disadvantage and making their escape from chronic poverty less likely.
default R
defaulteduced physical and mental capacity arising from the ageing process is also potentially a cause of chronic intergenerational poverty.
default 
default6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOlder people
default may not self-identify as having a disability – considering failing sight, hearing and decreasing mobility as natural accompaniments to ageing. I
defaultncreased levels of functional disability and lower rates of labour force participation may lead to a reduced ca
defaultpacity to earn an income as people grow older, resulting in economic vulnerability in old age. 
defaultB
defaultarely one fifth of the world’s older population is in receipt of a secure pension.
default 
defaultThe consequences of this vulnerability are not limited to older people only,
default but may be shared by their families and a significant proportion of the wider population. For example, in Bangladesh
default,
default nearly one third of the general population live in households containing an older person.
default 
default7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultInjuries in older people, particularly those 
defaultcaused by falls, are often unrecorded but are frequent. They
default 
defaultmay start a downward spiral in health status, resulting in death or long-term care needs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 28-35 per cent of people over the age of 
default65 fall each year and injure themselves, increasing to 32-42 per cent of those aged more than 70 years.
default Falls may lead to post-fall syndrome, which includes increased dependence, loss of autonomy, confusion, immobilisation and depression.
default8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPoverty in old 
defaultage has a strong gender dimension. Older women are more likely to lose their partner, and less likely to remarry. Lower education levels and the need to combine work with childcare means that women are more likely to work in the informal sector
default and
default are oft
defaulten paid less than men
default, with the result that they are likely to have lower pension income in old
defaulter
default age
default. WHO has found that particular groups of older women are more at risk of poverty in all countries, including those who are widowed, divorced or with disab
defaultilities, and those caring for grandchildren and children orphaned by AIDS.
default Older women may be subject to extreme sexual violence and encounter discrimination and exclusion on account of their age and gender.
default 
default9default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecuring a sustainable livelihood is a challe
defaultnge for over 180 million older people in low- and middle-income countries who live in poverty, with no savings, assets or pensions. Research in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Tanzania found that older people have only limited acce
defaultss to microfinanc
defaulte institutions (MFIs) and banks.
default Inconsistent information about formal savings and loan services, including MFIs, further discourages older people.
default 
default10default&#xa0; 
defaultA range of studies
default 
defaultdemonstrates that effective ways to reach older women and men who are 
defaultdisabled and living in poverty is by ensuring income security through social protection and livelihoods support. This needs to be combined with effective, appropriate, safe and affordable healthcare, backed up by robust information services, citizen guaran
defaulttees and a reliable complaints system to ensure entitlements are upheld.
default  
default11default&#xa0; 
defaultLack of data disaggregated by age is a critical issue. In 2013
default,
default HelpAge constructed the first global index to
default&#xa0;
defaultrank countries by how well their ageing populations are faring. Based 
defaulton four key enablers of older people's wellbeing
default –
default income, health, employment and education, and enabling environment 
default– 
defaultthe 
defaultGlobal AgeWatch I
defaultndex uses data from a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, the World Health Organizatio
defaultn, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The construction of the Index has highlighted a serious lack of data in key domains and geograph
defaultical regions
default including Africa, the Middle Eas
defaultt and the Caribbean
default.
default 
defaultThe Index explores the difference between years lived in good 
defaulthealth and years lost through disability. Further work is needed on the collection of quality data on disability in later life.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrevalence and nature of disability in ageindefaultg populationsdefault&#xa0;default12default&#xa0; 
defaultAgeing is associated with a higher probability of living with a disability. 
defaultWorldwide, of nearly 810 
defaultmillion people aged 60 or over (11 per cent of the world’s population), 
defaultmore than 46 per cent live with disabilities. More than 250 million
default older people experience moderate to severe disability.
default 
defaultDisabled people are ageing, and disability in older age is a consequence of accumulated health risks across a lifespan of disease, injury and chronic illness. Key causes of old-age disability are vis
defaultual impairment, hearing loss, dementia and osteoarthritis.
default 
defaultWhile the link between ageing and impairment is 
defaultinevitable, there is a less direct
default link 
defaultbetween ageing and disability. The key factors that stop impairment becoming disability are access to healthc
defaultare and an enabling environment (
defaultsuch as appropriate 
defaulthousing, care
default and
default transport).
default 
defaultHowever, these interventions are often not available in low- and middle-income countries. As a result, many older people
default, even
default with impairments such as 
defaulthearing or eyesight
default problems 
defaultthat can be resolved at little cost
default,
default 
defaultare disabled.
default 
default13default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2011, the first-ever High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases recognised ageing as one of the four drivers of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are the leading cause of death and 
defaultdisability worldwide, in 2010 accounting for 34.5 million of the 52.8 million deaths worldwide, with 80 per cent of these deaths occurring in the poorest countries
default.
default Some 75 per cent of deaths from NCDs in low
default-
default and middle-income countries occur in people o
defaultver 60.
default The 2011 
defaultWorld report on disability
default reports that people with disabilities are at risk of premature ageing and those with developmental disabilities show signs of ageing in their 40s and 50s.
default 
default14default&#xa0; 
defaultOlder men and women in developing countries are more l
defaultikely to have a disability than those living in developed countries, with older women tending to have higher levels of disability. This may be partially explained by their having less access to healthcare over the life course. There are also significant ba
defaultrriers to accessing affordable and appropriate healthcare
default,
default even when health conditions can be managed at low cost and interventions would make significant differences to families and individuals. Currently there are more than 40 million older people in dev
defaulteloping countries with significant hearing impairment, 32.5 million with significant visual impairment from cataracts, and 39.8 million with significant visual impairment from refractive errors.
default15default&#xa0; 
defaultDementia is probably the greatest cause of years lost to dis
defaultability worldwide. 
defaultThe total number of new cases of dementia each year worldwide is nearly 
default7.7 million,
default equivalent to one new case every four seconds.
default 
defaultThe total number of people with dementia worldwide i
defaultn 2010 is estimated at 
default36
default million. The number is pro
defaultjected to nearly double every 20 years, to 
default6
default6 million in 2030 and 1
default1
default5 million in 2050. 
defaultCritically, by 2050, over 70 per cent of dementia cases will be in the developing world.
default16default&#xa0; 
defaultDisability incurs major costs to people and families
default, as well as
default health systems. The total estimated worldwide costs of dementia in 2010 were US$604 billion, approximately 1 per cent of global GDP. In developing countries, direct social care costs are small, 
defaultwith 
defaultcosts of informal care (unpaid care provided by the fami
defaultly) predominat
defaulting
default. Dementia is overwhelming not only for those that have it but also for their carers and families.
default&#xa0;defaultAge and disability in emergenciesdefault&#xa0;default17default&#xa0; 
defaultOlder people often make up a high proportion of
default 
defaultpeople
default living in displacement camps. For example, in Gu
defaultlu District, Northern Uganda, 65 per cent of people still living in displaced people’s camps in 2009 were aged over 60.
default In cris
defaulte
defaults, older women are subject to gender-based intimidation, including sexual violence and rape.
default18default&#xa0; 
defaultEven though older and disabled pe
defaultople make important contributions
default to their families and communities
default, their needs and capacities continue to be widely overlooked 
defaultat
default all stages of emergency responses. This was first highlighted in a 2010 review of the Con
defaultsolidated Appeals Process (CAP)
default. Th
defaulte review showed that fewer than 5 per cent of the projects proposed for rec
defaultent crises made any reference to older people as a vulnerable group. Fewer than 1 per cent of proposed projects and only 0.2 per cent of funded projects included activities targeted
default towards older people.
default Further research on humanitarian funding targeted at older people and people with disabilities in 2010 and 2011 showed similar results, with less than 1 per cent of humanitarian aid targeting these two groups.
