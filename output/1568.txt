[[[Written evidence submitted by Christopher Jessop (HOT14)]]]&#xa0;EXECUTIVE SUMMARYUK policy re “Heat” cannot be sensibly formulated unless it is co-ordinated from the start with policies relating to electricity generation and distribution; the UK cannot achieve its stated aims for Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction unless the electricity grid is in future operated for the public good rather than run for maximum profit.  Furthermore, unless better prices are offered for electricity exported by homes or businesses generating green electricity, more and more green electricity will end up being converted into heat, and not being “fed in”.  Biomass is probably best used as a petrochemical feedstock; any process which burns biomass and rejects significant quantities of waste heat should have its claimed carbon savings factored downwards.  All new houses should have solar hot water systems installed.  As ever, building fabric energy efficiency is the weakest link.&#xa0;&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
