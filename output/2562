[normal]Written evidence submitted by Barry Saltmarsh [OLS0046][bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to express my views on this topic of the very much needed move to protect minors from accessing inter
[normal]net sites with adult content, which could cause a warping of the mind
[normal] to the individual
[normal], in particular 
[normal]those who are young and impressionable, and who are the “Us” of tomorrow
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As a Christian and a believer on
[normal] the Lord Jesus I find it abhor
[normal]able that anyone should
[normal] be
[normal] link
[normal]ed,
[normal] 
[normal]or have anything to do with 
[normal]to such 
[normal]adult sites
[normal], and would like to support those wh
[normal]o would try to bring about a level of control to protect today’s youth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Surely with the technology available today there is an easy way to prevent minors from accessing adult content online.
[normal]Filtering out material such as child abuse 
[normal]and pornographic mate
[normal]rial 
[normal]would be a 
[normal]very 
[normal]welcome step, 
[normal]I
[normal] would 
[normal]suggest
[normal] defaul
[normal]t blocking of all adult material which would require authorisation to activate
[normal], as a standard setting on all internet devices sold in the UK.
[normal]This would provide a measure of safely to our young peopl
[normal]e, whom we are responsible for.  As it speaks in the Bible, The Lord says “But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
[normal] sea.”  Matthew 18:6.  
[normal]This would show the depth of feeling the Lord
[normal] Jesus has
[normal] for children.  
[normal]As a Christian nation we should bear in mind what we stand for, the ways 
[normal]and the life 
[normal]of Christ.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One welcomes the CO-OP’s decision, mentioned in the Telegraph 
[normal]on Monday 9
[normal]th
[normal] of September 2013, to remove 
[normal]unpackaged 
[normal]adult newspapers and magazines from their shelves to help to make their stores more family and children friendly; I look forward to many more
[normal] retailers
[normal] following suit.  Why should innocent persons be co
[normal]nfronted with indecent images whilst trying to lead a normal 
[normal]and 
[normal]respectable life style?
[normal]It is on us all, individually and as a whole to recognise the need of protection
[normal] for our young people
[normal].  
[normal]Whilst the internet has many benefits and is an incredible too
[normal]l, we would have to acknowledge it also has pitfalls and traps into which the innocent can fall.  Internet chat rooms also need some form of monitoring, to try to minimise the possibility of young people being snared by paedophiles and murderers. One does 
[normal]not have to look far to read of situations where every parent’s worst nightmare has come true.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst any move forward is better than none, I believe there needs to be a 
[normal]purge 
[normal]of all such pornography 
[normal]and other suchlike material 
[normal]online and am greatly encou
[normal]raged by David Cameron’s move to ask the internet search providers to look into 
[normal]an element of control on 
[normal]this.
[normal]For the good of the nation as a whole can we join in in support to help to protect our children and future generations and help control what inde
[normal]cent material minors have access to?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to point out two passages of Scripture which I feel fit in well with the whole issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Lord said “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery:  But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.”  Matthew 
[normal]chapter 5, verses 
[normal]2
[normal]7&amp;28
[normal].
[normal]“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.”  Revelation 
[normal]chapter 22 verse 
[normal]15
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To all who believe on the Lord Jesus and know that every word in the Bible is true, there 
[normal]can be no ignoring these words. A solemn warning to all
[normal],
[normal] that there will be, in the in the day of judgement, a just and right God who will judge us according to our pathway in this world.
[normal]In the book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2 verse 21 it reads
[normal] “and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved”, let us therefore rally together to find a way to try to rid, or at least limit the evil that there is available at the click of a button.
