defaultWritten evidence submitted by Barry Saltmarsh [OLS0046]default&#xa0;

defaultI would like to express my views on this topic of the very much needed move to protect minors from accessing inter
defaultnet sites with adult content, which could cause a warping of the mind
default to the individual
default, in particular 
defaultthose who are young and impressionable, and who are the “Us” of tomorrow
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a Christian and a believer on
default the Lord Jesus I find it abhor
defaultable that anyone should
default be
default link
defaulted,
default 
defaultor have anything to do with 
defaultto such 
defaultadult sites
default, and would like to support those wh
defaulto would try to bring about a level of control to protect today’s youth.
default&#xa0;
defaultSurely with the technology available today there is an easy way to prevent minors from accessing adult content online.
defaultFiltering out material such as child abuse 
defaultand pornographic mate
defaultrial 
defaultwould be a 
defaultvery 
defaultwelcome step, 
defaultI
default would 
defaultsuggest
default defaul
defaultt blocking of all adult material which would require authorisation to activate
default, as a standard setting on all internet devices sold in the UK.
defaultThis would provide a measure of safely to our young peopl
defaulte, whom we are responsible for.  As it speaks in the Bible, The Lord says “But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
default sea.”  Matthew 18:6.  
defaultThis would show the depth of feeling the Lord
default Jesus has
default for children.  
defaultAs a Christian nation we should bear in mind what we stand for, the ways 
defaultand the life 
defaultof Christ.
default&#xa0;
defaultOne welcomes the CO-OP’s decision, mentioned in the Telegraph 
defaulton Monday 9
defaultth
default of September 2013, to remove 
defaultunpackaged 
defaultadult newspapers and magazines from their shelves to help to make their stores more family and children friendly; I look forward to many more
default retailers
default following suit.  Why should innocent persons be co
defaultnfronted with indecent images whilst trying to lead a normal 
defaultand 
defaultrespectable life style?
defaultIt is on us all, individually and as a whole to recognise the need of protection
default for our young people
default.  
defaultWhilst the internet has many benefits and is an incredible too
defaultl, we would have to acknowledge it also has pitfalls and traps into which the innocent can fall.  Internet chat rooms also need some form of monitoring, to try to minimise the possibility of young people being snared by paedophiles and murderers. One does 
defaultnot have to look far to read of situations where every parent’s worst nightmare has come true.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst any move forward is better than none, I believe there needs to be a 
defaultpurge 
defaultof all such pornography 
defaultand other suchlike material 
defaultonline and am greatly encou
defaultraged by David Cameron’s move to ask the internet search providers to look into 
defaultan element of control on 
defaultthis.
defaultFor the good of the nation as a whole can we join in in support to help to protect our children and future generations and help control what inde
defaultcent material minors have access to?
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI would like to point out two passages of Scripture which I feel fit in well with the whole issue.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Lord said “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery:  But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.”  Matthew 
defaultchapter 5, verses 
default2
default7&amp;28
default.
default“For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.”  Revelation 
defaultchapter 22 verse 
default15
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo all who believe on the Lord Jesus and know that every word in the Bible is true, there 
defaultcan be no ignoring these words. A solemn warning to all
default,
default that there will be, in the in the day of judgement, a just and right God who will judge us according to our pathway in this world.
defaultIn the book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2 verse 21 it reads
default “and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved”, let us therefore rally together to find a way to try to rid, or at least limit the evil that there is available at the click of a button.
