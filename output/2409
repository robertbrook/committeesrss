defaultCivil defaultLegal Aid- the Secret defaultLegal defaultService?default&#xa0;
defaultLAG has found a disturbing reduction in the take-up of legal aid cases in civil law for the first quarte
defaultr of the current year, 2013/14.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 
defaultintroduced sweeping cuts to scope in legal aid from April this year. What LAG’s research shows is that for the cases which are still covered by legal aid there has been a large reduction in the take-up of legal aid services for these by public. We believe 
defaultthis has been caused by
default a combination of factors
default 
defaultincluding, 
defaultthe reduction
default 
defaultin the number of solicitors firms and charities, such as Citizens Advice Bureaux, offering legal aid
default, a perception amongst the
default 
defaultpublic 
defaultthat
default 
defaultthey can
default no
default-longer
default 
defaultget help with any civil law problems 
defaultand 
defaultthe failure by the government to adequately advertise the availability of services.
default&#xa0;
defaultDownward Trend in Casesdefault&#xa0;
defaultPrevious figures released by LAG show that the number of civil legal aid cases has been in decline over t
defaulthe last few years. It is in the social welfare law (SWL) category that the biggest falls have occurred. From just under half a million cases at their peak in 2009-10 the number of SWL cases had dropped to 293,319 last year.
default The following table breaks down
default the figures for legal help and certificated cases for the five categories of SWL-

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe reducing number of SWL cases is surprising given the continuing difficult economic outlook and the numbers of 
defaultcases reaching the courts and tribunals system. For example in the quarter ending 31
defaultst
default Dec 2012 there had been a 48% increase in the number of cases brought to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal.
default Citizens Advice has also reported increasing nu
defaultmbers of enquiries in the first three quarters of 2012/13. However, in the final quarter Bureaux capacity to deal with specialist cases was reduced as they prepared for the withdrawal of legal aid from much of SWL. 
default We believe the reduction in the numbers
default of cases since 2010 has been caused by changes to the system, such as the reduction in the numbers of cases legal aid firm are permitted to commence, rather than a decrease in the numbers of people needing assistance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe trend over the last few years 
defaultha
defaults been of concern, but the
default latest 
defaultfigures 
defaultfor the first quarter of the current year (outlined below) show that the take-up of legal aid services in common areas of 
defaultcivil 
defaultlaw has fallen off a cliff.
default&#xa0;
defaultFewer Cases than Predicteddefault&#xa0;

defaultThe above table refers to legal help cases. Legal help cases 
defaultinvolve
default initial advice and assistance to a client. Some cases go onto legal representation, but the bulk of cases referred to in this report remain at the legal help level. For example in 2012/13 there were 81,944 new matters started for legal help

default, but only 353 cases went on to the next level, civil representation.

default.

defaultA total of 3,866 less people than predicted received civil legal aid. 
defaultThis is a total shortfall defaultof 52%. default The shortfalls do vary between the 
defaultdifferent 
defaultcategories of law
default, with the lowest being 
defaultin education law 
defaultat
default 12%
default and the
default highest
default 
defaultbeing 
defaultin discrimination law 
defaultat
default 77%.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultLAG believes that the very large shortfall in discrimination law can be explained by the 100% reduction in the availability of legal aid for employment law cases. 
defaultIn the employment law category 
defaultthe government projected that 78% of cases
default,
default 
defaultout of a total of 24,000, 
defaultwould be taken from scope
default. T
defaulthe remaining 22
default% would be discrimination ones. However, m
defaultost discrimination law cases usually stem from a dispute in the workplace, but as no legal aid is ava
defaultilable for employment law advice people who have been discriminated against are less likely to seek help.
default Another factor in the low take-up of legal aid for discrimination
default,
default 
defaultas well as debt 
defaultcases
default,
default might also be the government’s decision to shift all initial
default enquiries onto 
defaultthe Civil Legal Advice (CLA) service which is an internet and telephone based 
defaultservice
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultLow take-up of defaultHousing defaultand Debt defaultCasesdefault&#xa0;
defaultLegal Aid is 
defaultstill 
defaultavailable for people in danger of losing their homes
default, homelessness cases and for some 
defaultdisrepair matters
default. Such cases can be covered by either the debt or housing law categories. 
defaultDebt legal aid contracts were mainly concentrated among advice charities such as Citizens Advice Bureaux. These have seen the biggest reduction in the number of lega
defaultl aid contract holders
default.
default According to
default the national charity,
default Citizen’s Advice
default,
default there are now only just over 30
default 
defaultof its 
defaultbureaux with legal aid contracts, down from a total of over 160 before the cuts were imposed in April.
default&#xa0;
defaultBirmingham CAB held one of the largest legal aid contracts in the not for profit sector. The service operates out of four offices in 
defaultBirmingham
default. Prior to April it employed 27 specialist caseworkers in debt and welfare benefits, but according to Emma Cook, 
defaultacting Chief Executive
default of the Bureaux, all 
defaultof 
defaultthese post holders 
defaulthave 
defaulthad to be made redundant or redeployed, “the loss of the £750,000 contract for legal aid meant a third of the service 
defaultwent
default from 31
defaultst
default March. These specialist services cannot be replaced b
defaulty volunteers.”
default&#xa0;
defaultRussell Conway, is an experienced housing law solicitor who recently won the Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year Award for his work in housing and other areas of social welfare law
default. He blames in part the unrelenting bad news on legal aid for the 
defaultreduction in cases, “the public are quite good at picking-up on the grim stuff”, but “find it difficult to know exactly what
default’
defaults happened.” He 
defaults
defaultays that “some local authorities and social landlords have been peddling the rumour that legal aid for housing cas
defaultes has been abolished completely
default. Some of my
default clients have been pleasantly surprised when 
defaultI’ve
default told them they can still get legal aid for their case.
default”
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultMany practitioners have told LAG they believe that there is a problem 
defaultover the 
defaultidentification of clients
default who are eligible for legal aid as the rules now are so complex.
default Vicky Ling is a management consultant and author of LAG’
defaults Legal Aid Handbook. 
defaultShe
default says that
default “the Legal Aid Agency is now so draconian in their audits that practitioners fear applying for lega
defaultl aid unless they are absolutely certain it will fall within the rules.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultWelfare benefits cases were cut by 100% from April, but 135 new cases were commenced in April, May and June this year. This is around 3% of the cases which were reported in the same
default period last year. 
defaultLAG believes that these cases are Higher Tribunal, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court cases which relate to an appeal on a point of law,
default&#xa0;
defaultOnly in family law does the number of cases exceed the projected number of cases significantly 
default(14%), but this could be due to a combination of the tapering effect and the greater number of firms still providing services
default, (from April there were 2227 family law legal aid contracts against 
default703 housing and debt contracts
default).
default&#xa0;
defaultLack of Marketingdefault&#xa0;
defaultPam Kenw
defaultorthy is the 
defaultLegal Director
default at the solicitors 
defaultfirm Howells LLP
default. The firm 
defaultwon one of the contracts for the telephone gateway service. 
defaultKenworthy
default believes that both lawyers and the public need to get the message that employment law discrimination cases are st
defaultill covered by legal aid. “The CLA providers would obviously like the Ministry of Justice to consider raising the profile of the service with stakeholders as it seems daft to have a service that no one knows about.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Legal Aid Practitioners Group 
default(LAPG) has expressed concerns to the government about the adequacy of the marketing of legal aid services, “we believe it has been inadequate
default and is some cases unfortunately misleading
default” says Carol Storer, LAPG Director, “the information which is available 
defaultdoes not provide clear guidance to the public about what is covered by legal aid.”
default&#xa0;
defaultExceptional Casesdefault&#xa0;
defaultAs part of the provisions in the LASPO Act the government int
defaultroduced a revamped exceptional funding
default rule to ensure people with cases out of scope c
defaultan
default get
default assistance if their human rights had been breached
default.
default 
defaultThe LAA had estimated that there would 5-7000 cases granted annually.
default&#xa0;
defaultF
defaultigures 
defaultfrom the LAA 
defaultreveal that there were only 233 applications for exceptional funding in 
defaultApril, May and June this year the first
default quarter of 
defaultoperation 
defaultfor
default the scheme.  Only two grants of exceptional funding 
defaultto clients 
defaulthave been made in non-inquest cases (funding for inquest cases was usually granted under the previous exceptional funding scheme). The Public Law Project 
default(PLP) 
defaulthas 
defaultexpressed concerns about these figures as they are very low compared to the original projections and there is evidence of poor quality decision making in the cases being rejected.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is difficult not to conclude that the LAA is being deliberately obstruc
defaulttive in not allowing many of the claims
default. The PLP talks of the “poor quality of decision-making” in the cases which it has seen and expresses concern about the low number of applicants who seek reviews of the decisions.
default&#xa0;
defaultLAG has spoken to many practitioner
defaults who are not prepared to apply for exceptional funding as they have no guarantee of payment for the work
default unless the application is suc
defaultc
defaultessful
default. 
defaultChris Johnson of the Community Law Partnership in 
defaultBirmingham
default has submitted a number of exceptional funding appli
defaultcations but
default says
default “we cannot afford to keep on doing this work pro-bono.”
default&#xa0;
defaultCivil Legal Aid under threatdefault&#xa0;defaultThe reduced take-up of civil legal aid has been caused by the combination of factors described above, dwindling numbers of firms and agencies 
defaultundertaking legal
default aid
default, increased bureaucratic hurdl
defaultes before legal aid is granted 
defaultand a low profile, caused by lack of marketing and a public perception that legal aid is no-longer available for civil cases. Either by accident or design
default,
default the government see
defaultms to be presiding over a secret legal service
default. The fear is if nothing is done to increase the take-up of civil legal aid
default,
default the remaining services will wither away as the lack of use will be used to justify their loss.
default&#xa0;
defaultLAG calls on the government to increa
defaultse the profile of civil legal aid services 
defaultthrough better marketing via
default the web and other channels. We are also calling for an urgent review of the exceptional funding mechanism as it is clearly not providing the human rights safety net it was intended to.
