[[[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[THE EXTENT OF WHITE W]]]

[[[ORKING CLASS PUPILS’ EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT]]]:&#xa0;Pre-2013 data show that White British pupils do less well than their peers in Leicester and are over-represented amongst pupils falling in the lowest 20% performance band for the LA, with increasingly more FSM pupils represented (2010 - 23%, 2011-26%, 2012-27%) than non-FSM. In 2013 fewer disadvantaged White British pupils were at a good level of development in all prime areas plus literacy and maths (25%) than their non-disadvantaged peers (35.1%).&#xa0;&#xa0;

In 2012 the percentage of Key Stage 1 White British boys eligible for free school meals (FSM) who attained level 2b or above was 61% for reading, compared to 74% locally or 76% nationally (15% gap). The corresponding figure for writing was 42% compared to 62% locally and 64% nationally (22%) gap. In mathematics 67% of FSM White British boys attained level 2b or above compared to the LA average of 74% and the national figure of 76% (9% gap) as shown in Figure One. Although these outcomes mark a closing of the gap on previous performance, White British disadvantaged boys perform below their peers and below the outcomes for White British girls except in mathematics. ‘Low outcomes at the end of Key Stage 1 influence attainment outcomes at the end of subsequent key stages.’ (S.Welford, Education Performance Summary, 2012).Five-year performance data outlining the percentage of pupils achieving expected progress in reading, writing and mathematics shows White British boys performing consistently below the LA average and below girls in reading and writing although narrowing the gap in 2013. In mathematics White British boys have shown an upwards trajectory, narrowing the gap with LA averages and performing better than girls. Progress outcomes for the White British disadvantaged group as a whole over a five year period show consistently lower performance than their non-disadvantaged peers and the LA averages in reading, writing and maths as shown in Figures Two, Three and Four.

The five year trend of the performance in reading, writing and maths from 2009-13 shows a consistent gap in performance between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged White British pupils overall. In 2013 the gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged White British pupils was 16% for reading, 17% for writing and 15% for Maths. In 2012 84% of FSM White British boys made expected progress in English compared to 89% of pupils nationally. Although this was an improvement on last year’s progress in English for FSM pupils (73%), it still fell short of the LA percentage of 91% and the FSM White British girls’ percentage of 88% (Figure Five). Equally, White disadvantaged boys perform less well than their peers nationally for Level 4+ in English and Maths. Therefore, when the White British group is considered as a whole, both girls and boys perform less well than their peers nationally and boys perform less well than girls overall (S.Welford, Education Performance Summary, 2012).

[[[                                                                                ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;                                                        Source: RAISEonline at 10 September 201In 2012 there was a notable difference between the percentage of WWC boys on FSM making expected progress in English (41%) when compared to their peers (70%) and to national (67%) and local (71%) percentages. White working class girls’ expected progress in English in 2012 (57%) equally fell short of that of their peers (81%) and of local and national percentages. In Maths, the percentages for expected progress were of even greater concern with only 37% of White British boys eligible for FSM making expected progress compared to 58% of non-disadvantaged boys and 62% of pupils at LA level and 68% of pupils nationally. For White girls in receipt of FSM the figure was 41%.&#xa0;&#xa0;The gap in attainment increases across the Key stages and by 19 it is significant. Prior attainment at Key Stage 4 impacts on student performance at Key stage 5. At Key Stage 5 females attain consistently better than males and White British males are amongst the groups that consistently perform less well. For one very large group of Leicester young people – White boys – almost one half fail to attain Level Two by age 19 after five years of secondary education and, for many, a further three years in post-16 education and training The future for these under-attaining groups is bleak, risking unemployment and low paid work.( A.Suddaby, The Leicester 13-19 Partnership board,19 January 2012).&#xa0;Students will not improve their attainment if they are not participating in the education and training system available. In August 2013 13.2% of White British students were NEET. Such pupils who already had low attainment at Key Stage 4 will fall further behind peers the longer they remain NEET (A.Suddaby, 2012).&#xa0;Different progression and repetition rates are exhibited by different ethnic groups which impact on their attainment at 19. 90% of Asian females who attain level 2 at 16 progress directly to a level 3 qualification whereas only approximately 50% of White males do so. Instead, a higher number of White males repeat level 2 qualifications post-16 (most often by studying a vocational qualification), delaying their entry to level 3 and  thus  reducing the potential of attaining this level by the age of 19 (A.Suddaby, 2012 - see Figure Six). Two thirds of Asian females who attain Level One at 16 progress to Level Two.  Conversely, only about 20% (one in five) White males make this progression, with four out of five remaining at Level One (A.Suddaby, 2012).

Non-attendance at school either by choice or because of exclusions will impact on learning and subsequently on attainment. Exclusions data for the White group of which White British is a large subset shows that generally this group is more likely to be excluded from school than other ethnicities. 2012 to 2013 data shows that, of the population of pupils excluded from school, boys are more likely to be excluded whatever the ethnicity and White female FSM have higher numbers of exclusions when compared to all other ethnicities’ cumulative data.              It is no coincidence that the lowest performing schools in Leicester are in the west of Leicester.&#xa0;&#xa0;
