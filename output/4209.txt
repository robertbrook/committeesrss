[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) would like to thank the committee for the invitation to make a written submission on the issue of plastic bags.

[[[&#xa0;]]]2. The NFRN is one of Europe’s largest trade associations, representing over 16,000 fee paying members from approximately 18,000 independent newsagents and convenience stores across the UK, Channel Islands and the Republic of Ireland. We are a membership led organisation that is democratically structured; policy is made by annual conference and its implementation is overseen by National Council.&#xa0;3. The NFRN assists the independent retailer to compete more effectively in today’s highly competitive market through the provision of practical help and assistance, commercial support, deals and buying opportunities, training, expertise and services. It also represents its members’ interests at governmental and parliamentary level, as well as within the news and magazine industry. &#xa0;

[[[General Remarks]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4. The NFRN welcomed the announcement by the government that it would introduce in England a 5p levy on single-use plastic carrier bags in 2015.&#xa0;5. We support the policy in light of the benefits it can bring to the environment, local communities and businesses.&#xa0;6. Therefore we were disappointed to learn that the government intends to exclude small retailers from the levy as our members will not be able to participate or share in the benefits of scheme.&#xa0;7. The NFRN has written to the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, asking him to consider the inclusion of small businesses in the scheme.&#xa0;8. In its response to this inquiry, the NFRN’s submission will mostly focus on the two following terms of reference:&#xa0;- The likely change in the number of bags discarded and any benefits for biodiversity and the environment.&#xa0;- Any social or economic impacts of the proposed bag levy, for example on affordability for particular households or businesses. &#xa0;

[[[Declaration of Interest]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]9. The NFRN does not have any links with the packaging industry other than through its members who purchase carrier bags to distribute to its customers as required.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The likely change in the number of bags discarded and any benefits for biodiversity and the environment]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]10. The Republic of Ireland introduced a plastic bag levy back in 2002 with an initial charge of 15 cents being applied. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]11. A levy on single use plastic carrier bags has already been implemented in parts of the UK, with Scotland expected to follow from October 2014.&#xa0;12. In Northern Ireland, a 5p levy was introduced in April 2013 which covered the use of plastic, paper and starch bags. The proceeds from this charge are payable to the Northern Ireland government and are used to help communities, charities, businesses, schools and voluntary organisations. &#xa0;13. The policy was adopted in Wales in October 2011 with the 5p charge also being applied to plastic, paper and starch bags. The proceeds are then passed on to good causes (preferably environmental charities).&#xa0;14. Based on evidence from these examples, it is likely that England will see a reduction in the number of single-use bags used.&#xa0;15. In August 2013, it was approximated that plastic bag use had fallen by 80% in Northern Ireland since the introduction of the charge. Whilst 300 million carrier bags were used in Northern Ireland in 2012, only 17.5 million had been distributed between April and June 2013 and figures from the supermarkets “suggested a possible annual reduction of more than 80% in those stores”. &#xa0;16. A noticeable drop has also been found in Wales, with a sample of food retailers reporting that they had seen a reduction of up to 96%. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]17. This reduction in usage across the UK is likely to result in environmental benefits. Taking Wales as an example, prior to the implementation of the levy, 350 million carrier bags were used during the 2009-2010 period. &#xa0;18. As these bags can take 500-1000 years to break down in landfill and 3.4 plastic bags have previously been found in every kilogram of litter in Wales, there should be a noticeable benefit to the environment if the policy is introduced in England too.

[[[&#xa0;]]]19. The NFRN considers that the levy is reliant on customers changing their habits regarding plastic bag usage, in order for it to be of benefit to the environment. We argue that this will only happen if the levy is applied to 

[[[all ]]]shops, including small businesses such as of those of our members. Therefore we encourage the government to extend the levy to include them.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Any social or economic impacts of the proposed bag levy, for example on affordability for particular households or businesses]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]20. The NFRN feels that there are a number of social and economic impacts of the policy which is why it has asked Nick Clegg to consider the inclusion of small businesses in the scheme. Aside from the potential environmental benefits, participation in such a scheme is likely to help small independent news and convenience retailers financially.&#xa0;21. This is because a plastic bag levy is likely to reduce the volume of plastic bags that customers use. This in turn decreases the number of bags the retailer has to purchase resulting in savings for the business.

[[[&#xa0;]]]22. This theory is supported by evidence from Wales. Retailers have been vocal that the decline has reduced costs for the retailers, with one declaring that it was “saving us a fortune”. &#xa0;23. As long as the scheme is simple to administer and not overly burdensome for the independent retailers, we feel that participation in the levy would bring financial benefits to the independent retail sector. &#xa0;24. Benefits of inclusion in the scheme extend beyond financial to social impacts. For example, in models where retailers are able to choose the charities they donate funds to, it gives businesses the opportunity to contribute local campaigns and charities, reinforcing the retailer’s position in the heart of their community. &#xa0;25. Furthermore, local charities and organisations would be major beneficiaries of the scheme, as money generated from the levy would remain in the local area. &#xa0;26. This claim is supported by evidence. A recent report highlighted several examples of retailers in Wales who were donating the proceeds to local causes, including Chris Ward who has donated to PATCH (Pembrokeshire Action to Combat Hardship) and the Air Ambulance in West Wales.&#xa0;27. We would encourage that the system to be implemented in England allows retailers to donate to the causes they feel should be prioritised in their local area.&#xa0;9 December 2013&#xa0; http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/carrier-bag-levy  http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/consumers/proceeds/?lang=en  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-23794647  http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2189273/wales-plastic-bag-charge-yields-massive-green-savings  http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/consumers/?lang=en &#xa0;&#xa0;
