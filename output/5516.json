"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Institute Of Fisheries Management&#xa0;&#xa0;Executive Summary &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;\nThe Institute of Fisheries Management (IFM) is an international organisation of people sharing a common interest in the modern management of recreational and commercial fisheries.\n \nCreated in 1969 in the UK, the IFM is dedicated to the advancement of sustainable fisheries management in all its forms. It is a non-profit making organisation controlled by the membership and governed by an elected council. Members are drawn from professional fisheries managers, regulatory and research bodies, fishing and angling organisations, water companies, fish farms and private individuals whose interests in fisheries are represented at many levels within government and conservation bodies.\n&#xa0;\nThe Institute, in partnership with a number of other UK institutes and societies concerned with the environment, is one of the Constituent Bodies of the Society for the Environment.  The Society\n \nhas a Royal Charter and is empowered to award the qualification of Chartered Environmentalist.\n&#xa0;\nOriginally associated with freshwater and migratory fisheries\n in the main\n, the IFM has more recently begun to focus to a greater degree on estuarine and marine fisheries management as well, and is now establishing a number of positions in this field. These are :- \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe IFM \nresponded to the Defra consultation in March 2013 on Marine Conservation Zones. We welcome the opportunity to provide written evidence to this Inquiry. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn summary, The IFM strongly supports the first tranche of designations.\n We believe that there are lessons to be learnt, that can now be put to good use. \nSustainable management and development must be built around accessible robust science operating at the heart of open and frank negotiations, followed by rigorous post-project appraisal with active lesson uptake.  The Institute has a wealth of experience in this field. We look forward to positive engagement in MCZ development in the future. We hope you have found our comments helpful.\n&#xa0;\n27 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
