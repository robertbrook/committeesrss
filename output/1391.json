"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Ethical Medicines Industry Group (EMIG) (RAD004)1.0              Introduction1.1              \nThe Ethical Medicines Industry Group (EMIG) welcomes this opportunity to \nsubmit to the Science and Technology Committee inquiry into \nResearch and Development Funding for Science and Te\nchnology in the UK\n. \n1.2              EMIG is the research based biopharmaceutical trade association that represents the interests of over 200 companies and o\nrganisations based in the UK. Our members range from start-ups, whose prime focus is often research and development (R&amp;D), to highly developed businesses delivering essential products to patients and the NHS. They are commonly, but not exclusively, small t\no medium-sized enterprise\ns (SMEs). Less than 20% of our m\nembers are rep\nresented by other trade bodies.\n&#xa0;\n1.3              The UK life sciences industry provides vital medicines to patients, is at the forefront of medical innovation and is a significant contributor to \nthe UK economy.  SMEs constitute approximately 90% of the total number of biopharmaceutical companies and it is estimated that 80% of innovation is derived from these small companies. EMIG member companies employ approximately 20,000 people in the UK and h\nave a combined annual turnover of £4\n \nb\nillio\nn.\n&#xa0;\n1.4              EMIG would be delighted to give oral evidence to the Select Committee if it would be valuable or if any of the points in this submission require further detail. \n&#xa0;2.0              National Audit Office (NAO) review of Research and Development funding for science and technology in the UK&#xa0;2.1              \nThe National Audit Office’s (NAO) report highlights the significant spend of t\nhe UK pharmaceuticals sector\n on R&amp;D and \nits contribution \nas a ‘key driver to innovation in the UK’. \nHo\nwever, EMIG shares the NAO’s concerns that the sector is heavily dependent upon two large pharmaceutical companies\n, \nGlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca\n. It is imperative the life sciences industry is able to continue to grow and contribute to th\ne UK economy bu\nt to continue to do so by relying sp\necifically \non \nthese two major companies, is deemed, quite rightly, risky.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2              \nIt is therefore vital that the UK fosters a regulatory, fiscal and commercial environment which enables a new generation of companies to become significant R&amp;D funders. SMEs in the sector \nare particularly exposed to the current economic downturn and the un\ncertainty caused by the current domestic environment. However, SMEs are essential to the economy as when they launch new products, they grow organically and additionally outsource many of their service requirements, stimulating a hinterland of service comp\nanies that contribute to employment and the economy. \n&#xa0;\n2.3              \nAs SMEs\n typically lack the resources required to conduct all\n \nthe necessary steps, from basic research to marketing, \nthey\n tend to focus their R&amp;D in a\n well-defined and narrow field, for example specific indications or pharmaceutical formulations. They also, therefore, frequently out-license or sell their innovations to larger companies. Currently, approximately 25 per cent of the molecules in the develo\npment portfolios of large pharmaceutical companies have been acquired from other comp\nanies, many of which are SMEs. \nIt is therefore critical that specific measures to nourish and support these companies and their associates are recognised and implemented.\n&#xa0;\n2.4              \n              \nEMIG welcomes the support for the sector \nthrough measure\ns contained in the Life Sciences Strategy and recent funding for initiatives including the Specialised Services Commissioning Innovation Fund and the \nBiomedical Catalyst Fund\n. \nThe Government has\n also made important strides in fostering a more positive tax environment for the life sciences industry in the UK. Over the last 24 months there have been some welcome changes, in particular, the reduction in business tax rates, the introduction of the Pa\ntent Box, R&amp;D above the line tax credits and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) and changes to Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI). However, we believe the following areas require further consideration: \n&#xa0;\n2.5              \nThe NAO’s report separates\n \nspending by independent SMEs,\n those\n which are not part of a larger enterprise group, \nfrom overall SME spend. EMIG is concerned that the \nreport \nappears to denigrate \nthose SMEs who are R&amp;D investors but happen to \nbe a UK affiliate of a larger global enterprise\n from those which are ‘\nhome grown\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\n If so, this\n risks devaluing the importance of attracting \ninward investment\n. EMIG believes b\noth \nindependent\n and UK affiliate SME funders are important to the nation's econom\ny.\n&#xa0;\n3.1&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSuggestions for future Committee inquiries&#xa0;\n3.1              \n              \nIn light of our comments above, EMIG suggests the following \nfor future Committee inquiries on UK R&amp;D funding\n;\nLooking specifically at:\nLooking specifically at:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;August 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
