"Written evidence submitted by the Prison Reform Trust (JRR 0030)&#xa0;\n1) The \nPrison Reform Trust works to create a fair and decent prison system. We do \nthis by looking at how a prison is working, giving information to prisoners, staff and people outside and by asking the government and officials to make changes. We welcome the work the Parole Board is doing to make the process clearer and fairer and the c\nhance to response to this consultation. Alongside our media, research and policy work, we have an advice and information service that deals with over 5,000 queries from prisoners a year.  We do not give legal advice or \nrepresent\n in court and therefore we h\nave not given detailed answers to the consultation questions. However, we answer general queries on the legal process \nfrom\n people in prison, and monitor the impact of any potential changes and we therefore wanted to take the opportunity to raise some concerns.\n&#xa0;\nBackground&#xa0;\n2) \nAc\nc\ness \nto the legal process, including\n j\nudicial review\n,\n is particularly\n important to prisoners\n becaus\ne their\n lives are\n almost\n completely regulated \nb\ny \nthe\n \nstate. \nPrisoner\ns\n’\n \nfundamental\n rights cannot be \nsafeguarded\n without\n an accessible\n legal system. We are \ntherefore \nextremely\n \nconcerned\n about the \ngovernment\n’\ns\n \njudicial\n review \nproposals\n. \nIf enacted\n,\n \nthey will\n \nm\nake it more \ndifficult and more expen\nsive to take a judicial review. I\nt will be almost impossible to hold\n the \ngovernment\n \ndecisions \nto account\n, particularly for people from vulnerable groups who already have \ndifficulties\n accessing justice. \nIt will deter \nge\nnuine claimants\n from seeking \nredress\n. It will \nlimit\n access to justice to \nthose\n who have the means to pay\n.  \n&#xa0;\n3) It is difficult to predict \nexactly\n how the proposals\n will \nimpact\n on \nprisoners’ convention rights\n \nbut\n we \nhave\n \nparticular\n \nconcerns\n about \narticle\n 8, article 3 and \narticle\n 14 \nrights\n, which we \nbelieve \nare in \ngrave danger of being breached. It is also foreseeable that \nrights under articles \n2, 9, \n10 \nand 12 may\n be affected. \n&#xa0;\n4) \nOverall\n, we \nare \nconcerned\n \na\nbout the cumulative impact of \nthese \nproposals\n on\n people living in \nunder\n \nresourced and\n \npressurised\n prison\ns. \nWe are already seeing \ndeterioration\n in conditions and treatment and have concerns about the needs of minority groups in prison and outcomes for them. \nThis, alongside a lack\n of access to \nlegal\n aid a\nnd \na \nreduction in \naccess to \njudicial review\n,\n is extremely concerning.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Standing and third party intervention5) \nThere is already a test for who can bring judicial \nreview\n cases. All claimants have to show that they have ‘sufficient interest’ in the matter.  We do not \nbelieve\n that\n cases brought by charities, NGOs and interest groups should be classified as having no direct interest. \nCharities\n have a right to \nrepresent\n their\n \nbeneficiaries\n,\n \nparticularly\n when they are \nvulnerable groups who may not be \nable\n to \nrepresent\n themselves. \nPrisoners are a group of people that fin\nd\n it extremely difficult to access information and the means to take legal \naction.\n&#xa0;\n6) \nWe are also concerned \nthat particularly vulnerable groups in prison\n,\n such \nas those\n with a learning disability, the severely mentally \nill\n \nand \nforeign\n national prisoner\ns, and children\n,\n will be particularly disadvantaged. \nWe are concerned about the implications \nfor these people \nwho\n are \noften \nunable to access justice\n.\n&#xa0;\n7) \nAt \nthe\n moment\n third parties\n can \ninterve\nn\ne\n in cases where they have expertise\n and the court gives \npermission\n. \nI\nntervention from \ngroups\n with expertise in th\ne\n needs \nof the groups \nthey are working for can\n \nassist\n in \na\nvoiding breac\nhing \narticle\n 3 and \narticle\n 14 and help to make better policy.\n&#xa0;\n8) \nMany people\n who are\n directly impacted by prison service \npolicies\n are unable\n to make\n, or intimidated \nabout taking\n a complaint or \na case themselves. \nPrison\n is a \nspecifically\n coercive \nenvironment\n and the loss of autonomy and liberty can create \nsituations\n where people are \nafraid\n \nto take\n action. HMIP’s inspection evidence suggests that the prisoner complaints system cannot be consisten\ntly relied on. In their\n surveys last year, 1\n3% of \nprisoners said\n it was hard to make a complaint, two thirds of those who did so felt it had not been sorted out fairly and nearly one in \nfive said\n they had been prevented from making a complaint.\n People in prison may not take cases \nforward because\n of \nfear\n of retribution or \nrepercussions\n from a system or from \npeople\n \nwho\n \nhave\n \nalmost\n \ntotal\n control \nof their lives. \nIn addition\n,\n people who have very genuine grievances may not be able to \ntake\n cases because  of\n a\n lack of access to advice, solicitors, knowledge of rights, no automatic information \nabout prison life,\n \nlimited \naccess to phones or writing materials and\n little\n time\n and \nopportunity\n to find out about their rights. \n&#xa0;\n9) \nS\nometimes\n \nthird\n party \ngroups\n take action when the \nindividuals\n are unable to. This has\n previously\n included \ncases of \nremoval\n from the UK. \nThis can mean that \npolicies\n are changed before the\ny \ndamage\n \nvulnerable\n \nindividuals\n. \nThese \nproposals fetter\n \njudge\ns\n’\n \ndiscretion\n and are unnecessary. It\n is \nalso\n unclear how an \norganisation\n might prove they have standing. \nA\ns we have outlined above, m\nany prisoners will be \ndeterred\n from taking their ca\nse forward. A\n \nproportion\n of prisoners \nwill not be \ndeterred\n,\n however, and \nwill take cases forward themselves\n and possibly on behalf of groups of other prisoners. \n \nImportant\n cases may be \nlost\n (by \nprisoners\n \nlitigating\n in \nperson\n) \nbecause\n they have not be\nen able\n to \nprepare\n adequately.\n \nSolicitors\n \nfulfil\n a service by advising people when their cases are \nweak\n and \nunlik\nely\n to \nhave\n merit or be granted \npermission\n for \njudicial\n review. \nWithout this safeguard \nin \nthe system the courts may find \ntheir workload increases and the time taken for cases is longer.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Costs 10) \nThe \nproposed\n changes \nwould\n mean that many\n \ncharities\n \nand community groups \nwould not be able to access the court. \nThis\n \nwould\n weight the justice \nsystem\n in \nfavour\n of those with assets and finances. In the \nmajority\n \no\nf \ncases,\n \nch\narities\n \nwould\n not be able \nto\n \nbring\n a claim with a protective costs order.\n Costs for t\nhird party interveners \nmake intervening a \nrisky\n \nprospect\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Public sector equality duty11) \nIt is currently\n \nagainst th\ne law for the prison to treat a \nprisoner\n \nless favorably because of their race, \ng\nender,\n disability\n \nsexual \norientation\n, \nreligion\n or belief\n. \nEveryone in prison should have equal access to facilities, including jobs, education, library services, exercise and accommodation.\n \nHowever, we know that \ndespite\n \ncurrent\n \nprotectio\nns\n in law, the \noutcomes\n for many groups \nwith protected characteristics \nare\n \nless f\navo\nu\nrable\n. \nWe are extremely \nconcerned\n abut the \ndifferent\n \ngovernment\n \nproposals\n that seek to erode \nthis\n duty. \nWe note that black and \nminority\n ethnic prisoners, Muslim \nprisoners\n and \nyoung prisoners\n consistently report worse \nexperiences\n of prison and treatment in \nHMIP\n reports. We also note that the \nmajority\n of the 11 \ntreatment\n case\ns\n granted legal aid last year were for \nconditions\n for people with a \nlearning\n \ndisability\n or mental health \ndifficulty.\n \nNumerous \nreports\n and \nresearch\n identify tha\nt \nthe \nPrison\n Service\n, \ndespite some positive practice and sometimes considerable\n \nefforts\n,\n is \nfailing\n to \nmee\nt\n \nsufficient\n outcomes for many disadvantaged \ngroups\n including, older\n people with \nmobility\n or care needs\n, and\n \npeople\n who are \nphysically\n \ndisabled or hav\ne\n sensory \nimpairments.\n  We are therefore \nconcerned\n that article 3 and article 14 \nrights\n will be \nfurther breached\n without this protection.\n&#xa0;\nCombined effect of these proposals and legal aid proposals &#xa0;\nEligibility for legal aid12) \nThe \ngovernment’s\n reforms to legal aid will mean\n that only matters \nspecific\n to the \ndecision\n \nto\n \ndetain\n will be funded \nand \nthat \nother prison \nmatters\n will not be eligible. Many aspect\ns\n of a \nprison\n sentence have an \nimpact\n on \nrelease\n and ongoing detention,\n \nparticularly\n \ndiscretionary\n \nrelease\n under parole or home \ndetention\n curfew. Without legal aid to cover risk \nassessment\ns\n, \naccess to \noffending\n \nbehaviou\nr courses, recategorisation reviews and pre tariff parole \nhearings\n,\n people are likely to stay in prison in longer. \nWe beli\neve this has implications for article 5.\n&#xa0;\n13) \nRegarding treatment cases with limited access to judicial review and no access to legal aid t\nhe most extreme \nsituations\n are when survivors of torture, children or people with very \nserious mental health\n problems \na\nre concerned. \nThis could engage prisoners\n’\n article 3 rights. \n&#xa0;\nResidence Test for legal aid14) We are \nextremely\n \nconcerned\n that \npeople\n will not be able to access \nlegal\n aid if they cannot \nfulfil\n the residence tes\nt. It \ncan\n be extremely \ndifficult\n f\nor \npeople\n \nin prison to access immigration advice and renew their visas or regularise their stay. \nMany people’s immigration status wil\nl\n change while they are in prison. This could impact on article 3, article 5, article 8 and article 14 rights.\n&#xa0;\n15) \nThese proposals potentially impact disadvantageously on all prisoners. \nWe would ask the committee to have \nparticular\n regard to the needs of the following groups of people and \nwhose \nrights may be impacted by the \nproposals\n:\ntrafficked persons who have entere\nd prison because of coercion into criminal activity; people with severe lea\nr\nning disability or mental health difficul\nties, people with dementia or\n brain injury living in prisons; Muslim prisoners, children and young people in prisons and indeterminate sent\nenced prisoners\n.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n"
