"&#xa0;\nWritten Submission from the RSPBDecember 2013About the RSPB The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (the RSPB) is the largest wildlife conservation organisation in Europe with over one million members. We believe that sustainability should be at the heart of decision-making. The RSPB’s policy and practical wo\nrk covers a wide range of issues including \nagriculture\n, \nwater\n,\n \nclimate change, energy, \nplanning  and \nmarine issues. \nWe also manage one of the largest conservation estates in the UK, covering c.143, 000 hectares. Around sixty of our reserves are farmed, co\nvering more than 20,000 hectares, with around 170 tenant farmers, and 200 employees. We protect and enhance habitats such as lowland farmland, heather moorland, lowland heath, wet grassland, estuaries and reed beds, and our reserves help to protect 63 of t\nhe 77 most rare or threatened breeding birds in the UK. \nSummaryFood security is an issue in the UK, not because there is a lack of food\n \nbut because of poverty and inequality.  In the long-term, food security ultimately depends on maintaining the productive capacity of agriculture and \ntherefore \nis inherently linked to the concept of sustainability. One of the major threats to future food se\ncurity is the unsustainable nature of the current global food system. \nEnvironmental\n degradation \npresents a real threat to the UK’s food security because\n it undermines th\ne UK’s ability to produce food.\n1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK (and EU) food security would best be improved by a complete overhaul of the current \nagriculture and food \npolicy framework\n to ensure its long term sustainability\n. \nA series of high level reports have highlighted the nee\nd for \na transition to a more sustainable agricultural model\n. \nThe current \nsystem\n \nreceives\n high levels of \npublic \nsupport \nbut fails to\n work \nin the public interest\n.\n \nThe\n Natural Capital Committee recently highlighted that \nthe UK’s \nnatural capital assets are \nin decline at an unprecedented rate\n. \nT\nhese assets underpin long term productivity. \nUrgent a\nction is needed t\no shift \nthe\n production model on to a more sustainable footing.\n \n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment should build on the findings of the National Ecosystem Assessment and re\ncognise that agriculture should be appropriate to the natural environment which underpins it\n. F\nood production is one of a suite of services that society needs from land and we should aim for the optimal balance between \nthis range of \nservices\n. F\nocussing \nsol\nely \non\n maximum food production\n and efficiency\n \ncould\n jeopardise the natural resources \nwhich underpin production\n.\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough it is clearly important to use resources efficiently to avoid waste, when \ndetermining the best approach to\n \nsecure long term production \ntargets\n efficiency must \nnot be the primary driver. \nE\nfficiency – based on extreme specialisation – \ncan result in decreased\n resilience\n within the farming system\n. \nInstead the\n overarching aim must b\ne\n to achieve sustainable food production to ensure \nlong term f\nood \nproduction\n. \n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn approach which considers only the \nefficiency\n of certain elements of the system could result in \napproaches\n which \nare\n fundamentally unsustainable in the long term\n,\n fail to make best use of the land in a given area\n \nn\nor\n deliver the greatest benefit for society\n and indeed could be more susceptible to failure \ndue to a lack of resilience\n \n(see discussion below)\n.\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no \nsingle \ncorrect approach to more sustainable agricultural system. \nFarms should ensure that the levels a\nnd type of production respect and operate within environmental limits, recognising and responding to the particular tensions with environment that exist in its location.\n There are a number of considerations which can help guide decisions. Any \nfarm\n \nwhich is\n seeking to be sustainable should aim to\n:\n enhance soil quality\n;\n protect and enhance carbon stores\n;\n \nenhance \nand \nsustain \nwildlife\n;\n utilise a variety of crop types and livestock breeds to maintain genetic diversity\n;\n minimise direct and indirect Greenhouse gas\n (GHG) emissions \n(\nin total terms and not just per unit of output including carbon sequestration and storage impacts\n)\n, eliminate pollution\n and adverse impacts on the \nwater environment\n and not compromise the ability of other countries to manage their own lan\nd sustainably.\n1.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA consideration of all these \nelements \nundoubtedly\n adds to the complexity of the task but will also ensure\n that we are investing in approaches which secure our natural resources and food security in the longer term\n. \n1.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to improving the sustainability of production \nthe\nre is a need to encourage the uptake of a\n more sustainable diet to make the best use of land and tackle the epidemic of diet related illness which afflicts those on western\n style \ndiets\n \n(\ncharacter\nise\nd\n by high intakes of red meat and dairy\n, sugary and high-fat foods, refined grains \nand \nprocessed meat\n)\n. \nThe predicted rise in demand for food – potentially doubling by 2050 - comes not primarily from increasing populations\n but\n from changing diets. The r\nise of the middle classes \nin countries such as \nChina and India will result in \na demand for \ndiets richer in \nmeat putting increased demand on the global food system\n.\n \nTo \nensure that the UK is leading the way in demonstrating integrated policy which recognise\ns the importance of sustainable consumption as part of solution to \nfood security g\novernment\n must take action to facilitate the uptake of more sustainable dietary choices.\n The recent green food project developed a set of principles for a sustainable diet\n which should be developed and communicated to highlight the\n importance of changing our diets for \nsociety’s\n health and that of the environment.  \n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf we are to achieve a sustainable fo\nod and farming system it is important that the price of food accurately reflects the costs of producing it\n and any public subsidies are \ntransparent and clear in their aims\n. The negative externalities of unsustainable production systems should be reflected \nin the price of food\n rather than being paid for elsewhere\n. \nAlongside a robust regulatory baseline t\nhis \nwill\n benefit sustainable producers\n,\n improv\ne\n our long term food security, increas\ne\n resilience through more diversity in farming systems and reduc\ne\n the lik\nelihood of extreme price fluctuations.  For example, the reliance of intensive livestock production in the UK on imported protein means these systems lack resilience and are vulnerable to increases in input prices\n.\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere\n is insufficient transparency and clarity about where the money goes to in the food and farming system, both in terms of money paid at the till and public funding\n and the impacts on the health of our \ncountryside. The\n complexity of the Common Agricultural Policy \nis \na barrier to understanding of the \nimpact of this\n policy \non the\n environment, while lack of transparency in the food supply chain makes choosing sustainable options difficult. The public’s ability to discrimin\nate between options in order to support more sustainable producers is made difficult\n.\n \nThe result of this is that the most\n sustainable  farmers are \ndisadvantaged\n. \nThere needs to be \nmuch greater transparency, awareness and accountability \nwithin the food sys\ntem to correct this imbalance.\n \n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is often a lack of clarity over \nwhere \nconsumers \nmoney goes \nwith\nin the food supply chain. An organic lamb can be sold in \nmajor\n retailers at £13.98/kg, but the farmer who produced it on the hills of a National Park, usin\ng no inputs and extensively reared, receives only £1.98/kg, often \nthe same as \nnon-organic \nproducers\n higher input systems. \nG\nreater transparency within the food \nsystem is needed \nto \nenable the public to better understand where their money is going by creating\n clear lines of accountability between producers, processors, retailers, shoppers and taxpayers. \nThis would provide clarity on which sectors get most 'value-added' down the food chain, and \nhelp ensure that a fair share of the cost of food\n flow\ns\n to the most\n sustainable primary growers and farmers.\n \n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no shortage of food in the UK today but there are people who are unable to eat a good diet as they are unable to afford it or access it. Producing more food at the expense of our environments health and \npotentially public health, is not a solution to this problem. The Marmot review\n into social-related health inequalities in England, ‘Fair Society, Healthy Lives’, sets out a framework for action to ensure social justice, health and sustainability are at t\nhe heart of all policies. Recommendations include promoting sustainable local communities, access to good quality green space and sustainable food production.\n3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment \nstatistics show that the UK is over 60% self-sufficient in food (or over 70% if you consider only the foods that can actually be grown here). By comparison, we were less than 50% self sufficient for much of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. So although \nthe UK is\n mo\nre self reliant than \nit was \nwe are still part of the global market and as such will be subject to the fluctuations which exist. \nThe UK can play a role in helping to reduce \nthe impact of these fluctuations \nby developing a more sustainable \nand resilient \nappr\noach to \nour domestic agricultural system and so reducing our reliance on imported \nfeedstocks\n and the exposure of our food and farming systems to ext\nernal shocks, be they economic, physical or \nenvironmental\n. \n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK should play a leading role in the interna\ntional policy debate to eliminate harmful policies such as those which result in \nbiofuels\n driving up commodity prices.\n \nF\nuture volatility will be connected to extreme weather events or shifts in growing conditions linked to climate change. \nTherefore f\nood \nsecurity policies will be increasingly \ndependant\n on international action to secure a global deal limiting dangerous climate change, and on domestic action to ensure sustainable adaptation to new climate conditions for agriculture in the UK.\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScience has an important role to play in developing a more sustainable \nand resilient \nagricultural system\n to ensure future UK food security\n. \nThe UK could take a leading role in developi\nng new models of sustainable agriculture which meet the need to produce enough to feed a growing population within environmental limits. In order to achieve this r\nesearch must take a \nbroad\n perspective and \nfully address \nthe environmental impacts as well as \nthe agronomic.\n \nCurrently there is an issue that research is \nsiloed\n and as such fails to take account of the \nmultifunctional nature of agriculture. \n \nResearch should focus on \nsustainable production methods which address both farm\n, \nfarming \nsystem and \nlandscape\n levels.\n It is vital that the use of any technology does not lead to further narrowing of the range of crops grown: diversity is key to ensuring resilience in the face of unpredictable change.\n \n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith regard to GM technology there may be potential f\nor GM crops which contribute to a more sustainable agricultural system however this has not been the focus of developments to date, indeed the predominant GM crops are those which facilitate the use of agr\no\nchemicals \nwhich can damage soil \nand do not encoura\nge integrated pest control. In \ndeveloping and implementing new research\n the following\n considerations should be taken into account:\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a need to improve the dissemination of research \nfindings through effective knowledge transfer systems to ensure that reaches farmers and to allow them to adapt their farming systems accordingly.\n5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe horsemeat scandal at the start of this year highlighted \nboth \nthe importan\nce\n of t\nransparen\ncy within \nsupply cha\nins, \nand the need for effective oversight. The ability to trace the provenance of food is key \nboth to \nmaintain\ning\n consumer trust\n and u\nnderstand\ning\n the environmental impact of a product\n.\n \nShorter more \ntransparent food\n chain\ns are\n essential \nto \ndevelop a better understanding of where the money goes within the food system for a range of products\n as discussed above\n. \nShorter supply chains would \nhelp enhance traceability and build trust, but also to allow environmentally friendly farming to be supported via more direct connections to markets.\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA better understanding of the true costs of production can help improve resilience in its broadest sense, \nthrough a better understanding of the weaknesses in the system. \nA more detailed exploration of the importance of resilience is given below.\n6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the UK clim\nate change is predicted to result in \nincreased temperatures and increased rainfall extremes, however it is not clear what this will mean for crop yields\n. I\nt is \nexpected \nthat \nthe \nUK \nwill\n remain food secure over the next 40 years\n. \nBuilding resilience \nin\nto the farming sector will be an important strategy to minimise both economic and output losses \ndue to extreme weather events\n. \n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhere is no consensus\n on a definition of resilience\n – the ability to absorb shock and, in some definitions the ability to change\n or reorganise as a response to such a shock\n is often cited\n. \nIt \nhas been described\n as the ability of social-ecological system\ns,\n both to withstand perturbations from\n,\n for instance\n,\n climate or economic shocks\n,\n and to rebuild and renew itself afterwards. Loss\n of resilience can cause loss of valuable ecosystem services\n.\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSociety and institutions often find it difficult to shift to more resilient models\n. The\nre are many reasons for this\n. T\nhe fact we work in hierarchies and silos\n \nmay make \nit difficult to understand the interconnections \nand potential benefits of different approaches.\n  \nIn agriculture, t\nhe \nuse of monocultures where diversity is denied in the pursuit of economies of scale \ncan make change difficult\n. \nAnother reason is the attract\nion \nof focusing\n on efficiency and \nshort term profit maximisation, this increases \nthe risk that economic models quickly buckle when stress is applied.\n Finally a failure\n to invest in appropriate infrastructure to underpin more resilient models\n can present a\nn\n obstacle\n. \n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to overcome these issues we need to \naccept \nthe complexity of systems and rather than seek to oversimplify them\n,\n \nbetter recognise the multiple benefits which are \ndelivered by \nsuch \nsystems\n,\n  e.g. sustaining \nbio\ndiversity, living within ec\nological boundaries\n and \n generating social capital. \n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor example \nUK agriculture’s \nincreasing specialisation into specific farming types, contraction of crop rotations, increased stocking density and reduction of genetic diversity have all had profound envi\nronmental impacts. They have also made the system more brittle in that\n:\n \n6.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne approach to address these problems is to look for down\n-\nstream fixes \neg\n \nbuild\ning new\n reservoirs and develop new pesticides and drugs. While \nsuch actions can be useful\n,\n a more cost effective approach may\n \nbe to seek to \naddress the fundamental risk of failure which could have devastating consequences in a highly specialised agricultural syst\nem.\n B\nuilding resilience through seeking alternative environmentally sustainable approaches\n,\n such as by\n extending crop rotations, us\ning integrated pest management and \nintroducing traditional bre\neds less reliant on inputs although more complex, \ncan \ndeliver a\n wider range of beneficial outcomes and reduce the potential impacts of extreme weather events\n.\n6.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInvestment in ever more efficient approaches without a proper assessment of alternative approaches can result in \nsector\n becoming ‘locked in’ to unsustainable a\npproaches and therefore being unable to deliver a broader range of benefit to society.\n7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the short term in the UK w\ne don’t need to increa\nse production\n,\n we need to make it more sustainable\n – environmentally, economically and socially\n.\n \nSimply pursuing increased production does not necessarily result in increased profit and is not good for farmers, society or the environment\n. \nWhat is vital is creating value - for society and for farm businesses \n- \nin sustainable ways. \nFood is not the only output from our agricultural \nsystem;\n \nthere are a\n range of other services that matter to us all, such as water quality, carbon storage, flood a\nlleviation, the landscape, recreation,\n employment, high\n animal welfare and wildlife\n habitats\n. But the market often fails to \ndistinguish between those \nproviding these wider benefits to society, \nand those who are not. Often farmers seeking to be more sustain\nable are unable \nt\no\n compete with those farming in a less sustainable way.\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \n£\n3bn \npublic funding for \nUK \nagriculture via t\nhe Common Agricultural Policy should be \nsupporting farmers to become more sustainable and rewarding them for the wider public goods the\ny produce\n. But only a tiny proportion of this expenditure represents good value for the public purse by being targeted to sustainable farmers. \n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreasing agricultural specialisation, driven by a narrow focus on efficiency\n,\n has resulted in polarisation \nof production and the loss of mixed, rotational farming that has underpinned good soil, crop and animal husbandry for centuries. Historically farms \nutilised\n rotations which build soil and circulate nutrients. \nMixed farms\n now find it difficult to compete wi\nth the extremely specialised arable and livestock systems as the benefits of mixed systems and the externalities (soil degradation, feed and nutrient imports) of intensive systems\n,\n are not reflected in our current economic model\n. This specialisation, conc\nentration on just a few major commodity crops and reliance on imported protein (the EU is already reliant on importing three-quarters of protein-rich feed) has left limited diversity, which combined with increasingly unpredictable extremes of weather, leav\nes food production vulnerable and lacking resilience.\n7.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnderstanding and encouraging such complexity in \nthe \nfarming \nsector \nrelies on skilled advisors. Too often the provision of advice is now left to those with vested interests and narrow specialities. \nIn o\nrder to support the shift to a more sustainable agricultural system a well informed, impartial advisory network is required.\n  \n7.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis shift \nshould \nbe underpinned by the infrastructure required for mixed, sustainable agriculture systems such as more small and\n medium sized abattoirs, to enable shorter chains and trustworthy traceability.\n8.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithin this submission we have referred to a number of \nactions\n we believe are requ\nired to support a thriving UK agricultural system. \nThese \ninclude better direction of support payments, investment in skills\n,\n training \nand advisory support \nto better equip the industry \nto pursue \na more sustainable approach and investment in infrastructure\n to underpin this shift. \n8.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA change in peoples eating habits to more sustainable diets as described above would also improve our self sufficiency. \nHowever reducing use of cereals and oilseeds in animal feed through less intensive livestock farming could mak\ne\n the UK\n more self-sufficient in these crops and would reduce reliance on imported protein. More sustainable diets would also benefit UK horticulture\n through increased demand for vegetables\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Foresight future of food \nhttp://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf\n&#xa0;\n IAASTD http://www.europarl.europa.eu/webnp/webdav/users/jribot/public/JCM%20Agriculture/IAASTD%20Report.pdf\n UNEP Avoiding future \nfarmines\n  \nhttp://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/avoidingfamines/\n&#xa0;\n The Natural Capital Committee http://www.defra.gov.uk/naturalcapitalcommittee/files/State-of-Natural-Capital-Report-2013.pdf\n PN\nAS Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture David Tilmana,1, Christian \nBalzerb\n, Jason \nHillc\n, and Belinda L. \nBeforta\n \nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/108/50/20260.abstrac\nt\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229537/pb14010-green-food-project-sustainable-consumption.pdf\n http://www.foe.co.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/livestock_impacts.pdf\n \nhttp://www.staticwhich.co.uk/documents/pdf/making-sustainable-food-choices-easier-which-report-231317.pdf\n&#xa0;\n http://www.instituteofhea\nlthequity.org/projects/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review\n \nhttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/t/r/UK.pdf\n The Stockholm Resilience Centre\n Hodgson.  Is resilience enough?   \n \nhttp://www.fcrn.org.uk/research-library/climate-change/effects/m\nanaging-land-changing-climate-%E2%80%93-adaptation-sub-committee-pr\n&#xa0;\n TEEB http://www.teebweb.org/our-publications/teeb-study-reports/ecological-and-economic-foundations/\n"
