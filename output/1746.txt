[[[Introduction]]]

[[[ ]]]1. This discussion note has been prepared in response to the call for evidence by the Transport Committee Inquiry into Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities (SCA 21/2013-14, 27th June 2013)&#xa0;2. I am a Parish Councillor for Cropwell Bishop, a village with a population of around 2000 people located about 8 miles South East of Nottingham City.  Adjacent smaller villages extend into the Vale of Belvoir.  This note reflects the growing concerns and isolation felt by local people due to inadequate public transport provision.  I am a Chartered Civil Engineer (recently retired) and the comments reflect my personal perspective and frustrations as a resident of Cropwell Bishop and a commuter to Nottingham for the last 20 years. The proposals have the support and backing of the Cropwell Bishop Parish Council.&#xa0;

[[[Summary]]] 3. Bus services in village communities such as Cropwell Bishop are inadequate.  The village is just 8 miles from Nottingham but the population of around 2000 people is disadvantaged because there is no direct commuter service and no evening services connecting with the city or other local communities.&#xa0;4. Local authorities have reduced funds available to help subsidise bus services in less populated areas. Commercial operators have little interest in less profitable semi rural services but are generally making healthy profits from their core routes. Sometimes 2 or more operators cover the same core route indicating potential profits to be made.It is considered that Improvements to semi rural bus services can be achieved at very small costs if available resources are redirected by partial regulation and licensing of local area concessions.  Licensed (franchised) operators would be required to provide agreed appropriate semi rural services alongside their profitable core routes.&#xa0;5. These comments were previously made to the Competition Commission investigating the Local Bus Market.  Their provisional findings report of May 2011 supported the use of local area or route franchise to help provide the much needed commuter and evening leisure services for the less populated semi rural areas whilst avoiding wastage by excess competition on the more densely populated, commercially attractive routes.  Unfortunately, after pressure from the major operators, the local franchise idea was not promoted in the final report of the Competition commission.&#xa0;6. Similar comments were also passed to the Institution of Civil Engineers request for comment on the proposed High Speed railway line (HS2) and a station for the East Midlands (April 2011).  The nation desperately needs improved transportation and the proposed HS2 line might be an appropriate step forward but only if it is accessible as part of an improved national and local integrated transport system.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ssues]]]7. At a local level, I have been campaigning for many years to achieve attractive direct commuter and evening bus services for Cropwell Bishop and other smaller villages in the Vale of Belvoir.  My commuter journey into Nottingham took approximately 55 minutes door to door using the available indirect bus services but only 35 minutes if I choose to drive my car 10 miles across across Nottingham City to the Forest Fields ‘park and ride’ and take the tram back in to my work place at Nottingham Trent University – Not a very ‘green’ solution.  A direct commuter bus would reduce door to door journey times to 35 minutes – a reduction of 20 minutes.&#xa0;8. The local bus services are supported by generous subsidies from the County Council but despite the greater powers under the 2008 Local Transport Act (See Appendix 2), they seem unwilling (or unable?) to require the bus companies to provide attractive direct commuter services and evening leisure services into Nottingham as part of that subsidy agreement. (This could change with current Nottinghamshire County Council TITAN project initiatives but we are not holding our breath as available funds diminish!)&#xa0;9. Factors such as city parking levies, road congestion, fuel costs, and pensioner subsidies, have increased bus usage in recent years and alternative bus companies, such as Premiere Travel, moved in to try and take a share of the profits enjoyed by the established companies (such as Trent Barton).  This has not really helped us in semi rural areas like Cropwell Bishop because the competition was focussed on the more populated areas of nearby Cotgrave and Bingham.  It also generated unproductive ‘bus wars’ with the sister company of Trent Baton running ‘spoiling’ services with the sole intention of driving out the competition. Eventually the sister company’s ‘spoiling’ service did force the competitor, Premiere Travel to abandon the Nottingham to Cotgrave routes in 2012.  The ‘spoiling’ service stopped soon after Premiere pulled out!  The competing company, Premiere Travel went into liquidation, January, 2013. &#xa0;10. At one time in 2011, We had the nonsense of 3 competing buses running in to Nottingham from Cropwell Bishop at 8.00am but none of them provided a direct service because they saw the main revenue coming from the Cotgrave estates en route. After the demise of Premiere, we have now returned to one indirect bus at 8.00am and no other services into Nottingham until 09.26.  &#xa0;11. The day time services into Nottingham are adequate (2 indirect buses per hour) but we have recently lost the direct link to the adjacent community of Bingham where many of our village children attend seconday school. &#xa0;12. Our evening bus services are very poor with the last bus into Nottingham at 5.40 pm and the last bus home from Nottingham at 6.00 pm.  This creates a severe isolation of village people from the work and social opportunities offered by Nottingham City in the evening.&#xa0;13. It is observed that peak time (7.30-8.30 am) traffic flows from Cropwell Bishop towards Nottingham are over 400 vehicles per hour compared with flows of around 150 vehicles per hour outside peak times.  If direct commuter buses were available, a proportion of the peak time private vehicle journeys would be eliminated.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Solution]]]14. The solution is to integrate our public transportation systems.  This will never happen if left to the vagaries and commercial interests of the private operators and therefore a form of regulation is required.  &#xa0;15. An appropriate approach would be (as for London buses and the various railway concessions) for the bus companies to tender for local area concessions which would require them to run certain commuter, shopper and evening leisure services for the surrounding semi rural areas (such as Cropwell Bishop and the villages in the Vale of Belvoir) alongside their regular commercial services to the more populated centres (such as Cotgrave and Bingham).  An example of possible area concessions for South East Nottingham is presented 

[[[in the Appendix]]]. In the case of the ‘Cotgrave’ concession, 6 buses would provide an adequate day time, off peak service for the area, instead of the 13 used during the competitive ‘bus wars’. (Since Liquidation of Premiere, Currently 5 buses running + 1 on route 50 (route 53 abandoned for present))&#xa0;16. The Local Authorities are under severe pressure to save money by cutting subsidised rural bus services.  The fact that two (or even temporarily 3) bus operators are able to profit from service provision on the Nottingham – Cotgrave  (and Nottingham –Bingham) route is indicative that there if the route were assigned to one operator there would be sufficient surplus profit to subsidise the extension of the service to the less populated village areas. (Trent Barton currently run as sole operator with full buses making healthy profits!). Regulation by the award of area concessions to operators by competitive tender would seem to be the best way forward to help fund the necessary semi rural routes with reduced cost to the public purse.  &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[City Integration]]]17. Looking more widely at the integration of services, it is not necessary to run all buses into Nottingham.  With the much improved passenger information and bus location controls now available, timetabled connecting services from the populated centres to the rural villages are perfectly feasible.  &#xa0;18. Within Nottingham itself not all buses need cross or circulate the city.  Too many buses are currently clogging our city streets for example at Parliament Street and Friar Lane (Market Square).  A free Centre Link has already been introduced and this is the right approach.  Suggestions have been made to Nottingham City Council (Chris Carter) for further development of the free link with (electric?) buses running in two circuits every few minutes between key bus stations (hubs) where the radial routes can terminate. &#xa0;19. Provision of the free centre link alongside the partial regulation and letting of area concessions as suggested will mean that operators do not have to compete for passengers.  Only selected key routes need complete the city loops and operators could thereby save some 10 – 15 minutes on many journeys. &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[sage]]].20. The improvement of the A453 between Nottingham and the M1 and East Midland airport is a high priority and after much local pressure this scheme is now under construction. It was unfortunate for the region that the previous government chose to throw ‘fiscal stimulus’ money at the lower priority, over priced, ‘over engineered’ A46 Newark to Widmerpool scheme with its overscaled earthworks at Stragglethorpe and Saxondale resulting in unnecessary loss of valuable agricultural land and poor energy efficiency (more fuel used, higher CO2 emissions) for vehicles using the new junctions. Whilst giving local benefits such as improved, safer access to Newark and Leicester, the somewhat blinkered design of the A46 improvement has done little to help regional traffic flows and integrated transport – the A52 traffic into Nottingham is still delayed!  &#xa0;21. The Nottingham tram extension out towards the M1 is currently under construction.   Investment in the tram is fine for the areas it serves but it has to be recognised that many areas such as South East Nottingham gain no direct benefit.  Priority should therefore be given to improvement of bus and other transportation services in these areas.&#xa0;22. Whilst the proposed HS2 may be some help for travel between our main cities (assuming it is affordable to all) it will not address the needs for regular inter-city and inter-town travel or the needs of travel to and from the more isolated communities.  The options of longer trains, longer platforms at certain key stations and revised signalling should be carefully explored to increase capacity where overcrowding on the current rail network really is an issue.&#xa0;23. Where existing rail connections are poor, there would seem to be much scope for an improved network of intercity/intertown buses, attractively priced to draw travellers away from the private car.  When more than one person is travelling the car tends to be the obvious ‘value for money’ choice.  A ‘partner’ rail/bus card could enable a partner to travel at say half fare to make the public transport journey more financially attractive for the pair of travellers?&#xa0;24. Arriving in a town or city by public transport the traveller needs good information for onward connections.  Perhaps subsidised taxi fares are appropriate for some rural locations where demand for bus services is very low? &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[onclusion]]]25. I cannot see an efficient integrated transportation system developing within a free market economy.  Transportation is too important for the economic future of our country to be left to commercial interests alone.  It is therefore necessary to plan and regulate services at a national, regional and local level so that unnecessary duplication is avoided and surplus profits from commercial operations in the more populated areas are directed towards supporting provision of vital transportation in the less populated areas. &#xa0;26. As concluded at the ICE sponsored, HS2 workshop on 6th April 2011, if this expensive scheme is to proceed, it must be developed within a system of improved integrated transportation for the whole nation.  ‘Connectivity’ is the key buzzword.&#xa0;27. At a local level for a village such as Cropwell Bishop, access to (and usage of) an East Midlands HS2 station will be rather limited. It is far more important for residents of the local area to have attractive direct commuter buses which could cut 15 minutes off the current 45 minute journey time into Nottingham.  Improvements of this sort can be achieved at very small costs if available resources are redirected as suggested by partial regulation and licensing of local area concessions.  &#xa0;&#xa0;APPENDIX 1
