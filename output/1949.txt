[[[Sarah Armstrong – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I am writing in support of the Green Lanes Protection Group, members of the House of Lords and others who are requesting that the Bill be amended to include additional rights of way clauses which would have the following effect:&#xa0;2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I live in central Sheffield and walk with my family on the hills at the edge of the city and in the Peak District most weekends. In addition, I have over the last 20 years spent a great deal of time in and around the Peak District village of Eyam where my mother lives.&#xa0;3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When my children were small we would regularly take them in prams, pushchairs, and later on foot, around Eyam, where a number of green lanes provided safe and pleasant passage away from motorised traffic. In recent years these lanes have become popular with off-road motor bikers, to the extent that some are now so eroded that my elderly mother can no longer use them. One has been mended up with hard-core and gravel, and since the ground slopes steeply it is treacherous underfoot in all weathers – I hesitate to walk on it myself. In addition to this is the constant worry that a group of motorbikes will suddenly hurtle up at speed. I certainly would not feel safe taking young children on the lanes these days, and I am amazed – given the numbers of school parties that visit Eyam throughout the year to study the plague memorials on one of these lanes - that the law allows the bikers continued access. It is surely only a matter of time before there is a serious accident at Eyam.&#xa0;4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are two main routes on the hills around Sheffield which have become popular with motor bikers and off-roaders. Both of these had become seriously eroded and virtually no-go areas by non-motor users. One of these has recently been closed to motor vehicles, and after repair is now once more used by a great many people. Walkers continue to avoid the other.&#xa0;5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As users of our green lanes the off-roaders and motor bikers are in a small minority, yet they terrorise the majority and cause expensive damage to the environment which we all have to pay for. We therefore ask you to accept the changes to the draft Deregulation Bill which are being suggested by the Green Lanes Environmental Action Group and others.&#xa0;&#xa0;10 September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
