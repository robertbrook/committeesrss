"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Adam Smith International&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nDFID is able to meet the 0.7% target but that achievement will inevitably lead to a shift in the aid debate \naway from the\n quantity of aid spending to its\n quality. How can we make the largest impact with what is still a relatively small amount of money compared to the other funds available in a recipient country?\n1.2\n              \nThe quality of our aid intervention is all the more important now that the quantity of resources available from other sources is so much larger than it used to be. Not only are developing countries succeeding in gaining access to more non-aid funds, but the quantity of private investment into the developing world has also expanded exponentially.\n Other financial flows are dwarfing aid flows.  (Taking extractive industries as an example, p\notential net revenues from extractive industries are estimated at about US$1 trillion for low-income and lower-middle-income countries\n.) How do we influence, direct and increase these other financial flows in a way that helps poor people as opposed to a narrow elite? \n1.3\n              \nTo provide a concrete example, \ni\nn Sierra Leone \nan \ninternational standard mining sector institutional and legal framework has been put in place\n \nwith DFID financing\n.\n Government capacity and investor confidence have been transformed, with a huge effect on Government revenues. Starting from around £1m in 2006 revenues have now reached £50m this year. And the IMF predicts they will reach £130m by 2013, greatly in excess of total DFID support to Sierra Leone in 2012 of some £52 million. This is high value, high impact assistance.\n1.3\n              \nWe believe that much more needs to be done to assess the impact of the different types of DFID expenditure so that resources can be shifted to those areas with the highest impact.  While an effective development programme needs to use a variety of instruments, the main focus should be on directing aid spending to the areas providing the best value for money and the highest return on investment.  In many areas a better understanding is needed of the ‘value’ element of the value for money equation.\n2.              The adequacy of DFID’s current staffing levels2.1\n              \nDFID staffing levels are in general too low to handle its increased programme, and this provides an artificial incentive for it to transfer funds to inefficient multilaterals with higher administrative co\nsts. Below we set out (paras 4.2\n to\n 4.4\n) some proposals to address the problem of perverse incentives. However, there are other ways in which DFID’s efficiency could be increased, allowing more to be achieved to a higher standard by the existing staff complement.\n2.2\n              \nAs we argue below, there should be emphasis on effective programme management skills.  The focus should be on improving the programme management skills of the technical advisers who are responsible for DFID’s programmes. \n3.              DFID's ability to manage its bilateral&#xa0;spending3.1\n              \nDFID has made commendable efforts in recent years to increase its focus on results and consequent achievement of better value for money. This has improved the quality of its work, but at the cost of greatly increased lead times and complexity. Without corrective action, there is a considerable risk of DFID losing its comparative advantage in flexibility and responsiveness to changing conditions on the ground.  There will be consequent reputational damage.  Too much DFID staff time is taken up with filling in forms and seeking approvals for decisions that would better be taken at operational levels.\n3.2\n              \nDFID is seeking to introduce ‘private sector DNA’ into the organisation, with more of a focus on results and return on investment.  This is to be welcomed but a consequence of some of these changes has been to make DFID less like the private sector, which is used to taking decisions quickly and tolerating risk where the reward is potentially high.\n3.3\n              \nDFID is looking at how it can streamline its procedures and improve its programme management in order to get things done more quickly and more effectively. We believe that this should be a high priority.\n3.4\n              \nThere appears to be a division between advisers and programme managers within DFID.  We are not sure this is a useful division.  The more prestigious roles are the advisory ones.  People who have served in senior roles in DFID tell us that what is most appreciated in the organisation is the brilliant policy piece, rather than the programme delivered. It’s not that programme delivery is ignored, but rather that that good programme design and delivery is not rewarded within DFID as much as an adviser’s contribution to a think piece. It would be preferable if advisers spent a greater percentage of their time on fewer programmes, so as to get a better grip on the functioning of the programme, rather than focussing primarily on setting its objectives. \n3.5\n              \nWe wonder if the separation between advisers and programme staff is efficient?  In our organisation as in most private sector ones there is no such separation.  People with a proper grasp of policy issues are also meant to deliver, to organise and to manage, taking responsibility from start to finish. Perhaps a similar configuration can be adopted in DFID?  One would not want to load all sorts of minor administrative tasks onto those responsible for programmes, so admin staff should remain in place. At present those called programme managers are largely concerned with administrative matters.  Admin staff should remain, reporting to the combined adviser/programme manager.\n3.6\n              \nAt present in most circumstances the adviser is the one who in practice takes the major programme management decisions, without being formally responsible for programme management. Making the adviser formally responsible would help make one person accountable for getting things done.  Of course it is not necessary for every person within DFID to be primarily a manager. There must be room for brilliant thinkers to focus on policy development and strategic thinking. But given the imperative to commit resources quickly and effectively, the majority of advisers should be incentivised to spend more time in the field on the details of programme delivery. \n3.7\n              \nAnother approach, consistent with the above, is to bring in more people on a contract basis to handle programme advisory/management roles. There is a wealth of expertise in the market of people who have good subject knowledge and organisation experience and capability.  They could \nbe brought in more often on fixed-term employment contracts, (to avoid swelling permanent civil service numbers). This is already done to some extent in DFID, but more often to fill gaps.\n3.8\n              \nAs earlier noted, additional processes take up staff time that could be more productively utilised, but they also reduce DFID’s ability to move quickly. In reality speed should be a high priority. If a problem is substantive then the earlier it is dealt with the better. Moreover, the nature of problems usually change.  If there is a gap of some years between the time that a programme is designed and the time that programme implementers finally start, then the design is likely to be out of date. The design process can take over 2 years.  The slow speed of project design not only frustrates government partners, it means that the situation on the ground can have changed considerably since the ToR were developed.  \n3.9\n              \nA faster design process with a less prescriptive design would be preferable. Approval of the design seems to have become more complicated in recent years.  The use of the business case no doubt has its advantages, in that it has a stronger focus on results achieved for money spent.  But have the business case requirements become too complex?  Is a full business case necessary for smaller programmes?\n3.10\n              \nOnce a programme has been approved, delays often remain a problem. These \nhave real negative effects on projects’ effectiveness at ground level in terms of opportunities missed, team members lost, counterparts feeling not listened to, etc. Contracting mechanisms need to be more flexible and permit rapid procurement.\n3.11\n              \nCounterparts in developing country governments like to get assistance quickly, and with the minimum of procedural hassle.  The following is a recent quote from the Chief Economic Adviser to the President of Nigeria, talking about the Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility (NIAF) flexible facility that can provide help to him very quickly:\n“DFID through NIAF is our best development partner. The contrast between NIAF and others is like day and night in terms of timeliness and effectiveness of support. Others will promise help but delay and go through various procedures so by the time it is available it has been overtaken by events. We do not need to be given significant amounts of money.  We need good quality advice that is available at the appropriate time. I really appreciate the assistance. I am very, very pleased. Let me say thank you. My main message is keep it going, keep it working in the same way”.\n3.12\n              \nAs highlighted by the quotation above, flexibility once implementation is under way is particularly important.  Where there is greater flexibility to take advantage of a window of opportunity, to shift resources to areas where progress can be made, and to reallocate resources away from less effective interventions, considerable value can be added over the life of a programme.  The flexible facility model is an effective means of moving faster once a contract has been awarded.  \nDFID should use flexible facilities more widely, particularly in conflict / fluid environments where donors are typically trying lots of things simultaneously in the expectation that progress will be blocked in some.\n4.              DFID’s spending through multilaterals4.1\n              \nDFID’s ability to judge the effectiveness of its spending through multilaterals is severely constrained by the relative lack of information on results achieved. There is an increasing divergence between DFID’s bilateral programme, with its increasing emphasis on results, value for money, and accountability to the taxpayer, and DFID’s multilateral spending. We doubt that it is viable to have two distinct parts of the aid programme, - a high-performing, accountable bilateral one and an inefficient, unaccountable multilateral one.\n4.2\n              \nThe accounting treatment of funds given to multilaterals should be revised in order to remove one inappropriate incentive for funding them – the desire to meet budget targets. DFID should change its accounting policy so that DFID money spent by multilaterals and trust funds is only counted as spent at the time when it is actually spent on the ground, not when it is transferred into the bank account of the respective multilateral.\n4.3\n              \nIt is not appropriate to fund multilaterals with high administration costs at a time when DFID’s own administration costs are being cut. The current system provides a perverse incentive for more money to be spent on administrative costs, rather than less. The administrative costs of most multilaterals, as highlighted by the Committee in a recent DAR report, are way above those of DFID. The result is that DFID spends more on administration by funding multilaterals, the direct opposite of the original policy objective. \n4.4\n              \nDFID’s administration costs should be redefined to include the proportionate administration costs of multilateral organisations to which it gives funds. Thus if DFID gave £1m to a multilateral with administration costs of 7% then £70,000 should be added to DFID’s administration costs. At the same time the cap on DFID’s own administration costs should be lifted from the current 2% to some 3% or 3.5%. If there is a concern about adding to permanent civil service numbers then perhaps a cap on permanent civil service staff in DFID could remain, while the number of contract staff it can employ in administrative functions should be able to increase until the administrative costs cap is reached. \n4.5\n              \nDFID should not retain multilateral organisations that directly implement, e.g. UNDP and UNICEF, on a non-competitive basis.  They should always have to compete with others before being awarded work to carry out programmes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
