[[[FUTURE OF THE BBC INQUIRY]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Executive Summary:]]]Shed Media believes that the BBC holds a key and essential role within the TV landscape, for viewers in the domestic and international marketplace and within the creative industry. Many of the most successful television exports were initiated on the BBC and many successful UK production companies hold the BBC key to their achievements.  As such we are supporters of the BBC and the license fee, removing or reducing the licensee fee could have negative impacts for the broadcasting sector in the UK - and for UK creative industries globally. After a difficult few years for the BBC’s TV division, the new senior management and business leaders are showing signs of essential modernisation which should lead to greater efficiency both operationally and in communications, decision making and commissioning.  Shed Media recognises that the BBC needs an appropriate and effective mechanism for accountability and governance and we believe that progress has been signalled by new management who we consider have the commitment to introduce and follow-through on change. The BBC should broadcast the very best programmes it can regardless of whether they are produced ‘in house’ or from external producers.  As such Shed Media believes that the ‘Window Of Creative Competition’ should not act as a cap on external commissions (bar news and current affairs) and that ‘open competition’ will benefit the BBC and its viewers.  As part of any reform of the commissioning system, Shed Media believes that the definition of an ‘Independent Producer’ should be amended.The BBC’s achievements with regards to ‘Nations and Regions’ have been encouraging and we support and encourage further commitments from the BBC to represent its diverse audience by commissioning new and re-commissioning established programming from all areas of the UK. Shed Media believes that the commercial revenue the Independent Production sector could contribute the BBC could be increased if the BBC’s Fair Trading and Commercial Guidelines are updated to fit the nature of current of business practice  and rights ownership and exploitation.  Where the BBC operates its own commercial activities via BBC Worldwide , we believe these activities should be based on the current remit, be commercially transparent and operate on an equal footing with the independent sector. Shed Media believes that if the BBC does invest in new technologies, such devices (such as the iPlayer) then these technologies should be commercialised as fully as possible and that the BBC should work in partnership with external technology companies.
