[normal]Appendix - Photographic Evidence of destruction of Long Causeway in Recent Years[bold]1.[bold]In the 4 photos below, the arrow points at the same rock each time.  The destruction of the track by motorised vehicles was already well underway by 2004, but the photos below evidence how severely this process has continued in the past 9 years.  It can be seen how the surface is being worn away and rocks that should form the foundation of the track are being exposed. Also, a drainage pipe has been exposed, risking inevitable damage and a consequent increase in water erosion.  Also, much of the sand and pebbles that made the track smoother in 2004 have now become rubble, making the track far harder to walk - and impossible for horses:

[normal]2. [bold]Here is
[normal] [bold]a different section of Long Causeway. The arrow points at the same rock each time.  Again, it can be seen how the surface is being worn away and rocks that should form the foundation of the track are being exposed – in this case, the rock that is arrowed has moved from being reasonably buried in 2004 to being fully exposed now.  It can also be seen that a track which in 2004 was quite easily passable for walkers, riders and cyclists has now been turned into very difficult terrain:

[normal]n these 2 photos it can be seen how significantly the surface is being worn away and also how the track is being widened as vehicles go off the track.  It can also be seen that water running in ruts created by the vehicles is eroding a track that in 2004 was quite easily passable for walkers, riders and cyclists.  Also note the steep drop to the left of this narrow track, making it difficult and even dangerous for walkers, riders and cyclists to avoid motorised vehicles as they pass:
