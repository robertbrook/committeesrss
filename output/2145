[normal]Discrimination Law Association – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]This submission by the Discrimination Law Association (DLA) relates to Clause 2 of the draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the reasons set out below, the DLA does not believe that removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations when it has made a finding of discrimination will contribute in any way to reducing the regulatory burden on business. On the contrary, the experience of DLA members suggests that tribunal recommendations, which are intended to assist employers to adopt improved equality practices and thus to avoid future litigation, are often welcomed by employers.  In this brief submission the DLA seeks to assist MPs and Peers to understand what this power of employment tribunals involves and why it should be retained.

[normal]EqLR
[normal] 1910
[normal]In this case the Respondent accepted that it had unlawfully discriminated against the Claimant because of her pregnancy or maternity. At the remedy hearing the Tribunal made a series of recommendations including that within 28 days of the issue of the Tribunal’s judgment the Respondent shall publish the Tribunal’s written reasons on their internet; the Tribunal noted that it “accepted the Claimant’s contention that bringing the judgment  to the attention of all managers and employees in the Royal Mail would increase their awareness of the risks of discrimination and therefore was likely to reduce the risk of such discrimination occurring to other employees in the future”.
