Three quarters of councils are\n \nreporting that non-payment of rent following \nthe \nunder occupancy changes is\n \ndirectly responsible for the increase in their rent arrears.\n  \nOf that rent now due to be collected from tenants affected by under occupancy\n \nmeasu\nres, 60% of councils are reported receiving 40% or less and 80% reported\n \nreceiving 50% or less as at the end of May\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nIn total, councils have received over 22,000 applications for DHPs since advising\n \ntenants of revised Housing Benefit awards. For 19 \nlocal authorities this is 4 times\n \nhigher than the same period last year.\n&#xa0;\n3.               Impact of debt on health3.1\n              \nGiven the increase in \nrent \narrears due to \nunder occupancy\n, there are clearly a significant nu\nm\nber of tenants who are now in debt in Scotland.  The \nre\nlationship between the \nimpact of debt on\n \nhealth\n and in particular mental health\n is well \nestablished\n.\n \nThe under occupancy rules \ndisproportionately\n affect people who are already disadvantaged, including disabled people and \nthose\n who suffer long term health conditions, addictions, mental health problems and carers.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \n              \nBeing in debt can\n \nnegatively affect a person’s mental health, while\n \nliving with a mental health problem increases the\n \nlikelihood of falling into debt\n, \nfor example\n the number of people \nwho have trouble paying their debts are more than twice as likely to have mental health problems or suffer severe anxiety compared with the general population\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nAccording to the Royal College of \nPsychiatrists\n, m\nore debt equate\ns to more mental ill health, even after adjustment for income and other socio-demographic variables.\n  Their research has concluded that:\n \n&#xa0;\n4.               Impact of homelessness on health4.1\n              \nIn contra\ns\nt to England, homelessness has been falling in \nS\ncot\nl\nand\n.  However the increase in rent arrears due to under \noccupancy\n rules and lack of appropriate housing stock for people to ‘downsize’ \nto\n is likely to increase evictions. \nWhilst some local authorities in Scotland have stated they will not evict tenants who fall into arrears \nbecause\n of the under-occupancy rules, \nmost hou\nsing\n associations and local \nauthorities\n \ncannot\n afford to take th\nis\n approach\n, therefore\n it is likely that t\nhere will be an increase in \nthe \nnumber of people who become homeless\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nPoor health is a well established consequence of \nhomelessness\n;\n this can include \nchronic conditions as well as anxiety, stress, self-harm, other mental health problems and infectious diseases. A significant minority of homeless people are dependent on drugs or alcohol often alongside mental health problems and other m\nultiple needs\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nAn increase in h\nealth problems \nis\n not confined to those sleeping rough. People living in temporary accommodation, with friends or in hostels have little stability, often have to share kitchens and bathrooms and have little privacy or security\n. They may also experience problems relating t\no damp or overcrowded conditions. Research also shows that homeless families in rural areas may spend longer in temporary accommodation than those in urban areas\n and that\n health problems arising from such circumstances include an increased risk of dermato\nlogical problems, musculoskeletal problems, poor obstetric outcomes and a range of mental health problems.  \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nThe effect on children in homeless families living in temporary accommodation can be serious\n. There are many detrimental effects on the physi\ncal and emotional development of children living in unsettled or overcrowded accommodation with little room to play or do homework. Studies have shown children in these circumstances \nare more likely to experience\n behavioural disturbance, have higher levels of illness and infection, have poor sleep patterns and are more prone to accidental injury\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nIt can be more difficult for homeless people to sustain continuity of care, to meet appointments made a long time \nin advance, or to participate in health \nimprovement and health promotion activities, such as healthy eating and physical activity\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.               Impact of low income on health5.1\n              \nWhilst \nsome tenants \nmay become homeless because they have incurred arrears due to the under \noccupancy\n rules; other tenants on low incomes, with no option of moving to a smaller property, will try to meet the shortfall in rent, therefore having less money to spend on basic liv\ning costs such as fuel, food and transport.  \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe rapid increase in the number of Food Banks now available in Scotland \nserve\n to illustrate a growing level of need that individuals and families face as a result of increasing financial difficulties\n.  \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nAny\n decrease in income for \nth\nose\n population groups \naffected by the under occupancy rules is\n likely to cause increased income inequalities in Scotland, increased fuel poverty, increased food poverty (and a consequent shift from quality foodstuffs to calorific quantity); and decreased housing \nsecurity\n.\n  These factors are likely to cause a number \nof negative health outcomes, \nand predictions\n are\n: \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nThose population groups who\nse health is most \nlikely to be most affected \nare\n disabled people, carers and women, and those living in rural communities in Scotland\n.  \nPrior to April 2013, \nth\nese\n population group\ns\n were already \nfound to be \ndisproportionably\n affected by the recent recession and public sector adjustments. \n \nScottish Gover\nnment Social Research\n in 2010\n \nfound that:\n&#xa0;\n6.               Impact on NHS services6.1\n              \nThe potential increase in the burden of ill health due to increase in\n \nhealth inequalities\n, \nincome inequalities\n, and \npoverty and debt \nwill clearly have an impact on NHS services, particularly primary care\n,\n in terms of increasing demand for appointments and increased costs associated with diagnostic testing and medication\n.  And\n what is of \nparticular \nconcern \nhas been \nthe increasing\n demand\n for medical evidence to support applications for Discretionary Housing\n \nPayment (\nDHP)\n. \nGiven that 80% of those affected by the under-occupancy rules in \nScotland\n are disabled, many are applying for DHP on medical\n \nor health grounds.  \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nDue to a lack of clear guidance\n and supported by Local Medical Committees\n, GP’s are \ntaking a number of approaches in \nresponding\n to reques\nt\ns for medical evidence to support applications for DHP, this includes charging for the evidence or refusing to provide any evidence.  GP’s have taken this stance given the number of r\ne\nquests they now re\nceive to provide medical evidence in support of those appealing W\nork Capability \nA\nssessment (WCA)\n \ndecisions\n.  \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nT\nhe additional work of providing evidence for DHP applications and WCA appeals falls disproportionately on general practices in areas of \ndeprivation in Scotland which are already struggling as a result of the inverse care law\n \n.  \n&#xa0;\n7.              ConclusionAs outlined above \nthere are concerns amongst the NHS and public health \nworkforce\n of the impact that the social size criteria is having on\n the most vulnerable communities in Scotland.  Of the 82,500 households affected by the under occupancy rules, 60,000 need a one bedroom property, however only around 20,000 one bedroom \nproperties\n in the social housing sector become available each year.  C\nonsequently the impact o\nf the under occupancy rules are \nlikely to cause an increase in health problems, health inequalities and pressure on NHS services, particularly primary care.\n  \nIt is hoped that the \nUK \nParliament Work and Pensions C\nommittee\n recognise these impacts and can identify how these impacts can be minimise in order to protect the health of those \nmost \naffected in Scotland.\n&#xa0;\n20 September 2013\nBilbliographyIn \naddition to the references in the footnotes, \nevidence\n for this report \nhas been \ndrawn\n from a number of published and unpublished documents – see below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n7\n&#xa0;\n The Scottish Government (2013)  \nUpdated Evidence On The Number Of Households Affected By The Housing Benefit Under Occupation Penalty \n European Parliament (2012) Mental Health in Times of Economic Crisis\n RCGP &amp;
