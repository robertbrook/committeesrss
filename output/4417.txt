[[[Education should be an early priority for DFID’s inclusive approach]]]. The exclusion of disabled children denies their human right to education and will prevent the world reaching MDG 2. DFID is the leading donor to education and should lead the way with a 

[[[strategic focus on]]]

[[[ equity and]]]

[[[ inclusive education]]] that benefits all children (not just disabled children). 

[[[Inclusive education is the right approach to ]]]

[[[strengthening education systems, improving teacher-training and]]]

[[[ delivering better quality education]]]. This should be complemented by additional efforts to 

[[[reach the most marginalised ]]]

[[[if implemented on the ground by DFID’s Country Offices ]]]

[[[and in-country partners]]]. The implementation of central strategy and guidance can be challenging within DFID’s devolved structure. Embedding inclusion will require strong

[[[leading its global partners on inclusion]]]. DFID’s dialogues with 

[[[developing country governments]]] provide an opportunity to challenge attitudes toward disability and encourage an inclusive education approach. DFID should urge the

[[[champion a disability-inclusive post-2015 framework]]], particularly the “

[[[no one left behind]]]” principle, the 

[[[disaggregation of indicators by disability]]], and the approach that 

[[[no target should be considered met unless for all social groups, including disabled people]]]. The UK is well-positioned to lead on a post-2015 ‘

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disability has long been neglected as a “niche” area of development, deemed by many to be too complex or too small an issue to be core to development efforts. The MDGs failed to mention disability, yet we now know that disabled people make up an estimated 15% of the global population, and that disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty. 80% of disabled people live in developing countries and the UN calls them “

[[[the world’s largest minority]]]”. Without including disabled people, it is clear that 

[[[many of]]] 

[[[the MDG targets will not be reached]]]. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 

[[[UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]] has led to a step-change in the recognition of the rights of disabled people to be included in all aspects of their own development. The UNCRPD also places an obligation on signatories like the UK 

[[[to ensure aid programmes include disabled people]]].&#xa0;3.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A major barrier to the recognition of disability as a core development issue has been the 

[[[appalling lack of data available]]]. Information is often speculative and out of date. A lack of reliable and consistent data at national level feeds a lack of clarity internationally. This has ultimately 

[[[left disabled people invisib]]]

[[[le, left behind by development efforts]]]. However, with dramatic improvements in data over recent years, there is now 

[[[a]]]

[[[n unprecedented]]]

[[[ opportunity]]] to bring the needs of disabled people into the light.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Post-2015 negotiations represent a unique opportunity to reverse the neglect of disabled people by ensuring that 

[[[the new framework explicitly includes disability as a core issue]]]. DFID’s recent commitments should be 

[[[the ]]]

[[[first step towards the UK leading ]]]

[[[a revolution in disability-inclusive development, starting by embedding disability as a core part of ]]]

[[[DFID’s]]]

[[[ work]]].

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; RESULTS and our grassroots volunteers have long campaigned for disabled children to have access to quality education. It is estimated that there are 93 million disabled children globally, and in most countries, they are 

[[[more likely to be out of school than any other group of children]]]. In Nepal, it is estimated that 85% of all children out of school are disabled. In Ethiopia, fewer than 3% of disabled children have access to primary education. In some countries 

[[[being disabled more than doubles the chance of never enrolling in school]]]. Disabled children are also less likely to remain in school and transition to the next grade. &#xa0;4.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The exclusion of disabled children not only denies their human right to education, but makes it impossible for the world to reach the MDG of universal primary education by 2015. 

[[[57 million children of primary age are st]]]

[[[ill out of school]]] around the world and progress all but stalled. It is estimated that 

[[[disabled children may make up over ]]]

[[[a third of ]]]

[[[the ]]]

[[[out-of-]]]

[[[school population]]].  

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Lack of understanding, negative attitudes and discrimination]]] towards disability are major challenges, often leading parents in low-income countries to 

[[[hide away their ]]]

[[[disabled children]]] and leading governments and education decision-makers to segregate disabled children into

[[[ “special” schools]]] – often inappropriately – which tends to compound the exclusion from the mainstream and perpetuate the myth that disabled people should be “helped” and not empowered to lead their own productive lives. &#xa0;4.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Disability is also 

[[[inextricably linked to other factors which exacerbate exclusion and i]]]

[[[nequality]]]. For instance, ethnic minority girls living with disabilities experience triple exclusion. A recent GCE UK report noted that of all the excluding factors, disability has the strongest correlation with poor educational outcomes. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The recent commitments made by DFID are 

[[[important and welcome progress]]], and as part of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE) UK, RESULTS has sought to support DFID in this process. The announcement that 

[[[all future ]]]

[[[schools built with direct UK support will be built accessibly]]] is an important statement to DFID’s developing country and donor partners. DFID’s commitment to work with global partners to 

[[[improve the data and evidence on disability]]] goes to the heart of the current invisibility of disabled people. DFID should now 

[[[build on these steps to embed disability-inclusion within its work]]] and position itself to champion disability-inclusive development with its partners and within the post-2015 dialogue.&#xa0;5.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 2010, RESULTS UK published a report which raised serious concerns about implementation, since then, progress has been made. At the time, DFID had been among the first donors to recognise the importance of a 

[[[“twin-track” approach ]]]which sees the “mainstreaming” or inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of their development work (eg. ensuring education support disabled children), coupled with additional inputs and resources which recognise the extreme marginalisation of disabled people and go further in supporting them. DFID has since put in place useful guidance for its Country Offices. &#xa0;5.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, despite some examples of good practice, DFID still 

[[[has no formal framework for the systematic inclusion of disabled people throughout its programmes]]], and 

[[[no formal ]]]

[[[checks]]] are in place to ensure that DFID’s work results in improved development outcomes for disabled people. As part of GCE UK, RESULTS UK has raised concerns that 

[[[implementation remains a real problem]]]. For instance, in a survey of six Country Offices in 2012, GCE UK found that only half of the offices were aware of the existing guidance, and 

[[[only one was implementing ]]]

[[[it]]]. In a later report, GCE UK noted that there were 

[[[only two mentions of the word “disability” across 14 DFID Country Operational Plans]]]. There is substantial risk that the current momentum will be lost unless there is 

[[[robust implementation ]]]

[[[to embed ]]]

[[[disability-inclusion within DFID’s ]]]

[[[work]]].&#xa0;5.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID should move in a 

[[[careful, phased approach towards disability-inclusive development as part of a]]]

[[[ wider strateg]]]

[[[ic focus on equity]]]

[[[ and inclusion]]] that could be similar to its ‘Strategic Vision for Girls and Women’. These principles should be embedded throughout DFID’s 

[[[strateg]]]

[[[ies]]]

[[[, structures and processes]]], with a high level prioritisation reflected by the inclusion of disability as a 

[[[core requirement of]]]

[[[ country plans, business cases ]]]

[[[and the disaggregation of programme plans and results]]] to demonstrate how DFID’s work is supporting disabled people. DFID should move towards making disability-inclusion 

[[[a requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding agreements]]], starting with the next cycle of aid reviews. &#xa0;5.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This strategic focus should be 

[[[championed at a ]]]

[[[senior]]]

[[[ level]]]. The work of Judith Heumann, Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the US State Department, could provide a useful reference point. Ms Heumann told the APPGs on Disability and Global Education for All in 2012 that she works closely with USAID to embed disability within their work, with focus on their funding decisions, internal processes and training for staff. The AusAid strategy ‘Towards a disability-inclusive Australian aid programme’ could also be a helpful model.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;6.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Education should be an early priority for ]]]

[[[DFID’s inclusive approach]]], building on the recent commitment on accessible school construction. The UK is the 

[[[largest bilateral donor to basic education]]] and so has an opportunity to lead and influence other donors and developing countries. &#xa0;6.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID should lead the way with 

[[[a strategic focus on equity and inclusive education that benefits all children]]], particularly the most marginalised (not just disabled children). As a recent GCE report emphasises, the UNCRPD established inclusive education as the key mechanism to deliver the right to education for disabled children. Inclusive education systems can be defined as all children learning together in mainstream classrooms, irrespective of the different ranges of abilities and disabilities, with teaching methods, materials and school environments that address the needs of all children, and additional, individually tailored support as needed. They can be a powerful tool in addressing inequalities, tackling discrimination and changing societal attitudes towards embracing diversity.&#xa0;6.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UNICEF notes that inclusive education is by no means a luxury available only to the privileged. Rather, examples of inclusion in education can be found in all regions, and challenge the notion that such an approach cannot be taken in low resource contexts. The GCE report argues that 

[[[i]]]

[[[nclusive education is the right approach to strengthening education systems, improving teacher-training and delivering better quality ]]]

[[[all]]]. &#xa0;6.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[I]]]

[[[nclusive education is ]]]

[[[a good]]]

[[[ investment]]], enabling developing country governments to spend limited budgets on a system which benefits all children rather than inefficiently channelled towards a few children in segregated schools (which again reinforces the perception that disability is a cost to the state). Directly relevant to DFID’s recent commitment on accessible school construction, UNICEF highlights that the 

[[[costs of integrating accessibility into new buildings can be negligible]]] (less than 1% of the total cost) compared to the higher cost of adapting completed buildings. Ultimately, supporting the education of disabled children will yield a substantial economic benefit to the developing countries where DFID works.&#xa0;6.5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID is a leader in supporting 

[[[teacher-]]]

[[[training]]], which is fundamental to meeting MDG 2 and improving educational quality. DFID should match its commitment on accessible school construction with this equally crucial aspect of inclusion, committing that 

[[[DFID will integrate disability and inclusive education throughout the teacher-training it supports]]].&#xa0;6.6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In line with a “twin track” approach, DFID should also 

[[[put in place additional ]]]

[[[projects]]]

[[[ and resources to support disabled children]]]. DFID already takes this approach with gender through its ‘Girls Education Challenge’ fund. Similarly, DFID could have a dedicated fund to 

[[[support]]]

[[[ pr]]]

[[[ojects to r]]]

[[[each out-of-]]]

[[[school disabled children; tackle discrimination about disability; and support children with complex needs in community settings]]]. DFID should take a 

[[[cross-sector approach]]], linking to early childhood, nutrition, health and humanitarian programmes and ensuring that these too are inclusive. &#xa0;6.7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[An inclusive approach will only become reality if implemented on the ground]]]. RESULTS UK’s experience suggests that implementation of central strategy and guidance is challenging given DFID’s devolved structure. Embedding inclusion will require 

[[[st]]]

[[[rong accountability mechanisms]]]. RESULTS UK recommends that 

[[[designated leads]]] should be identified in DFID’s Country Offices to be responsible and accountable for ensuring that the needs of disabled people are included in DFID’s work. 

[[[T]]]

[[[all Country A]]]

[[[dvisers]]]. As part of GCE UK, RESULTS UK has welcomed discussions with DFID about incorporating disability into ‘continuous professional development’ for Country Advisers, and we urge DFID to proceed with integrating disability and inclusive approaches into future training. Finally, DFID’s Country Offices should be required to engage in 

[[[substantive, regular consultation with Disabled People’s Organisations]]] to ensure the participation of disabled people in the planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes.&#xa0;

[[[DFID’s ]]]

[[[dialogues]]]

[[[ with developing country governments]]] provide opportunities to challenge unhelpful attitudes toward disability and encourage an inclusive approach at national level. DFID should seek to

[[[divided ministerial responsibility ]]]

[[[within developing country governments]]], where education for disabled children is the responsibility of a different ministry than that responsible for the education of non-disabled children. This division reflects and reinforces the view that the disabled need welfare rather than equal access to education, and it often leads to a segregated education system with disabled children separated into “special schools”. 

[[[DFID should call on national governments to invest in inclusive systems]]], with responsibility for the education of all children clearly within the remit of the Ministry for Education.&#xa0;7.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID should use its role on the Board of the

[[[education for disabled children]]]. The GPE is the only multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into school for a quality education. The GPE’s unique partnership model, which coordinates donors, civil society and private sector investments in support of nationally-led education plans, provides an important vehicle for DFID to give global reach to its disability commitments. The GPE has already committed to supporting disabled children within its new strategic plan. 

[[[In June 2014, the GPE will hold a replenishment campaign to]]]

[[[ re-galvanise the education community]]] with pledges to its fund and commitments to increase domestic financing and bilateral aid to education. 

[[[DFID should use this important moment to call for a global effort to improve support for disabled children’s educa]]]

[[[tion]]].&#xa0;7.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; DFID should play a leading role in improving 

[[[data on disability at a global and national level]]]. Progress is already being made through the 

[[[Global Partnership on Children with Disabilities]]], and work by the 

[[[UN Washington]]]

[[[ Group on Disability Statistics]]]. 

[[[UNICEF]]], the 

[[[World Bank]]] and 

[[[UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics]]] all have expertise which should form part of a more coordinated effort. Donors like DFID should seek to turn global knowledge-sharing into national action by 

[[[supporting capacity-building within]]]

[[[ national governments and statistical agencies]]] in developing countries.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;8.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Post-2015 negotiations represent a 

[[[once in a lifetime opportunity to reverse the neglect of disabled people]]]. The Prime Minister has already played an important role as a co-chair of the UN High Level Panel (HLP) and has been championing disability-inclusion and the principle of “no one left behind”. The 

[[[UN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development]]] in September was the highest level gathering of decision-makers on this issue for many years, and DFID Minister Lynne Featherstone MP’s intervention at this event was widely praised.&#xa0;8.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We urge DFID to 

[[[continue championing these issues throughout the tough]]]

[[[ inter-governmental negotiations that lay ahead]]]. We cannot be complacent – with so many priorities on the table, there is a great risk that concepts like ‘disaggregation by disability’ 

[[[will be lost]]]. We all have a collective responsibility to ensure that does not happen. DFID should fight for the “

[[[no one left behind” ]]]principle

[[[, ]]]the

[[[ disaggregation of indicators by disability ]]]to measure progress, and the approach that

[[[ no target should be considered met unless for all social groups, including disabled people]]]. &#xa0;8.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The HLP called for a “
