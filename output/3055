default?
default&#xa0;
default1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government plans to triple spending on road enhancements by 2021, and resurface 
defaultover 3000 miles
default of the strategic road network, in an effort to
default 
defaultredress the effects of
default past underi
defaultnvestment, as well as 
defaultpreparing for
default large increases in
default required
default capacity, and researching and implementing solutions for 
defaultareas with enduring traffic issues.
default If properly implemented, this programme may alleviate the congestion that is estimated to cost the British economy up to £14bn per annum by 2025.
defaultMany opportunities are presented for efficiencies and smarter road usage.
default The government recognises the impo
defaultrtance of local road networks in supporting the strategic network, and is providing 
default£6 billion for their maintenance over the next six years. Building on this, we suggest that
default 
defaultr
defaultedefining the strategic road network to include key entry points and junctions 
defaultwould help avoid congestion at intersections between the SRN and the local system.
defaultThe programme also offers £500 million in support of low-carbon technologies, with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint of road travel. Economies of scale in larg
defaulte highway projects offer more opportunities to invest in environmental mitigation.  The potential spread of the managed motorways programme could deliver both cost and environmental efficiencies; the effects of this and other technological innovations are 
defaultdiscussed in section 4.
default 
defaultIn accordance with the recommendations of the Cook Report, independence from central government will 
defaultallo
defaultw the Highways Agency to realise large improvements for the strategic road network, 
defaultwhich will be discussed in 
defaultgreater
default detail below.
default The introduction of 5-year control periods will also allow for 
defaulta much longer planning horizon by freeing the Agency from the uncertainty of the annual Budget cycle. Furthermore, regulatory pressure is expected to create efficiencies of up to
default 20%
default in
default unit costs within 5 years of implementation, translating to £600 million in savings by 2020.
default Building on these plans, new funding options will also be available to the Agency.
default2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the era of austerity, the potential
default efficiency
default gains from effective implementation
default of multi-modal transport planning are relatively higher
default. Integrated planning with other modes of transport is essential; for example, freight distribution centres 
defaultand ports 
defaultshould 
defaulthave excellent 
defaultlink
defaults
default to both the strate
defaultgic road network and the rail network.
default  
defaultThe success of the Olympic Games in London showed that when planning for all modes is linked together there can be a significant imp
defaultrovement in overall performance; 
defaultCH2M HILL’s work as Delivery Partner on 
defaultthis proje
defaultct
default 
defaultrequired 
defaultthe integration of water, rail and road systems for the efficient management of traffic, particularly freight. 
defaultExternal multi-modal passenger information screens were deployed
default, greatly streamlining travel times to and from venues. Widespread 
defaultimplementation of such a technology would be greatly beneficial to users of all forms of transport.
defaultThe government is currently collating the results of a consultation on potential reforms to Inte
defaultgrated Transport Block funding. 
defaultOne area for potential impro
defaultvement is the planning and coordination of integrated transport in the six Metropolitan Areas; in particular, the divided responsibility for road planning and investment has been detrimental in the London area. 
defaultThe weighting of
default public transport and congest
defaultion
default needs in the funding formula is being reconsidered, and may be raised. 
defaultIn accordance for our regulatory recommendations below, the establishment of a High-Level Output Specification for roads would be directly analogous to that for the rail network; a
defaults such, it would be relatively easy to integrate plans for both networks, particularly if the regulatory cycles for both utilities are aligned.
default 
default3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn recent years, travel by car has dropped somewhat in Britain, using kilometres travelled per person as a metr
defaultic. 
defaultThe Department for Transport’s forecasts acknowledge this decline, but do not appear to account for the reasons for it.
defaultStudies show that the
default 
defaultdecline is 
defaultlargely due to external factors, such as rising fuel prices, the cost of insurance and 
defaulttaxation.
default Should this trend continue, 
defaultprivate car 
defaultdemand may be lower in the coming years than currently predicted by the 
defaultgovernment.
default 
default 
defaultOn the other hand, r
defaultoad freight is also sharply increasing; in conjunction with the fall in car travel, this trend may be 
defaultconnected with the steady rise 
defaultin internet shopping
default. Thus
default, the fall in individual demand may be counterbalanced by the rise in commercial transport.
default As above, integrated planning is essential to deliver the capacity for increased freight traffic.
defaultThe gover
defaultnment can deal with uncertainty in 
defaultdemand 
defaultforecasts through the use of a range of 
defaultdifferent 
defaultforecasts
default rather than a monolithic one
default, and 
defaultalso by understanding how forecasts have been produced by 
defaultbreaking down predictions into 
defaulttheir 
defaultconstituent parts. For example, an exogenous growth forecast could be based upon 
defaultchanges in factors such as 
defaultGDP
default (for disposable income)
default, population growth, employment, fuel costs and insurance costs
default. 
defaultBy understanding the assumptions behind and the signific
defaultance of each of these factors, forecasts can be updated as economic indicators 
defaultchange over time.  
defaultThe Department for Transport currently utilises a 
defaultregularly updated Rail Usage Demand Database from which 
defaultforecasts of 
defaultrail 
defaultpassenger demand
default are derived
default.
default A si
defaultmilar system could be established for roads.
default4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe r
defaulteliability 
defaultand efficiency of travel 
defaulton the strategic road network can be improved through 
defaultthe implementation of 
defaultsmarter technology. 
defaultFor example t
defaulthe provision of real-time information to users 
defaultand the 
defaultphasing of traffic lights to minimise delays
default lead to tangible improvements in journey times. The Highways Agency is seeking to launch a workable driver information service through 
defaultsmartphones
default and GPS in 2014.
defaultThe use of laser scanners by police to record n
defaultecessary information from traffic incidents provides an average reduction of 40 minutes in road closures. 
defaultThis technology is currently being used by 
default27 police forces, and further investment should prove beneficial. By the same token, investment in safety m
defaulteasures prevents incidents and further improves the reliability of the network. 
defaultThe results of the M42 managed motorway trial suggest that widespread implementation of this programme 
defaultc
defaultould sharply reduce the incidence of accidents and fatalities, increase 
defaultcapacity a
defaultnd decrease journey times. Additionally, emissions and noise levels are also reduced.
defaultOne aim of t
defaulthe government’s current investment programme
default is to resurface 80% of the strategic road network by 2021, as well as carrying out other maintenance and enhancement projects.
default Res
defaulturfacing
default 
defaultreduces the amount of damage caused 
defaultto vehicles from potholes, decreasing the number of breakdowns and improving
default eff
defaulticiency
default. 
defaultHowever, the challenge of managing road space and maintaining journey time reliability during such a significant programme of investment must be addressed; as most work is already carried out at night, options for avoiding disruption are limited.
defaultRevising the Agency’s funding cycle to a 5-year regulatory period would facilitate a constant stream of maintenance work, as opposed to the discontinuous nature of the annual budgetary cycle. 
defaultThis transition also presents the opportunity to redefine the st
defaultrategic road network to include key entry points and junctions, helping to avoid congestion at intersections between the SRN and local system
defaults
default.
defaultOther new technology can address environmental concerns while delivering efficiencies and reliability; 
defaultcurrently, a system of ‘smart’ highways is being piloted in the Netherlands, which includes solar-powered street markings to indicate wet or icy sections of road, and windmill-powered efficient street lighting that is only active when vehicles are within a
default certain range, saving large amo
defaultunts i
defaultn energy costs. This project should be closely observed, and if successful and cost-effective, implemented in the UK.
defaultAs detailed below, converting the strategic road network into a regulated utility will create a clea
defaultr, long-term output specification for performance with well-defined standards for safety and resilience, and the Highways Agency will be held to account for failures.
default 
default5.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe implementation of a Regulatory Asset Base (R
defaultAB) model is one option for increasing i
defaultnvestment in the strategic road network,
default and has been used extensively in the corporatisation of other public ass
defaultets in the UK
default and across Europe
default. Rail is the most similar sector, but it also applies to water, power and airports in the UK. 
defaultThis mo
defaultdel uses 
defaultthe valuation of network assets as a basis for setting access charges, outputs and incentive structures across predetermined control periods.
default Using such a structure would provide certainty of funding for the network, reducing the costs of uncertainty from 
defaultthe annual budgetary cycle. Instead, longer regulatory cycles would be used, providing investment horizons of 5 years or longer.
defaultT
defaulthe 
defaultstrategic road network
default would form the core 
defaultof a highways
default 
defaultRAB
default. The model has several advantages over a PPP or PFI model; 
defaultnamely that its cost of capital is cheaper, the valuation of its assets forms a solid and consistent foundation for a sustainable price control, and a pricing cap imposed by an independent regulator provides transparency and reassurance to consumers and fi
defaultnance providers. However, an accurate valuation of the entire SRN is likely to require a lengthy audit. Thus, an approximation will be necessary, with initial financing based on this valuation.
default Such an approximation
default was used
default in establishing the RAB for Net
defaultwork Rail.
default As a case s
defaulttudy, 
defaultthe use of the model in restructuring Scottish Water serve
defaults
default as an example of best practice
default, with drastic increases in quality of service concurrent with a 35% decrease in operational expenditures over a 10-year period
default.
defaultAs a 
defaultgovernment-owned company, the Highways Agency will be capable of borrowing from the private sector, allowing for increased financial flexibility.
default 
defaultThis is a
default 
defaultfeature of most regulatory regimes and 
defaultallows the company
default to manage
default 
defaultits business 
defaulteffectively over 
defaultre
defaultgulatory period
defaults. 
defaultSuch a reserve could also protect the
default 
defaultconsumer by 
defaultproviding insulation
default between long-term planning requirements and the shorter
default 
defaultterm public expenditure framework
default.
defaultThe precise method of securing a revenue 
defaultstream,
default and associated financing fo
defaultr the SRN cannot be finalised until broader policy questions on road charging have been considered. We are experienced in various approaches to tolling that are used to charge road users for access to strategic highways assets: for example, the Agency may 
defaultwish to adopt systems tailored by factors such as peak time, location and vehicle emissions. The European Union mandates that electronic toll systems be compatible with those on the continent, so it may be sensible to use a ‘badge’ system such as that used
default by the French, which seamlessly integrates toll systems from all regions with no work required on the part of the road user.
defaultIf an alternative method of charging is implemented, a transition
defaultal
default period of shadow tolling 
defaultis likely to be essential
default, in which
default the government
default 
defaultpay
defaults operators for road
default usage rather than 
defaultconsumers
default. 
defaultThis payment is 
defaultbased on the num
default&#xad;
defaultber and type of vehi
default&#xad;
defaultcles using the road, with adjust
default&#xad;
defaultments made for lane clo
default&#xad;
defaultsure and safety per
default&#xad;
defaultfor
default&#xad;
defaultmance
default.
default This system is useful in
default transferring
default 
defaultt
defaultraffic risk 
defaultto developers and 
defaultoperator
defaults
default as it
default 
defaultdoes not impair traffic levels in the same manner as
default real tolls or toll increases
default do
default; 
defaultit 
defaultallows the government to draw upon m
defaultultiple sources of revenue
default 
defaultto contri
defaultbute to a shadow toll fund; and p
defaultroject cost obli

defaultctor sponsor
default in terms of 
defaultcapi
defaulttal, maintenance and operations costs 
defaultshould
default be reasonably known in advance
default,
default and
default can be
default guaranteed 
defaultfor a particular traffic level.
defaultTo 
defaultovercome
default the general aversion to tolling that is historically observed in the UK, it is 
defaultour 
defaultrecomm
defaultendation
default that Vehicle Excise Duty, 
defaulto
defaultr a portion thereof,
default b
defaulte phased out. In the transition period, VED could be used as a source of revenue for shadow tolls, while 
defaultbeing replaced by actual tolls over a set period of time; 5 to 10 years
default (one to two regulatory cycles)
default may be appropriate.
defaultIn the same fashion as Network Rail, we expect that Government will set out the funding requirements for the ne
defaulttwork in a High-
defaultLevel 
defaultOutput Specification,
default an outcome-based programme for 
defaultthe framework. This will probably be done 
defaultover
default five year periods. We expect that HA will work with the independent regulator and the government to finalise this specification. The independent regulator will determine an affordable price cap and the level of returns allowed on the RAB, and HA will set 
defaulta planning framework, overall objectives and licensing agreements for regional operators. The operators will draw their capital from the financial markets, and provide access to road users who will pay VED, tolls, and/or analogous charges to the operators,
default and taxes to the government. 
defaultAn
default interpretation of this
default system is laid out in the diagram below.
defaultBased on the size of the network and experience with other utilities, the use of several regional operators is recommended. A simple method of dividing the reg
defaultions would be to use the 13 existing HA areas. This allows for performance to be benchmarked between regions, enabling the regulator to compare unit costs and identify efficiencies.

defaultThe World Economic Forum
default’s Global Competitiveness Report
default ra
defaultnks
default France as 
defaultthe best highway operator in the world
default, with the UK in twenty-fourth place
default. However, 
defaultthe metric used in this survey was strictly output-based, in that it relied on the opinions of business leaders regarding the quality of road infrastructure in their own country. As such, it is theoretically possible that the leading agency could be ineffi
defaultcient in the allocation of its resources, yet still delivering a good set of outputs. By contrast, 
defaultwe believe the leading agency should follow
default the
default aforementioned
default example of Scottish Water; achieving increased quality of service for road users, while delive
defaultring cost efficiencies from 
defaultwithin
default.
default 
defaultA 
defaultwell implemented
default RAB offers the opportunity for both
default.
default Private sector expertise in corporatisation should be drawn on extensively during the transition.
defaultThe reformation of the Highways Agency is 
defaultkey
default to the successful
default implementation of a RAB model, and many of the 
defaultnecessary 
defaultchanges specific to this issue are outlined in the previous section.
default Other benefits to reform in line 
defaultwith the reco
defaultmmendations of the Cook Report
default are detailed below
default.
defaultDistance from central government 
defaultwould
default remove the HA’s focus from 
defaultpolitically charged 
defaulthigh-profile local matters, specific schemes and programmes, and operational and
default 
defaultmethodological techniques in areas such as traffic management, information services and
default 
defaultreliability measures
default, allowing for strategic policymaking in terms of value for money, resource allocation and the customer experience.
defaultThe use of a High-Level Output Specification would provide: 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultnecessary pressure on the Agency to create an evidence base
default for informed asset management decisions; 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaulttransparency regarding long term goals and success in achieving these;
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultforesight regarding capacity and maintenance needs; and
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultcertainty
default of policy direction and freedom from reactive political decisions.
defaultAs the st
defaultrategic road network is a natural monopoly, 
defaultcompetition does not exist to drive costs down or incentivise good performance. 
defaultHowever
default, regulatory pressure can fill 
defaultthe gap
default, providing these public goods
default.
default This
default benefit
default has been observed in the corporatisation of other public utilities in the UK.
default It is recommended that this function be carried out by an entity separate from the Department for Transport which would be appropriately resourced and insulated from political p
defaultressures.
defaultThe removal of civil service constraints would also be beneficial to the Agency in several areas. Most importantly, if wages are improved at senior levels and performance related bonuses implemented, the Agency will be able to compete with the pr
defaultivate sector to recruit and retain the best commercial talent.
default A relaxation of bureaucratic controls would reduce wastage, and allow p
defaultrocedural flexibility 
defaultto
default improve responsiveness 
defaultto operational issues.
default 
defaultI
defaultnternal benchmarking should be used to maintain be
defaultst practice.
defaultConclusiondefaultIn summary, 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe government’s plans for the strategic road network have the potential to deliver great improvements in quality of service, cost efficiencies and environmental concerns, as well as laying the groundwork for intensive 
defaultreforms to the Highways Agency.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMulti-modal 
defaultplanning is essential to deliver quality of service and cost efficiencies. By moving the Agency to a similar regulatory regime to Network Rail, it will be easier to plan for both networks at once.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are sever
defaultal methods the government can use to add rigour to its road use demand forecasts. It is also advised that research into the ongoing decline in individual private car use be carried out.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultContinuing investment into the adoption of new technologies will deliv
defaulter safer, more environmentally friendly and more efficient roads. 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe use of a Regulatory Asset Base is proven to deliver efficiencies in many public utilities, and will provide opportunities for the Highways Agency to decrease unit costs while increasing
default quality of service.
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo this end, a variety of supporting reforms are recommended.
default&#xa0;
defaultIdeally, a workable long-term investment strategy and business plan for the SRN should be delivered by the end of 2014, in preparation for a transition process starting in 
defaultearly 2015. 
defaultThe Agency
default will also need to deal with challenges and constraints
default 
defaultsuch as skills/training and network occupancy while the annual capital expenditure on major road schemes triples over the next decade to accommodate expected growth. Many changes
default are expected, but with careful management and advice, 
defaultthe Highways Agency can
default ensure that the transition to a fully effective corporate body is smooth, and that the supply chain and wider industry have the capacity and capability to deliver the required l
defaultevel of investment.
