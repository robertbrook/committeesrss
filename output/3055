[normal]How should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s 
[normal]leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network
[normal]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The government plans to triple spending on road enhancements by 2021, and resurface 
[normal]over 3000 miles
[normal] of the strategic road network, in an effort to
[normal] 
[normal]redress the effects of
[normal] past underi
[normal]nvestment, as well as 
[normal]preparing for
[normal] large increases in
[normal] required
[normal] capacity, and researching and implementing solutions for 
[normal]areas with enduring traffic issues.
[normal] If properly implemented, this programme may alleviate the congestion that is estimated to cost the British economy up to £14bn per annum by 2025.
[normal]Many opportunities are presented for efficiencies and smarter road usage.
[normal] The government recognises the impo
[normal]rtance of local road networks in supporting the strategic network, and is providing 
[normal]£6 billion for their maintenance over the next six years. Building on this, we suggest that
[normal] 
[normal]r
[normal]edefining the strategic road network to include key entry points and junctions 
[normal]would help avoid congestion at intersections between the SRN and the local system.
[normal]The programme also offers £500 million in support of low-carbon technologies, with the aim of reducing the environmental footprint of road travel. Economies of scale in larg
[normal]e highway projects offer more opportunities to invest in environmental mitigation.  The potential spread of the managed motorways programme could deliver both cost and environmental efficiencies; the effects of this and other technological innovations are 
[normal]discussed in section 4.
[normal] 
[normal]In accordance with the recommendations of the Cook Report, independence from central government will 
[normal]allo
[normal]w the Highways Agency to realise large improvements for the strategic road network, 
[normal]which will be discussed in 
[normal]greater
[normal] detail below.
[normal] The introduction of 5-year control periods will also allow for 
[normal]a much longer planning horizon by freeing the Agency from the uncertainty of the annual Budget cycle. Furthermore, regulatory pressure is expected to create efficiencies of up to
[normal] 20%
[normal] in
[normal] unit costs within 5 years of implementation, translating to £600 million in savings by 2020.
[normal] Building on these plans, new funding options will also be available to the Agency.
[normal]2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the era of austerity, the potential
[normal] efficiency
[normal] gains from effective implementation
[normal] of multi-modal transport planning are relatively higher
[normal]. Integrated planning with other modes of transport is essential; for example, freight distribution centres 
[normal]and ports 
[normal]should 
[normal]have excellent 
[normal]link
[normal]s
[normal] to both the strate
[normal]gic road network and the rail network.
[normal]  
[normal]The success of the Olympic Games in London showed that when planning for all modes is linked together there can be a significant imp
[normal]rovement in overall performance; 
[normal]CH2M HILL’s work as Delivery Partner on 
[normal]this proje
[normal]ct
[normal] 
[normal]required 
[normal]the integration of water, rail and road systems for the efficient management of traffic, particularly freight. 
[normal]External multi-modal passenger information screens were deployed
[normal], greatly streamlining travel times to and from venues. Widespread 
[normal]implementation of such a technology would be greatly beneficial to users of all forms of transport.
[normal]The government is currently collating the results of a consultation on potential reforms to Inte
[normal]grated Transport Block funding. 
[normal]One area for potential impro
[normal]vement is the planning and coordination of integrated transport in the six Metropolitan Areas; in particular, the divided responsibility for road planning and investment has been detrimental in the London area. 
[normal]The weighting of
[normal] public transport and congest
[normal]ion
[normal] needs in the funding formula is being reconsidered, and may be raised. 
[normal]In accordance for our regulatory recommendations below, the establishment of a High-Level Output Specification for roads would be directly analogous to that for the rail network; a
[normal]s such, it would be relatively easy to integrate plans for both networks, particularly if the regulatory cycles for both utilities are aligned.
[normal] 
[normal]3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In recent years, travel by car has dropped somewhat in Britain, using kilometres travelled per person as a metr
[normal]ic. 
[normal]The Department for Transport’s forecasts acknowledge this decline, but do not appear to account for the reasons for it.
[normal]Studies show that the
[normal] 
[normal]decline is 
[normal]largely due to external factors, such as rising fuel prices, the cost of insurance and 
[normal]taxation.
[normal] Should this trend continue, 
[normal]private car 
[normal]demand may be lower in the coming years than currently predicted by the 
[normal]government.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]On the other hand, r
[normal]oad freight is also sharply increasing; in conjunction with the fall in car travel, this trend may be 
[normal]connected with the steady rise 
[normal]in internet shopping
[normal]. Thus
[normal], the fall in individual demand may be counterbalanced by the rise in commercial transport.
[normal] As above, integrated planning is essential to deliver the capacity for increased freight traffic.
[normal]The gover
[normal]nment can deal with uncertainty in 
[normal]demand 
[normal]forecasts through the use of a range of 
[normal]different 
[normal]forecasts
[normal] rather than a monolithic one
[normal], and 
[normal]also by understanding how forecasts have been produced by 
[normal]breaking down predictions into 
[normal]their 
[normal]constituent parts. For example, an exogenous growth forecast could be based upon 
[normal]changes in factors such as 
[normal]GDP
[normal] (for disposable income)
[normal], population growth, employment, fuel costs and insurance costs
[normal]. 
[normal]By understanding the assumptions behind and the signific
[normal]ance of each of these factors, forecasts can be updated as economic indicators 
[normal]change over time.  
[normal]The Department for Transport currently utilises a 
[normal]regularly updated Rail Usage Demand Database from which 
[normal]forecasts of 
[normal]rail 
[normal]passenger demand
[normal] are derived
[normal].
[normal] A si
[normal]milar system could be established for roads.
[normal]4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The r
[normal]eliability 
[normal]and efficiency of travel 
[normal]on the strategic road network can be improved through 
[normal]the implementation of 
[normal]smarter technology. 
[normal]For example t
[normal]he provision of real-time information to users 
[normal]and the 
[normal]phasing of traffic lights to minimise delays
[normal] lead to tangible improvements in journey times. The Highways Agency is seeking to launch a workable driver information service through 
[normal]smartphones
[normal] and GPS in 2014.
[normal]The use of laser scanners by police to record n
[normal]ecessary information from traffic incidents provides an average reduction of 40 minutes in road closures. 
[normal]This technology is currently being used by 
[normal]27 police forces, and further investment should prove beneficial. By the same token, investment in safety m
[normal]easures prevents incidents and further improves the reliability of the network. 
[normal]The results of the M42 managed motorway trial suggest that widespread implementation of this programme 
[normal]c
[normal]ould sharply reduce the incidence of accidents and fatalities, increase 
[normal]capacity a
[normal]nd decrease journey times. Additionally, emissions and noise levels are also reduced.
[normal]One aim of t
[normal]he government’s current investment programme
[normal] is to resurface 80% of the strategic road network by 2021, as well as carrying out other maintenance and enhancement projects.
[normal] Res
[normal]urfacing
[normal] 
[normal]reduces the amount of damage caused 
[normal]to vehicles from potholes, decreasing the number of breakdowns and improving
[normal] eff
[normal]iciency
[normal]. 
[normal]However, the challenge of managing road space and maintaining journey time reliability during such a significant programme of investment must be addressed; as most work is already carried out at night, options for avoiding disruption are limited.
[normal]Revising the Agency’s funding cycle to a 5-year regulatory period would facilitate a constant stream of maintenance work, as opposed to the discontinuous nature of the annual budgetary cycle. 
[normal]This transition also presents the opportunity to redefine the st
[normal]rategic road network to include key entry points and junctions, helping to avoid congestion at intersections between the SRN and local system
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]Other new technology can address environmental concerns while delivering efficiencies and reliability; 
[normal]currently, a system of ‘smart’ highways is being piloted in the Netherlands, which includes solar-powered street markings to indicate wet or icy sections of road, and windmill-powered efficient street lighting that is only active when vehicles are within a
[normal] certain range, saving large amo
[normal]unts i
[normal]n energy costs. This project should be closely observed, and if successful and cost-effective, implemented in the UK.
[normal]As detailed below, converting the strategic road network into a regulated utility will create a clea
[normal]r, long-term output specification for performance with well-defined standards for safety and resilience, and the Highways Agency will be held to account for failures.
[normal] 
[normal]5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The implementation of a Regulatory Asset Base (R
[normal]AB) model is one option for increasing i
[normal]nvestment in the strategic road network,
[normal] and has been used extensively in the corporatisation of other public ass
[normal]ets in the UK
[normal] and across Europe
[normal]. Rail is the most similar sector, but it also applies to water, power and airports in the UK. 
[normal]This mo
[normal]del uses 
[normal]the valuation of network assets as a basis for setting access charges, outputs and incentive structures across predetermined control periods.
[normal] Using such a structure would provide certainty of funding for the network, reducing the costs of uncertainty from 
[normal]the annual budgetary cycle. Instead, longer regulatory cycles would be used, providing investment horizons of 5 years or longer.
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]strategic road network
[normal] would form the core 
[normal]of a highways
[normal] 
[normal]RAB
[normal]. The model has several advantages over a PPP or PFI model; 
[normal]namely that its cost of capital is cheaper, the valuation of its assets forms a solid and consistent foundation for a sustainable price control, and a pricing cap imposed by an independent regulator provides transparency and reassurance to consumers and fi
[normal]nance providers. However, an accurate valuation of the entire SRN is likely to require a lengthy audit. Thus, an approximation will be necessary, with initial financing based on this valuation.
[normal] Such an approximation
[normal] was used
[normal] in establishing the RAB for Net
[normal]work Rail.
[normal] As a case s
[normal]tudy, 
[normal]the use of the model in restructuring Scottish Water serve
[normal]s
[normal] as an example of best practice
[normal], with drastic increases in quality of service concurrent with a 35% decrease in operational expenditures over a 10-year period
[normal].
[normal]As a 
[normal]government-owned company, the Highways Agency will be capable of borrowing from the private sector, allowing for increased financial flexibility.
[normal] 
[normal]This is a
[normal] 
[normal]feature of most regulatory regimes and 
[normal]allows the company
[normal] to manage
[normal] 
[normal]its business 
[normal]effectively over 
[normal]re
[normal]gulatory period
[normal]s. 
[normal]Such a reserve could also protect the
[normal] 
[normal]consumer by 
[normal]providing insulation
[normal] between long-term planning requirements and the shorter
[normal] 
[normal]term public expenditure framework
[normal].
[normal]The precise method of securing a revenue 
[normal]stream,
[normal] and associated financing fo
[normal]r the SRN cannot be finalised until broader policy questions on road charging have been considered. We are experienced in various approaches to tolling that are used to charge road users for access to strategic highways assets: for example, the Agency may 
[normal]wish to adopt systems tailored by factors such as peak time, location and vehicle emissions. The European Union mandates that electronic toll systems be compatible with those on the continent, so it may be sensible to use a ‘badge’ system such as that used
[normal] by the French, which seamlessly integrates toll systems from all regions with no work required on the part of the road user.
[normal]If an alternative method of charging is implemented, a transition
[normal]al
[normal] period of shadow tolling 
[normal]is likely to be essential
[normal], in which
[normal] the government
[normal] 
[normal]pay
[normal]s operators for road
[normal] usage rather than 
[normal]consumers
[normal]. 
[normal]This payment is 
[normal]based on the num
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]ber and type of vehi
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]cles using the road, with adjust
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]ments made for lane clo
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]sure and safety per
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]for
[normal]&#xad;
[normal]mance
[normal].
[normal] This system is useful in
[normal] transferring
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]raffic risk 
[normal]to developers and 
[normal]operator
[normal]s
[normal] as it
[normal] 
[normal]does not impair traffic levels in the same manner as
[normal] real tolls or toll increases
[normal] do
[normal]; 
[normal]it 
[normal]allows the government to draw upon m
[normal]ultiple sources of revenue
[normal] 
[normal]to contri
[normal]bute to a shadow toll fund; and p
[normal]roject cost obli
[normal]gations to the public se
[normal]ctor sponsor
[normal] in terms of 
[normal]capi
[normal]tal, maintenance and operations costs 
[normal]should
[normal] be reasonably known in advance
[normal],
[normal] and
[normal] can be
[normal] guaranteed 
[normal]for a particular traffic level.
[normal]To 
[normal]overcome
[normal] the general aversion to tolling that is historically observed in the UK, it is 
[normal]our 
[normal]recomm
[normal]endation
[normal] that Vehicle Excise Duty, 
[normal]o
[normal]r a portion thereof,
[normal] b
[normal]e phased out. In the transition period, VED could be used as a source of revenue for shadow tolls, while 
[normal]being replaced by actual tolls over a set period of time; 5 to 10 years
[normal] (one to two regulatory cycles)
[normal] may be appropriate.
[normal]In the same fashion as Network Rail, we expect that Government will set out the funding requirements for the ne
[normal]twork in a High-
[normal]Level 
[normal]Output Specification,
[normal] an outcome-based programme for 
[normal]the framework. This will probably be done 
[normal]over
[normal] five year periods. We expect that HA will work with the independent regulator and the government to finalise this specification. The independent regulator will determine an affordable price cap and the level of returns allowed on the RAB, and HA will set 
[normal]a planning framework, overall objectives and licensing agreements for regional operators. The operators will draw their capital from the financial markets, and provide access to road users who will pay VED, tolls, and/or analogous charges to the operators,
[normal] and taxes to the government. 
[normal]An
[normal] interpretation of this
[normal] system is laid out in the diagram below.
[normal]Based on the size of the network and experience with other utilities, the use of several regional operators is recommended. A simple method of dividing the reg
[normal]ions would be to use the 13 existing HA areas. This allows for performance to be benchmarked between regions, enabling the regulator to compare unit costs and identify efficiencies.
[normal]6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The World Economic Forum
[normal]’s Global Competitiveness Report
[normal] ra
[normal]nks
[normal] France as 
[normal]the best highway operator in the world
[normal], with the UK in twenty-fourth place
[normal]. However, 
[normal]the metric used in this survey was strictly output-based, in that it relied on the opinions of business leaders regarding the quality of road infrastructure in their own country. As such, it is theoretically possible that the leading agency could be ineffi
[normal]cient in the allocation of its resources, yet still delivering a good set of outputs. By contrast, 
[normal]we believe the leading agency should follow
[normal] the
[normal] aforementioned
[normal] example of Scottish Water; achieving increased quality of service for road users, while delive
[normal]ring cost efficiencies from 
[normal]within
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]well implemented
[normal] RAB offers the opportunity for both
[normal].
[normal] Private sector expertise in corporatisation should be drawn on extensively during the transition.
[normal]The reformation of the Highways Agency is 
[normal]key
[normal] to the successful
[normal] implementation of a RAB model, and many of the 
[normal]necessary 
[normal]changes specific to this issue are outlined in the previous section.
[normal] Other benefits to reform in line 
[normal]with the reco
[normal]mmendations of the Cook Report
[normal] are detailed below
[normal].
[normal]Distance from central government 
[normal]would
[normal] remove the HA’s focus from 
[normal]politically charged 
[normal]high-profile local matters, specific schemes and programmes, and operational and
[normal] 
[normal]methodological techniques in areas such as traffic management, information services and
[normal] 
[normal]reliability measures
[normal], allowing for strategic policymaking in terms of value for money, resource allocation and the customer experience.
[normal]The use of a High-Level Output Specification would provide: 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]necessary pressure on the Agency to create an evidence base
[normal] for informed asset management decisions; 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]transparency regarding long term goals and success in achieving these;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]foresight regarding capacity and maintenance needs; and
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]certainty
[normal] of policy direction and freedom from reactive political decisions.
[normal]As the st
[normal]rategic road network is a natural monopoly, 
[normal]competition does not exist to drive costs down or incentivise good performance. 
[normal]However
[normal], regulatory pressure can fill 
[normal]the gap
[normal], providing these public goods
[normal].
[normal] This
[normal] benefit
[normal] has been observed in the corporatisation of other public utilities in the UK.
[normal] It is recommended that this function be carried out by an entity separate from the Department for Transport which would be appropriately resourced and insulated from political p
[normal]ressures.
[normal]The removal of civil service constraints would also be beneficial to the Agency in several areas. Most importantly, if wages are improved at senior levels and performance related bonuses implemented, the Agency will be able to compete with the pr
[normal]ivate sector to recruit and retain the best commercial talent.
[normal] A relaxation of bureaucratic controls would reduce wastage, and allow p
[normal]rocedural flexibility 
[normal]to
[normal] improve responsiveness 
[normal]to operational issues.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]nternal benchmarking should be used to maintain be
[normal]st practice.
[normal]Conclusion[bold]In summary, 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The government’s plans for the strategic road network have the potential to deliver great improvements in quality of service, cost efficiencies and environmental concerns, as well as laying the groundwork for intensive 
[normal]reforms to the Highways Agency.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Multi-modal 
[normal]planning is essential to deliver quality of service and cost efficiencies. By moving the Agency to a similar regulatory regime to Network Rail, it will be easier to plan for both networks at once.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are sever
[normal]al methods the government can use to add rigour to its road use demand forecasts. It is also advised that research into the ongoing decline in individual private car use be carried out.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Continuing investment into the adoption of new technologies will deliv
[normal]er safer, more environmentally friendly and more efficient roads. 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The use of a Regulatory Asset Base is proven to deliver efficiencies in many public utilities, and will provide opportunities for the Highways Agency to decrease unit costs while increasing
[normal] quality of service.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To this end, a variety of supporting reforms are recommended.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ideally, a workable long-term investment strategy and business plan for the SRN should be delivered by the end of 2014, in preparation for a transition process starting in 
[normal]early 2015. 
[normal]The Agency
[normal] will also need to deal with challenges and constraints
[normal] 
[normal]such as skills/training and network occupancy while the annual capital expenditure on major road schemes triples over the next decade to accommodate expected growth. Many changes
[normal] are expected, but with careful management and advice, 
[normal]the Highways Agency can
[normal] ensure that the transition to a fully effective corporate body is smooth, and that the supply chain and wider industry have the capacity and capability to deliver the required l
[normal]evel of investment.
