defaultHouse of Lords Communications Committee – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your letter of 30 July inviting the Communications Committee to comment on the Draft Deregulation Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe only section of the Bill which falls within the Communications 
defaultCommittee’s remit is 26-
default&#xa0;
defaultCommunications
default26 Repeal of power to make provision for blocking injunctionsdefault&#xa0;
defaultIn the Digital Economy Act 2010, omit sections 17 and 18 (which confer power on the Secretary of State to make regulations about the granting by courts 
defaultof injunctions requiring the blocking of websites that infringe copyright).
default&#xa0;
defaultAs you know, the Digital Economy Act received Royal Assent towards the very end of the last Parliament and most of it came into force in June 2010.  However, following criticism o
defaultf the powers relating to website blocking, the Government asked Ofcom to review whether sections 17 and 18 of the Act were technically workable
default. Following this review, the Government announced in August 2011 that they would not bring forward site blocking
default regulations under the Digital Economy Act at that time but would “be doing more work on what measures
default can be pursued to tackle online copyright infringement.”
default&#xa0;
defaultWhilst we make no comment on the merits of sections 17 and 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010,
default we are not aware of any further work which the Government has done to identify other measures which could be pursued to tackle online copyright infringement.  It seems to us that there might be merit in the Joint Committee on the draft bill firstly ascert
defaultaining what further research the Government has carried out on this issue and second exploring with witnesses the merits or otherwise of dropping sections 17 and 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010.
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope this is helpful to your Committee.
