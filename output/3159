[normal]House of Lords Communications Committee – Written evidence[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Thank you for your letter of 30 July inviting the Communications Committee to comment on the Draft Deregulation Bill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The only section of the Bill which falls within the Communications 
[normal]Committee’s remit is 26-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Communications
[normal]26 Repeal of power to make provision for blocking injunctions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]In the Digital Economy Act 2010, omit sections 17 and 18 (which confer power on the Secretary of State to make regulations about the granting by courts 
[normal]of injunctions requiring the blocking of websites that infringe copyright).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As you know, the Digital Economy Act received Royal Assent towards the very end of the last Parliament and most of it came into force in June 2010.  However, following criticism o
[normal]f the powers relating to website blocking, the Government asked Ofcom to review whether sections 17 and 18 of the Act were technically workable
[normal]. Following this review, the Government announced in August 2011 that they would not bring forward site blocking
[normal] regulations under the Digital Economy Act at that time but would “be doing more work on what measures
[normal] can be pursued to tackle online copyright infringement.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst we make no comment on the merits of sections 17 and 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010,
[normal] we are not aware of any further work which the Government has done to identify other measures which could be pursued to tackle online copyright infringement.  It seems to us that there might be merit in the Joint Committee on the draft bill firstly ascert
[normal]aining what further research the Government has carried out on this issue and second exploring with witnesses the merits or otherwise of dropping sections 17 and 18 of the Digital Economy Act 2010.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I hope this is helpful to your Committee.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lord Inglewood
[normal]Chairman of the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications
