defaultAbout TABSdefault1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultTABS is a trade association which works with
default the Department for Transport to ensure the highest quality of delivery of Bikeability cycle training. TABS aims to work in the interest of Bikeability schemes, and represents the view of the professional cycle training industry in discussions and decision
default-making activities with Government agencies and other public bodies. TABS’s ultimate aim is more people taking trips by bike more often and more safely.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultChris Boardman submitted a statement expressing the support of the work that TABS is doing: 
default“Cycling 
defaulthas never been more important than now in terms of promoting enjoyable physical activity.  Being able to ride a bike confidently on road, with minimum risk, is an essential life skill for an active and healthy lifestyle. Bikeability has an important role t
defaulto play in giving people of all ages, especially the next generation of young people and their parents, the skills and confidence to make everyday trips by bike. If we want to transform cycling in this country we need to do all we can to make a difference a
defaultnd make sure that the government is taking us seriously.
defaultI welcome the role of TABS in making the case for the continued funding for Bikeability beyond the term of this current government.”
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultTABS has been delivering courses across the sector aiming to ensu
defaultre the consistency of the quality delivery of cycle training on behalf of the Department for Transport. This seminar is based on principles of 
defaultRoad Danger Reduction
default, which aim to promote benign active travel and reduce t
defaulthe source of road danger. We are submitting a number of case studies which give an overview of work in this area, especially around training drivers.

defaultTraining people who ride bicyclesdefault2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhy train cyclists? Surely anyone can ride a bike? Ideally the spaces w
defaulthere people live, work and shop should be accessible on foot and on bike without any special training, and this is largely the case. The majority of people who cycle manage perfectly well with little guidance and statistically, riding a bike is a low risk 
defaultactivity per mile travelled. There are, however, many people who perceive cycling as more risky than it is, people who would cycle if they had help with gaining the skills and confidence to do so. Training  these people helps them make the transition from 
defaultsomeone who is reluctant to ride due to perceived risk to some who can ride anywhere with confidence in a short time. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
default(One argument for separating people on bikes from people in cars is that many more people would take to cycling on road after a 
defaultfew mont
defaulths
default of experience riding in a 
defaultsegregated environment. People who undergo cycle training can make this transition in 2-4 hours!)
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultEven confident people who already cycle can benefit from training. As with any activity input from an expert can increase effici
defaultency thereby improving the enjoyment of cycling, perhaps increase peoples speed (by encouraging them to ride as part of the traffic flow) and definitely ensuring that what is a relatively low risk activity becomes even less risky.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultPeople who cycle are mor
defaulte likely to ride their bikes more often, make longer trips and cycle in all seasons as evidenced in 
default research
default commissioned by Transport for London in 2003.

defaultTraining people who drive to be aware of cyclistsdefault3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultSome Bikeability schemes
default in London were delivering cyclists/driver awareness sessions  since 2007. These sessions were largely theoretical, classroom-based sessions. They were delivered to all people who drove for some London councils on council business. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultFollowing the success 
defaultof this scheme, Bikeability schemes were commissioned to develop a programme whereby lorry drivers, contracted by the councils, received on bike training in addition to a theory session. (This anecdotally fostered much empathy between some council’s driver
defaults and local cyclists). This programme was replicated with bus companies (Abellio, Stagecoach and Go Ahead) who also agreed to go one step further and training bus driver trainers as cycling instructors in order to deliver this more sustainably in-house.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultEncouraged by the success of the driver training TFL, in partnership with Bikeability schemes, developed an on-bike driver/cyclist awareness course that met HGV/PCV 
defaultCPC
default outcomes. These courses were submitted to JAUPT, the CPC accrediting body by  Transport for London. Out of this came the Safe Urban Driving course (SUD) which is being promoted to many professional drivers who use London’s roads through the Freight 
defaultOperators Recognition Scheme (FORS).
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0; 
default The one day training SUD course comprises of a practical and a theory module and contributes 7 hours towards the legal CPC requirement of 35 hours of professional training for drivers. The aims of this course are:
default●
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultto 
defaultensure passenger comfort and safety
default●
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo know the social environment of road transport
default●
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo make drivers aware of the risks of the road
default●
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultto adopt behaviour to help enhance the image of the company
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn outcome of the development of this training has been interes
defaultt from professional drivers who are not required to undergo CPC training in particular the private can hire company Addison Lee who piloted this training for 20 drivers then trained their own trainers to deliver this on bike driver/cyclists awareness train
defaulting in-house.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultMaking cycle training a prerequisite of driver training may lead to better and more responsible drivers as well as drivers who can cycle and may feel happy about making some trips by bike rather than in a car. We are looking forward to input
defaultting to the proposed Green Paper on young driver training

defaultRecommendations default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultActive promotion of cycling:default While we are sure many submis
defaultsions to the select committee will highlight the need to redesign the road environment helping to reduce the risk and the perception of risk, we believe cheaper immediate wins could be achieved by positive marketing of cycling as desirable low risk benign 
defaultactivity that anyone can do.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultCreate a road sharing environment:default Bikeability and National Standard cycle training gives people on bikes the skills to share the road with people in motor vehicles by communicating to them through looking and road positioning
default. Ensuring that the speed differential between modes is low would encourage riders to move within the flow of traffic and discourage drivers from ‘punishing’ people on bikes using aggressive behaviour when the driver perceives the cyclists as ‘in their way
default’. 20mph (or lower) speed limits in all urban areas, enforced through design and policing would help people share the road space
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultFunding and promotion of adult cycle trainingdefault: rebranding it to remove the child-centred stigma attached (Urban riding skills 
defaulttraining perhaps?) would help adults make the transition from off road leisure riders to everyday cyclists in a short time. T
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultContinued funding and promotion of Bikeability for young people:default through the Bikeability schemes and Youth Sports Trusts. Such fu
defaultnding should be guaranteed across terms of government. Up-skilling people of all ages through training as well as messages about how to road share will minimise risk on the roads
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultFunding and promotion of on-bike driver trainingdefault: While this has been happen
defaulting for too short a time to accrue more than anecdotal evidence of the value of getting drivers on bikes there is definitely a case from the small amount of feedback received from participants (TfL have this data) to recommend that this scheme be scaled up
default nationally and that anyone who drives a lorry or a bus on roads where people ride bikes should get such training. The training should also be rolled-out to all professional drivers.
default&#xa0;
default4.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultCycle training for anyone who a gets a driving licencedefault: If, as a society
default we seriously wish to normalise cycling and minimise road risk, demonstrating the ability to ride on road and understand the basics of the highway code should be demonstrated on a bicycle before people are allowed a provisional driving licence.
