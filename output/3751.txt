[[[Written evidence from Mr Barry Anderson]]]My name is Barry Anderson and this is my personal view.I have been employed by Peterborough Regional College for the past 12 years as an AM2 electrical examiner.I am a time served electrician holding a City &amp; guilds C certificate, City &amp; Guilds 2382 17th edition Electrical Wiring Regulations &amp; City &amp; Guilds 2391 Inspection &amp; Testing.Below I have listed the problems I believe to exist.I fail to see how somebody can be competent in such a short space of time.I see these bodies as money making organisations trying to keep a niche market for themselves. &#xa0;The solution is have only time-served tradesmen who have a JIB/ECS grading card (which has a photo of person proving identity) which already exists as a body having stamped on the card what level of competence they are at. The fee (approx £15) for this is far less than what the other organisations are charging. This is done on an individual basis not as a cover for one person in a company signing all employees work off. This would simplify the already very complicated and confusing system. How was this missed when first thinking about proving competence?              25 November 2013&#xa0;
