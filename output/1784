[normal]1. 
[normal]How do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities? 
[normal]It is not known how they do this at present, but ideally, methods of information gathering should include: looking at Parish, Community &amp;
[normal] Neighbourhood plans and building models on successful international examples.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Where services are currently poor, people may not realise that it is even possible to run their lives using public transport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] For this reason, simple questionnaires asking abo
[normal]ut demand may provide a be falsely low result compared to the possible success of schemes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] It is important to educate people about benefits of public transport rather than just accepting the status quo (of it frequently being seen as unpopular, unreliable
[normal] and therefore suffering from an ‘inbuilt’ lack of demand)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]To what extent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport t
[normal]o isolated communities?
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]In 
[normal]rural Cumbria, provision for schoolchildren is felt to be good – mix of private taxi at public expense and school bus. There is no special provision for them for leisure and evening bus services are infrequent (where they h
[normal]appen at all).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] There is some provision for elderly/passengers with disabilities by way of low access buses. Ideally all buses should eventually be low access. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated
[normal] communities? How could Community Transport be improved?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]Our local Voluntary Car Service in Above Derwent is popular and well used, but it could not operate without financial help from Cumbria County Council &amp; the WI. Publicity, subsidy from CCC and publ
[normal]icity are all vital. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]To what extent should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services? 
[normal]If one starts from the position that it is important to maintain rural communities rather than 
[normal]allow them to wither on the vine and let the countryside become the preserve of the second home owners and holiday makers; then local people should only be expected to rely on demand led service where there is absolutely no alternative.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] In rural areas, in
[normal]habitants already get a poorer quality service for many facilities than in urban regions so public funding should be made available to provide public transport. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated commun
[normal]ities? How can these services be made more affordable? 
[normal]Privatisation has allowed bus companies to cherry pick the profitable routes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Bus companies should only be able to provide complete services so there is cross subsidy built in to the system.  In addi
[normal]tion provision of mixed services should be considered (e.g. school buses being used by other passengers, school taxi’s being publicised and shared, post-buses etc)
