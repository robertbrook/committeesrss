"&#xa0;\nHouse of Commons Transport Committee – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are a number of issues relating to transport which are raised in the draft Bill and to which we wish to draw your attention.\n&#xa0;\nFirstly, we support the measures in clause 22 and schedule 7 which would permit PTEs to be involved in the provision of passenger rail services beyond their immediate areas. This is required in order to enable PTEs and other local authorities to have a greater role in rail franchising, something we expressed support for in our Rail 2020 report, which was published earlier this year (7th Report, 2012-13, paragraphs 61-65).\n \n              \nWe note that in Schedule 8 of the draft Bill, the requirement for the Secretary of State to approve permit schemes for conducting roadworks is removed. Although we are not opposed to this meas\nure in principle, \nwe have previously commented on the limited evidence of how permit schemes work in practice and \nrecommended that \nwide variation\ns between local authorities \nshould be assessed where \nthey do\n not reflect differences in local circumstances (see 9th Report, 2010-12, paragraphs 38-43). The Government rejected our recommendations (11th Special Report, 2010-12). We remain concerned that a multiplicity of approaches to permit schemes could increase costs to businesses which deal with numerous local authorities. This is an issue your Committee might wish to explore.\n&#xa0;\nWe took oral evidence on 10 September from the Shipping Minister on the Government’s maritime strategy and asked for further information about section 48 of the draft Bill, which deals with ambulatory references to international shipping instruments. The clause appears to give a far-reaching power to the Government to amend UK law to reflect changes to maritime treaties, bypassing Parliament entirely. We were told that this proposal only relates to technical changes which are “clogging up the system”. \nThe DfT has sent us a follow-up letter on this point, which I enclose. \nWe think this issue should be explored further. The clause may need to be amended to ensure that it cannot be used to prevent parliamentary consideration of substantive changes to international instruments which have been agreed by the Government but ought to be debated in and approved by Parliament.\n&#xa0;\nWe have received a submission from the UK Maritime Pilots’ Association about clause 25, relating to the circumstances in which a marine accident investigation can be reopened. \nI understand that you have also received this submission. In our view, it raises an important point, which ought to be considered.\n&#xa0;\nWe have no comments at present on other aspects of the draft Bill but will write again if other matters are brought up with us.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLouise Ellman MP\nChair of the Committee\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14 October\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
