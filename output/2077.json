"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Sustrans (SLC 014)&#xa0;\nExecutive summary\n&#xa0;\n1. \nSustrans is the \nUK\n’s leading sustainable transport charity. Our vision is a world in which people choose to travel in ways that benefit their health and the environment. We work on practical, innovative solutions to the transport challenges facing us all. Sustrans is the charity behind the award winning National Cycle Network, Safe Routes to Schools, Bike It, TravelSmart, Active Travel, Connect2 and Liveable Neighbourhoods, all projects that are changing our world one mile at a time.\n2. Sustrans’ most established and extensive project is the National Cycle Network which comprises 14,000 miles of walking and cycling routes and has been established across the \nUK\n since 1995. Around a third of the NCN is on traffic free paths, greenways and byways, while around 9,000 miles of the network uses local roads and quiet country lanes. The Network continues to grow by several hundred miles a year and has become a significant piece of \nUK\n transport infrastructure, carrying 485 million journeys in 2012/13.\n3\n. Railway lines which pass through communities often present significant barriers to people who want to make local journeys. The ability to cross them is vital to avoid communities being split, and to prevent people being separated from important destinations such as jobs, schools and amenities. Sustrans is pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this consultation because the National Cycle Network uses a significant number of level crossings in order to help people make journeys between local destinations, as well as bridges and under-passes of which there are many different designs, some significantly more user-friendly than others.\n3.1. Sustrans agrees that there are safety risks \nat\n level crossings and supports Network Rail’s commitment to cutting risk by 25% by March 2014. However Sustrans believes that there are aspects to how this strategy is being implemented by Network Rail which could have – and are having - a significant impact on the way people travel in the communities where the crossings exist. \n4. The key questions posed by the call for evidence which Sustrans would like to address are:\n4.1. In terms of whether safety measures at level crossings are adequate and how they should be improved, Sustrans strongly recommends consulting with local communities over the types of crossings they want, and consulting with local transport campaign\ner\ns and groups about what measures they would like to see in place. In locations where the National Cycle Network crosses a level crossing, Sustrans would be happy to participate in any consultation. Extensive research over many years has shown that people are often put off making short trips by foot or by bike if they face a major barrier or are asked to take a significant detour. At present Network Rail’s solution to improving safety at railway crossing points is to remove level crossings and replace them with standard-design bridges which feature both steps and ramps, the latter often being quite elaborate and which require people to make an extensive detour. \n4.2. Recent examples of such bridges show that little or no consultation with local communities was carried out before the solution of a ramped bridge was arrived at, and that ramps which require people to make a significant detour have been added. This appears to have been the chosen solution in order to ensure that a “standard” design bridge can be used and that the bridge stays within Network Rail’s land, rather than any desire to make a crossing suitable for the use it will receive or in line with the needs of the community it is in.\n4.3. Example – The Johnson’s Footpath crossing in Bishops Stortford in \nHertfordshire\n. There was a fatality at the former pedestrian level crossing which led to it being replaced \nvery quickly \nwith a footbridge. On one side the bridge connects very well to the local community and is easy for people to access via a simple and straight ramp, but on the other side, in order to accommodate the substantial cycle, pushchair and wheel chair use, the bridge uses several zig-zag ramps which require people to make a lengthy detour away from the desired alignment. \n The situation is complicated by the crossing being  a right of way and a number of different approaches to the level crossing, but the final result \n makes the railway crossing a much greater barrier than it was previously, adding to both time and inconvenience for people walking and cycling\n.  In this case all land is understood to belong to Network Rail and the Council so land should not have been an issue. \n While safety is evidently a concern at this site, the chosen solution has substantially reduced the user-friendliness of the crossing and early evidence suggests that use of this bridge has reduced since it was installed. This solution was imposed with\n little \nconsultation with local community groups\n, until after the design was finalised.\n \n \n   \nIllustrations - The photo on the left show\ns the former level crossing alignment, and new bridge with straight ramp which provides a direct and convenient route. The photo on the right sho\nws the zig-\nzag ramps under construction which make people make a lengthy detour.\n4.4 Example – \nPeterborough\n. The use of such bridges is not new and more established sites have shown that their installation can lead to a host of additional problems. \nThe East Coast main line passes through \nPeterborough\n and there are crossings of varying standards, which are typical of many towns and cities. \nAt the bridge over the East Coast Mainline between Walton and Bretton in \nPeterborough\n, which replaced a level crossing \nmany\n years ago, the consequences of a poor design are very serious. Whilst having a level crossing on such a major line would be hard to imagine now the bridge is between two major residential areas on a route that school children have to take if they walk or cycle. The poor quality of the infrastructure \nmust be a\n deterrent to walking and cycling and \npotentially lead to people choosing to go by car rather than walk or cycle. Whilst there are no known recent issues at this location bridges such as this can be \na focus of anti-social behaviour. Neither of these are the railway’s problem, but they are a major problem for the local communities. \nInterestingly about 100m away there used to be a bridge over a dual carriageway, which the Council have now removed and replaced it with an at-grade level crossing. The railways are going the other way.\n&#xa0;\nIllustrations - \nThe photo on the left sho\nw\ns the \nbridge which crosses the East Coast Mainline between Walton and Bretton, where poor design has led to issues with severance and anti-social behaviour. \n4.5 – Despite this experience there is a further proposal for a new bridge to replace an at-grade level crossing \nat \nFoxcovert Road\n, \nPeterborough\n.\n&#xa0;\nIllustrations - \nThe \ndiagrams above show Network Rail’s proposed new bridge at Foxcovert\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis is on National Cycle Network Route 12 which follows two closed roads. Cyclists have to dismount and cross the railway on foot. It generally works well, but sadly there was a fatality at the crossing recently when a small child crossed unsupervised. There is a strong local demand for a bridge and Network Rail is upgrading the line and planning a new bridge. The route is used by school children going between Werrington and Glinton, and it is a good popular route. However the one-size-fits-all design proposed by Network Rail, which they believe to be the cheapest and easiest solution and which stays within their land ownership, is likely to reduce usage based on the experiences nearby and elsewhere, and cause significant severance issues. Network Rail have not engaged in discussions with the community or with any other relevant parties such as Sustrans before reaching this solution which appears to be based on cost and convenience rather than safety and suitability. \n&#xa0;\nIllustrations - \nThe \nimages above show options for the crossing at \nFoxcovert Road\n. The first shows what can be achieved with an under-bridge while the latter shows how the Network Rail proposal turns a 10 metre crossing into a 250 metre one.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere is a similar issue near Thurston in \nSuffolk\n. The community’s preferred option is direct and convenient, but Network Rail prefer a steel zig-zag bridge. Again they quote cost and land issues as their reasons for this being the option they intend to proceed with.\n&#xa0;\nIllustration - \nThe \nimage\n sho\nw\ns \nalternatives for the proposed \nNetwork\n \nRail\n \nBridge\n at Thurston. \n4.6 There are several more examples of where a new, standard zig-zag-style bridge has been installed and which appears to be now acting as a barrier to local journeys and are starting to suppress demand, and these include locations such as Witham and the \nLea\n \nValley\n. Examples are not confined to the east and south east of \nEngland\n but there are a large number of quiet lane and pedestrian level crossings in these regions in particular, especially on the Essex Thameside and Greater Anglia franchises which both operate extensive networks.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. With reference to what other measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings, Sustrans has direct experience of establishing safe railway crossings which have lead to increased usage by the community they serve and which have no impact at all on the operational performance of the railway.\n&#xa0;\n5.1 One recent example is in the town of \nRoyston\n where a newly installed underpass, created through Sustrans’ Connect2 programme, opened in the last 12 months and has already proved to be extremely popular with a considerable increase in the number of local journeys made since it opened. \n&#xa0;\n   \nIllustration - \nThe \nphotos above\n sho\nw\n \nthe new underpass under the mainline at Royston in use\n&#xa0;\nThe railway has long been a considerable barrier to local journeys in Royston but the creation of the new pedestrian and cycling underpass and an associated network of safe routes for people to walk and cycle has allowed people to safely cross on a direct alignment. The work done at Royston, in partnership with Network Rail, was led by the local \nauthorities \nwho identified this as a key corridor for \npeople \nto make important journeys. \nThey worked closely with Network Rail, the Police, Sustrans and the local community to come up with a solution that works well \nand which has set a benchmark for other places to adopt.\n This was not easy and there was some opposition to the acquisition of land that was needed for the route but in the long term this has resulted in a good solution, to a problem that people had been trying to address for decades.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n  \nIllustration - \nThe \nimages\n sho\nw\n \nthe route which leads to the underpass at Royston and how it now forms a key part of a network of routes for local journeys throughout the community. \n5.2 The lesson here is not that an underpass is the best solution, but that consulting with the local communities\n \nthat the railway passes through\n and those who understand how to promote and encourage walking and cycling\n is vital to identify the best solution. If members of the select committee would like to see Royston first hand, Sustrans would be happy to arrange this.\n&#xa0;\n5.3 Sustrans would be \nextremely\n keen to \nhave the opportunity to \ngive oral evidence in support of this written submission, and would be happy to provide further evidence and examples of the key points specified.
