&#xa0;Written evidence from Ian Barker (CYS0045)&#xa0;Dear Select Committee,I'm speaking as a motorist, cyclist and pedestrian and believe there is enough space for all on the roads.But, there needs to be a change of Attitude and Care, by some road users.&#xa0;This proposal for a tightening of penalties, should make our roads safer at no cost:-&#xa0;Consider the case where a Pedestrian or Cyclist is obeying the law and is injured or killed by a motorist.As a starting point, that motorist shall automatically lose their driving licence for the period that the victim is disabled.So, if the pedestrian or cyclist is disabled for a year the motorist will lose their licence for a year. If the victim is killed the driver will never drive again.This is a starting penalty; there may need to be bigger penalties.&#xa0;And remember, I AM A MOTORIST&#xa0; but it is the motorist who has the lethal machine.&#xa0;Also if a pedestrian is killed or injured by a cyclist, the cyclist will be banned from cycling for the period.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
