[normal]O
[normal]n 11 September 2013 
[normal]the Consumer Council gave oral evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee into
[normal] how the Northern Ireland (NI) retail banking market affects NI 
[normal]consumers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We were asked to supply 
[normal]further information on
[normal] a range of subjects, and originally provided this supplementary information in October 2013. This has now been updated using figures from the latest Family Resources Survey in November 2013:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Statistics on access to daily banking services- NI consumers[bold]The Family Resources Survey (FRS) collects information on the incomes and circumstances of private households in 
[normal]NI
[normal]. It has been running in Great Britain since October 
[normal]1992, but 2002/03 saw the introduction of
[normal] regional data on
[normal] Northern Ireland for the first time. Th
[normal]e latest report was published on
[normal] 
[normal]28
[normal] November 2013 
[normal]and summarises the results for the 201
[normal]1
[normal]/1
[normal]2
[normal] survey in which 
[normal]1,943 
[normal]households were interviewed. All adults questioned in the Family Resources Survey were asked about the types of accounts they have held over the last 12 months. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he numbers of people/households with access to bank accounts is an important indicator for financial inclusion. The Consumer Council’s ‘Price of Being Poor’
[normal] report shows that consumers on low incomes that cannot access mainstream financial services end up paying more, a “poverty premium”, for the services they need (for example, higher gas and electricity bills because they cannot get direct debit discounts). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Table
[normal] 4.1 
[normal]on the following page 
[normal]shows the percentage of households with one or more current, savings or investment accounts and those with one or more direct payment accounts, including and excluding Post Office Card Accounts (POCAs).  This has been measured across all areas of GB and NI. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A POCA allows c
[normal]onsumers to withdraw cash at the Post Office but there are no facilities to set up direct debits to manage money and pay bills.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Table 4.1 shows that 
[normal]1
[normal]1
[normal] per cent of households in NI do not have a current account with access to direct debit and overdraft facilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It also shows that 
[normal]only 
[normal]9
[normal]4
[normal] per cent of households in NI had
[normal] any type of
[normal] account including POCAs
[normal], a figure down 1 per cent since the last survey
[normal]. This was the lowest proportion for any region in the UK, an
[normal]d compared to a UK average of 98
[normal] per cent. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Age profile of consumers without a current account[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal]were 
[normal]asked to provide further data on the age profile of consumers who do not have a current account and the proportion of consumers who do not have an alternative such as a Post Office Card Account.
[normal]To do this, we had to request further data from the Family Resources Survey which is specific to Northern Ireland adults
[normal] (individuals)
[normal] only
[normal]. 13 per cent of NI adults (individuals) did not have a current account at the time of the survey in 2011/12.
[normal]

[normal] profiles of those consumers below:

The following table shows the number of branches that are currently open, provided by the four largest banks in NI.

[normal]Bank of Ireland

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Building Societies in [bold]NI[bold]The main building societies with branch facilities in NI are Nationwide and the Progressive. Nationwide offer a range of curren
[normal]t account services. They have 14
[normal] main branche
[normal]s.
[normal] As mentioned at the committee on 11 September, there have been closures of agency services
[normal] provided by
[normal] Nationwide in the past. Nationwide previously had nine agencies (private insurance brokers and estate agents) operating in NI that carried a small float to service customers with current accounts. All of these agencies closed in 2008. Consumers must now visit one of the 14 branches for face to face service.
