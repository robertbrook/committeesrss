defaultNational Governors’ Association – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;defaultThe National Governors’ Association (NGA) is the national membership body for school governors. NGA has several categories of membership comprising school governing bodies, individual governor and independent local associations of school governing bodies. NGA seeks to represent the interests of governing bodies in all state funded schools (local authority maintained and academies). Our organisation’s aim is to improve the well-being of children and young people by promoting high standards in all our schools, and improving the effectiveness of their governing bodies.

defaultQuestions defaultGeneral 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1:  The draft Bill covers a broad range of specific activities and a large amount of legislative provision is amended by it. Could the same result have been achieved using existing secondary legislative procedures? default&#xa0;
defaultA:  The NGA is responding specifically to the clauses relating to schools many of which are amending or repealing existing primary legislation. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2:  Are the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence-based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account? default&#xa0;
defaultA:  The changes in relation to provision of information are proportionate and take into account that other mechanisms which have been put in place to ensure parents are informed.  It is also the case that when the existing legislation was put in place only a minority of schools had websites and many fewer parents than now had internet access. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn relation to Home School Agreements it has long been a bone of contention that although schools are required to have such agreements there is no mechanism for ensuring that parents abide by them – i.e. they are toothless. It does seem sensible to allow schools to make individual decisions about how they inform parents of the expectations on pupils and parents.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NGA is not convinced that adequate thought has gone into the removal of all governing body responsibility for behaviour policy.  As drafted the Bill removes all responsibility for behaviour from the governing body. We strongly believe that this responsibility should continue to sit with governing bodies.  The Procedure Regulations have just been updated and amended and specifically state that one of the core functions of the governing body is “ensuring that the vision, ethos and strategic direction of the school are clearly defined;” Expectations of student behaviour are clearly part of the ‘ethos’ of the school.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3:  Does the draft Bill achieve its purpose of reducing the regulatory burden on business, organisations and individuals effectively and fairly?default&#xa0;
defaultA:  A distinction needs to be drawn between removing a ‘regulatory’ requirement and reducing a burden.  For example, saying that schools do not have to follow guidance produced by the Secretary of State, but it does not reduce the requirement for schools to 
defaultact properly – it simply means that instead of being able to go straight to a known and accepted piece of guidance someone has to take additional time researching what it is appropriate – there is no reduction in burden.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the case of school terms the proposal extends new burdens to school governing bodies – in community and voluntary controlled schools responsibility for setting term dates is currently the local authority’s and this would move to individual governing bodies. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4:  How does the provision in the draft Bill affect - the provision of education? default&#xa0;defaultA: 
defaultResponsibility for discipline 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs stated above a core function of governing bodies is to set the ethos of the school, expectations of pupils in relation to behaviour clearly form part of the ethos of the school.  Under current legislation, governing bodies are responsible for producing a set of behaviour principles which the 
defaultheadteacher
default must take into account in drafting the behaviour policy, which must then be approved by the governing body. The effect of this legislation is not just to remove the requirement to develop a set of behaviour principles, but to abolish any formal statutory input for the governing body into the behaviour policy. This is not sensible on two counts: one the governing body’s responsibility for ethos and two the role governors play in reviewing exclusion decisions. If there is no shared development of the behaviour policy then the governing body may come to different conclusions about the implementation of the policy on review.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NGA agrees that removing the current two tier approach is sensible – we are not convinced of the need for governing bodies to develop behaviour principles from which the 
defaultheadteacher
default drafts a behaviour policy.  The NGA thinks it is vital that there remains a statutory role for governing bodies in the approval of any behaviour policy.
default&#xa0;
defaultHome-school agreements 
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently there are no sanctions/enforcement methods if a parent breaches or fails to sign the agreement. The removal of the requirement to produce such an agreement is sensible, schools can determine for themselves how best to communicate expectations to parents and pupils. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultResponsibility for setting school terms
default&#xa0;
defaultThe majority of primary schools are still either community or voluntary controlled, where the relevant local authority sets term dates. Academies (including free schools), foundation and voluntary aided (VA) schools already have the power to determine term dates, yet very few have introduced longer terms and reduced school holidays.   On one hand, given that academies, foundation and VA schools already have this freedom, we do not see why this should not be extended to all schools.  It is schools that know their parents and pupils best, therefore they should be given the freedom to determine term dates, in the best interest of the pupils and their families.  However this does at the same time add another burden onto the school and needs to be acknowledged as such by all concerned.  Furthermore, if this 
defaultfreedom is to be exercised well, it will take much co-ordination between local schools to ensure that problems are not created for parents with children at different schools.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe do have serious concerns that giving this freedom to schools could cause difficulties for many parents if considerable effort is not put into setting dates. If all schools are going to be given the responsibility for setting term times, it is of vital importance that governing bodies ensure schools consult parents and communicate with their local authority/other schools in the local area to coordinate dates. This would need to be done in order to prevent problems for families in relation to organising childcare and holidays. Already parents with children in different schools across local authority boundaries grapple with different half-terms and Easter holidays, in particular. If all schools are given freedom to set their own terms this could become a bigger issue unless they communicate effectively during the decision-making process. Furthermore given that the regulations relating to authorised absence have also been tightened (the discretion to authorise up to ten days in a school year for a family holiday has been removed) this could become very difficult for some parents. Schools adopting different school terms might also impact on the cost and provision of school transport.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlthough legislation has set out how many days a school must be open and  how many hours a teacher covered by the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) can be required to teach, there has never been standard school year. Various attemp
defaultts have been made to bring one into force but these were never successful.  The STPCD states teachers cannot be required to work more than 195 school days each year (to teach pupils and perform other duties). If schools wanted to extend terms there would probably be additional costs as they would need to employ more staff, but there will be no additional money available to accommodate such a change.
default&#xa0;
defaultIf all schools are given the freedom to set term dates, guidance which includes reference to research evidence would be essential, both from this country and abroad (for example, some countries with the highest level of academic achievement in Europe such as Finland have longer summer holidays).   In particular the fact that disadvantaged children appear to fare worse as a result of the summer holidays is not necessarily an argument to change the school year for all children.  The needs of all children might be better addressed by ensuring activities are available to poorer children over the summer holiday to give them the opportunities that other children have with their own families.   
default&#xa0;
defaultStaffing Guidance
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently all local authority maintained schools must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State, relating to the appointment, discipline, suspension and dismissal of school staff. Removing this requirement does not necessarily reduce bureaucracy, as schools must still have regard to legislation/regulations. The Bill shifts responsibility rather than reducing burdens, as schools would still have to interpret the law and produce their own guidance.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5:  Will any or all of the proposals have any significant economic or financial impact? Do you have any evidence of the impact that will aid the Committee in their scrutiny?default&#xa0;
defaultA:  Financial impact on local authority and school budgets:
default&#xa0;
defaultSome of the proposals in the draft Bill may have a financial impact on local authorities and schools. Many local authorities include in their schemes for financing schools clauses which allow them to charge schools if additional school transport costs arise from changing the length of the school 
defaultday,
default this could also happen if schools extend term time.  There is no additional funding for any increase in transport costs. Furthermore if schools increase the length of the terms then it will have an impact on staffing arrangements and raise the running costs of the school for which there is no additional funding.
