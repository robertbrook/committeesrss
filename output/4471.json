"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by HelpAge International O\nlder and disabled people routinely face discrimination and exclusion from services, entitlements and development aid.\n \nHelpAge \nInternational helps older people claim their rights, challenge discrimination and overcome poverty, so that they can lead dignified, secure, active and healthy lives.\n Our work in over 75 countries is strengthened through our global network of like-minded o\nrganisations.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDemographic transition&#xa0;\n1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPopulation ageing is one of the most significant trends of the 21st \ncentury.\n \nIt has important and far-reaching implications for all aspects of society\n. \nB\ny 2050\n,\n there will be more over\n-\n60s \nworldwide \nthan \nchildren \nunder \n15\n.\n \n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPopulation ageing is progressing fastest in developing countries, including those that have a large\n population of young people. Of the 15 countries that currently have more than 10 million older\n \npeople, seven are developing countries.\n \n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPopulation ageing has an important gender dimension. Women and men age differently, with women \nliving \non average 3-5 y\nears longer than men.\n \n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLifetime inequalities of income, education, employment, health and gender are likely to increase with age.\n \nIssues of equality and equity are therefore essential to the wellbeing of older people with disabilities, as they are to othe\nr age groups. Tackling inequalities through policy, practice and monitoring is therefore crucial to sustaining development progress and improv\ning the wellbeing and capabilities of current and future generations of older people. \n&#xa0;\n5&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAge, gender, socio-economic status, physical and cognitive health, and psychosocial factors have all been identified as key determinants of disability.\n T\nhe ageing process may increase economic vulnerability, as \nit \nreduces the framework of capacity \nfor \nindividuals, accumulating their disadvantage and making their escape from chronic poverty less likely.\n R\neduced physical and mental capacity arising from the ageing process is also potentially a cause of chronic intergenerational poverty.\n \n6&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOlder people\n may not self-identify as having a disability – considering failing sight, hearing and decreasing mobility as natural accompaniments to ageing. I\nncreased levels of functional disability and lower rates of labour force participation may lead to a reduced ca\npacity to earn an income as people grow older, resulting in economic vulnerability in old age. \nB\narely one fifth of the world’s older population is in receipt of a secure pension.\n \nThe consequences of this vulnerability are not limited to older people only,\n but may be shared by their families and a significant proportion of the wider population. For example, in Bangladesh\n,\n nearly one third of the general population live in households containing an older person.\n \n7&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInjuries in older people, particularly those \ncaused by falls, are often unrecorded but are frequent. They\n \nmay start a downward spiral in health status, resulting in death or long-term care needs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 28-35 per cent of people over the age of \n65 fall each year and injure themselves, increasing to 32-42 per cent of those aged more than 70 years.\n Falls may lead to post-fall syndrome, which includes increased dependence, loss of autonomy, confusion, immobilisation and depression.\n8&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoverty in old \nage has a strong gender dimension. Older women are more likely to lose their partner, and less likely to remarry. Lower education levels and the need to combine work with childcare means that women are more likely to work in the informal sector\n and\n are oft\nen paid less than men\n, with the result that they are likely to have lower pension income in old\ner\n age\n. WHO has found that particular groups of older women are more at risk of poverty in all countries, including those who are widowed, divorced or with disab\nilities, and those caring for grandchildren and children orphaned by AIDS.\n Older women may be subject to extreme sexual violence and encounter discrimination and exclusion on account of their age and gender.\n \n9&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSecuring a sustainable livelihood is a challe\nnge for over 180 million older people in low- and middle-income countries who live in poverty, with no savings, assets or pensions. Research in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Tanzania found that older people have only limited acce\nss to microfinanc\ne institutions (MFIs) and banks.\n Inconsistent information about formal savings and loan services, including MFIs, further discourages older people.\n \n10&#xa0; \nA range of studies\n \ndemonstrates that effective ways to reach older women and men who are \ndisabled and living in poverty is by ensuring income security through social protection and livelihoods support. This needs to be combined with effective, appropriate, safe and affordable healthcare, backed up by robust information services, citizen guaran\ntees and a reliable complaints system to ensure entitlements are upheld.\n  \n11&#xa0; \nLack of data disaggregated by age is a critical issue. In 2013\n,\n HelpAge constructed the first global index to\n&#xa0;\nrank countries by how well their ageing populations are faring. Based \non four key enablers of older people's wellbeing\n –\n income, health, employment and education, and enabling environment \n– \nthe \nGlobal AgeWatch I\nndex uses data from a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, the World Health Organizatio\nn, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The construction of the Index has highlighted a serious lack of data in key domains and geograph\nical regions\n including Africa, the Middle Eas\nt and the Caribbean\n.\n \nThe Index explores the difference between years lived in good \nhealth and years lost through disability. Further work is needed on the collection of quality data on disability in later life.\n&#xa0;\nPrevalence and nature of disability in ageing populations&#xa0;12&#xa0; \nAgeing is associated with a higher probability of living with a disability. \nWorldwide, of nearly 810 \nmillion people aged 60 or over (11 per cent of the world’s population), \nmore than 46 per cent live with disabilities. More than 250 million\n older people experience moderate to severe disability.\n \nDisabled people are ageing, and disability in older age is a consequence of accumulated health risks across a lifespan of disease, injury and chronic illness. Key causes of old-age disability are vis\nual impairment, hearing loss, dementia and osteoarthritis.\n \nWhile the link between ageing and impairment is \ninevitable, there is a less direct\n link \nbetween ageing and disability. The key factors that stop impairment becoming disability are access to healthc\nare and an enabling environment (\nsuch as appropriate \nhousing, care\n and\n transport).\n \nHowever, these interventions are often not available in low- and middle-income countries. As a result, many older people\n, even\n with impairments such as \nhearing or eyesight\n problems \nthat can be resolved at little cost\n,\n \nare disabled.\n \n13&#xa0; \nIn 2011, the first-ever High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases recognised ageing as one of the four drivers of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are the leading cause of death and \ndisability worldwide, in 2010 accounting for 34.5 million of the 52.8 million deaths worldwide, with 80 per cent of these deaths occurring in the poorest countries\n.\n Some 75 per cent of deaths from NCDs in low\n-\n and middle-income countries occur in people o\nver 60.\n The 2011 \nWorld report on disability\n reports that people with disabilities are at risk of premature ageing and those with developmental disabilities show signs of ageing in their 40s and 50s.\n \n14&#xa0; \nOlder men and women in developing countries are more l\nikely to have a disability than those living in developed countries, with older women tending to have higher levels of disability. This may be partially explained by their having less access to healthcare over the life course. There are also significant ba\nrriers to accessing affordable and appropriate healthcare\n,\n even when health conditions can be managed at low cost and interventions would make significant differences to families and individuals. Currently there are more than 40 million older people in dev\neloping countries with significant hearing impairment, 32.5 million with significant visual impairment from cataracts, and 39.8 million with significant visual impairment from refractive errors.\n15&#xa0; \nDementia is probably the greatest cause of years lost to dis\nability worldwide. \nThe total number of new cases of dementia each year worldwide is nearly \n7.7 million,\n equivalent to one new case every four seconds.\n \nThe total number of people with dementia worldwide i\nn 2010 is estimated at \n36\n million. The number is pro\njected to nearly double every 20 years, to \n6\n6 million in 2030 and 1\n1\n5 million in 2050. \nCritically, by 2050, over 70 per cent of dementia cases will be in the developing world.\n16&#xa0; \nDisability incurs major costs to people and families\n, as well as\n health systems. The total estimated worldwide costs of dementia in 2010 were US$604 billion, approximately 1 per cent of global GDP. In developing countries, direct social care costs are small, \nwith \ncosts of informal care (unpaid care provided by the fami\nly) predominat\ning\n. Dementia is overwhelming not only for those that have it but also for their carers and families.\n&#xa0;Age and disability in emergencies&#xa0;17&#xa0; \nOlder people often make up a high proportion of\n \npeople\n living in displacement camps. For example, in Gu\nlu District, Northern Uganda, 65 per cent of people still living in displaced people’s camps in 2009 were aged over 60.\n In cris\ne\ns, older women are subject to gender-based intimidation, including sexual violence and rape.\n18&#xa0; \nEven though older and disabled pe\nople make important contributions\n to their families and communities\n, their needs and capacities continue to be widely overlooked \nat\n all stages of emergency responses. This was first highlighted in a 2010 review of the Con\nsolidated Appeals Process (CAP)\n. Th\ne review showed that fewer than 5 per cent of the projects proposed for rec\nent crises made any reference to older people as a vulnerable group. Fewer than 1 per cent of proposed projects and only 0.2 per cent of funded projects included activities targeted\n towards older people.\n Further research on humanitarian funding targeted at older people and people with disabilities in 2010 and 2011 showed similar results, with less than 1 per cent of humanitarian aid targeting these two groups.\n \n19&#xa0; \nRecent research on t\nhe impact of the crisis in Syria \nconducted\n by \nHelpAge\n \nInternational\n and \nH\nandicap \nInternational\n \nillustrates challenges encountered by older people and people with disabilities \nat\n the various stages of the emergency\n.\n20&#xa0; \nIn contexts of displacement\n,\n the \nprotection \nchallenges for older \nand disabled \npeople \nfall into three main areas\n \n–\n b\neing left behind\n, \nbeing more \ndependen\nt\n and vulnerabl\ne\n, and\n facing \nincreased risks\n due to reduced capacity to adapt and to respond to information\n.\n \nOlder people who are\n left be\nhind\n \nlack \nsupport and protection\n. Besides \nfacing \ni\nsolation, \nthey are more exposed\n to physical risk or harm than \nyounger\n,\n able\n-\nbodied\n \np\neople\n who \nhave \nfled\n and are\n \nbetter able to protect and support themselves.\n Ol\nder\n \npeople, especially older \nwomen\n,\n may\n also\n \nfind \nthemselves\n with small children \nin their care \nbut little \nm\ne\nans \nof\n protect\ning\n and fend\ning\n for them.\n \nF\nor\n \nolder people \nwho \nare able to flee\n, \na new environment \ncan \nmake them more dependent. \nI\nncreased dependency, combined with stretched or reduced family support, \ncan exacerbate \nthe\nir\n \nexperience of \nneglect, discrimination and violence\n. \nVisual or sensory disabilities can\n \npresent obstacle\ns\n to accessing information about the emergency, the changing\n security situation, and the availability of humanitarian assistance and rights protection services. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSightsavers,\n HelpAge International, ADD and Alzheimer’s Disease International, \nWe can\n also make change\n, 2013,\n a briefing based on \nWe can also make change\n, a report from \nVoices of the Marginalised\n, \na research project in Bangladesh, p.9\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWorld Health Organization research based on \nThe Global Burden of Disease: 2004 update\n,\n \nGeneva, World Health Organization, 2008\n Harvard Humanitarian \nI\nnitiative and Oxfam International, \n“Now, the world is without me”: \nAn investig\nation of sexual violence in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo\n, Ca\nm\nbrid\ng\ne \nMA \nand Oxford, \n2010\nDecember 2013\n"
