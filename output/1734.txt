[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;2.1 The Post Office is one of the UK’s fastest growing financial service providers in the UK. We have:&#xa0;&#xa0;2.2 At The Post Office we offer a range of financial services products to meet the needs of all customers including products that promote financial inclusion.&#xa0;2.3 We have a nationwide network that provides access to customers including those in remotest areas and areas of deprivation. Our network enables all customers to have convenient access to cash.&#xa0;2.4 Our approach to our own financial services products is to ensure that they are simple, fair, transparent and value for money, supported by widest access.&#xa0;2.5 Aside from our own products, we can also provide over the counter access for cash withdrawals to 95 per cent of current account debit card holders and it remains our aspiration for all banks to offer their customers access via Post Office branches. &#xa0;2.6 The Post Office is going from strength to strength in the mortgage market and this has become more evident over the last few years as we continue to offer some of the most competitive rates direct to consumers. We are committed to being fully transparent with our customers and in return, they know they will receive excellent service from a brand they can trust. We are also recognised as being the leading provider of foreign exchange products in the UK market.&#xa0;2.7 At The Post Office we continue to develop a full range of financial service products and we recently launched a trial of our current accounts in East Anglia.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1 In the context of Northern Ireland the Post Office has 484 branches and of these around 330 or 68 per cent are in rural locations. There are 28 Post Office/Bank of Ireland ATMs in Northern Ireland and some branches will have ATMs provided by other suppliers. &#xa0;3.2 We are committed to maintaining a nationwide network of Post Office branches and we continue to meet the access criteria stipulated by the Government. &#xa0;&#xa0;4.1 Many of The Post Office’s financial service products are provided in partnership with the Bank of Ireland and the two companies have built a successful partnership over the past decade. Together we provide a comprehensive range of products to 3 million customers and we have a savings book valued at £17 billion.&#xa0;4.2 The Bank of Ireland’s UK business was incorporated into a separate ring-fenced UK company on 1 November 2010 which means that depositors are protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).&#xa0;4.3 Bank of Ireland personal, business and basic bank account customers can access cash withdrawals, balance enquiries, cash and cheque deposit services at Post Office counters. We also provide BOI business customers with a change giving service in nominated branches.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;7.1 The Post Office also has a relationship with Danske Bank whereby their personal, business and basic account customers can access cash withdrawal and balance enquiry services at Post Office counters so long as they have the appropriate card and pin number.
