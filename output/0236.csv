default1.2 
defaultThere does not appear to be

default police forces, 
defaultcollaborating police forces
default and the commercial companies may well have 
defaulttheir own 
defaultstrategies

defaultexample some police forces are 
defaultcreating t
defaultheir own forensic lab
defaultoratories 
defaultand are doing this 
defaultwith the 
defaultminimal
default of support and guidance.  A ‘free’ meeting with UKAS may support accreditation but it doesn’t act as a substitute for the force or company strategy 
defaultto fit UK forensic science
default practice. Th
defaulte situation is m
defaultore complicated with the commercial 
defaultproviders

defaultprofit.

default1.4.3 
defaultEven with these developments
default, and it is still early days
default since the FSS closure and the R&amp;D review
default, 
defaultit still doesn’t seem 
defaultthat we have s
defaultufficient effective support for in-depth, long term research in the broad range of forensic subjects.
default 
defaultThe government needs to 
defaultbe 
defaultwilling
default to
default support research
default,
default 
defaultincluding, 
defaultat universities who teach forensic science but don’t necessarily have such a history of research. The
defaultse universities generally 
defaulthave the practitioners who can fully contextualise the research and can be supported by research active staff in other areas. This also needs to be considered in terms of validation of new techniques as private companies may not be willing to publish their research 
defaultdue to the 
defaultIPR as much as academic institutions who are 
defaultkeen to carry out 
defaultresearch and 
defaultits

defaultWith more research there will be a 
defaultgreater requirement for
default v
defaultalidation
default.
default This validation is not only within the investigative process but additional areas which support the 
defaultinvestigative 
defaultprocess such as packaging materials and the provision of additional materials for use within the process.

defaulttogether with the drive 
defaultwithin the 
defaultUK 
defaultfor accreditation to quality 
defaultstandards in the form of 
defaultthe 
defaultISO standards 17020 and 17025
default are improvements. However, 
defaultthe most important aspect of consistently providing best evidence for the court is also under threat.
default1.6 
defaultThe view that accreditation is the answer is 
defaultstrikingly untrue, it is

defaulte
default that accre
defaultditation is part of the answer 
defaultbut only to a minimum standard
default and doesn’t raise standards to reach the goal of providing

defaultWith the requirement for R&amp;D 
defaultto fuel improved 
defaultforensic practice it is not only blue sky research for technology and analytical procedures
default that is required
default but also the R&amp;D into core processes to deliver best evidence for the most effective and efficient procedures for all techniques, from packaging to laboratory procedures and the interpretation and evaluation of the evidence 
defaultto 
defaultthe justice system.

default The role of the professional body,

default&#xa0;
default2. Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?
default2.1 
defaultWe don’t have sufficient information to comment on this question.
default&#xa0;
default3. What impacts have the FSS’s closure had on (i) the criminal justice system and (ii) forensic science R&amp;D and training? In particular, have the appropriate quality standards and accreditation been rigorously maintained? (please provide evidence/examples)
default3.1 
defaultImpact on the Criminal Justice System – this is best answered by the 
defaultjudiciary
default in terms of quality and quantity of cases being presented to the CPS and courts.
default However we have seen a 
defaultrecent 
defaultDNA issue within one of the commercial providers which impacted the justice system. 
defaultTherefore 
defaultthe bigger question
default which 
defaultneeds to be answered 
defaultis whether the 
defaultjustice system and public 
defaultare 
defaultconfiden
defaultt 
defaultand 
defaultassured
default 
defaultthat the development of the industry is supporting public safety while it becomes more 
defaultfragmented.  
default3.1.1 Further, 
defaultas more work moves into police forces can we be confident that complaints and issues relating to the provision of scientific evidence be thoroughly and openly managed and resolved. In the light of the 
defaultHillsborough
default incident and the Mitchell incident can the public be confident that their forensic provision will remain independent with the highest int
defaultegrity
default?
default Under the ISO standard all complaints are expected to be logged and covered for independence, impartiality and integrity. 
default3.2 
defaultThe R&amp;D – The FSS 
defaultintimated
default that they did a lot of research but in the later years before it closed it was questionable if they were still leading 
defaultthe UK 
defaultin R&amp;D. Although there have been a number of significant changes for the good with 
defaultthe 
defaultR&amp;D
default review
default (mentioned above) there is still no 
defaultnational 
defaultcoordinated lead 
defaultor 
defaultstrategy for R&amp;D. 
default3.3 
defaultThe FSS didn't really govern quality in forensic research, but the perception now is that research has been left to fend for itself with limited governmental input.
default 
default3.4 
defaultThere 
defaultmust 
defaultbe a coordinated 
defaultapproach 
defaulton R&amp;D
default in the UK
default.  There is lots being done such as the Forensic Science Society Forum for Universities and Industry, conferences (one day in Nov. 2013 and three days in Nov 2013) but there are still untapped R&amp;D 
defaultwithin 
defaultgood quality BSc and MSc level 
defaultprojects. These 
defaultselected projects could be made available to the community in the same way as PhD’s are.
default3.5 
defaultPart of the solution must be to 
defaultenable
default more collaborative partnerships.  The days when there could be one 
defaultphysical 
defaultcentral
default research establishment may have passed but the strategic leadership and central coordination is still needed.
default Universities are keen to collaborate with practitioners in police forces and with companies but this still needs national and regional coordination.
default It is without doubt a good thing for police forces and companies to work with 
defaultUniversities such
default as educational awards which Teesside University is involved with but also 
defaulton
default various other activities including
default 
defaultresearch 
defaultprojects. It is quite possible to keep things confidential and the 
defaultresearch 
defaultfindings can feed into the bigger picture and guide future good practice. Universities can and would be willing to work 
defaultconfidentially with police forces 
defaultand companies 
defaultand only publish their data with permission 
defaultespecially when 
defaultthe findings could have much wider relevance and impact.
default3.6 
defaultTraining – the overall training and continual professional development including continual professional competency is a big area and there have been a number of 
defaultnew 
defaultSME’s starting to come to market
default since the 
defaultclosure
default of the FSS
default.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultwould suggest that consistent accreditation and individual competency coupled with the strive for optimisation of practices and procedures 
defaultwithin R&amp;D 
defaultare the biggest areas to provide the justice system with assurance and confidence. 
default&#xa0;
default4. What should be role of the Forensic Science Regulator?
default4.1 
defaultThe requirement for and role of the Forensic Science Regulator was clear in 2007/8. However
default,
default there are 
defaulta number of key 
defaultareas needing addressed. Firstly the 
defaultstatutory
default position 
defaultof the Regulator 
defaultand 
defaultassociated 
defaultpowers
default to oversee forensic 
defaultscience 
defaultpracti
defaultce. Secondly concerning the area of the practitioner being 
default‘fit to practice’
default, possibly linking with the 
defaultprofessional body
default. Anyone providing evidence to court needs to be fit to practice. Thirdly 
defaultit needs to be recognised that the 
defaultRegulator 
defaultis not the 
defaultperson 
defaultto throw all the forensic science 
defaultpractice 
defaultissues at such as 
defaultfunding, 
defaultCCTV and research.
default 
default4.2 
defaultThere is a need to ring fence the role within the quality arena – set, maintain and 
defaultmonitor
default and then identify the other areas with overlap but outside the remit of the 
defaultR
defaultegulator. For 
defaultexample
default does research fit comfortably with the 
defaultR
defaultegulator or can the 
defaultR
defaultegulator be the conduit to 
defaultcoordinating research with practice.
default4.3 
defaultWe should not believe that accreditation to the ISO standards such as 17025 and 17020 will ensure consistency of quality standards or enable continual improvement to provide best evidence to the courts.
default4.4 
defaultThe Police are in a difficult situation with their budgets and the greater provision on in-house forensic practice. They also need to contribute to the improvement in quality standards and carry out research.  As a minimum they need to set up partnerships with commercial companies and Universities to enable worthwhile R&amp;D.
default5. What is the size of the forensics market and how stable is it?
default5.1 
defaultThis is a difficult question 
defaultbecause
default one needs to define the ‘forensics market’.  For example when the Home Office were considering the 
defaultsize
default of the market during the transition of the FSS to a GovCo the 
defaultmarket
default was estimated at 
defaulta
defaultn
default amount considerably more than that now being suggested
default – less than £100m. It is important to be able estimate the size of the total market and not just the commercial company slice.
default 
default5.
default2
default 
defaultNevertheless the market size seems to be 
defaultjudged
default by the amount the commercial sector is involved with – currently about £80m and 
defaulttherefore
default falling.  The overall size including all the police forces, commercial providers, Universities / SME 
defaultetc.
default 
defaultis probably 
defaultfairly
default stable.  The full question 
defaultcan’t
default be answered until the police forces understand what their forensic provision costs using the same model as the commercial providers and include not only the building and over heads but HR, finance etc.
default 
default5.
default3
default 
defaultOverall our 
defaultfeeling may well be that the market is growing due to 
defaultits 
defaultfragmentation
default.  The size of the market should be confused with the quality of the 
defaultservice to the justice system.
default6. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHow are forensic science services procured by police forces and could procurement processes be improved?
default6.1 
defaultWe have insufficient intimate knowledge of the procurement process. However, anecdotal evidence would suggest that there is a large 
defaultbureaucratic
default beast dealing with this (which should be part of the calculation on the 
defaultsize
default of the market and drain on police budgets).  Small companies seem to spend an enormous amount of time filling out forms to apply within the procurement process.
default6.2 
defaultOne could argue that there is no need for such a process and let the customers purchase, under guidelines, the service they require. The key difficulty here is the phrase ‘level the playing field’ and the transparency of procurement process.
default7. Has the closure of the FSS resulted in a loss of intellectual wealth through its scientists leaving the forensic science profession, or the UK? (please provide evidence/examples)
default.
default7.1 
defaultYes, 
defaultfrom one x FSS 
defaultemployee 
default–
default 
default“
defaultonly half of the people I worked with now have jobs within the industry - they are deemed too expensive possibly when graduates can be used for a low cost. Examples of where they have ended up: dentists 
defaultassistant
default, moved to Canada, working for environment agency, unemployed (returning to education) 
defaultetc.
default”
default8. Are current arrangements for the FSS’s archives satisfactory? How could arrangements for the retention of case files and forensic materials in the UK be improved?
defaultWe consider that the question is much bigger than only the FSS archive.  It should relate to the case files and associated materials for all police forces, commercia
defaultl providers and other providers, including the process to deal with the retention and storage of materials if a police force or company no longer undertakes forensic science practice.
default The time scales are clear for retention but 
defaultthe actual physical retention across the UK is key
default to support the justice system
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultJanuary 2013
default The secret to success here will be the ability to identify companies whose products can be adapted to the investigative process.
