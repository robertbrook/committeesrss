[normal]Written submission by AB Sugar[bold]4 December 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction to AB Sugar[bold]AB Sugar 
[normal]is a business segment of Associated British Foods plc (ABF) a diversified food, ingredients and retail group with 2013 sales of £13.3 billion and 113,000 employees in 47 countries.  ABF has a primary relationship with the UK Government through the Strategic Relationship Management (SRM) initiative, for which its sponsor departments are DEFRA, BIS and UKTI.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AB Sugar produces cane and beet sugar plus a wide range of associated products in 9 countries worldwide.  It has invested £1.6 billion since 2005, of which over £340 million has been in Britain, much of which has been in renewable energy.  The UK beet sugar industry is one of the most efficient sugar industries in Europe, makes an economic contribution of £1 billion/year and supports 13,000 jobs.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]AB Sugar response[bold]As requested, we have addressed our comments to the questions posed in the inquiry paper.  Not all these questions were relevant for us, so our responses below cover questions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 1.  How best to improve UK (and EU) food security, including using resources more efficiently[bold]Food security is a fundamental, long-term imperative for the UK.  The country’s population is rapidly increasing, reserves of agricultural land are dwindling, and recent global events have demonstrated the unreliability and volatility of a ‘traded solution’ reliant solely on imports.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Building on its tradition as an efficient and innovative producer of agriculture and food, the UK is well able to rise to this challenge.  However, to do so it must use its resources ever more efficiently.  In practice, this means:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK beet sugar industry provides a useful model for the aspiration to produce more from less, as set out in its joint industry sustainability report
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Increasing productivity[bold]Over the last 30 years sugar beet productivity has been increased 60%, significantly more than for any other major arable crop in Britain.  Factors which have contributed to this success include:
[normal]These efficiency gains have meant that 90,000 hectares of arable land previously needed to grow the UK crop have been released for alternative uses.  UK sugar beet yields are now consistently in the top quartile of EU producers, and are still increasing at over 2%/year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reducing inputs and costs[bold]It is sometimes suggested that productivity can only be improved at the expense of increased inputs and greater ‘intensification’, so placing a greater burden on the environment.  However this is not the case.  Over the same period of time as UK sugar beet yields have been driven up, inputs to the crop have been substantially reduced.  For example, fertiliser application rates have been cut between 40% (nitrogen) and 73% (phosphate), and use of plant protection products by 60%
[normal]1
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This has been made possible by a combination of targeted applied research and novel seed technology (see below under Question 4).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A similarly innovative approach is used in processing operations.  Combined heat and power (CHP) is used for generating electrical and heat energy, which has an energy conversion efficiency of over 70% - roughly double that of a normal power station.  Energy usage in UK sugar manufacturing has been cut by 25% since 1990
[normal], and over £16 million has recently been invested to further reduce CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions by 30,000 tonnes/year between 2010 and 2020
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These examples demonstrate it is possible to improve productivity while simultaneously reducing inputs and benefitting the environment, thus supporting one of the key objectives of 
[normal]sustainable intensification 
[normal]set out in DEFRA’s agriculture call for evidence in the Balance of Competences review
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘Zero waste[bold]’[bold] culture[bold]One of the keys to using resources more efficiently is to reduce waste.  This is particularly relevant for food security as the most recent WRAP survey
[normal] concludes that, despite recent improvements, almost one-fifth of all the food purchased in Britain (i.e. 7 million tonnes/year) is thrown away, at a cost of £12.5 billion/year.  This creates a double failure in which valuable resources are wasted, and then squandered food has to be dumped into landfill.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Again the UK beet sugar industry offers some ideas to address this.  Across the industry a ‘zero waste’ culture is practiced, in which each production stage is optimised to capture and use raw materials.  This is exemplified by the sustainable manufacturing model
[normal] used at British Sugar’s plants (Annex 1), which demonstrates how raw materials are transformed into valuable co-products.  In addition to the ‘traditional’ co-products of topsoil, animal feed and liming products, a range of new products and business activities have also been added so converting sugar plants into ‘integrated biorefineries’.  These include: CHP power generation, renewable transport fuel, pharmaceuticals and tomato production.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Besides increasing the UK beet sugar industry’s economic contribution and efficiency, these initiatives have also driven out waste.  Of the relatively small amount of waste which cannot be recovered, three-quarters is recycled.  This leaves only a very small quantity sent to landfill, representing less than 0.1% of the products produced and only 0.02% of crop purchased
[normal]2
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Promoting ‘buying British’[bold]Improving UK food security is also dependent on having positive sales and marketing strategies in place to promote British products.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Clearly much of the responsibility for this falls on commercial companies, however public initiatives can also be helpful.  For example the ‘Red Tractor’ initiative has been successful in highlighting British-grown produce and has been incorporated into farm assurance schemes (see Question 5).  It is featured by ABF Grocery’s Silver Spoon sugar brand as part of the product marketing and packaging.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Government support can help too by taking every opportunity to promote ‘buying British’ including recognising positive aspects of domestic production (lower ‘food-miles’, strong traceability standards, improved freshness etc).  It may also be appropriate to review public purchasing policies to ensure that wherever possible British food is used by public institutions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 3.  The implications of volatility in global food supply and demand for UK food security.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Volatility in global food markets has an unpredictable, and potentially corrosive, influence on food security.  This is readily observed in the sugar sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The world sugar market is one of the most volatile of all food ‘soft’ commodities
[normal] (see Annex 2).  Over the last 13 years global raw sugar prices have ranged from 5 to 30
[normal] cents/pound with extreme daily volatility.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This situation has an inhibiting effect on investment if it is left exposed to such extreme variations, and makes imports unpredictable.  So, for example, sugar imports into the EU were relatively plentiful between 2000 and 2008 when global prices were low, but became less attractive and in shorter supply between 2008 and 2012 as world prices increased.  As a result, greater reliance has been placed on European domestic sugar production as the cornerstone of food security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 4.  The potential value and contribution of science and GM technology to UK food security.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Providing it is well directed and carefully managed, science can form a useful foundation for food security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UK beet sugar industry invests over £1.8 million/year in applied research, development and industry education.  This R&amp;D programme is operated by the British Beet Research Organisation
[normal] (BBRO) and co-funded by UK beet growers and British Sugar.  Priorities for the programme are to increase productivity, reduce crop inputs and optimise the environmental benefits created by sugar beet’s inclusion in the arable crop rotation.  Over the years results from BBRO research have contributed to the 
[normal]sustainable intensification
[normal] benefit described under Question 1 of increasing crop yields while reducing inputs.  Thus the use of fertilisers and plant protection products have been tailored to crop requirements, reducing costs of production and benefiting the environment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Seed technologies play an important role too.  Seed varieties bred by leading seed suppliers are screened and evaluated by the National Institute of Agricultural Botany
[normal] (NIAB) in conjunction with the BBRO against industry standards.  The resulting annual performance ranking enables beet growers to select the beet varieties best suited for their individual circumstances.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Complementing this, speciality seed technology company Germains
[normal] has developed advanced systems for micro-applying fungicide and insecticide to individual seeds and their surrounding pellets.  This has improved protection against sugar beet seedling and foliar diseases and has led to a reduction of over 90% in the amount of insecticide applied to the crop
[normal]1
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AB Sugar has an open mind on GM technology.  Our Associated British Foods (ABF) corporate position is attached at Annex 3.  From this, it can be seen that prerequisites for GM being able to make a positive contribution to improving competitiveness include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 5.  How food and farming supply chains, and the current systems for traceability, can contribute to increased resilienc[bold]e[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]As has been shown in the answer to Question 4 on 
[normal]the contribution of science
[normal], the UK beet sugar industry operates in a collaborative way to enhance the overall competitiveness, and therefore the resilience, of the industry. 
[normal] 
[normal]This is also the case for traceability across the farming and food supply chains, which aims to provide consumers and retailers with confidence about product quality including food safety and environmental protection.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Since 2003 British Sugar (AB Sugar’s UK subsidiary) has operated a crop assurance standard 
[normal]in conjunction with its supplying growers 
[normal]which has now been incorporated into the Red Tractor Farm Assurance Combinab
[normal]le Crops and Sugar Beet Schemes
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Schemes provide
[normal] 
[normal]“
[normal]. . . 
[normal]an integrated assurance chain to internationally recognised standards. 
[normal] 
[normal]They ensure that crops are harvested and grown to a high standard, kept in clean storage and transported in vehicles so that the final product is free from contamination and safe to eat.” 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As well as assuring food safety, including hygiene, the Schemes include “
[normal]. . . 
[normal]carefully managing the storage, application and disposal of fertilisers, pesticides (including insecticides, herbicides and fungicides), manures and other potential pollutants in accordance with current le
[normal]gislation and best practice to
[normal] prevent pollution of the environment (including watercourses, soil, air and wildlife habitats), contamination and spread of disease.” 
[normal] 
[normal]The contract between British Sugar and sugar beet grower
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]specifies that unauthorised agricultural chemicals 
[normal]cannot
[normal] be used. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]AB Sugar also produces 
[normal]renewable transport fuel (‘bioethanol’)
[normal] from sugar beet and 
[normal]feed 
[normal]wheat, the latter through its partnership with BP at the Vivergo plant on Humberside. 
[normal] 
[normal]Since 2011 the Combinable Crops and Sugar Beet Schemes have been extended to incorporate additional sustainability requirements for the production of biofuels
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]e.g. 
[normal]on previous land use), which has added a further level of standardisation for the confidence of 
[normal]customers and consumers
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The production of biofuels 
[normal]delivers 
[normal]valuable high protein 
[normal]and energy-rich 
[normal]animal feed which can substitute imported 
[normal]feed ingredients like soy, so further increasing 
[normal]resili
[normal]ence in the food/feed chain (see Question 8).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Supplementing
[normal] the Schemes, British Sugar operates its own supply chain checks and adjusts processing parameters to accommodate prevailing weather and market-driven factors to give additional resilience. 
[normal] 
[normal]These adjustments are carried out following a process of negotiation with 
[normal]the NFU on behalf of 
[normal]growers and
[normal], 
[normal]as necessary, the Environment Agency. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Question 8.  Ways of increasing self-sufficiency in products for which the UK has a comparative advantage[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Sugar
[normal]Sugar is a product for which the UK has a comparative advantage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Driven by the industry initiatives described under previous questions, UK sugar beet yields have been increased by 60% since the 1980s, and are now consistently in the top quartile of European producers.  UK sugar productivity also rivals that in leading global cane industries like Brazil and Australia
[normal](Annex 4).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The industry’s focus on cost reduction has also improved competitiveness.  The most recent global ranking of sugar and isoglucose producers by consultants LMC International
[normal] suggests UK beet sugar industry production costs are the lowest in the EU and similar to those of efficient cane producers elsewhere in the world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent reform of the EU Sugar Common Market Organisation (CMO) provides an opportunity to take advantage of this competitive advantage when the sector becomes deregulated from 2017 onwards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Wheat and animal feed
[normal]The UK has a comparative advantage in the production of feed wheat, where 5 year average yields are 7.7 t/ha
[normal] compared to an EU average of 5.7 t/ha
[normal] (a 35% difference).  This provides an opportunity for the UK to become more self-sufficient in products derived from feed wheat, such as high protein animal feed produced at biorefineries like Vivergo Fuels
[normal] based at Hull.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The EU and UK have a 70% import dependency on protein for animal feed, which represents the equivalent of 20 million hectares of soya cultivated outside the EU.  Much of this is imported from South America.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]High protein animal feed
[normal] is produced as a co-product from the manufacture of renewable ethanol transport fuel, where feed wheat is used as feedstock.  For example, Vivergo Fuels will produce 420 million litres/year of renewable transport fuel plus 500,000 tonnes/year of high protein animal feed.  This substitutes imported soya, so providing a valuable feed ingredient while improving the UK’s self-sufficiency and trade balance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Horticulture and tomatoes
[normal]The UK is a substantial net importer of horticultural products which are often produced in warmer climates like southern Spain.  For example, 80% of the tomatoes consumed in Britain are imported.
[normal]In the past it has often been assumed that the UK is unlikely to be a competitive producer for products like this, making imports inevitable.  However a more innovative approach is proving otherwise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Apart from sunlight, the main pre-requisites for competitive horticultural production are:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At British Sugar’s Cornerways nursery
[normal] in Norfolk an ingenious solution has been found which enables these requirements to be produced highly efficiently.  Low grade heat and CO
[normal]2 
[normal]from the main sugar manufacturing plant are diverted to specially designed glasshouses, along with rainwater which is collected from the roof.  This combination increases yields and reduces costs, making Cornerways’ production competitive with imports – and considerably fresher too.  Following its start-up just over 10 years ago, Cornerways has been expanded several times and is now the largest single tomato glasshouse in Britain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]UK self-sufficiency – policy suggestions
[normal]Some suggestions to increase UK self-sufficiency in food:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Until recently, the UK Government’s recognition of the importance of the food and agriculture industries for the economy has been less than fulsome.  In the past there has often been a tendency to take these ‘primary’ industries for granted, with an underlying assumption that UK needs can be met primarily from imports.  The current Government’s change of view on this issue is welcome and a much needed fillip for the food sector.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As mentioned under Question 1, the Government also has an important role in helping to promote British Food with the public, and is ensuring that its benefits are highlighted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Food and agriculture are the largest sectors in the UK economy with potentially the highest investment.  For example, since 2005 AB Sugar has invested £340 million in these sectors in Britain.  Increased self-sufficiency in the long-term is heavily dependent on attracting investment into the sector, which in turn needs positive and consistent Government policy.  This should include taking a pro-industry line wherever possible in CAP debates as well as a carefully balanced approach in international trade negotiations.  The Government should avoid concessions being made, either by the UK or EU, which could undermine our national interests.  It is also important that the Government recognises and supports policies having cross-sector benefits for the economy, such as the transport target of the Renewable Energy Directive, which provides fuel security, climate change mitigation and food security benefits.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Increasing UK domestic production can only be achieved if our industries are internationally competitive.  It is therefore crucial to avoid imposing unnecessary and unjustified costs on UK manufacturing and businesses which other competitors don’t have to comply with.  This factor should also be taken into account in international trade negotiations, where the UK’s position should recognise any discriminatory differences between the approaches taken by the UK compared to its negotiating partners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A recent example of this occurred earlier this year when the UK Government unilaterally introduced mandatory greenhouse gas reporting for UK-based plc companies
[normal].  This imposes a significant administrative and cost burden which does not apply to overseas competitors, thus placing UK producers at a competitive disadvantage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For the same reasons, it is also important to avoid unjustified interference in normal operating practices.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A potentially serious example occurred in 2013 when the European Commission imposed an outright ban on the use of certain plant protection products called neonicotinoids on flowering crops
[normal].  This action, which was introduced at short notice and without proper impact assessments being carried out, was claimed to be justified because of declining bee populations, despite no causal factors being identified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Although sugar beet is currently exempt from the ban (as it is not a flowering crop), there remains a risk that it could be extended as a blanket ban to all crops.  Such a restriction would be wholly unjustified for sugar beet, particularly as the product is micro-applied to the seed using technology developed by Germains.  This ensures that seed pellets are securely coated and safe to handle, and minimises the environmental impact.  Its loss would have damaging consequences for UK sugar beet cultivation, as there is no equivalent alternative product available, and because it controls the single most damaging disease of sugar beet (called ‘virus yellows’) in this country.  Since the introduction of micro-applied neonicotinoids in 1995, the incidence of virus yellows disease has dropped to negligible levels (see Annex 5), creating substantial gains in productivity for the UK industry and economy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Annex 1[bold]Annex 2[bold]Annex 3[bold]GM Technology[bold]ABF briefing note for Owen Paterson, Secretary of State DEFRA[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction to Associated British Foods (ABF)[bold]Associated British Foods (ABF) is a diversified food, ingredients and retail group with 2012 sales of £12.3 billion and 106,000 employees in 47 countries.  ABF therefore has extensive and wide-ranging food interests across the world, and strives to offer safe affordable food in all these markets.  Competitiveness is also a priority.  ABF is the largest purchaser of agricultural products in Britain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]ABF GM policy[bold]As a group with a long history of close interdependence between the consumer, manufacturing and agricultural sectors, it is in ABF’s interests to make sure that the farms which supply us are healthy and sustainable in both the short and long term.  We also recognise that consumers around the world have differing views on the use of GM ingredients in the food chain. ABF seeks to meet consumer expectations as they vary, country by country, as well as complying with local regulations on use and labeling of GM ingredients.  Currently our assessment is that a significant number of British consumers remain concerned about the application of this technology in food.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Some GM crops have now been cleared by UK and EU regulatory bodies as safe for both animal and human consumption.  In the case of the animal feed we supply, we respect our customers’ requirements and strive to balance their views with the commitment to help the farmers we supply remain as competitive as possible in what is often a very tough business environment.  GM feed materials and ingredients are included in our products, in line with normal industry practice, unless our customers request otherwise.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Technical and commercial considerations[bold]Successful introduction of GM technology is dependent on having the right technical and commercial structures in place.  Specifically, the traits being targeted by the GM technology need to deliver genuine value to the producer and processor. In practice this means either improving competitiveness (e.g. through increased crop yield, or reduced cost), benefitting the environment; contributing to public health, or facilitating new product development. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The commercial structure also needs to be acceptable and transparent.  Value should be shared in a balanced way across the supply chain, including both farm suppliers and processing industries, rather than being ‘locked in’ by the technology provider(s).  Suppliers must also be transparent in declaring any GM ingredients.  Failure to do this convincingly was partly responsible for earlier collapses in public confidence about GM foods.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold]In order to openly support the widespread application of GM technology in the UK, Associated British Foods would need to be assured that the concerns of the general public are being adequately addressed. Government could assist this by seeking to move the public debate away from viewing GM as a ‘blanket technology’, and instead focus on the benefits it can bring society in specific applications. It would also have to be apparent to our businesses that the benefits being offered were real, and that the value derived from the technology was being shared throughout the supply chain, rather than accruing exclusively to the technology provider(s).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In the case of animal feed supplies we would ask DEFRA to encourage a shorter time lag from the point at which a company submits a GM event for approval by the EU, to the achievement of that approval. This process, which normally includes attaining EFSA’s opinion plus the necessary political approvals, is sometimes protracted when it can cause disruption to UK imports of feed materials.
