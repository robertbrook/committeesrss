[[[Written evidence submitted by Zero Emissions Platform (CCS07)]]]Founded in 2005, the Zero Emissions Platform (ZEP) serves as an advisor to the European Commission on the research, demonstration and deployment of CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS). ZEP is a coalition of over 200 members from 19 countries – representing academics, scientists, European utilities, petroleum companies, equipment suppliers and environmental NGOs.&#xa0;

[[[SUMMARY]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;ZEP also recommends establishing up to six new CO2 storage pilots across Europe to complement demonstration projects and accelerate state-of-the-art technology. This will enable meaningful R&amp;D on a range of issues, which may then be used generically – on- and offshore. Qualifying and improving knowledge of representative geological storage conditions will also greatly benefit the planning of a trans-national, European CO2 transport infrastructure. In certain cases, the storage pilot may even be used to explore industrial scale-storage in the same reservoir.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0; “Redrawing the energy-climate map.
