"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Ageas\n UK CMI0023)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;SUMMARY&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nABOUT AGEAS&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgeas is the second largest motor insurer in the \nUK\n by number of vehicles insured. It insures over 3.5 million vehicles though its underwriting businesses Ageas Insurance Limited and Tes\nco Underwriting Limited, its joint venture with Tesco Bank.\n&#xa0;1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgeas also has a presence in the retail sector, through its Ageas Insurance Solutions (Cover Direct, Auto Direct and Done Deal brands), Ageas 50 (RIAS and Castle Cover brands), Kwik Fit Insurance\n Services, Express Insurance and The Green Insurance \nCompany broker businesses.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMEDICAL REPORTING&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgeas supports the need for reform of the medico-legal reporting process. We also support the benefits of pre-med offers under the current system. Ageas\n would only \nconsider suspending its strategy of making such offers for low value cases once it has confidence in relation to the quality and reality of medical evidence being compiled.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgeas currently believes that there is a good case for maintaining pre\n-med offers and that any move to end them ahead of the proposed reforms will have a perverse impact on general car insurance premiums. We would be averse to seeing pre-med offers being prohibited in their entirety. Pre-meds do give claimants, and their sol\nicitors, quicker settlement, payment and closure in a more convenient and efficient\n&#xa0;\nway. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is still appropriate in some scenarios to make pre-meds on a case by case basis, allowing us to help manage the predicament of each claimant. Examples of where me\ndical evidence will add no value but increase costs and length of claim include very minor injuries of low value and some serious traumatic injuries involving loss of digit/limb/sense where the impact of injury is obvious. Also global settlements on large \nlosses with considerable contributory negligence arguments and claimants with extensive pre-existing conditions or individual circumstances such as relocated abroad or have fears of medical examinations may be appropriate for settlement without obtaining m\nedical evidence.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe practice of insurers making pre-med offers for low value injury claims has developed because the current medical process adds no value, with reports not consistently being of sufficient quality. If a reformed system gave the insurance\n industry confidence in the quality and impartiality of medical experts’ reports there would be less incentive for us to make pre-med offers. Alongside this if claimant solicitors were minded to cease the practice of automatically pushing claimants through\n physiotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy as part of their claim we would be minded to cease making pre-meds on the bulk of appropriate whiplash cases.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order for the role of medical evidence to be strengthened as part of the Government’s propose\nd reforms we believe that the selection of the medical expert panel needs to be genuinely random and not influenced by a claimants choice or the prognosis they give.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, we believe that a form of a challenge facility would support the structure o\nf the new system. The Government should carefully consider what role the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association and other regulatory bodies can play in auditing medical reports.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlongside this there is a need for a better level of proof \nand evidence available for experts to consider. Government should consult with all related stakeholders in detail on this issue. Changes could include giving experts access to details about an accident and a claimants’ medical records. This could be achiev\ned through updating the standard medical report form to allow for assessments to be as scientific and analytical as possible. In the absence of an objective test for whiplash, if medical records are verified as part of the assessment process, this would ar\nguably allow greater consistency in medical reporting.  Accident related information would also assist with causation considerations. However, changes should all give due consideration to the risk of introducing an extra burden of bureaucracy and cost into\n the system.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInputting the improved and accurate medical evidence into a ‘damages calibration tool’ (per Lord Justice Jackson) to produce an agreed valuation would also reduce the adversarial nature of evaluating General Damages and hence produce quicker \nsettlements and result in reduced costs which benefits all customers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDATA SHARING&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgeas remains unconvinced whether increased data sharing between claimant lawyers and insurers will help reduce the volume of fraudulent claims being made and we would st\nill like clarity on how this will be achieved.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst i\nn principal, the industry is happy to allow most firms access to limited information from Claims and\n Underwriting Exchange Personal Injury/Illness claims database (\nCUE PI\n), such as number of previous claims, \nt\nhere has been a long held hesitancy within the insurance industry over how far this sharing should extend.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConcerns lie in what the extent of data is required by solicitors and also into what may eventually happen to\n the information, for example being used against insurers and facilitating claims farming and phishing practices by unscrupulous solicitor firms.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn order to establish greater data sharing practices there needs to be a common understanding and agreement w\nithin the claimant community on the benefits of such sharing in the first instance. It would be encouraging if limited access to CUE PI could be made on the basis of a data exchange whereby the claimant’s solicitor would have to submit photo identification\n with the request for information along with full Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU) data such as a National Insurance or passport number which in many claims they often claim not to have.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would also be reluctant to respond to a request for CUE data unt\nil a formal claim had been submitted via the electronic portal or letter of claim. We would also wish to limit the data provided to the claimant community to that pertaining solely to a client, not providing information regarding additional claims at an ad\ndress, previous accident dates without other parties involved etc.\n&#xa0;\n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTHIRD PARTY PERSONAL INJURY FRAUD AND EXAGGERATED CLAIMS &#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAgeas UK recently submitted a response to the Law Commission’s 12\nth\n programme of law reform outlining its position on third party injury fraud law. We supported the ABI’s broad sentiment of bringing the law around third party fraudulent exaggeration more in line with first party fraudulent exaggeration. We are concerned t\nhat the inconsistency surrounding the law affecting the strike out of fraudulently exaggerated claims is having a severe financial impact on many stakeholders and putting upward pressure on customer premiums. There should be urgent reform of this area of l\naw to make the strike out of claims the general position upon a finding of fraudulent exaggerations, in the absence of viable alternative options. The ABI has helpfully pointed to existing legislative examples in the Republic of Ireland as a guide to such \nreform as well as the need to carefully consider the impact on the ability of comprehensive motor insurers to make subrogated recoveries.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe insurance industry needs clarity and the Courts need clear guidance through any reforms to ensure consistency is \nbrought to this area of law. Particular consideration should be given to a definition or guidance around the word ''exaggeration'' and where the threshold at which a claim should be struck out will be set. A solution\n&#xa0;\nsuitable for the insurance industry sho\nuld\n&#xa0;\nbe addressing the\n&#xa0;\nlower value\n&#xa0;\nvolume claims.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember\n 2013\n&#xa0;3\n"
