You know why we are here and why we have invited you to give evidence. The House of Lords report that we intend to make on youth unemployment will be published in April. We have had a range of witnesses, including youth, and today we have had two very good sessions, with the Director-General and then with the Commissioner, which helped us to put the jigsaw together more. You are very important here, because we have had questions about trade unions for most of our witnesses but \nnow \nwe will hear it from the horse’s mouth, as we say\n—t\nhat expression means, “The people who actually know”. We are looking forward to this session.\n \nYou have met everyone, but I think it would be good idea if we said what our experience is, starting from the Member on your right.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: I am Clive Brooke—Lord Brooke. I have been in the House of Lords for 16 years, prior to which I was in the \nl\nabour movement as General-Secretary of a union that was affiliated to the TUC, and I was a close friend of John Monks as well.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: I am David Wilson. I am \nwhat we call a Cross-Bench Peer—an independent Peer\n. I have been in the House of Lords for 22-odd \nyears\n. I have had a career mostly in public service, including that unfashionable thing, being\n \na colonial governor—quite an experience.\nThe Chairman: I am Detta O’Cathain. I am a Conservative Member of the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came to the House of Lords through the business route rather than the political route, but I am a Conservative Peer.\nLord Freeman: \nI am Lord Freeman. I was formerly House of Commons, and now I am in the House of Lords. I have been in the House of Lords now for quite a number of years. I am very \ngrateful from my \nstandpoint\n \nthat \nyou have come to see\n us, because some of these questions are really, really important. \n \nThe Chairman: \nThank you. \nI shall start.\n There is a general consensus that youth unemployment across \nEurope\n is a particularly serious aspect of the current economic crisis, and while things like banking seem to be getting a lot of push and business is beginning to pull up, w\ne are still worried about the effect \nparticularly \non the young of \nthe crisis in \nfinding jobs.\n Could you summarise for us your own view of the exact nature of the current problems and the issues that you are most concerned about?\nCinzia Sechi: \nI will say just a few words. I t\nhank you for \nthis \ninvitation. \nIt is an honour for us to be able to share our views on \nyouth unemployment\n in \nEurope\n, \nbecause that has been \none of the biggest concerns of \nthe \nEuropean trade \nunion \nmovement over \nthe \npast five years. \nIt is a great opportunity to present you with some of the \nachievements\n that we have made with employers’ organisations, because we really believe in the social dialogue at the European level and we will share with you the specific positions of the trade union movement in order to enrich\n your thinking on this issue.\nThe questions will be addressed \nmainly \nby \nmy colleague \nIgnacio Doreste. \nI am Cinzia Sechi. \nI deal mainly with \nthe \nEuropean \nsocial \ndialogue\n, general equality issues and precarious work, while \nIgnacio is our adviser on youth policies. \nWe will try to complement each other as much as possible, and hopefully will answer your questions in a meaningful manner.\nThe Chairman: \nI should have said to you that the witnesses receive a transcript of this session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. \nIgnacio Doreste: \nThe nature of \nyouth unemployment is \nactually \nnot that different from what \nis happening \nin the banking \nsystem and the financial \nsector. \nFirst, we would like to point out that the youth unemployment rate \nwas \nalready \nhigh before the \noutbreak of the \ncrisis. \nIn \nEurope\n, this is d\nue to \nthe \nlack of investment \nin the productive sectors, which are sustainable both in terms of respecting the environment and in terms of \ncreating quality jobs. \nThat is our main point. \nBefore the crisis—during the golden years, so to speak—\nmany \nEU countries \nwere investing a huge percentage of \ntheir gross national product in \nspeculative rather than productive sectors. \nIn \nSpain\n, for \nexample, the situation is quite dramatic when it comes to unemployment in general but to youth unemployment in particular. \nI \ndo \nnot \nwant \nto stick \nonly \nto my own experience, but \nSpain\n is a good example\n to look at\n.\n In \nSpain\n, a\n lot of \ninvestment was \nallocated to the construction sector. \nIt was growing a lot because of the real estate bubble, so with the outbreak of the crisis there was a huge increase in youth unemployment and in unemployment in general. From that moment on\n, \nthere has been \nno macroeconomic policy to tackle \nthe origin of the crisis\n. \nEven though I have focused on my country, it is \napplicable to \nthe \nother \n27 EU \ncountries. \nIt might be timely for us to share with you an investment plan, which was approved by the Executive Committee of the European Trade Union Confederation a \ncouple of months ago\n, through which we are trying to apply pressure to national Governments but \nespecially the European Commission in order to shift from the current situation\n,\n \nin which we are \nfocusing \nmuch more \non \nthe \nlabour market \nand the reduction of the public deficit, \nto a new trend \nin \nwhich \nwe are applying to invest in strategic sectors. We are actually allocating 2% of the European \ndomestic product\n to this strategy. Maybe Cinzia can\n complete the presentation\n of this strategy\n.\nCinzia Sechi: \nYes. It is an investment plan and it is a political document belonging to the \nETUC\n. However, on investments at the European level there are some shared views with employers. We recently addressed a letter\n to President Bar\nro\nso and \nPresident V\nan Rompuy \non the need for Europe to direct more resources to our industries—this is very much a concern in the business sector and the strategic and public sectors, where it is a specific demand of the ETUC—to \nboost research into different sectors that could be much more productive\n, \nand\n to boost demand and the number of quality jobs in the near future\n. We have copies of the document with us \nand we can provide \nelectronic versions. It is the ETUC\n’s main \ncampaign \nand involves\n 85 \nconfederal \norganisations across 36 \nEuropean \ncountries\n, including of course the TUC in the \nUK\n. \nWe also have members beyond Europe, in \nTurkey\n.\nThe Chairman: \nThat would be most helpful. \nThank you\n very much indeed.\nQ196 &#xa0; \nLord Freeman: To what extent is the crisis that affects most European Union members a function of the lack of industrial and commercial demand? We have just heard evidence about the l\nack of skills\n, \nand \nin some cases the \nlack of \nproper \neducation and experience\n for young people in the sense that they are not qualified or available in the practical sense for work. What \nis\n the balance between the demand from \nindustry and \nthe supply of \nquality and experience of young people?\nIgnacio Doreste: \nThat is q\nuite a \ntimely \nquestion\n, which I think completes the previous one\n. \nWe have been talking about the lack of demand and the lack of investment in strategic sectors, but when it \ncomes to \nthe \nlack of skills\n we would point out first that it is agreed worldwide that \ncurrent\nly, especially at the European level, the \nyoung \ngeneration are \nthe most trained \nand well prepared \nin \nEuropean \nhistory. \nT\nhere has been a lot of focus on the \nlack of skills\n among young people that are needed to meet the demands of the private sector, because this is something that we constantly \nsee \nwhen we \nmeet \nour partners and have conversations with them. Even though we \nunderstand that there is room for improvement\n,\n especially in \nthe \nvocational system, we want\ned\n to point out that \nin the crisis \nwe \nare facing \na lack of demand\n and investment in strategic sectors\n.\n As Cinzia said, this also affects domestic demand.\nAgain, o\nn skills, together with employers and \nmany \nother \nimportant \nstakeholders\n, we have \nsigned up to \nthe European Alliance for Apprenticeships, since we believe that apprenticeships are a compelling way of \ntailoring \nthe demands of certain sectors to prepare students when they leave the education sector. We have also \nsigned a European charter of apprenticeships\n, together with employers. This is actually one of the \nmost important milestones of the past \neight \nyears\n when it comes to youth unemployment. We signed up to a framework for action on youth employment, which was divided into \nfour chapters\n, one of which was training\n. \nWe are aware that there is room for improvement, even though we considered that the main \nproblem is \nthe \nlack of demand \nand the \nindustrial \nand \nmacroeconomic\n problem\n. \nIt has been said that it is also important to remind ourselves that in \nthe past companies \nwere considered \nsomehow \nto have \nan obligation to train their employees. \nNow, what we hear from our partners is that they are demanding that young \npeople \nleave the education system with \nspecific skills \nthat are required by these companies\n. \nWe also think that the\nre should b\ne a balance of responsibilities when it comes to training their employees.\nCinzia Sechi: \nBriefly, I will \ncomplete\n what Ignacio has just said in answer to Lord Freeman’s question. \nWe have always \nhad\n mismatches between \nthe \nsupply \nside \nand \nthe \ndemand side. What \nis very \nconcern\ning in \nEurope\n is \nthat \nthe size of \nthis \nmismatch is increasing. The risk is that we will lose a \ngood \nproportion of \nthe well educated young \nif we do not \nre\nact in a timely manner.\n The so-called NEET generation is probably one of the main concerns at the moment, because it is as Ignacio said: people have probably never been so well educated at the European level across countries, but we are not fully exploiting their potential. This might also explain why the \nlong-term \nyouth unemployment rate is\n increasing\n in a number of member states. That will also mean that\n more resources \nwill have to be spent \nin the future if we want to \nattract and retain these people in the labour market. \nWhat is not helping \nat all \nis the proliferation of typical contractual arrangements. In \na country like \nSpain\n, the \nflexibilisation of the \nlabour market \nhas not \nshown \nitself able \nto \natt\nract or retain young people in a direct manner.\nLord Freeman: \nI have a brief supplementary question. \nThere are \nso \nmany \nthings \nthat \nyou can do \nin \nrelation to \nindustrial and commercial demand. Should there be greater direction in \nthe \nbalance of skills\n that young people need to acquire?\n We live in a \ndigital age, a \ncomputer age\n, but s\nome jobs are\n more prosaic and \nless glamorous and are not being filled\n or are being filled from outside the European Union. \nDo you feel that \nnot direction but \neducation of young people \nat school is a \nmore realistic\n thing to do in terms of employment\n?\nIgnacio Doreste: \nThat is included in the framework of action: that we \nnegotiate with employers. \nWe should \nidentify \nexactly \nthe sectors\n where there is no demand and the reasons for the lack of attractiveness for young people, because if it is because of bad conditions, instead of encouraging young people to go into these sectors \nwe have to improve the\nir\n \nworking \nconditions.\n That is our position. Any assessment and policy following that assessment should be done in a way that ensures that all citizens are included when launching the policy.\n \nThis framework of action on youth unemployment is something that we are going to provide.\nThe Chairman: \nThank you very much. This is the European charter on apprentices.\nIgnacio Doreste: It is kind of messy because there are so many different things that we are dealing with, but yes, we have that European charter on apprenticeships and the European Alliance for Apprenticeships. \nQ197 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: \nWe now m\nove on to \ntalk about \nhow trade unions can work with national Gove\nrnments to reduce unemployment and how you can work with the EU. There is not as much evidence of the social partnership in the \nUK\n as you might find in some European countries. Perhaps you might care to comment generally on what the relationships are like in different countries and how that helps or does not help to solve youth unemployment.\nBack at home, I will be very frank\n, people would say that the\n unions \nmay speak \nabout youth unemployment but they do not \nactually \nrepresent the young\n unemployed\n. \nThey represent increasingly a group of p\nublic sector workers and \na diminishing number of private sector employees, and in \na sense \nthe \nunemployed are excluded \nfrom them and cannot get into these jobs, particularly \nas \nthe \npublic sector is declining. \nYet the unions wish to speak on behalf of the unemployed. I wonder if you would care to \ncomment on that\n,\n because \nthose \ncriticism\ns are \nlevelled in the \nUK\n. \nI would like you to give us a European view generally of how you see the \nnature of the relationship \nbetween the EU and \nthe unions\n and how they would solve the problem\n. \nI would like an insight into what may be happening elsewhere, and then, if you like, you are free to comment on the specific \nUK\n issues.\n \nIgnacio Doreste: \nThat is quite interesting. \nIn order to prepare for \nsome of the \nquestions\n,\n we \ncontacted our \ncolleagues in \nthe \nTUC. \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: \nWe have taken some evidence from them about these issues. They were very good.\nThe Chairman: And it was excellent evidence.\nIgnacio Doreste: How can \ntrade unions at the national level interact with \nGovernments to tackle unemployment? This is not only about the trade unions themselves. Of course we can do a lot at \ncompany and sector\nal levels, and when it comes to negotiating with Governments not only the unions but employers are engaged through social dialogue. That is our point. As I just said, we talk with our colleagues from the TUC, and with them we acknowledge the unfortunate lack of \nsocial dialogue in the \nUK\n.\n \nWhen it comes to the criticisms of the \nlack of unions\n’ \nrepresentativeness \nof cash workers, \nyoung workers\n, unemployed people, first of all we would like to point out that a lot has been done over the past year within the trade union movement. Right now we have, I think, youth \ncommittees in almost \nevery trade union organisation\n \naffiliated to the ETUC. We have 85 trade union organisations \nfrom \n3\n6 \nEuropean \ncountries, \neven though \nthere is room for improvement\n—that is for sure\n. \nWe also have a youth committee at the European level. \nI had the opportunity to attend an a\nssembly of young workers at \nthe TUC headquarters in \nLondon\n a couple of months ago. They t\nackle the situation from a different perspective\n, and there are many different things that they are studying\n—we are studying them \nalso at the European level\n—\nin order to improve the affiliation rates of young workers.\n \nIreland\n is a good example\n, where they are increasing the \naffiliation rates\n of young people. We are studying many different ways, and considering not only campaigning but how to organise\n \nthe \ndifferent branches of \nthe \nunions\n to better represent precarious workers. There are different systems. \nItaly\n, for example, has a \nconfederation \nthat represents all the \nworkers\n, a federation for the\n regions and a\n federation for the sectoral\n, so they have \na federation only for precarious workers. So there are d\nifferent ways to proceed in o\nrder to improve representativeness of these types of workers, and we are constantly examining the different possibilities and interchanging good practices to organise young people better.\nThe Chairman: \nCan I interject there? \nWhich EU member states do not have youth committees? \nPerhaps you \nneed notice\n of that question, and if you could answer it that would be useful.\nIgnacio Doreste: \nFor sure, t\nhe 28 member states have youth\n committees\n. \nThe Chairman: \nAll of them?\nIgnacio Doreste: \nYes.\nThe Chairman: Then that is okay.\nCinzia Sechi: \nThere might be a difference within the same country. In a country like mine—I am Italian, as you can tell from my accent—there are \nthree confederations\n. One \nhas a youth structure\n in place. Others deal with youth issues, not through a specific structure of young trade unionists but through different bodies.\nThe Chairman: So it is not the trade unions that actually have the other two.\nCinzia Sechi: \nIt really depends on the structures of the confederation. But as Ignacio said, since we have members in all 28 EU member states, you will find at least one confederation with a you\nth \nstructure in place.\nThe Chairman: I see. I am sorry to interrupt you, Lord Brooke. Carry on if there is anything else that you want to ask. \nQ198 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: We as a Committee have found it difficult to \narrange \nmeetings with unemployed people. \nWe have managed to arrange some, but I suspect that there are s\nome groups \nthat \nare hard to reach. You \nprobably h\nave the\n same problems. With the unions you can have youth groups and youth conferences, but I think they are probably mainly \nconferences of people who are in employment rather than out of employment. \nDo you have any special means of making connections so that you can speak representatively on their behalf \nand fend off the criticism that you are defending the inte\nrests of people who are already in work and that you are not really able to speak on behalf of those who are not in work?\nIgnacio Doreste: \nI take your point. Indeed, w\ne represent employed people\n, but when negotiating better employment benefits with the Government we are\n defending \nthe \nrights \nand interests \nof unemployed people. \nIt really is a question many times of image and \nadvertising\n our own actions, but we have to acknowledge that trade unions all over Europe are suffering attacks from certain sectors of the media, which are really not helping us \nin \nintegrating into society. We \nare tackling h\nuge problems in many countries. Also, when it comes to o\nrganising, we have \nvery \ngood examples of creating platforms\n with civil society \norganisations. That \nis also a very wise way of exchanging views with\n other stakeholders in\n society such as NGOs, and even \nnon-\no\nrganised groups\n, such as those in my country with all these movements \nthat \nwere created after what happened in Puerta del Sol in May 2011. That is another good example. Actually we are thinking about having a European \npathway to deal with civil society organisations\n.\nThe Chairman: \nJust for clarification, would those civil society organisations be \nNGOs\n?\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: NGOs, yes. They are talking about creating a new pathway.\nIgnacio Doreste: \nActually, it is not a pathway, but it is common ground: a document, a joint strategy—something in that class. \nQ199 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: You mentioned \nearlier \nthat you have done some work on apprenticeships\n and on training. Can I just follow up on that, please? \nA\ns we have gone around talking to people, we have found it a bit difficult to define precisely what different people in different countries mean by \napprenticeships\n. That is question one. The other \nquestion \nis on training. Do you think that the quality, content and type of training across \nEurope\n are what is needed? If not, are there things that should be done about that at a European Union level?\nIgnacio Doreste: First\n of all\n, \nit is not only people in general who are finding problems in defining an apprenticeship and an internship but the \nEuropean Commission \nitself, because although it launched the proposal for a quality framework for apprenticeships, in that document, which is currently under discussion, it tackles\n \nwhat it referred to before as \nopen market internships. For many years when \nwe were \nnegotiating with employers \nand talking to the European Commission, \nwe referred to apprenticeships as \ntraining schemes \nwithin \nthe framework of the \neducation system\n and to internships as any kind of scheme that is after the education system, more or less. Before negotiating the framework for action on youth unemployment, we\n set up a\n joint definition of the different schemes with employers to avoid misunderstandings. \nAt \nthe European level, it is true that there are \nwide differences \ni\nn \nthe \nquantity\n and the quality of apprenticeship schemes\n. In \ncountries like \nGermany\n, \nAustria\n and \nDenmark\n, where they have a very \nwell\n \ndeveloped \ntraining system, the quality and quantity of apprenticeships provided, especially within the \nvocational training \nsystem, are pretty well \nrecognised\n by society as a whole. They are quite proud. T\nrade unions and employers’ organisations \nare also in many cases members of the bodies identifying the companies where students \ncan \nhave apprenticeships. They also \nassess \nthe \nquality of \nthe \nschemes. It is not only \na \nqu\nestion in many cases of the industrial fabric—what we can find in \nGermany\n is completely different from what we can find\n in\n, for example, \nCyprus\n—but it is also a question of how these bodies are conformed. \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Just to clarify\n, what would the definition of an apprenticeship be now in, let us say, \nSpain\n or \nItaly\n? What would “apprenticeship” mean?\nCinzia Sechi: \nWe at the ETUC \nhave just finished \na project at the European level. W\ne \nlooked at the \nquality framework\n for apprenticeships, and it showed that the definition was a common concern. If you want to find a shared definition at the European level, \nI advise you to look \nat what Cedefop\n \nhas provided as a definition of apprenticeships. \nCedefop\n is a tripartite agency of government, trade unions and employers, and we have \nexpressed our agreement \non that specific definition. You \nwill find details \nsuch as the fact that \napprenticeships \nshould be provided at workplace level, that some education should also be given by public institutions\n and \nthat a \ncontract should be att\nached to apprenticeship schemes\n. There is also \na reference to payment, which is not the case for apprenticeship schemes in some member states\n. \nCedefop\n could be a good starting point. However, as Ignacio said, there is \nproliferation \nand \na lot of political attention\n on apprenticeship schemes at the European level, so in different documents\n \nand publications \nunfortunately the \ndefinition used is \nnot\n \nCedefop\n’s\n.\n \nThere should be a political commitment on the part of member states and social partners to work together towards a shared definition not only at \nCedefop\n level but at a higher level. \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: I am sorry to interrupt, but what was the name?\nCinzia Sechi: Cedefop\n.\nThe Chairman: \nThat sounds very useful. \nHow many other \nmember \nstates\n would have that and have bought into that, as they say—they have adopted this?\nCinzia Sechi: \nIt has not been formally adopted, but \nit \nis \ncommon\n ground, and it is \none of the oldest agencies in \nEurope\n. It is based, unfortunately, \nfar away\n in \nThessaloniki\n in \nGreece\n. \nThe Chairman: \nAnd “encourages” employment, which they need. \nCinzia Sechi: Yes, indeed. Apprenticeship schemes vary too much at the European level, so, again, our political demand is that we should find a common meaning.\nThe Chairman: \nThis \nis what we \nreally \nbelieve. \nI am just interested to know how wide the acceptance has been of the 28 member states. \nHow ma\nny people know of its existence and how many of them have agreed that it is a good thing?\nCinzia Sechi: I will turn your question around. \nFirst of all, the \ndefinition of apprenticeships is not codified in \nall \nmember states.\nThe Chairman: \nYes, we know that.\nCinzia Sechi: \nSometimes it is in law, sometimes it is in regulations or \ncollective agreements.\n It would be interesting to see how many definitions match the \nCedefop\n definition, which matches what they have \nin \nDenmark\n and \nGermany\n but not \nwhat they have in a number of \neastern European countries\n, for example, where the schemes have not been developed very much. The other main issues with apprenticeship schemes are the\nir\n quality and \ntheir \nincreased \nattractiveness\n to young people.\n We hear a lot \nfrom our members that there is a lack of places for apprentices in a number of member states, including member states with a very strong dual system, such as \nGermany\n and \nDenmark\n. That, again, could have an impact on the schemes in the long term but especially in the short term. \nQ200 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: I \nreally \ndo not want to hog the conversation\n, but I am very interested in what you have said\n. \nYou have said that the d\nefinition of apprenticeships \nprobably differed \nfrom \nthe \ndefinition \nof apprenticeships \nthat other member states \nhave\n. Is there \nsuch a thing as \na document that shows \nthe definition of the word “\napprenticeship\n” in each of the 28 member states? We cannot get our heads around that.\nCinzia Sechi: \nCould you \nrepeat the question\n, please?\nThe Chairman: \nWe would like a definition of an apprenticeship. Is there a definition of what an apprenticeship is in each of the 28 member states?\nCinzia Sechi: We surveyed 10 member states and we \nfound that almost all of them had \na definition. \nI was not directly involved, but we found a definition in most of them. This definition is made either under the labour code or \nby \ncollective agreements. The nature of the instrument codifying the definition differs from member state to member state.\nIgnacio Doreste: \nWe worked on this in the final conference that we had in November, so we will provide you with the final document, which is quite handy when it comes to apprenticeships.\nI \nwould like \nto \ncomplete this \nquestion \non apprenticeships, because we may have focused too much \non good practice in \nGermany\n and \nDenmark\n. There are also very good examples in \nItaly\n, for example, where e\nmployers \nsigned \nan agreement\n \nwith three trade union confederations, I think three years ago. \nI can \nalso \nprovide \nyou with a brief explanation of this scheme, because it was presented as evidence of good practice for the negotiation on the framework for action \nat the European level. \nThey defined in a very \nclear way three different apprenticeship schemes. \nThe n\national framework \nwas \ncompleted six m\nonths ago, with another agreement reached between employers and the \nunions on a basic salary \nof \n€400 \nfor every apprenticeship, which can be improved at regional level. The €400 is the \nminimum floor\n for the company. In some regions, it even reaches €600 or something like that. We w\nill provide \nyou with \nmore information\n on that\n. \nIn \norder to tackle \nthe \nwide variety of \napprenticeship \nschemes \nand internships all over \nEurope\n, the European Commission \nlaunched \nthe \nquality framework for apprenticeships. \nIt was presented last December, on the 5th I believe. \nWe \ncan also provide you with the statement that we launched the day after. We \nagree with \nthe European Commission’s evaluation \non \nthe \nquality and quantity of apprenticeships \nall over \nEurope\n, \nbut we were \nreally \ndisappointed\n with the measure that it was recommending, because it is \na \nrecommendation to the Council. \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: What was their recommendation?\nIgnacio Doreste: \nActually their recommendation is as basic as saying that a\nny training \napprenticeship will do. The \nonly thing \nthey are asking for \nis for e\nmployers to provide a contract, so they are definitely not tackling the quality. R\negardless of \nthe \nconditions of \nthe \napprenticeship\n,\n \nthey should be registered in a written contract where \nall \nthese \nconditions should be kno\nwn by trainee\ns\n before they start the apprenticeship.\n \nThe Chairman: \nLord Brooke, did you want to ask question 5?\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: I think it has been covered.\nQ201 &#xa0; \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: You touched on the question of best practice, which has interested us quite a lot. How could, and how should, the Commission publicise best practice? One example that has come to us is the various bids for the employment initiative. We are told that every country, except one, which we happen to represent, has put in their bids, but these are not public documents yet, so the question is: do you think that the Commission could do more to publicise best practice? Would you support that, or is it being done enough already?\nIgnacio Doreste: First\n of all\n, the E\nuropean \nT\nrade \nU\nnion \nC\nonfederation\n \nfirmly \nbelieves that \nthe \nEuropean Commission should go \nfar \nbeyond \nexchanging practices in member states when it comes to promoting policies. We firmly believe that a c\nommon \nbackground that is obligatory for \n28 member states is necessary. \nWe are n\not talking about direct implementation. \nThe best way to tailor a European initiative is through s\nocial dialogue.\n \nWe have identified \nmany interesting \ninstances of good practice\n, which were used, for example, in the negotiations on the framework for action and in the negotiations with the European Commission on the implementation plans of the \nYouth Guarantee\n. \nMany member states are supposed to have \nalready \nsent\n their implementation plan to the European Commission. All that documentation is private so far. The European Commission is not discussing those plans even with the member states, as far as \nwe \nknow, or with the European social partners. \nWe can provide \nyou with \nsome \nexamples of good practice, which \nwere used \nas common ground \nto negotiate the four \ndifferent \nchapters\n of the framework for action on youth employment\n. \nWe \ncan give \nyou s\nome good examples \nof current good practice on the \nYouth Guarantee\n, for example, \nin \nFinland\n and in \nDenmark\n, \nAustria\n and \nSweden\n. \nThat is a great example because it has been t\nransposed to other European countries. \nThe same applies to the dual training system, which was i\nnitially created in \nAustria\n and in \nGermany\n. We also gave you the example of the \nItalian agreement for apprenticeships. \nWe have an \nannex\ne\n \nwith something like 20 good practices listed in it, which were presented in the negotiations on the framework for action. I always say that \nfive \nexamples should be selected for evidence sessions, but if it is possible I can send you the whole document. \nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Let me get this right. \nWhen I ask whether the Commission should be doing more, you are doing it. \nWhere are you getting \nall \nthe information\n from\n?\nThe Chairman: \nAnd \nwho is paying you\n to do it?\nIgnacio Doreste: \nActually we obtain all this information from our affiliates. During the negotiations on the framework for action on youth employment, the \nEuropean Commission \nfunctioned as a vehicle. It was the \nemployers and \nthe \nunions \nthemselves that wanted to \nnegotiate \nthe different courses of action, which are included in the agreement.\nLord Wilson of Tillyorn: Should there be more collection of\n data by member states? Should member states be doing this? Are you really doing this job, and is everyone else aware that you are doing it? Does it get out?\nCinzia Sechi: This is \nvery much \npart of the European social dialogue. \nIn order to reach that agreement with employers, we first collected evidence that social partners at the national level and at the \nsectoral level\n were active in addressing youth concerns\n. We collected \nthat \nevidence \nfirst, \nand \nthen \nnegotiated \na framework for action consisting of five priorities which we committed ourselves to looking \nat\n in the next three years and to continuing to monitor\n our members \nand see \nwhat they are doing\n, either together or unilaterally,\n to address youth unemployment. \nSo to answer your question, we will indeed continue to look at good practice, and at\n the end of the process we will make an assessment.\n Hopefully we will also be confronted with a better situation.\nThe Commission and the institutions are looking \nat good practice on youth unemployment \nfrom a different angle. \nOf course, they are very much involving Governments, whereas o\nur focus is \nmore \non social partners. Yes, we should continue to look at good practice\n, but we should make sure that this is not only a top-down approach. I agree very much with what you said: member states themselves should start not only putting these good practices into practice but sharing them at the local and the national level. Otherwise this European feeling will be lost. In a top-down approach, the impact of what we were doing would be limited.\nQ202 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: \nThat is very interesting. \nWe have asked\n about your view as to how the EU initiatives are being used in different states. How do you see the \nUK\n’s response \nin comparison to others? You talked about the youth employment programme, the \nYouth Guarantee\n and the youth employment initiative.\nIgnacio Doreste: \nT\no answer this question we \ncontacted \nthe TUC\n and asked for ideas\n. The TUC is not happy \nat all \nwith the fact that \nUK\n has decided that \nthe \nYouth Guarantee \nwill not be implemented in the \nU\nnited \nK\ningdom\n as the \nYouth Contract \ninitiative already covers \nthe same\n objectives\n. The TUC produced a\n very \ninteresting statement on \nits \nposition\n on the \nYouth \nContract\n. During the negotiations on the framework for action\n,\n the \nYouth Contract \nwas presented by \nrepresentatives \nof the \nUK\n employers’ organisations\n as a good practice. The \nTUC had a sound argument against \nthat \nproposal\n, because all the \ndifferent good practices\n included in the framework for action on youth employment at the European level did not \nnecessarily \nhave to be \nagreed\n between the social partners at the national level\n. The TUC disagreed\n with implementing the \nYouth Contract as\n a good example. Correct me if I am wrong but I think the \nYouth Contract\n was launched two years ago, so the TUC has already been able to \nassess\n its \noutcomes\n. It has not generated youth employment at all. \nThere is n\no way \nof \nassess\ning the \nextent \nto which \ncompanies\n are using the \nYouth Contract\n to replace other \nformal jobs\n. Even though it is stated in the political proposal at company level, since it is very difficult to guarantee that formal jobs are not going to be replaced \nby \nthe \nYouth Contract\n, there is n\no statistical evidence \nof how \nnet employment \nis going to be \ncreated solely by investing money in the private sector \nin order to subsidise jobs rather than by investing \nin economic activity itself. \nThe TUC was also quite critical about the fact that the \nYouth Contract\n also makes it possible for companies to \nhave \nyoung people \nin \nunpaid\n positions\n.\n It also related the fact that the \nscheme \nmeant that \nthe Future Job\ns\n Fund \nwas \nset aside when \nthe Youth Contract\n was \nlaunched by the Government.\nQ203 &#xa0; \nLord Freeman: You have been extremely helpful\n. Over the last two days we\n have heard a great deal \nand had some helpful advice \nabout the supply side coming from the European Commission\n and from companies\n. \nI would like to ask you about t\nrying to understand \nbetter \nthe demand side \nfrom \nyoung people. \nIn your judgment, are there a\nny initiatives \nthat could be taken by member states to understand attitudes to work and \nhow much knowledge \nthere is \nabout employment opportunities\n or lack of them? Can you think of any initiatives that would help both to educate and to understand the p\nre\ndicament that many young people find themselves in?\nIgnacio Doreste: We identified \nthe \ngood practice in the \nCzech Republic\n of both employers and trade unions visiting \nschools \nat a very basic level in order to share with the students the different prospects that they might expect in their \nworking lives\n. They tackled the \ndifferent youth opportunities, mainly in sectors \nthat were \nidentified as being \nparticularly un\nattractive, such as the energy sector\n in the \nCzech\n \nRepublic\n. At least, that is what they presented in the papers. They also presented the u\nnion side\n on completing training schemes for students. The unions talked about the \nspecific condition\ns\n of those sectors\n, the \ncollective agreements\n covering those sectors\n,\n \nhealth and safety issues\n, the\n work/life balance in general\n, and the sectors that were strong for the students in particular.\n The European social partners agreed on the importance of that\n, even though they do not think it is going to be \na magic solution for the crisis \nthat \nwe are facing. \nThat is why it was included as a good example in the framework for action.\nLord Freeman: Is that information readily available\n to us?\nIgnacio Doreste: I have it here.\nThe Chairman: \nYou are absolutely brilliant. \nIgnacio Doreste: I \nforgot to add the annexes, but I will send them to you if it is possible, because you will find all the examples of good practice in them.\nThe Chairman: \nYou are absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much. Lord Brooke, your question is the final one but I want to ask one afterwards.\nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: \nYou can ask yours now, if you want.\nQ204 &#xa0; \nThe Chairman: Right. \nI am going back to the money. \nDo you think that the ESF and the additional youth initiative \nmoney\n \nwill be used in the right way? A lot of money is involved and \nwe do not want to throw money at things and find that that has been such a waste, because \nwe\n will never recover from \nthe\n opportunity that \nwe\n have now. \nIgnacio Doreste: \nFirst of all, when it comes to the money, you are talking about the \nYouth Guarantee\n scheme, so I will focus on that\n. The \nInternational Labour Organisation carried out deep research \non the funding \nnecessities at \nthe European level of the effective implementation of \nthe \nYouth Guarantee\n. \nIt f\nound that more than \n€20 billion\n \nw\nould be needed. It is important to say that Eurof\no\nund states in research, which it launched in 2011 on the NEETs situation, that the cost \nof NEETs at the national \nand European \nlevel \nis actually the cost of not acting. If \nyou have people who \nar\ne neither \nworking \nn\nor \nattending any kind of \ntraining\n, that is the cost to the \nGovernment and the \nEuropean Commission of not acting\n, which \namounts to €160 billion a year, but I still think there is room for improvement in investment. The European Commission has allocated €6 billion for the \nyouth employment initiative\n, which is a lot and we firmly consider that that\n money should be \nspent in a very effective way.\n \nFrom what we \nhave heard from Ma\nnuel\n Huber\nt\n from the European Commission\n, the Commission is going t\no revisit that aspect when it assesses \nall \nthe \nimplementation plans \nand allocates the money to the member states to implement the \nYouth Guarantee\n. But it is a question \nnot only \nof the European Commission\n auditing the money sent to the member states but of the importance of social partners designing, together with the Governments, the different schemes that are implemented at the national level\n.\n That is also going to be a very effective way of ensuring that the money is well spent.\nQ205 &#xa0; \nLord Brooke of Alverthorpe: You raised the issue of zero-hours contracts\n earlier in one of your replies\n. \nYou indicated that you were not happy about them. Certainly the t\nrade union movement back in the \nUK\n \nhas been un\nhappy about them. \nWe have also had evidence from some quarters that\n,\n while people may not be enthusiastic about them, they are sometimes a \nmeans \nwhereby people can find an \nentry into the labour market who would otherwise remain unemployed. \nWe heard this morning from the Commissioner that they wanted a meeting with you to discuss their \nideas \nabout how they might produce a \nframework \nthat \ncould be suggested across \nEurope\n and that should form a basis for embracing zero hours to some degree\n. \nYou \nprefer \nto have \na wider discussion\n on youth unemployment, rather than focus simply on that topic. Could we come back to it, and could you give us the strongest argument you can that we should in principle be totally opposed to it when some have been advocating them, albeit not with enthusiasm, given the right conditions surrounding \nthem\n, as a means of getting people into employment? I got the impression that you were saying, “No, we just do not want to embrace them”—unless I am being unfair to you.\nIgnacio Doreste: First\n of all\n, a framework agreement was signed \nby the European employers’ organisation and the ETUC, which was later converted into \na \nD\nirective on temporary contracts. In that legal statement, we both agreed that indefinite contracts should be the rule rather than the exception. Both parties \nacknowledged \nthat certain forms of temporary contract could be a stepping stone to\nwards\n entering the labour market. That is something on which there is an agreement between \nemployers and\n the ETUC\n. \nHaving said that\n, examples of zero\n-\nhour contracts are practices \nthat are not the outcome of \nsocial dialogue\n. It \nis our opinion that w\nhenever we investigate whether a practice might be good or bad\n for helping workers to enter the labour market\n, the first thing \nwe should look at is whether that \npractice \nwas \nthe outcome of social dialogue\n and whether there was an agreement between the social partners at the national or European level. Fundamentally, in the two cases in the \nUK\n that you mentioned, there was no agreement. A t\nraineeship or internship\n, which is a scheme for when you leave the education system, is definitely not \ngoing to be the most qualified job experience of a young person’s life\n. The \ntrade unions are supporting \nthe schemes, but in order to e\nnsure that they are stepping stones \nand to ensure that \npeople \nare not stuck \nin a vicious circle\n it is important to define the floor conditions to ensure that it is not going to be possible for \ncompanies to make use of \nth\nat kind of \nformula\n, with \nthe same person \nin that position for a long \nperiod. \nIt is a\nlso important that \nthese kinds of \ncontracts are covered by the social security syste\nm and many other standards.\nThe Chairman: \nLet me \nsay a very big \nthank you \nto both of you \non behalf of us all. \nI am sure you will all agree that it has been v\nery informative\n. It certainly makes me realise that \nwe were absolutely right to come h\nere and seek your co-operation, which has been very graciously and generously given. W\ne will send you a copy of the report\n once we publish it. You will have the transcript to correct or whatever you want to do. Also, t\nhank you in advance for \nyour co-operation in sending us a lot of \nbackground data\n, which \nwill help\n us to give some measure of solidity to parts of the report \nthat \nwe might not have been able to do without them\n.\n Thank you very much.\n \n&#xa0;\n"
