&#xa0;

[[[Written evidence submitted by Mr J Vaughan (ESG 37)]]]&#xa0;I read the transcript of your meeting. I work as a financial analyst for an oil company in Aberdeen. My company has significant investments in the Eagleford and Bakken unconventional plays in the US. &#xa0;Question 5 (how much energy one frack pad could produce compared to one large wind turbine) was, I thought, a very good question. The weather isn't great this weekend so I spent some time thinking about it. &#xa0;As you might guess there&#xa0;are many variables,&#xa0;ranges and&#xa0;interpretations to work with. You could pick holes in all the numbers I have used, but to answer the question&#xa0;you have to make some assumptions. I estimate&#xa0;that 

[[[between 76 and 171 turbines are required for one]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[pad.]]] This is shown at cell D20 and D21 of Sheet 1 attached.&#xa0; My calculations compare the energy output from a gas well compared to a turbine over the lifetime of production.&#xa0;Looking at the spreadsheet boxes:1. This calculates the&#xa0;energy generated by a wind turbine over its life span - 

[[[115GWh.]]] The Enercon E70 is a typical turbine deployed&#xa0;where I live in Stonehaven.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2. The comparable energy from a shale gas well is 

[[[1,096GWh]]] using the mid point of prof Davies quote of production.&#xa0;Here we&#xa0;have to convert volumes of gas to energy.3. The volumes quoted by prof Davies are likely historic. The shale oil/gas industry is evolving rapidly, with constantly&#xa0;increasing efficiency and increase in production. Here I use the estimated future recovery by EQT, a significant player in the Marcellus.4.In this box I calculate the number of turbines per well&#xa0;and pad. Prof Davies said in answer to Q4 that 5.9 bcf was a very small number. To give that context I calculated the number of houses heated for a year using his mid point for a well is 66 thousand. A more realistic number might be 149 thousand. Included is the number of houses lit per turbine.&#xa0;On sheet 2 of the spreadsheet I cut extracts from various websites that I visited. All the information I used is either from your transcript or websites I looked up.&#xa0;In question 17 Mr Doughty mentions £70 billion. The Bowland shale was also discussed.&#xa0; The British Geological Association give a range for the resources at Bowland (the amount in the ground)&#xa0;with a stab at&#xa0;mid point of 1,329tcf.&#xa0;A 10% recovery factor is 133tcf. Current wholesale prices at NBP in the UK are ~68pence/therm. That is £7 per&#xa0;mcf. That&#xa0;equates to 

[[[£926bn]]]. The mix of hydrocarbons&#xa0;from wells varies widely. The Marcellus is mostly gas. The Eagleford players are aiming for the liquids window. The Bowlands will be a mix of gas, NGLs and crude.&#xa0;For comparison if the hydrocarbons were all crude, 133tcf equates&#xa0;to 22bn oil at 6,000 conversion. At&#xa0;$100 oil that is worth $2.22 trillion, say 

[[[£1.5tn.]]]&#xa0;Finally can I point out that some of the responses to your questions were a bit naff. The reference to Gaslands wasn't clever. We&#xa0;know it was a con. A few other observations:&#xa0;- Q9, an onshore drilling derrick is&#xa0;usually between 150ft and 200 ft. "tens of metres" is misleading. &#xa0;- Q9, "eventually"is misleading, drilling activities on a well pad take less than a year.&#xa0;- Q9, "for 10 years" is not representative of the production life of an onshore well. It is typically much longer than that.&#xa0;- Q31, answer "significant number of occasions to refracture some of the wells" is misleading.&#xa0;If a well is prolific they&#xa0;might frack it again a few times. "Significant number" is not&#xa0;the norm.&#xa0;- Q34, subsidy for shale gas is just plain wrong.&#xa0;The tax breaks&#xa0;mean&#xa0;that, instead of charging tax at ~62% like the rest of the oil industry, it will be more like 30%, as you say in Q35.&#xa0;- Q35, wind turbines "virtually do not need a subsidy now" is misleading.&#xa0; They actually do receive significant subsidies, every day.&#xa0;- Q39, the answer by prof Anderson is not very enlightening.&#xa0;"I suppose you could untie us from the European gas network" is an entirely meaningless comment.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
