default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) is grateful 
defaultfor opportunity to submit written evidence to the Committee in support of its inquiry into helicopter safety.
default1.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBALPA welcomes the Committee
default’
defaults continued interest in aviation safety, and applauds it for its decision to hold an inquiry
default to
default the important and 
defaultper
defaulttinent 
defaultarea of off-shore helicopter safety.
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, BALPA believes that an ind
defaultependent judicial inquiry into o
defaultffshore 
defaulth
defaultelicopter safety is required for two principal reasons:
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe CAA and the 
defaulth
defaultelicopter 
defaultc
defaultompanies have both recently announced reviews, but BALPA 
defaultdoes not believe that either of these will adequately assess the role of the 
defaulto
defaultil 
defaultc
defaultompanies, the amount of control they exert over the helicopter com
defaultpanies and ultimately their impact on the safety of public transport on the North Sea.
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNor will these reviews independently examine the adequacy of the “light touch” regulatory regime of the CAA which has demonstrably failed to ensure universally safe stan
defaultdards of operation.
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSix UK 
defaulto
defaultffshore public transport helicopters have been involved in serious accidents during the last 
defaultseven
default years. These events happened in 2006, two in 2009, two in 2012, and 2013. In all cases the helicopters entered the wa
defaultter. In two of the cases, water entry took place in a controlled manner following a malfunction contained by a published emergency procedure. These cases had the potential for fatalities due to the hostile nature of the environment. In the remaining four c
defaultases, the water entry was inadvertent or uncontrolled. Three of these cases resulted in multiple fatalities.
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll the accidents have been investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB); their investigation into the latest accident is continuin
defaultg.
default.
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn 29 November a Eurocopter EC-135 operated by Bond helicopters on behalf of Police Scotland crashed in the centre of Glasgow.  The AAIB is 
defaultat an early stage of investigation into the cause of this incident and at the current time the cause is far from
default clear.  Therefore, we will not submit evidence regarding this particular crash at this time, but, with the Committee’s permission, we may seek to submit supplementary evidence if more details are known before the Committee takes oral evidence.
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAll the hel
defaulticopter companies involved were subject to regulation by the UK CAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). 
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe fatal accident in 2006 Morecambe Bay (Ref 1) occurred due to pilot disorientation and poor monitoring during a visual night approach 
defaultunder low cloud followed by a poorly executed go-around from the approach. The CAA subsequently instructed all operators to review their procedures for night and poor visibility approaches.
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe next accident in 2009 ETAP (Ref2) occurred due to pilot disori
defaultentation and poor monitoring during a visual night approach in poor visibility. The helicopter company had reviewed its procedures in accordance with the CAA instruction above, and deemed them to be robust. The CAA’s evaluation of this internal review fail
defaulted to establish that the operator’s procedures fell well short of industry best practice
default. Following the accident, other North Sea helicopter companies made their own operations manuals available to the company involved to allow it to copy best practice in
defaultto its procedures. The CAA’s oversight of the company’s original Operations Manual is thus open to question, since its contents fell short of industry best practice prior to the accident, and yet were approved by the regulator.
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe second accident in 2009,
default an AS332L2 East of Peterhead (Ref 3) occurred due to a catastrophic failure within the helicopter’s main rotor gearbox. The AAIB report found that the operating company had misidentified the origin and composition of a metal chip which had initiated a war
defaultning on the gearbox chip detector system. The company had not followed the formal protocol in discussions with the manufacturer and as a result had not complied with 
defaultthe full
default maintenance procedure following its discovery. It is difficult to understand why,
default with the company
default being subject to two
default simultaneous serious accident investigations out of a fleet of only 
defaultnine
default aircraft, the regulator did not consider it necessary to suspend its Aircraft Operator’s Certificate (AOC) pending the conduct of a full investi
defaultgation of its operations.
default2.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBoth accidents in 2012 (Refs 4 &amp; 5) were as a result of the fracture of a shaft in the main rotor gearbox of EC 225 helicopters operated by two different companies. Whilst the root cause of both accidents was a manufacturing issue
default, neither company was using industry best practice of downloading and assessing Integrated Helicopter Usage Monitoring System (IHUMS) data after every flight. Had they done so, it is probable that the progressive cracking of the shafts would have been iden
defaulttified in time to remove both aircraft from service prior to the final fractures occurring.
default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 2013 Sumburgh accident involved an AS332L2 helicopter entering the sea while conducting a non-precision instrument approach in low cloud and poor visibility. Th
defaulte AAIB investigation has yet to be completed, but the interim report (Ref 6) indicates 
defaultthat the aircraft was in a serviceable state, and that use of automation and monitoring procedures were contributory factors.
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBALPA’s opinio
defaultn is that in recent years the CAA’s regulatory oversight of offshore helicopter operations has developed into “light touch” supervision as opposed to regulation. This has encouraged the oil and gas industry to introduce its own standards of equipment or in
default some cases operating limits. For example, one oil company has issued its own height minima for approaches to its installations, which conflict with CAA approved approach procedures. BALPA contends that the regulator has sole authority to approve aviation 
defaultprocedures, and it alone should be setting and maintaining and enforcing the high standards required to maintain safety – i.e. regulating the industry rather than overseeing it.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecent events have shown that the lessons learnt from the
default 1992 Cormorant Alpha accident (Ref 7) have not been universally applied by all helicopter companies including new entrants to the market. As a result of this omission, the common thread of helicopters crashing into the sea whilst conducting approaches in 
defaultpoor visibility and/or at night has continued with the 2006 G-BLUN Morecambe Bay, the 2009 G-REDU ETAP and the 2013 G-WNSB Sumburgh accidents. 
default3.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultRecommendations made by the AAIB to individual helicopter companies with regard to best practice in operations m
defaultanuals, inflight conditions, stabilised approaches, use of automation and monitoring techniques have 
defaultreceived a 
defaultCAA 
defaultresponse 
default“not addressed to the CAA” 
defaultin follow up reports 
defaultwhen 
defaultthe issues 
defaultwere clearly within the Authority’s regulatory purview (Refs 8, 9 &amp;
default10). BALPA believes that the actions required by these recommendations should have been subject to regular review and enforcement by a robust regulator. Had this been the case, these accidents could have been avoided.
default3.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the 
defaultAAIB 
defaultinvestigation into the 
defaultfatal 2013 Sumburgh accident is still in progress, the initial report describes a sequence of events with marked similarities to the 1992, 2006 and 2009 accidents, despite the approach being conducted under instrument flight rules. This latest example, and
default the public outcry it has occasioned, has undoubtedly prompted the CAA to initiate its own review into its regulatory activities.
default3.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Operations Manuals of all offshore helicopter operators should now be brought up to a common standard with particular rega
defaultrd to the use of automation, monitoring procedures, visibility and cloud base minima and procedures for  the conduct of visual approaches by night and in poor visibility. New entrants to the offshore market should be required to comply with accepted indust
defaultry best practice. This could be achieved by a helicopter operators’ conference sponsored by the regulator to identify 
defaultand agree the common criteria and procedures, which would then be incorporated in all operations manuals.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs
default already stated, the 
defaultAAIB
default report into the latest accident on 23 August 2013 has not yet been completed, but is likely to involve questions about training which is regulated by the CAA under its approval for Type Rating Training Organisations.
default3.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA recent tren
defaultd has developed of helicopter companies outsourcing training and recurrent checking of their crews to third party training providers. This policy is designed to reduce training costs to the operator which is achieved by having the training conducted by gro
defaultund simulator instructors rather than current operational pilots who are also Type Rating Examiners (TRE).
default3.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe techniques being taught and checked by these third party training providers must therefore be included in the oversight of best practice in the o
defaultffshore helicopter industry by the CAA Offshore Inspectorate. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of maintenance procedures, the CAA has not required all helicopter operators follow current best practice with regard to advances in IHUMS technology. 
defaultSpecifically, it has not mandated best practice with regard to downloading and analysing IHUMS data after every flight. Had this been the case, it is highly probable that the impending fracture of the gearbox bevel shafts in EC
default 
default225 helicopters G-REDW and G
default-CHCN would have been detected before failure, and hence neither aircraft would have been despatched for the flights on which they ditched.
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default 
defaultBALPA believes that regulation of the offshore helicopter secto
defaultr of the UK aviation industry should be significantly strengthened. The CAA has a recent history of being reactive to accidents rather than pre-empting problems. The required improvement in safety could be achieved by a robust pro-active approach which ide
defaultntifies and enforces industry best practice, takes account of developments in equipment and techniques, and ensures new entrants to the sector match up to the safest standards in operational and maintenance procedures.
default4.2.
default 
defaultBALPA believes that the Flight Operat
defaultions Inspectorate (FOI) of the safety regulation group of the CAA would benefit from the recruitment of additional inspectors with current experience of offshore helicopter operations, including some with experience of training, to a specialist Offshore He
defaultlicopter section of the inspectorate. This would increase the department’s appreciation of the detailed issues involved and enable it to assess the need for improvements to operational standards across the entire industry. The remuneration of these inspect
defaultors would have to match that of current North Sea pilots and licenced engineers to enable recruitment of suitably experienced staff to take place. This would mirror the status of the offshore department of the Health and Safety Executive, and BALPA is conf
defaultident that this would provide a significant net safety benefit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBALPA believes that the oil and gas companies exert an undue influence over the safety of the public transport helico
defaultpter sector of UK aviation 
defaultbecause 
defaultthey have immense financial customer power, and control the market to ensure very strong competition which leads to a dearth of spare capacity, and encourages cost cutting at the ultimate expense of safety. This is in mar
defaultked contrast with the Norwegian sector where a strongly dominant national oil company sets high standards, ensures adequate spare capacity is maintained, and where the  international oil companies have to comply to retain their operating licences. The UK i
defaults one of the very few significant oil producing countries in the world with no state oil company or sovereign wealth fund. In the absence of a state oil company, the role of the aviation regulator is critical in ensuring safety.
default5.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOil and Gas companies in th
defaulte UK sector have traditionally ensured that a highly competitive market exists for their helicopter support operations. This is managed in 2 ways.
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFirstly, standard contracts are structured in such a way that the oil company generally has a 90 day notice p
defaulteriod for termination of contract, whereas the contracting helicopter company is normally tied in to the contract for a period of years. This allows the customer to effectively threaten the helicopter company with a “market testing” exercise at any stage t
defaulthrough the duration of the contract, and to pull out of the contract at short notice if their market testing finds another operator to undercut the price. The oil companies frequently use the cyclical nature of the oil industry to impose price cuts on thei
defaultr contractors and service providers. This philosophy encourages the appearance of low-cost helicopter companies who inevitably try to cut corners on safety to achieve their low pricing structure. Many of these small companies are based in other European co
defaultuntries and organise their UK operations using “remote site” regulations which allow them to use their less restrictive Flight Time Limitation (FTL) schemes for competitive commercial advantage. These foreign operators are regulated by their own national a
defaultviation authorities rather than the UK CAA which could enforce a level playing field on safety if it had complete regulatory authority over all UK offshore helicopter operations.
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSecondly, the oil companies have ensured strong competition among helicopter 
defaultoperators by providing financial backing to new entrants to the market. 
default5.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is best exemplified by 
defaulta super-major oil company’s 
defaultfunding of 
defaulta large new entrant to the market 
defaultin 2004
default.  BALPA understands that 
defaultthe oil company 
defaultawarded 
defaultthe new entrant 
defaulta contra
defaultct which was heavily front end loaded to enable 
defaultit 
defaultto purchase 
defaultsix 
defaulthelicopters and acquire hangar, maintenance, operations and 
defaultpassenger handling facilities at Aberdeen and Sumburgh airports. This 
defaultmajor 
defaultcontract allowed 
defaultthe new company 
defaultto re-enter the market exactly 
defaultfive 
defaultyears after 
defaultthe same owners sold a 
defaultprevious business to a Norwegian competitor with a five year exclusion clause to 
defaultprevent them setting up a competing enterprise.
default5.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis sponsorship action was exactly as predicted by the 
defaultOffice of Fair Trading/ Monopolies and Mergers Commission in their decision to permit the merger between British International Helicopters (CHC) and Bond Helicopters into CHC Scotia in 2001. The analysis fails to identify the main reason prices for helicop
defaultter services rose after the 2001 merger. This was that following the disappearance of the previous company, wages for helicopter pilots had to rise by nearly 50% over 
defaultthree
default years in order to stem the dramatic loss of helicopter pilots to the fixed wing jet
default sector of the aviation industry in the late 
default19
default90s and early 2000s. This exodus followed many years of wages depressed by the results of the previous company’s successful business model of building market share by undercutting rival operators on the basis 
defaultof low wages. 
default5.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultoil c
defaultompanies also usurp the power of the regulatory authority by setting up “industry bodies” such as Step Change in Safety and the Helicopter Safety Study Group (HSSG) which take the initiative over policy and equipment, (Oil and Gas P
defaultroducer Aircraft Management Guidelines (OGP AMG)) which they impose through their unequal contractual arrangements. The 
defaulto
defaultil 
defaultc
defaultompanies are careful to invite the CAA to membership of their HSSG thus giving it some “legitimacy”. BALPA believes that the correc
defaultt regime would be to have a powerful and proactive UK national regulatory authority which sets common standards of safety which transcend competitive pressures, and mandates safety improvements in equipment and procedures.
default5.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAn example of the oil companies e
defaultnforcing their own agenda to the detriment of aviation safety was their issuing personal locator beacons (PLB) to “their” helicopter passengers. These PLBs were designed for use by personnel working over the side of offshore installations, and were intende
defaultd to assist rescue from the water by fast rescue craft with homing devices.  In the case of the 2009 ETAP accident, these small PLBs were initiated by the passengers and interfered with and rendered inoperative the powerful aircraft locating beacons which 
defaultwere part of the mandatory aircraft equipment for the purpose of rescue of passengers and crew. The very short range of these PLBs actually hindered the rescue of those involved in the accident.
default5.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe reservations of the helicopter operators about the issue 
defaultof these PLBs to passengers were over-ridden by the oil companies who insisted that they be worn by the passengers as an addition to the mandatory Personal Protective Equipment.
default5.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt took an 
defaultAAIB
default safety recommendation following the ETAP crash before the CAA 
defaultfinally acted despite many Air Safety Reports being rendered by helicopter operating crews over the use and erroneous activation of these devices by the passengers.
default5.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaulto
defaultil 
defaultc
defaultompanies have also fiercely resisted attempts to abolish reliance on mechanical me
defaultthods (Dacon Scoop) as the sole means of recovery of survivors from the sea in high sea states, and to ensure provision of fire cover on many Normally Unmanned Installations (NUI) in the Southern North Sea.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default6.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBALPA believes that aviation in the North Sea is necessary to ensure a productive oil and gas sector which has huge positive knock-on effects in the local and national economy.  However, our vision is to make every flight a safe flight.
default To improve safety B
defaultALPA makes the following recommendations:
default6.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat a full independent public judicial enquiry takes place into the conduct of the 
defaulto
defaultffshore 
defaulth
defaultelicopter 
defaultindustry with a 
defaultremit to include:
default6.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat a separate Offshore Helicopter section of the CAA Safety Regulation Group
default Flight Operations Inspectorate be established. This section should be staffed by inspectors who have at least 
defaultfive
default years
default’
default recent personal experience in the large offshore public transport helicopter sector of the aviation industry, and who are remunerated
default at a level equivalent to senior front line pilots and licenced engineers to allow recruitment from the industry.
default6.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat frequent and regular reviews of industry best practice be initiated by the CAA in order to keep up with new technology developments, and 
defaultto ensure that all lessons learnt from accidents and AAIB recommendations are universally applied. In particular, new entrants to the market should only have their Operations Manuals approved, when they have been scrutinised to ensure that they incorporate
default all the current industry best practice, rather than 
defaultmere 
defaultcompliance with minimum international standards.
default6.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat the CAA obtains authority from EASA to regulate the operations of al
defaultl foreign entrants into the UK o
defaultffshore 
defaulth
defaultelicopter public transport market, 
defaultto ensure that they meet the same rigorous standards of equipment, operations and maintenance required of the UK based operators.
default6.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThat the CAA mandates downloading of IHUMS data immediately after every flight and analysis prior to the next flight.
