"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted to the EFRA Committee by the Born Free Foundation14th January 2014&#xa0;WE understand that t\nhe EFRA Committee \nis seeking written submissions of \nevidence \nin regard\n \nto the following\n:\nWe welcome the opportunity to comment, and would be happy to discuss the specific details with the Committee.\nWe do not wish to present evidence of the extent of the trade and keeping of prim\nates as pets within the UK at this stage. \nWe understand that other organisations intend to make submissions covering this point.\nThe following comments refer to the keeping of primates by private individuals, distinct from the keeping of primates in licens\ned zoos or in genuine animal sanctuaries.\nSummary:&#xa0;&#xa0;“They are wild undomesticated animals that cannot be house-trained or fully tamed”Defra 2009\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;The primate Order consists of approximately \n230-4\n00\n+\n species (depending on classification), ranging in size from mouse lemurs to lowland gorillas. \nDepending on the species, primate groups in nature range in size from 1 to 800 (\nChapman\n \n&amp;\n&#xa0;\nTeichroeb\n 2012) across \na range of habitats, from \nsavanna and \nrainforest\ns\n to montane forests and grasslands.\nMost primates\n are intensely social. Infant primates may be carried constantly by \ntheir mothers for weeks, remain in constant \nproximity \nfor months, and live in family groups for years.  Primates \nkept as \npet\ns\n may be taken\n from their mothers when they are just weeks or even days old. \nResearch \ndating from Harlow’s controversial experiments in the 19\n50\ns to recent work by Feng et al. (2012) \nhas demonstrated the considerable and long-lasting \nnegative \neffects \non behaviour and we\nlfare resulting from \nseparating infant primates from their mothers.\n \nA domestic environment places limitations on the size of primate group that is likely to be kept, and as a result p\nrimates may be kept alone\n or with incompatible conspecifics, with associated detrimental effects on welfare.\nPrimates are intelligent, agile and strong. \nEven the smallest primates \nare equipped with \nteeth and nails that can inflict injury to humans\n (there is a risk of significant i\nnjury from many species)\n, and \nindividuals that \nare apparently accustomed to handling\n by humans \nremain \nunpredictable.\nAs our closest relatives, nonhuman primates are able to share and transmit many diseases that may infect humans:\n \n“\nNonhuman primates, by vir\ntue of their genetic, physiologic, and sometimes social similarities to humans, are particularly likely sources of infectious agents that pose a threat to humans\n” (Jones-Engel et al. 2005)\n. \nSuch \nzoonotic \npathogens include\n v\niruses\n \nsuch as herpes B (herpesvi\nrus 1)\n, \nand \ngastrointestinal and pulmonary bacteria\n including \nSalmonella\n, \nShigella\n and \nStreptococcus\n spp. \nThe Code of Practice \nassociated with the \nAnimal Welfare Act 2006 \ncurrently acknowledges that the \nconditions\n must be “appropriate to\n the species”. \nAs stated previously, there may be more than 400 species of primate that could potentially be privately kept. \nRunning to\n \nonly \n24 pages, it is perhaps inevitable that the\n existing C\node \no\nf \nP\nractice\n \nis \ngeneric\n and\n,\n in our opinion\n,\n \nwholly insufficient to address the varied needs of such a \ndiverse \ngroup of animals.\n \nFurthermore, w\ne \nare convinced \nthat \na system based \neven \non an expanded and \nmore detailed \nCode \nof Practice simply cannot \ngu\narantee the welfare of primates as pets, as a resu\nlt of the incompatibility between the\n animals’ \nbiology and needs and the domestic environment.\nThe Dangerous Wild Animals Act \n(DWAA) \nrequires\n inspection and\n licensing for some species of primate considered to be dangerous. \nIt should be noted that the DWAA is first and foremost public health and safety legislation, and covers animal welfare only \nsecondarily\n. It does not cover the most commonly kept species of primates in the UK. \nIt \nhas been acknowledged \nthat \nimplementation a\nnd\n enforcement of this act is \nproblematic\n:\n “\nMany dangerous wild animals are not kept in public view and therefore there is less chance of the keeping being reported by a third party or the local authority becoming aware of their presence and being able to\n carry out enforcement action\n“.\n (Defra 2009b)\nWe consider that the DWAA exemplifies some of the problems associat\ned\n with licensing the private ownership of non-domesticated animals, and indicates that a similar system for pet primates would be unworkable.\nIt should be noted that countries in Europe including \nBelgium and \nthe Netherlands \nhave \nimplemented \nlegislation that effectively prohibits\n the keeping of primates.\nApproximately half of the states in the USA prohibit \nthe \nkee\nping \nof \nprimates as pets (and there are some forms of restriction in place in many of the other states). In addition, importing primates into the United States for the pet trade has been pr\nohibited since 1975 on the grounds of risks to health.\nExperts in the field of primatology are united in their concern for primates kept as pets. The International Primatology Society \n“\nopposes the holding of nonhuman primates in captivity by individuals for any non-scientific, non-certified educational or \nnon-registered/accredited sanctuary purposes, including the possession of nonhuman primates as pets or companion animals as well as engaging in breeding and trading for these purposes\n”\n.\n (IPS n.d.)\nAn opinion poll was commissioned by the Bor\nn Free Foundation, Captive Animals’ Protection Society and the RSPCA in January 2013. In response to the question “Do you think that keeping primates as pets in the UK should be legal or illegal in the UK?”, the responses were as follows:\n“Should be illega\nl”: 65%\n“Should be legal”: 11%\n“I don’t have an opinion whether it should be legal or illegal”: 24%\n(ICM Research, 2000 respondents)\nExotic animal medicine remains a minor part of the veterinary curriculum\n and \nspecialist knowledge of \nprimate medicine is not widespread among veterinary practitioners\n. It \nfollows\n that primate owners are extremely unlikely to be able to access specialist primate veterinary care at \ntheir local veterinary practice, which is an obstacle to providing sufficien\nt and appropriate \nanimal health\n \nand welfare\n.\nPrimates are generally long-lived. \nIt is inevitable that situations \narise \nwhere, unfortunately, owners \nmay \nno longer wish to \nor be able to \nkeep their \nprimate\ns: owners\n’ circumstances \nchange,\n animals mature and \nbecome \ndifficult to manage\n \nor develop costly health problems\n, for example\n. For companion animals such as dogs and cats, there exists an (admittedly overstretched but) well-established network of shelters, sanctuaries and charitie\ns offering the chance for rehoming and/or lifetime care. Such \na support network is\n, \nin effect, \nall but \nabsent for primates. As a result, \nthere is currently a potential welfare deficit facing primates kept as pets. \nIt has been proposed\n that the keeping of primates be limited to “specialist keepers”: individuals with knowledge and experience of keeping primates. We do not support \nthe \nkeeping \nof primates by private \n\"specialist keepers\"\n.\n \nT\nhere is currently no \nsubstantive \nmeans by which to \ndetermine objectively \nwhether an individual\n is \na specialist i.e. \nsuitably qualified and experience\nd\n. \nMoreover\n, such keepers may continue to keep primates in a domestic environment which, we are convinced, cannot offer a suitable condition for primates.\nConclusion:We wholeheartedly support moves to ban the keeping of primates as pets. At this stage\n,\n we do not offer suggestions as to the mechanism by which \na ban \nmight be \nimplemented:\n \nw\nhether by a ban on keeping and/or a ban on the trade of primates\n, under th\ne Animal Welfare Act or by \nother \nprimary legislation. \nWe would be delighted to present further evidence on these matters to the Committee.\n&#xa0;\nReferences:Chapman,\n&#xa0;\nC.\n&#xa0;\nA.\n&#xa0;\n&amp;\n&#xa0;\nTeichroeb,\n&#xa0;\nJ.\n&#xa0;\nA.\n&#xa0;\n(2012)\n&#xa0;\nWhat \ni\nnfluences the \ns\nize of \ng\nroups in \nw\nhich \np\nrimates \nc\nhoose \nt\no\n li\nve?\n&#xa0;\nNature Education Knowledge\n&#xa0;\n3(10):9\nDefra (2009\na\n).
