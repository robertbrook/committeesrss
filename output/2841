&#xa0;[bold]Supplementary evidence f[bold]rom London Councils following t[bold]h[bold]e evidence session o[bold]n[bold] [bold]11 September[bold] 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]London Councils was very grateful for the opportunity to give oral evidence to your Justice Select Committee on Wednesday 11 September on the crime reduction inquiry.
[normal]Regrettably, we did not have sufficient time to provide full answers on some of the important issues that were discussed. Following further discussions with your clerks, who offered further guidance on the questions you were most interested in we would like to provide the following information to the committee.
[normal]We are very happy that this information is made public as part of the evidence that your committee has received.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What are the relative merits of the Government’s reforms to the commissioning of rehabilitative services through national contracts as opposed to devolving responsibility to local decision makers such as PCCs and local authorities?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]London Councils broadly agrees with the Transforming Rehabilitation objective of reaching as many offenders as possible with rehabilitative services, and especially those most likely to re-offend. We have therefore welcomed the proposed extension of rehabilitation services to offenders on short term sentences (less than 12 months). Re-offending rates by prisoners on short term sentences costs the criminal justice system a disproportionate amount. It also has a significant effect on local communities and local perception of crime. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have also cautiously supported the government’s commitment to designate new local resettlement prisons, so that local areas are better able to work with prisons, and the National Probation Service or other probation providers to commission rehabilitation and resettlement services.  We have however, asked government for reassurance that these reforms are achievable in London, given the particular pressures on prison spaces in London.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are concerned about the intention to commission probation services at the national level. Nationally commissioned services are out of kilter with this government’s stated commitment to local, responsive services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is our view local relationships and knowledge lead to better commissioning of services and that locally commissioned services are more flexible and responsive to local needs. By contrast nationally commissioned services can inhibit local partnership working and stifle innovation.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Experience tells us that there are significant question marks about national government’s ability to performance manage delivery of nationally commissioned services which operate at a local level. These can lead to inadequate performance from providers looking to minimise costs. There is already clear evidence from the Work Programme that commissioning these types of services from the market, when applied on a large scale and managed nationally, can lead to low levels of effectiveness. Indeed, introducing new providers of offender management, who have little incentive to co-ordinate with local provision,  has the potential to negatively affect existing local partnerships that have often years to build, where local probation trusts currently play a key role. It may also jeopardise local efforts to better align service delivery. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, we have concerns that the model of national commissioning with large contract package areas may have the effect of narrowing the market of providers, with only large providers being able to compete for contracts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would therefore suggest the government consider the following to ensure that commissioned rehabilitation services be best aligned with local priorities
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]As such London Councils is asking the government for the following[bold]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Do you support the view of our predecessor Committee that there needs to be a direct financial incentive for local agencies to spend money in ways which will reduce prison numbers? [bold]It is London Councils view that financial incentives can play a valuable role in ensuring resources are spent in a more intelligent way which delivers better outcomes and provides savings for the public purse as a whole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recent modeling by the Tri-borough Community Budget pilot demonstrated that should local authorities increase investment in reducing offending (and therefore prison numbers), the cashable savings would only accrue to the police, health and the criminal justice system, rather than councils. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This need to directly incentivise agencies to reduce offending was recognised by the Justice Reinvestment Pilots, where local areas were cash-rewarded for reducing demand on the 
[normal]criminal justice system. There was evidence from those pilots that this approach was seeing some success. The government should think about how this investment model can be expanded to incentives local agencies. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Equally it is our view that pressures on all partners’ budgets, as well as the reforms within the probation service, mean that in the future it will be critical for local government to be given the powers and responsibility to align and coordinate the resources of local partners in order to achieve better crime reduction outcomes and better value for money. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Do the Government’s reforms to introduce payment by results into the commissioning of rehabilitative services provide a sufficient incentive?[bold]Payment by results can and do work in terms of getting good value for money for tax payers and driving innovation. However it will be essential to get the right payment by result model.
[normal] 
[normal]Reducing reoffending is not a straight forward process, with many agencies and often many interventions required before an offender changes their behaviour. It is difficult for to see how a payment by result model can respond effectively to that complexity.  For example despite the Government’s finessing of their financial model for these reforms there is still a perverse incentive for providers to game the system, using creaming and parking. The Government need to ensure that providers do not just work with those offenders that have less complex needs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In addition, there are concerns that PbR model where it is successful encourages these savings to be paid out in profits to providers, rather than reinvested into early intervention There is a real risk that new providers will lack the incentive to either provide initial upfront investment or reinvestment of their resources into early stage interventions, given that their profit-margins and payment mechanism is built on rehabilitating individuals already convicted of a crime. A recent report by the Social Market Foundation suggested that the PbR model being proposed by the Ministry of Justice risks “backfiring because their proposals mean that private and third sector organisations are in danger of losing money if they try to cut re-offending”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In contrast, the Community Budget pilots, as well as other local areas, are prioritising intervention earlier and further upstream in those who, potentially have the highest need and may ultimately be of high cost to the public purse. There is a commitment between participating partners that savings are then reinvested into through the community budget to provide earlier interventions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]My officers have raised these concerns with Ministry of Justice officials and are involved in the recently set up Transforming Rehabilitation Local Authority Reference Group. However we have yet to receive concrete assurances on how our concerns will be addressed.
