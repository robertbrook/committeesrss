default&#xa0; 
defaultWildlife and Countryside Link (Link) brings together 42 voluntary organisations concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife, countryside and the marine environment. Our members practise and advocate environmentally sensitive land management, and encourage respect for and enjoyment of natural landscapes and features, the historic and marine environment and biodiversity. Taken together
default,
default our members have the support of over eight million people in the UK and manage over 690,000 hectares of land.
default&#xa0;default1.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultLink convened a dedicated Task and Finish Group to work on Invasive Non-Native Species 
default(INNS) 
defaultissues in late 2012, which brings 
defaulttogether 
defaultconsiderable scientific, policy and practical experience of issues relating to INNS. Our objectives include scrutinising government policy, gathering evidence on the impacts of INNS on the third sector, and raising the profile of the issue with government and the public alike. Our preliminary analysis

default of the fitness and success of

defaultInvasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain

defaultThis submission is supported by the following

default organisations:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultINNS cost the British economy at least £1.7billion every year, and it is estimated that in addition, 
default‘
defaultthe total non-market costs incurred, including disturbance of ecosystem services, have been estimated to £96 billion in the UK
default’.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe European Environment Agency (EEA) has estimated that the cost to the EU of a range of INNS was 
defaultat least 
default€
default12billion per year.
default All the evidence points to these costs to society increasing significantly and exponentially, as invasion increases and established INNS become more invasive (or the impacts of their invasiveness manifest themselves). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment asserted that the global negative impacts of INNS on biodiversity were of a similar magnitude to that of climate change and habitat loss.

default&#xa0;
default2.3.2.
default 
defaultA
defaultppropriate, effective and timely legislation is deployed at both the UK and EU level, together with an increased use of and confidence in existing tools, such as the ability to ban the sale of known problem species, and a ratification of the Ballast Water Convention. We also need to harmonise the detail of existing 
defaultUK 
defaultlegislation, for example 
defaultby 
defaultcreating provision for Species Control Orders in all UK countries, not just in Scotland.

default-

default,
default which also seek to educate and build capacity within those sectors and are monitored to ensure the
defaulty
default deliver results. If they do not, then regulatory means 
defaultshould be deployed.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultSome NGOs manage large areas of the countryside where non-native species have become established and sometimes subsequently 
defaultbecome 
defaultinvasive. A complete overview of costs for all members would be difficult to produce, but here are some indications: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment is to be applauded for its investment in the GB Strategy. Th
defaulte strategy
default was developed in consultation with many stakeholders, at a time when few other EU Countries 
defaulthad 
defaultadopted similar programmes. The establishment of a dedicated GB Secretariat to oversee and support delivery of the strategy was also much welcomed. The GB Strategy was visionary for its time, providing much
default-
defaultneeded focus and prioritisation.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultMuch of the planned delivery against this strategy has been effective, but there have been shortfalls. Unfortunately
default,
default the shortfalls have occurred 
defaultaround
default preventative measures
default, which are the measures
default most likely to be cost effective, but 
defaultalso 
defaultoften the most difficult to implement. For example, no Pathway Action Plans (identifying the routes of invasion and planning for their control) have been completed, and horizon scanning work (identifying future threats) has been patchy at best
default;
default both
default were
default given priority in the original strategy.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition, although Government consulted in 2007 on how a ban on sale (possible via Section 14ZB of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) on certain problem species could be an effective tool for their control, a ban on sale has yet to be fully implemented and is currently only envisaged for five
default plant
default species, the majority of which are already widespread. We believe a number of other species lend themselves to a swift ban on sale, for example 
defaultLysichiton americanus
default (American skunk cabbage). 
defaultT
defaulthe proposed EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species would likely make provision for bans on sale (a black list) for key species over and above those currently listed for such action in the UK,
default but
default it may be many years before such action becomes obligatory in the UK. There is therefore a need to explore further use of this domestic tool in the interim.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultLegislativedefault5.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe need robust and fit
default-
defaultfor
default-
defaultpurpose domestic legislation which includes the effective and timely 
defaultuse
default of existing legislation
default,
default together with its enforcement, supplemented by a number of 
defaultchanges
default to address shortfalls. To our knowledge, there have been few
default,
default if any
default,
default prosecutions of those who intentionally allow species listed under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to become established in the wild (despite this having evidently been the case on a number of occasions). This sets an unhelpful precedent and 
defaultprovides 
defaultno deterrent. As mentioned above, an effective response, that fully embodies the precautionary principle, includes a swift ban on sale of those species which evidence demonstrates are having, or could have
default,
default a major impact on human health, the economy or natural assets, and for which trade and sale are the major pathways 
defaultof
default invasion. 
defaultW
defaulte do not feel that the precautionary approach is
default currently
default given sufficient weight
default 
defaultin consideration of which species should or should not be banned from sale. In addition
default,
default the evidence presented to support such a case does not include the full range of actual or predicted costs and benefits to wider society of implementing this measure.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultA major barrier to the effective control of problem species lies in the inability of relevant authorities to access land where problem species have become established. Neither can they compel the landowners to notify 
defaultthem of
default the presence of named species, or take action to address invasions where it is reasonable to do so. This situation was recently rectified within Scottish legislation with the creation of Species Control Orders under the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Act 2011. Such land can now be accessed
default in Scotland
default, and
default costs can,
default if necessary
default, be 
defaultrecovered from land owners who do not take action. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Scottish model also includes a new framework that assumes species are not safe for release (but are otherwise safe for sale) unless it can be proven otherwise; this effectively amounts to a ‘white list’ approach. With so many problem species on the horizon, and a relative lack of information about the likely impact of future invaders, the Scottish framework embodies the precautionary approach (
defaultalthough 
defaulta variety of exemptions do apply).
default With an ineffective and incomplete Schedule 9 listing mechanism in England and Wales, which does not benefit from regular review and which is ineffectively publicised or used to prosecute, we believe there is merit in 
defaultexploring whether
default similar measures in England and Wales in relation to the intentional release of species
default could be beneficial
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPartnershipsdefault5.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe GB Strategy helped to establish a number of key partnerships, in recognition of the shared problem and joint solutions and resources required to address the impacts of INNS. The NGO community are key lead partners in virtually every Local Action Group (LAG), which coordinate action on the ground. We have also played a supporting role in promoting ‘Be Plant Wise’, in establishing and promoting ’Check Clean Dry’ and in 
defaultcommunicating the impacts of INNS to the general public and the press. An effective response, into which partners can invest
default,
default requires absolute transparency as to the decision making 
defaultthat 
defaultunderpin
defaults
default action, communications work, and 
defaultthe 
defaultprioritisation process. This has unfortunately been lacking on a number fronts thus far.
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe recommend
default 
defaultthat the NGO community be brought into high
default-
defaultlevel decision making with regards to government policy on INNS, ideally through representation on the 
defaultINNS
default Programme Board. This 
defaultwould
default facilitate greater buy-in and investment from the NGO community
default, which is necessary to successfully tackle INNS in the UK
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultPublic communicationsdefault5.6.
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is widely acknowledged that to effectively tackle INNS we need 
defaultthe 
defaultgeneral public 
defaultto be aware of the problem and ready to act, 
defaultas well as 
defaulthaving 
defaulteffective technical tools
default available
default. Many of the species we would seek to identify
default,
default contain or tackle will first be observed by members of the public, and 
defaultthe reasons for addressing 
defaultsome species 
defaultwill
default require thoughtful explanation. There has been good progress
default,
default for example in developing ‘Be Plant Wise’ and ‘Check Clean Dry’, although it has proven difficult to establish the success of these projects
default,
default which are aimed at particular sectors rather than the general public. 
default&#xa0;
default5.7.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe GB Strategy established a communications group to oversee and deliver on this need. However, although this group has made progress it has been stymied by a government freeze on funds for communications work, and an inability to gain the necessary expertise to devise structured campaigns. Moving forward, 
defaultwe need
default a well-resourced and fit
default-
defaultfor
default-
defaultpurpose communications campaign which seeks to meaningfully engage with all relevant sectors, is dynamic and can be monitored to demonstrate impact.
default&#xa0;
defaultIntra-departmental and intra-governmental communicationsdefault5.8.
default&#xa0; 
defaultAn effective response requires buy-in, resourcing and ownership of action in 
defaultd
defaultepartments other than Defra (
defaultas well as
default between Defra’s 
defaultagencies
default). This is in recognition of the breadth of impacts caused by INNS to society, and the need to draw on mechanisms outside Defra’s 
defaultscope of 
defaultinfluence. For example, responsibility for ratification of the Ballast Water convention lies not with Defra but with the Department for Transport.  
default&#xa0;defaultPrioritising actiondefault5.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt has long been recognised that to fully address the presence of problem 
defaultspecies 
default(or 
defaultthose with the 
defaultpotential
default to cause
default problem
defaults
default) already present in the UK (which currently stands at 
defaultalmost 2000 non-native species
default)
default,
default requires resources far beyond those likely to be reasonably available. The actual or likely impact of each species varies, as does knowledge of the ecology of each species and of how it will express its invasiveness in a UK context. An element of prioritisation has been core to the domestic approach thus far, underpinned by the production of high quality risk assessments
default. However,
default we do not consider that 
defaultthis
default has been sufficiently strategic. There has been a lack of clarity over why action for certain species has been prioritised over others, and in particular what outcome is ultimately sought for species already established. The lack of systematic horizon scanning has undermined the ability to prioritise action towards preventing new species from arriving – the most cost effective means to prevent impacts, i.e. before species become established.
default&#xa0;
default5.10.
default 
defaultA single body to identify, plan and oversee strategic management INNS, and to ensure that the environmental benefit of available resources is maximised, should be identified. This will need to operate at country level – the legislation in Scotland has been updated recently to allow for this.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe NGO community is deeply supportive of the clear need for EU-level action, to be underpinned by appropriately robust legislation which all Member States must in principle adhere to. The effectiveness of our own GB level strategy is significantly undermined by a lack of corresponding action and investment by other Member States. We have worked, and continue to work
default,
default on a number of levels to ensure that this legislation is positioned to support the efforts of the UK through enhanced efforts and coordination in other countries that affect us, and where necessary further drive forward domestic action. The attributes of appropriate and effective EU legislation that can address INNS from our perspective are:
default&#xa0;
default6.1.1.
default 
defaultOne whose resultant action is not arbitrarily limited to a set number of priority species
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe list 
defaultshould 
defaultinstead 
defaultbe 
defaultinformed by the outcomes of risk assessments, and regularly updated if need be (quickly) via an emergency listing mechanism.
default If the list of species of concern was limited to 50 it would completely undermine the efficacy of the Regulation.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.2.
default 
defaultA Regulation
default that enhances and compl
defaulte
defaultments current and planned action in the UK. For example
default,
default by ensuring that other countries where Ruddy Duck is present take the necessary measures to 
defaultcompletely 
defaulteradicate it from both the wild and private collections (to complement the extensive efforts of the UK)
default. The Regulation must also
default not undermine the efficacy of planned and future ban
defaults
default on sale in the UK, which may go further than 
defaultmeasures demanded by the Regulation 
defaultor 
defaultbe applied to species not included on 
defaultEU-wide species lists.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.3.
default 
defaultOne which facilitates effective and timely communications and coordination between Member States so that joint action plans can be developed, and the appearance of problem species in neighbouring states is communicated in a timely way to all other Member States so that they may take 
defaultappropriate
default action.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.4.
default 
defaultOne which facilitates the development of shared risk assessment resources (overseen by the Commission and pan-EU if need be), 
defaultthrough 
defaulta scientific review body 
defaultthat would
default provide scientific rigor to the selection of species and their risk assessments, and 
defaultwith 
defaultan underpinning database detailing where species are found, likely to be found, and where specific measures are in place or need to be in place.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.5.
default 
defaultOne which allows species to be listed on the EU-wide list 
defaultthat
default are native to parts of the EU, but have significant impacts through being invasive in other parts of the EU. For example, 
defaultDikerogammarus villosus
default (
defaultk
defaultiller shrimp) and other 
defaultP
defaultonto-
defaultC
defaultaspian species which originate from eastern European countries have caused
default,
default and are projected to cause
default,
default problematic outbreaks in the UK and so require measures that will come under the scope of the EU Regulation.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.6.
default 
defaultAppropriately embeds the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, whilst allowing some discretion in countries already heavily infested.
default&#xa0;
default6.1.7.
default 
defaultIs adequately resourced. We are concerned that the costs of implementing the Regulation, and the servicing of the associated data needs, is seriously underestimated at this stage
default,
default and that this 
defaultlack of funding
default may prove short sighted and cost ineffective. 
default&#xa0;
default6.1.8.
default 
defaultOne which assures (despite retaining some scope for derogations to take place) that pan
default-
defaultEU action can be secured where this is critical for effective outcomes. All Member States need to adopt the precautionary principle because knowledge 
defaultof
default how species evolve, disperse and behave in different climates is far from complete. The UK must also follow suit. For example, 
defaultEichhornia crassipes
default (
defaultw
defaultater hyacinth, which originates from South America) is not currently present in the wild in the UK, but is 
defaultalready a serious problem in some neighbouring Member States. There is some scope for the species to be invasive in the UK in the future (under climate change scenarios), and for the UK to act as a reservoir for invasion back into neighbouring states - thus undermining their own actions. Should it be a species recommended for pan
default-
defaultEU measures, then the UK must follow suit.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe renewed GB Strategy must embed an effective domestic response
default,
default as detailed above. It must also by savvy in its outlook towards and embracing of the EU situation, recognising that there is a need to share our knowledge with countries that have yet to prepare
default a strategy
default. The success of many of our actions is dependent upon the cultivation of cross
default-
defaultborder relationships. If the draft 
defaultGB S
defaulttrategy continues to 
defaultbenefit from
default input during its development phase from a range of stakeholders, including the NGO sector, then it will gain significant endorsement and greater action as a result. Equally important
default,
default however, is the need to broker broader ownership and action across other relevant parts of government, underpinned by evidence, with the assumption that commitment and funds must follow.
