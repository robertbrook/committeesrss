[[[Refugee Action – Written evidence]]]Response to the committee consultation on the Draft Deregulation Bill 2013 – Clause 40 ‘Repeal of powers to provide accommodation to persons temporarily admitted to the UK etc’

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction to Refugee Action]]]Refugee Action is an independent, national charity working to enable refugees to build new lives in the UK. We provide practical support for newly arrived asylum seekers as well as a long-term commitment to their settlement. Through our ‘One Stop Service’, Gateway Protection Programme and Choices Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) Service, the Home Office funds us to give confidential, independent and non-directive advice and information to asylum seekers, refugees and irregular migrants on a breadth of topics. We also offer support through a range of independently funded projects.&#xa0;

[[[Summary of our response]]]Refugee Action objects to the proposal to repeal section 4(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as outlined in clause 40 of the Draft Deregulation Bill 2013. The principle reasons for our objection are:

[[[1)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Section 4(1)(a) &amp; (b) is not moribund and is currently in use]]]In April 2013 the Home Office published guidance on section 4(1)(a) and (b) as part of  the non-statutory Section 4 Support Instruction.  The instruction outlines the situations in which support will be granted to applicants from ‘non-asylum’ categories. The existence of this guidance – albeit very restrictive - is a clear indication that this provision is necessary and in current use. While the guidance does not specify every situation in which support could be provided, it does provide some clarity on current eligibility and therefore, the groups most likely to suffer from repeal of this provision. The eligibility threshold is high and support is only granted in ‘truly exceptional circumstances’: the applicant must have temporary admission, s/he must be destitute, s/he must have no other avenue to any support, and the provision of support must be necessary in order to avoid a breach of his/her human rights. The consideration of whether the applicant’s human rights will be breached if support is withheld requires an assessment of whether s/he will experience inhuman and degrading treatment (as per the Limbuela threshold), and whether s/he could reasonably be expected to leave the UK.Refugee Action and other organisations have evidence that people are currently in receipt of s4(1)(a) and (b) support (see case studies below). In September 2012 the Home Office refused to give a figure for the number of people in receipt of s4(1)(a) and (b) support in response to a parliamentary question, stating that ‘obtaining these data would require a manual search of individual case files held on asylum support, which would incur disproportionate cost’. A subsequent Freedom of Information request in December 2012 met with the same response. The Asylum Support Appeals Project (ASAP) deals with a growing number of s4(1) appeals at the Asylum Support Tribunal, with 6 cases in July 2013. Refugee Action acknowledges that there is only a small number of people in receipt of s4(1)(a) or (b) but we suspect this is because people do not know about this provision not because it is moribund. In addition, the Home Office has suggested that some s4(1) cases (absconders and unaccompanied children turning 18) are currently treated as s4(2) for reasons of administrative ease. Refugee Action therefore advises the committee to request that the Home Office provide statistics on the cases they know are being and have been supported under s4(1)(a) and (b) to date, including those incorrectly recorded as s4(2). &#xa0;

[[[2)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Repeal will interfere with efforts by destitute migrants to leave the UK ]]]Those most likely to suffer as a result of repeal include people who are trying to leave the UK but, because they have never claimed asylum, they can’t access support under s4(2) and consequently have been supported under s4(1)(a) and (b). This includes irregular migrants who were granted temporary admission and are trying to take steps to return. These people are trying to engage with the re-documentation and return process and, as such, are making efforts to prevent the continuing interference of their Article 3 rights, but obstacles beyond their control prevent their departure. Such obstacles include problems with re-documentation, particularly for clients from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh who wait for on average 32 days to receive travel documents but, in some cases, up to 133 days.&#xa0;

[[[3)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Repeal of this power will interfere with ECHR rights]]]Other obstacles that prevent removal from the UK include criminal or family court proceedings, as well as efforts to establish a right to remain under Article 8. The Section 4 support instruction specifies that those with outstanding Article 8 claims should not be supported under section 4(1) on the basis that they can reasonably be expected to leave the UK in order to avoid the consequences of destitution.  However case-law (Birmingham City Council v Clue [2010] EWCA Civ 460) has established that it is not reasonable for someone with an outstanding Article 8 application to go back to their country of origin as by doing so, they would be treated as essentially abandoning their claim. Clue also says that as long as the claim has some merit then support from the local authority should be provided whilst the claim is pending. The same reasoning must apply to Home Office support, and if the Government repeals s4(1)(a) and (b), it will fetter the discretion of the Secretary of State to provide support in these cases.&#xa0;

[[[4)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Repeal of this power will remove a form of support for people released from detention on temporary admission or High Court bail]]]If an immigration detainee has been released on bail, then s/he can access support under section 4(1)(c). However, people released from detention by the Home Office prior to a bail hearing may currently access support under s4(1)(b) and therefore avoid destitution on release. Such cases occur when the Home Office realises that it has been unlawfully detaining someone, include people who have been trafficked, victims of torture, those who cannot be removed and people with mental health problems. These are cases where Home Office policy clearly states that they will detain in only very exceptional circumstances, and the threat of legal action provokes the Home Office to release the individual. Repeal of this power will put the Secretary of State in the position of having no choice but to release such people into destitution and homelessness. &#xa0;

[[[5)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Repeal will remove a form of essential support for refused asylum seekers]]]The draft bill amends s4(2) and s4(4) such that the definition of a ‘failed’ asylum seeker can include persons whose claim for asylum is withdrawn (or treated as withdrawn) and persons whose asylum claim was rejected before they reached 18 years of age. This change will not necessarily capture all those within these two categories who previously received support under s4(1) and will not decrease the regulatory burden on the Home Office as persons in these groups will now be subject to the eligibility tests imposed under the 2005 Support Regulations under regulation 3(2).Furthermore, all other refused asylum seekers who may have benefitted from s4(1) will be left destitute as a result of the repeal of this power. It is government policy, not legislation, that excludes refused asylum seekers from accessing s4(1)(a) and (b) so in theory the Secretary of State holds the power to grant support to cases of refused asylum seekers who do not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria under the 2005 Support Regulations. The open-ended power to provide support under s4(1)(a) and (b) should remain and should continue to be open to refused asylum seekers. &#xa0;

[[[6)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Repeal of this provision will interfere with Article 3 rights]]]Repeal of this power will interfere with Article 3 because the group of people outlined above have no entitlement to support under any other provisions and consequently will be left destitute. Support should continue to be provided under s4(1)(a) and (b) for people in non-asylum immigration categories provided they are on temporary admission, are destitute, have no other avenue of support and the support is required to avoid a breach of their human rights.&#xa0;

[[[7)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Shift of responsibility to local authorities]]]Despite being included in the section of the bill entitled ‘Other measures to reduce burdens on public authorities’,  Refugee Action believes that it will not reduce the burden resulting from legislation, it will simply shift some of that burden from central government to local authorities and devolved administrations. This is because those clients who are currently receiving s4(1)(a) and (b) have no entitlement to support from the Home Office or the Department for Work and Pensions under other provisions. Those who require care and attention and therefore meet the eligibility criteria under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 will therefore turn to local authorities to claim support to which they are entitled in order to avoid a breach of their human rights. In addition, applicants may be able to access support from the local authority under the Children Leaving Care Act 2000, the Children Act 1989, and possibly under section 2 of the Local Government Act. Refugee Action would be interested to know whether the Scottish and Welsh governments or the LGA have been consulted about this proposal.&#xa0;

[[[8)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Lack of consultation]]]Refugee Action is disappointed that it was not consulted by the Home Office at any stage on this proposal despite being a key stakeholder for consultation and engagement on asylum support related matters. Refugee Action co-chairs the National Asylum Stakeholder Forum (NASF) subgroup on support and meets regularly with the Home Office to discuss amendments to and implementation of the section 4 support instruction. Despite this we were not informed by the Home Office that repeal of the provision would be included in the Draft Deregulation Bill until an email was sent by the Home Office on 3rd September 2013.&#xa0;

[[[s4(]]]

[[[1)(a)]]]1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An Egyptian national was granted support on the basis that he was waiting to attend court regarding the outcome of a court order about contact with his child. His application for s4(1)(a) support was granted by the Home Office in July 2013, 3 months after the application was submitted pending evidence of destitution. His court hearing has been postponed until September 2013 and he is still claiming s4 support under s4(1)(a). 2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An Indian national who never claimed asylum as he was an overstayer and was waiting to attend court in relation to a criminal matter was charged and then released on bail in May 2013 (not under a provision of the Immigration Acts). He had also submitted a claim under Article 8 of the UK Human Rights Act pertaining to the Right to Respect for Private and Family Life which was refused. He was granted temporary admission after his application for s4 support was submitted. After an initial s4(1)(a) application was refused, his support appeal was granted by the Asylum Support Tribunal in July and he was accommodated in August. 3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A Nigerian male had not claimed asylum but was awaiting a decision on a human rights application. He has a child with a British woman and was receiving no other support. His application for s4(1)(a) support was accepted by the Tribunal after two previous refusals before he was then granted leave to remain in the UK.4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An Indian national had lost his passport so was unable to return voluntarily while applying for updated travel documents. He applied for s4 in Nov 2011 while rough sleeping, but was refused and detained. He was released, applied for s4 a second time while still waiting for the travel documents to come through, but was again refused and detained. He was subsequently released, but is still waiting for travel documents to come through after almost a year, and is facing challenges because of lack of family members in India to confirm his identification. He has recently been found rough sleeping again, and is being assisted to apply for s4(1)(a).5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A partner organisation working with rough sleepers is currently assisting three individuals to apply for s4 on s4(1)(a) grounds. In two cases the clients have been bounced between Home Office and Social Services support – both clients have serious medical conditions and we understand that both would be likely to die without support.September 20131&#xa0; Alongside our Home Office-funded reactive advice services, we have substantial experience delivering innovative, proactive advice services, including the key worker pilots in Liverpool and Manchester, Fresh Start project in Leicester and Bristol women’s project.
