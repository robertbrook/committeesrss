"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from\n Andrew Green \nCEng \n(HSR 027)\nMy submission concentrates on some key statistics and on data that is either misleading or has been omitted by Ministers, HS2 Ltd and the Department of Transport in an attempt to hide the risks and flaws in the HS2 project&#xa0;1. KPMG reportA simple analysis in a paper by Trans\nport Watch UK demonstrates how absurd the KPMG figure of £15bn is.\n(Source:\n \nTransport watch UK: HS2 WIDER ECONOMIC BENEFITS LAUGHED OUT OF COURT November 2013\n )\nhttp://www.transport-watch.co.uk/hs2-wider-economic-benefits-laughed-out-court-november-2013\n &#xa0;\nAnalysis of new trips created by HS291,000 \n              \nnew t\nri\nps per day attributed to HS2 \n              \n(\nSource HS2: \n24% of 380,000 Re Economic case for HS2)\n300\n              \ndays pa\n= \n27 million trips pa\n&#xa0;\n£15bn \neconomic benefit \npa re KPMG\n£15bn\n \n/\n \n2\n7\nx10\n6\n = \n£549 per single trip or £1,099 for each round tripIs this credible?1,460 million\n train\n trips \nin\n 2011/12 \n              \n(\nSource \nORR data for Network Rail)\n1,460\nx10\n6\n x £549 = £802 \nb\nn \n              \n              = over half the UK GDP&#xa0;2. HS2 spend profile v CrossrailI have heard \nM\ninisters\n, MPs and until recently the HS2 web site, equate HS2 to the spend on Crossrail.  The gr\naph below demonstrates how utterly false and misleading that comparison is.  The DfT only fund 40% of Crossrail  with a peak of £1.2bn and total \ncontribution \nof £5.2bn (60% \nis \npaid by London businesses and other sources ) while the spend on HS2 has a peak \nof £5bn pa for several years and a total of £50bn, \nten times the Crossrail spend!\n&#xa0;\nCrossrail budget TfL Business Plan\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/business-plan-gla-budget-update.pdf\nHS2 spend profile: Economic case – Appraisal spreadsheets: Phase 1 and Full Network Costs \nhttp://w\nww.hs2.org.uk/news-resources/economic-documents\n3. HS2 and the spend on classic rail ENHANCEMENTSMinisters and the DfT attempt to compare HS2 costs with the total ‘investment’\n \nin the rail network\n.  The large majority of the investment in the rail netwo\nrk is routine maintenance and renewals not enhancing the network.  The spend on enhancements for the whole of the network is around £2bn pa while the spend on HS2 would for several years be £4bn or more.  Hence a more accurate statement is that HS2 will ta\nke 2/3 of the budget available to improve the network!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSource:\n              \nFull strategic business plan for England and Wales\nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/publications/strateg\nic-business-plan-for-cp5/\n&#xa0;\n4. Capacity released for FreightHow much extra capacity \nfor freight \non classic lines is actually released by HS2?\nNothing till at least 2026!\nThen, from the 2013 strategic case, in 2033 it assumes the number of fast line paths used by passenger trains \nreduces from 13 to 12 leaving the capacity from \nONE fast passenger path available per hour.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSource for this analysis is the Beleben\n blog link below:\nhttp://beleben.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/hs2-and-classic-capacity-part-four-2/\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. Passenger Growth on WCML(a) \nHS2 will\n \nNOT relieve crowding \nover the whole of the rail network, so why do HS2 and the \nD\nfT persist in giving data for the whole network \nwhen they have the data relating to the specific routes ie WCML that will be affected?Is passenger growth going to continue on the WCML?\n(b) Virgin Trains Key statisticsIn 2012/13 Virgin Trains passenger growth was only 0.66% (ORR data) and has been falling rapidly for several years!\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(c) ORR data for the long distance rail travel The ORR data for the long distance \nrail \ntravel for the whole \nnetwork shows a marked downwards trend since the peaks of 2007.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(d) Technology wedgeTechnology takes time to gain a hold and then  make\n a wide impact on the existing market.  This can be seen with the lag between the start of significant use of the internet for communications and its impact on letter volumes\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVideo conferencing is only really just taking hold now.  As businesses str\nive to make a profit in an ever more competitive global market place, using increasingly reliable video conferencing wil\nl\n become the norm and expensive, time consuming long distance busine\nss travel will have to be very carefully justified.\n&#xa0;\n(e) Decline in trip ratesThere has been a steady decline in trip rates for the last fifteen years.  This may be partly due to technology but whatever the cause, has this been included in the HS2 demand models?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(f) Travel rates for the elderlyThe UK populati\non is undoubtedly growing but it is also aging! Older people travel less and less by rail and do not want to may premium peak fares on ultra-fast trains!\n&#xa0;\nN\november 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
