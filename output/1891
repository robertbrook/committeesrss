defaultCanada
default.

defaultCarillion works with local government to provide a full range of integrated support services including highway maintenance, facilities management, property and estates management and energy services.  We 
defaulthave worked
default with Birmingham City Council to construct th
defaulte world’s largest public library,
default and, under a separate contract, we are delivering 
defaultBirmingham Energy Savers
default, the C
defaultity’s flagship Green Deal energy efficiency programme.  In 2012 we signed a £500 million contract with Oxfordshire County Council to deliver fully integrated and consolidated property and facilities management services, the first initiative of its kind, which will save the Council up to £550,000 each year over the next decade.  
default&#xa0;
defaultCarillion also has a strong presence in Greater Manchester
default and offers a range of 
defaultcapabilities
default with 
defaultpublic sector partners

default.
default We are
default a joint venture partner with Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council providing a range of services and significant local investment, and 
defaultwe are
default a partner with Rochdale MBC delivering new and refurbished schools in the Borough.
default  Additionally, we have been selected as one of three preferred bidders on the Manchester Airport Capital Delivery Framework, which will bring vital economic regeneration to the area, and are working with the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) to deliver “Get me Toasty,” a pilot energy saving scheme, which will help combat fuel poverty for up to 3,000 households.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have used our private sector experience in local government to help achieve better outcomes, for example supporting community engagement in 
defaultBirmingham
default by creating award-winning community gardens and opening up our facilities for community use.  Our legacy strategy for Birmingham City Council demonstrates our continuing commitment to the area – we have created 250 local employment opportunities, 278 apprenticeships and we have worked with local SMEs.  Similarly, for our contract with Oxfordshire County Council we have committed to holding almost 600 local education engagement sessions, 180 back to work trials, 400 hours of SME or third sector monitoring and a commitment to 60% local spend, which we hope to exceed to reach 70%.
