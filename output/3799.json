"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Milton Keynes Council (GHS0018)This submission has been made by Geoff \nSnelson\n, Director of Strategy, Milton Keynes Council and sponsor of the Milton Keynes Future City Programme.\nThe Future City Programme is an umbrella for a range of innovative programmes and projects including the Low Carbon Urban Transport Zone (LUTZ) programme that has an autonomous vehicles theme. \nImplementation of these initiatives has benefited significantly from the involvement of the new Catapult centres.     \nIndividual Catapults have provided expert advice and additional capacity to develop projects. They have been able to assist in securing input from expert academic and industry partners and sharing intelligence on new and innovative developments in their respective fields. They have also acted as points of co-ordination for business and government input more widely. \nOne of the most positive aspects of the Catapults is their interest in learning about practice and innovation in localities. Both bottom-up and top-down perspectives are essential to horizon scanning activity and the most effective arena for understanding the future is arguably at the level of the city, where technology and other developments can be scoped and understood within a locality context – including implementation opportunities and challenges.\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Future City Programme is a collaboration between business, higher education and government partners. It aims to address barriers to housing and economic growth and\n provide the capabilities to \nenable business and service innovation, including through the i\nntegration of multiple city systems. Rad\nical new solutions for managing demand will help ensure the city’s capacity to reach its forecast growth potential.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n A\nt the centre of the programme is the \nMK:Smart\n Data Hub that will draw together and make available information relevant to how the city functions - including data from key infrastructure networks (energy, transport and water) and sensor networks (\neg\n. weather and pollution data); satellite data; and data from social media and specialised applications.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccess to \nanonymised\n data in the Data Hub, under protocols governed by Milton Keynes Council, will allow new approaches and applications that address city challenges to be developed by the partners and independent and commercial developers. \nMK:Smart\n has a project value of £16m, including a grant of £8m from the Higher Education Funding Council for England.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMilton Keynes benefits strongly from its excellent connectivity to national transport networks and the ease of mobility within its urban area. The council is addressing the transport challenges of the future at the same time as meeting demanding carbon reduction targets through a set of innovative transport projects. These\n \ninclude the deployment of over 100 publicly-accessible charging points for electric vehicles, the imminent launch of a wirelessly charged electric bus service, and the launch of an electric-vehicle car club.  The recent arrival of the Transport Systems Catapult adds to the city’s credentials as a transport innovator. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Low Carbon Urban Transport Zone (LUTZ) programme has been developed by the Intelligent Mobility Working Group (IMWG) of the UK Automotive Council.  It has a value of £65 million and is scheduled to run over 5 years from 2014. LUTZ is to be located in Milton Keynes and \nis supported by Government (BIS and \nDfT\n) and the Transport Systems Catapult (which is based in Milton Keynes). It will \nexplore the potential for Intelligent Mobility \n– including autonomous and on-demand services\n - to deliver early benefits within 5 years and substantial benefits to the UK transport system by 2030. It will d\nemonstrate\n the ability of the UK to perform at the leading edge of transport innovation; and d\no something that is demonstrably ‘smarter’ \n- than anything seen elsewhere in the world, including a real-time city mobility map.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLUTZ is an \nintegrated programme with three key themes that have a high degree of \ninnovative content. Many of the practical details will only be defined through the carefully controlled implementation that is planned. \n&#xa0;\nA.\n Autonomous Vehicle Theme3.4\n              \nThis theme will deploy an on-demand autonomous transport system using lightweight 2-seater ‘pods’ operating within \npedestrianised\n spaces of the city-centre. The exact locations will be scoped and agreed with the council as part of the implementation planning, but are likely to include a route from the railway station to the city centre. It will provide a working system which enables an in-depth understanding of how the public might react to autonomous vehicles, what practical problems might be associated with running them in mixed pedestrian/vehicle spaces, and how a system owner might operate the service and make a profit. It will also work with Milton Keynes Council and the Department for Transport to explore how regulatory structures might be shaped to allow autonomous vehicles to operate freely and safely in mixed city-centre environments.\n3.5\n              \nThe pods will be capable of speeds of up to 12 mph and equipped with technology that enables them to operate safely alongside pedestrians  including visual, radar and other types of sensor, object recognition capabilities and safety critical systems. The pods run directly on road or paved surfaces and their electronic guidance systems mean that rails or tracks are not needed. \nActivity 1 – Planning (2014)3.6\n              \nThe first 12 months will be devoted to detailed planning and preparation, working closely with council services. Infrastructure adaptations will be made e.g. painting lines on paving to identify pod pathways; installing segregation barriers; installing the electric pod charging points; etc.\nActivity 2 – Systems Development (2015 to 2017)3.7\n              \nStep 1:\n A limited number of pods (20) will run on designated routes with segregation of the vehicles from members of the public who are not riding on the system.  The vehicles will move under driver-control, and empty vehicles will be collected and re-positioned during the working day by operator ‘valets’.\n3.8\n              \nStep 2:\n The pod fleet will be expanded to 40 units. The pods will continue to operate on pathways where pods and pedestrians are strictly segregated, but the pods will be progressively turned over to fully autonomous control.\n3.9\n              \nStep 3:\n The pods will continue to operate in fully autonomous mode; the segregation of pods from pedestrians will be progressively removed until the pods are moving freely amongst pedestrians throughout the designated zone.\n3.10\n              \nThe later stages of the project will include the development of a road-going autonomous taxi. This activity will draw on learning gained early in the project. \nB. Spontaneous Mobility Theme3.11\n              \nThis theme will examine how current and future transport options might be made available and co-ordinated through a city-wide system that is responsive to the needs of individual users. The study will not be limited to public and private transport systems; it will also examine transport for healthcare, retail delivery, and urban freight (\neg\n. supermarket shop-and-drop). \n3.12\n              \nThe \ntransport on-demand project will examine the provision of on-demand public transport services using small to mid-sized vehicles. The service aims to be as flexible and convenient as using private hire cars, but priced at the level of a bus. \n3.13\n              \nThe ‘\nCity Motion Map’ project will explore how city-wide mobility information from a range of sources can be aggregated and made available to the public, providing accurate real time information about for example, congestion and predicted journey times. It will address issues such as community benefit, security, and personal privacy. This project forms part of the \nMK:Smart\n programme that is being led by the Open University with funding from the Higher Education Funding Council (see report to Cabinet on 24/07/13). \nC.               Directed Research Theme 3.14\n              \nThis theme will comprise individual research projects (the details of which have yet to be defined)\nProgramme Benefits for Milton Keynes 3.15\n              \nThe benefits for Milton Keynes of a successful LUTZ programme include:\n&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith LUTZ and previous projects, we have encountered “road maps” produced by the auto industry for their shared ambitions, including the development and deployment of low/no emission and autonomous vehicles. These have been hugely important as resources to convince local stakeholders that seemingly futuristic initiatives have strong credibility and industry support. The project to introduce electric vehicle charging in Milton Keynes was given significant impetus through the alignment of the industry road map for emission free transport and government programmes that funded charging infrastructure (through the Office for Low Emission Vehicles). Such strategic alignment between industry and government is enormously powerful.                    \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAlthough they are very new bodies, a number of the new Catapult Centres have already made significant contributions to the development of our Future City initiatives. Milton Keynes has project relationships with four of the Catapult Centres (Transport Systems, Future Cities, Connected Digital Economy and the Satellite Applications Catapults). A co-ordination arrangement has been made to ensure the inputs across the Catapults are aligned to best effect.  \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIndividual Catapults have provided expert advice and additional capacity to help develop our projects. For example, the Transport Systems Catapult designated a member of staff to work directly on LUTZ and the Future Cities Catapult has provided regular strategic advice on the development of our overall programme, notably governance challenges and the integration of multiple systems. The Future Cities Catapult has also sought to ensure our focus is complementary to initiatives elsewhere in the UK where this makes sense.  All of the Catapults have been able to assist in securing input from expert academic and industry partners and sharing intelligence on innovation in their respective fields. They have also acted as points of co-ordination for business and government input more widely, including from government departments and bodies such as the Technology Strategy Board.           \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs well as co-ordinating central inputs, one of the most positive aspects of the Catapults is their focus on learning about practice and innovation in localities. Both bottom-up and top-down perspectives are essential to horizon scanning activity and the most effective arena for this is arguably at the level of the city where technology and other future developments can be scoped and understood within the local context – including practical implementation opportunities and challenges.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LUTZ programme is a good example of a future technology that is well advanced but where the major future challenge is its practical application in a real life environment and its interaction with people.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2015\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
