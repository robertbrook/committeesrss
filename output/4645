default 
defaultThe Elliot Foundation is a charitable multi-academy trust and primary specialist operating thirteen vibrant primary schools in the West Midlands, London and East Anglia. Our aim is to build self-improving, self-sustaining clusters of primary schools that d
defaulteliver world-class education for all of our pupils.  Full details of the education and other professionals who make up the Elliot Foundation can be found on 
defaultour website

defaultludes, a former Director of Children’s Services, one EdD, three PhDs, two HMIs, OFSTED graded ‘outstanding’ current and former primary heads including NLEs, LLEs, one director of the DfE innovation unit, one principal educational psychologist and one exper
defaultt child protection barrister.  This central team of experts exists to build and grow capacity within each of our schools across all education and organisational disciplines.  Indeed our aim is to keep expertise, money and decision making as close to the ch
defaultildren as possible.  The best evidence for this system leadership can be seen in the upward trajectory of our member and partner schools and the fact that our headteachers are forming the targeted intervention teams that support our new academies.

default1.2.
default 
defaultWe beli
defaulteve that the system is beginning to work; bringing choice for parents and increased aspiration on behalf of all children.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default 
defaultWe believe that the single most important thing government can do in the academy programme is not to change it or dilute it but to gi
defaultve it time to bed down.  This will enable the emerging system to build the resilience that it so desperately needs.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default2.1.
default 
defaultThe effectiveness of any academy or chain in 
defaultclosingdefault t
defaulthe gap
default needs to be considered in a broader sense than simply KS2 outcomes.  Notice should be also taken of the impact of inclusive primary schools 
defaulton 
defaultbuilding socializing structures for disadvantaged children that 
defaultis 
defaultas yet insufficiently quantifiable
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default 
defaultWe 
defaultrecognize that quality assuring of sponsors is critical in securing impact on student outcomes as well as maintaining confidence in the academy system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default 
defaultSteer EEF funding so that it incentivizes system development and research, e
defaultspecially encouraging NLEs, TSA
defaults, sponsors and others to come together to identify and tackle endemic under-performance. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default 
defaultDisseminate EEF findings more 
defaultrapidly so that the whole system can benefit from research on “what works”.
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default 
defaultCreate larger groups of self-supporting primary schools moving away from the idea of exceptional leaders. There simply aren’t enough ex
defaultceptional leaders, NLEs and TSA
defaults nor are the
defaultse leaders necessarily in geographical areas of greatest need. Furthermore, the strengths of these leaders aren’t necessarily the ones required in the matched failing schools.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default 
defaultThe potential risk for a ‘successful’ school in supporting a ‘failing’ school n
defaulteeds to be mitigated across a larger system rather relying upon a one-to-one arrangement.  
default&#xa0;
default3.5.
default 
defaultAddress the issue of ‘testing for tots’ by establishing an acceptable baseline at reception and measuring progress throughout the whole of primary school years, ra
defaultther than just through KS2.  This change would provide a genuine evidence base on what works to bring about transformational impact in the early years and in KS1. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6.
default 
default'Similar schools' from OFSTED data dashboard should include intake and EAL data not just Ye
defaultar 2 attainment otherwise the ‘hard yards’ done by schools in areas of disadvantage to the end of KS1 will not be recognized when compared with demographically ‘fortunate’ schools
default&#xa0;
default3.7.
default 
defaultSuggest improvements to OFSTED 
defaultand FFT 
defaultdashboards, by adding:
default&#xa0;
default3.8.
default 
defaultContinue the targeting of funding to the strategies that make a difference, consider expanding pupil premium to EAL students that join in years 3 &amp; 4 to 
defaultsupport the catch up work required so that these new arrivals 
defaultbecome successful.
default&#xa0;
default3.9.
default 
defaultSEND Partnerships - Traditionally schools have accepted 
defaultall defaultchildren as part of a collective responsibility across an LA addressed through dual registration and/or shared services. There should be an expectation that all schools and aca
defaultdemies will provide a network of provision in any locality and successful strategies and expertise including safeguarding are shared. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default 
defaultThere is a disjunction between the espoused “market led’ approach leading to freedom of choice for successful and satisfactory primary schools wanting to convert to an academy and the intercession at a number of levels by the DFE.
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default 
defaultCreating an academy to i
defaultmprove standards is more likely to be a rapid, successful process when it is the result of common consent, rather than imposition.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default 
defaultSponsors have to plan to meet the demands of school improvement, financial probity and control, health and safety and good e
defaultstates management.  A clear commitment from the DfE to support them through their growth phase will significantly reduce risk and waste of public money and help establish successful academies.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default 
defaultExperienced sponsors are able to judge the potential fit for a
default school into their academy group by interrogating the wider context behind the top-level attainment data. A dialogue with DFE should be the norm.
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default 
defaultFinancial incentives could be considered to schools on the threshold of satisfactory or requires improvement 
defaultwhen joining quality assured academy groups.  A more value for money approach to achieve the same outcome would be to streamline the process for approving sponsored and converter projects
default;
default where each month’s delay can 
defaultincur five figure lost revenues.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default 
defaultIt s
defaulthould be noted that the replacement of LACSEG by ESG in the new funding formula is now a major disincentive to primary schools. Running a primary academy group on anything less than 5-6% of GAG is unlikely to rapidly improve standards and invites the risk 
defaultof non-compliance on a range of requirements including sound estate management, governance and HR. Academy MAT’s that are mixed secondary and primary academies cross-subsidise.  An ESG of £150 per pupil equates to between 3-4% of the school’s budget.  This
default is no incentive for the good and outstanding primary schools to choose academy status and a reason for RI primary schools to resist the same.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default 
defaultRecent announcements suggest a new middle tier of 
default‘Schools Commissioners’
default between failing academies and DFE.  We strongly urge the committee to emphasise the use of already existing scorecards and real time data as a means of t
defaulthese bodies managing failure in their region. A renewed role for NCTL to broker school-to-school support for academies, alongside these bodies would bring additional capacity. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default 
defaultThe current DfE
default&#xa0;
defaultdata page
default&#xa0;
defaultdoes not link to OFSTED
default&#xa0;
defaultschool dashboard
default&#xa0;
defaultand the OFSTED dashboard page often does not contain academy data
default;
default these are easy wins
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default 
defaultBoth
default dashboards above are aged data;
default DfE needs to be confident that MAT governors are receiving more up to date information in order to make timely 
defaultinterventions that impact on pupil progress
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default 
defaultA requirement that SoS receives and agrees every academy order is u
defaultnrealistic if momentum is to be main
defaulttained in Primary academisation
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6.1.
default 
defaultThe statutory functions of the LA must be made known to all sponsors by the DFE. These functions must be fully supported in all academies for example, care order requirements, child protection, place planning, excluded pupils, SEND requirements, Educationa
defaultl Psychology support, FSM, attendance. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default 
defaultAs long as the process is transparent and academies and academy chains are not excluded then there is no reason that LAs cannot continue to hold the role of place planning; the decision making needs to be conducted 
defaulton behalf of all children not select groups of vocal families
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default 
defaultA duty to collaborate for all sponsors including free schools should be an implicit part of the funding agreement.
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default 
defaultThe development of an escalation route that stops short of whistle-blowing to
default enable academies and academy groups to work with LAs on child protection is needed urgently.
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
default 
defaultIt is important for schools to be sponsored in ways that do not simply replicate the role of LAs, bringing little gain for the academies or their pupils. Academy
default sponsorship should bring rigorous governance and greater independence and autonomy within a democratic process. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6.
default 
defaultGovernance in academies enables removal of ineffective governors and more rapid intervention to raise standards. 
default&#xa0;
default6.7.
default 
defaultGovernance needs 
defaultrevisiting for primary schools. : Sponsored chains are more likely to have ‘professional’ or highly skilled governors which work across schools enabling them to have an overview of the locality of schools. Higher skill sets can also lead to their being mor
defaulte effective in holding school leadership to account.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7.1.
default 
defaultInto the future Ensure that any sav
defaultings from LA funding are not lost to cost creep including extra management and inspection costs in DfE and OFSTED.
default7.2.
default 
defaultCan we be certain that DfE and OFSTED costs can be held steady or reducing, given that more entities will need to be inspected (if MATs are t
defaulto be regulated &amp; inspected which they should) and more entities need to be managed?
default&#xa0;
default7.3.
default 
defaultSocial responsibility and social cohesion must be built by schools operating within and across communities meeting local and common agendas, government must ensure that ac
defaultademies play their part in the wider needs of communities. 
default&#xa0;default7.4.
default 
defaultThe LA still has a role to play in conjunction with chains but far less a school improvement role. We need to adapt and nurture current system of academies and recognise that it takes time for pr
defaultactice to become embedded. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default8.1.
default 
defaultAdvocacy and lobbying at national policy level is already difficult for primary key stages with the result that resources are most often given or diverted into the later key stages, for example City Challenge, BSF and more recently ESG changes. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2.
default 
defaultAcade
defaultmy status for individual primary schools including outstanding ones is not a sustainable model. Individual academies or even small groups do not have the scale to protect themselves against risk in the form of their leadership and governance, probity, and 
defaultestates. Creating larger networks and linking to academy chains gives primary schools a long-term self-improving option. 
default&#xa0;
default8.3.
default 
defaultFunding arrangements for primary schools are not favourable when compared to secondary schools (See 
defaultalso 
defaultabove 4.6). Economies of sca
defaultle can 
defaultonly 
defaultbe realised if primaries can work together as a family of schools.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default9.1.
default 
defaultWe need to consolidate and grow successful chains, recognise that chains mitigate 
defaultrisk, bring the required coherence and integration and are therefore more resilient than small group school-to-school academy groupings. Policy Exchange report “Competition meets Collaboration” 2012 suggests
default,
default 
default“that not only do Academies work when it comes 
defaultto raising standards, but that Academy chains can be even more effective at improving results than single Academies. Academy chains can have this impact by enabling the spreading of effective educational practice and by delivering economies of scale”
default 
default&#xa0;
default9.2.
default 
defaultImplementation of the academy system must be given time to embed and must not be watered down or diverted into yet more alternatives for schools.
default&#xa0;
default9.3.
default 
defaultExisting scorecards should be properly implemented and would provide the trend data and early warnings requir
defaulted to whatever middle tier accountability structure is implemented to oversee school failure.
default&#xa0;
default9.4.
default 
defaultGovernment should expect all sponsors to work across groups of schools to create coherence to avoid isolated schools. Collaborative developments need coordinatio
defaultn and therefore resourcing to create the improvement capacity.
