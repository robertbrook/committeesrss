Written evidence submitted by Justice (LAI 0061)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]"I find it hard to believe that a government which truly respected the rule of law - which had taken the trouble to understand what that phrase really means, 
[normal]and to study the consequences of what it has in mind - would have contemplated introducing the [civil legal aid proposals]".

[normal]Col

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]JUSTICE considers that the proposals for reform [bold]in [bold]Transforming legal aid[bold] are ill-considered, rushed and unsupported by evidence. [bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]We consider that each of the proposals under consideration by the JCHR will undermine the rule of law and significantly restrict access to justice for individuals without [bold]independent [bold]means.  We are specifically concerned that the propo[bold]sals to restrict eligibility for[bold] prisoners and persons with less than 12 months lawful residence [bold]are[bold] incompatible with the right to the equal protection of the law and the right to equal treat[bold]ment protected by Article 14 ECHR and the HRA 1998.  [bold]Further proposals to restrict access to judicial review are based upon scant evidence of the need for reform and could undermine the long-term constitutional function of judicial review.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Government[bold] [bold]has failed to answer[bold] [bold]serious[bold] concerns raised, including [bold]by [bold]representatives in both Houses, members of the senior judiciary, members of the legal professions and groups representing individuals affected by the proposed changes (from civil society and public[bold] bodies alike)[bold],[bold] about the constitutional function of legal aid, the impact of these measures on the effectiveness of our justice system and the credibility of our judiciary or the ability of individuals to hold public bodies to account.  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]We regret that t[bold]his process has become less about a rational approach to making justifiable savings and more about a new “ideological” approach to the distribution of legal aid, based not upon the complexity or seriousness of individuals’ complaints, but about categories [bold]of persons deemed deserving or undeserving of public support by virtue of their status.  This process appears to have become overtly politicised by Ministers suggestions in the press that cases funded by legal aid as time-wasting and unworthy and legal aid[bold] lawyers [bold]caricatured as “fat-cats” unduly drawing on public funds.   Unsupported allegations that public law is used as a “promotional tool” for “left-leaning” organizations and lawyers undermine any confidence that the Government is approaching this exerc[bold]ise objectively.[bold] 
[normal]  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Yet, the Government proposes to introduce each of these significant changes by secondary legislation, over a short timetable of around 6-8 months, with little to no opportunity for effective parliamentary scrutiny.      [bold]&#xa0;[bold]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Timing, effectiveness and evidence-based policy making[bold]&#xa0;[bold]We deal with each of these concerns in greater detail in our response to the 
[normal]First Consultation Paper
[normal].  However, we are concerned that the inadequacy of the evi
[normal]dence for reform is compounded by the short treatment of the consultation in 
[normal]Next Steps, 
[normal]specifically, in Annex B
[normal].  
[normal]The analysis of the concerns expressed by many of the consultation responses, including members of the senior judiciary and public authoriti
[normal]es who will be affected by these changes
[normal],
[normal] is cursory.

[normal]Legal aid is both
[normal] a right in itself and an essential precondition for the exercise and enjoyment of a number of human rights, including the rights to a fair tr

[normal] 
[normal]It represents an important safeguard that

[normal]the administration of justice.
[normal]Legal aid s

[normal]For example,
[normal] the 
[normal]removal of the right to choose may have been
[normal] unlawful pursuant to section 27(4) LASPO
[normal]. 
[normal]The Government maintains its view that the residency test may be introduced 
[normal]through secondary legislation following LASPO.
[normal] 
[normal]While LASPO clearly permits the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the provision of legal aid, it is difficult to argue that this power includes the ability to exclude whole classes of person
[normal]s
[normal] from el
[normal]igibility without further scrutiny by Parliament.

[normal], 2010, pp. 85 and 88.  That the rule of law included a requirement on the State to furnish civil legal ai
[normal]d, in addition to protection for those accused of crimes was clear.  The rule of law includes that 
[normal]“means must be provided for resolving, without prohibitive cost or inordinate delay, bona fide civil disputes which the parties themselves are unable to reso
[normal]lve”.
[normal]   That the principles of the common law protect the right of access to justice, including through the testing of rules which might inhibit access to the court is clear.  See 
[normal]R v Lord Chancellor ex p Witham 
[normal][1998] QB 575 (this case dealt with the impl
[normal]ications of court fees for access to the courts).

[normal] The Government ought to recall its obligations to c
[normal]omply with A
[normal]rticle 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamen
[normal]tal Rights when 
[normal]implementing
[normal] EU law, which provides that ‘legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensur
[normal]e effective access to justice.’.  Importantly, Article 47 TEU does not include the
[normal] additional requirement of Article 6 ECHR that a fair hearing be provided in the determination of “civil rights and obligations”.  See 
[normal]DEB v 
[normal]Germany
[normal], 
[normal][2010] ECR I- 13849
[normal], 28.  
[normal] Several international and regional human rights treaties recognise access to 
[normal]free legal assistance as an essential component of the right to a fair trial.
[normal]  Although many of these focus on criminal justice, international law appears to mirror the requirements of the common law and the ECHR that legal assistance may be essential wher
[normal]e otherwise a hearing would be rendered unfair
[normal].  For example, In its 
[normal]General C
[normal]omment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee acknowledged that “the availability or absence of legal assistance often determines whether or not a person can access the releva
[normal]nt proceedings or participate in them in a meaningful way”, and encouraged States to provide free legal aid not only in criminal proceedings, but also in other cases where individuals do not have sufficient means to pay for it.

[normal] 3.1 – 3.22
[normal] [1985] QB 251
[normal]  See the Lord Chancellor’s evidence to the House of Commons Justice Committee on 3 July 2013.  During this session, the Lord Chancellor explained the Government view that: “the taxpayer should not be paying legal aid for prisoners to go to court to debate
[normal] which prison the Prison Service has decided to detain them in, what the conditions are in their cell, or whatever” (Q202), that “
[normal]is why we have prison visitors, a prison complaints system, independent monitoring boards and a prisons ombudsman-to make sure
[normal] that those safeguards are in place. I do not believe that it is appropriate for us then, on top of that, to be paying for legal aid for those cases to go to court
[normal] (Q205)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]That prisoners are in a vulnerable position and subject to the absolute coercive
[normal] power of the State is recognised in most international human rights instruments and within the domestic law.  As Lord Woolf recognises in his report, 
[normal]Prison Disturbances: 
[normal]‘a prisoner, as a result of bein
[normal]g in prison, is particularly vu
[normal]lnerable to arbitrary
[normal] and unlawful action’ (1991),

[normal]Hull
[normal] Prison

[normal] For example, many of the serious issues identified in the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on deaths in cu
[normal]stody about the treatment of prisoners – segregation, access to healthcare and restraint to take a few – would now be treatment issues for which prisoners would no longer be able to access criminal legal aid to lodge a complaint, even if it had been shown 
[normal]that a remedy was not possible using the alternative mechanisms identified in the First Consultation Paper.  See Third Report of Session 2004-05,
