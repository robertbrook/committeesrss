default&#xa0;defaultJUSTICE considers that the proposals for reform defaultin defaultTransforming legal aiddefault are ill-considered, rushed and unsupported by evidence. default default&#xa0;defaultWe consider that each of the proposals under consideration by the JCHR will undermine the rule of law and significantly restrict access to justice for individuals without defaultindependent defaultmeans.  We are specifically concerned that the propodefaultsals to restrict eligibility fordefault prisoners and persons with less than 12 months lawful residence defaultaredefault incompatible with the right to the equal protection of the law and the right to equal treatdefaultment protected by Article 14 ECHR and the HRA 1998.  defaultFurther proposals to restrict access to judicial review are based upon scant evidence of the need for reform and could undermine the long-term constitutional function of judicial review.default&#xa0;defaultThe Governmentdefault defaulthas failed to answerdefault defaultseriousdefault concerns raised, including defaultby defaultrepresentatives in both Houses, members of the senior judiciary, members of the legal professions and groups representing individuals affected by the proposed changes (from civil society and publicdefault bodies alike)default,default about the constitutional function of legal aid, the impact of these measures on the effectiveness of our justice system and the credibility of our judiciary or the ability of individuals to hold public bodies to account.  default&#xa0;defaultWe regret that tdefaulthis process has become less about a rational approach to making justifiable savings and more about a new “ideological” approach to the distribution of legal aid, based not upon the complexity or seriousness of individuals’ complaints, but about categories defaultof persons deemed deserving or undeserving of public support by virtue of their status.  This process appears to have become overtly politicised by Ministers suggestions in the press that cases funded by legal aid as time-wasting and unworthy and legal aiddefault lawyers defaultcaricatured as “fat-cats” unduly drawing on public funds.   Unsupported allegations that public law is used as a “promotional tool” for “left-leaning” organizations and lawyers undermine any confidence that the Government is approaching this exercdefaultise objectively.default 
default  default&#xa0;defaultYet, the Government proposes to introduce each of these significant changes by secondary legislation, over a short timetable of around 6-8 months, with little to no opportunity for effective parliamentary scrutiny.      default&#xa0;defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTiming, effectiveness and evidence-based policy makingdefault&#xa0;defaultWe deal with each of these concerns in greater detail in our response to the 
defaultFirst Consultation Paper
default.  However, we are concerned that the inadequacy of the evi
defaultdence for reform is compounded by the short treatment of the consultation in 
defaultNext Steps, 
defaultspecifically, in Annex B
default.  
defaultThe analysis of the concerns expressed by many of the consultation responses, including members of the senior judiciary and public authoriti

defaultThe Government maintains its view that the residency test may be introduced

default 
defaultWhile LASPO clearly permits the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the provision of legal aid, it is difficult to argue that this power includes the ability to exclude whole classes of person

default   That the principles of the common law protect the right of access to justice, including through the testing of rules which might inhibit access to the court is clear.  See

default EU law, which provides that ‘legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensur

default Several international and regional human rights treaties recognise access to 
defaultfree legal assistance as an essential component of the right to a fair trial.
default  Although many of these focus on criminal justice, international law appears to mirror the requirements of the common law and the ECHR that legal assistance may be essential wher
defaulte otherwise a hearing would be rendered unfair
default.  For example, In its 
defaultGeneral C
defaultomment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee acknowledged that “the availability or absence of legal assistance often determines whether or not a person can access the releva
defaultnt proceedings or participate in them in a meaningful way”, and encouraged States to provide free legal aid not only in criminal proceedings, but also in other cases where individuals do not have sufficient means to pay for it.

default  See the Lord Chancellor’s evidence to the House of Commons Justice Committee on 3 July 2013.  During this session, the Lord Chancellor explained the Government view that: “the taxpayer should not be paying legal aid for prisoners to go to court to debate

defaultis why we have prison visitors, a prison complaints system, independent monitoring boards and a prisons ombudsman-to make sure

defaultThat prisoners are in a vulnerable position and subject to the absolute coercive
default power of the State is recognised in most international human rights instruments and within the domestic law.  As Lord Woolf recognises in his report,

default For example, many of the serious issues identified in the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on deaths in cu
defaultstody about the treatment of prisoners – segregation, access to healthcare and restraint to take a few – would now be treatment issues for which prisoners would no longer be able to access criminal legal aid to lodge a complaint, even if it had been shown 
defaultthat a remedy was not possible using the alternative mechanisms identified in the First Consultation Paper.  See Third Report of Session 2004-05,
