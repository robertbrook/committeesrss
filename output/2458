default1.1 The Export Group for Aerospace &amp; Defence (EGAD) is a UK-based not-for-profit-making special interest industry group, founded in September 2004, focusing exclusively on all aspects of export and trade control matters. 
defaultEGAD is the only dedicated national industrial body in the UK dealing exclusively with export control issues. 
defaultEGAD operates under the joint auspices of ADS Group Ltd, the British Naval Equipment Association (BNEA), INTELLECT and the Society of Maritime Industries (SMI). 
default&#xa0;
default1.2 A dedicated website (
defaultwww.egad.org.uk
default) has been created at the request of the group’s Executive Committee and with guidance from its Awareness Outreach Activities Sub-Committee, that is intended to become the first port of call for companies as the source of user-friendly basic, initial guidance on all aspects of export and trade controls, created by like-minded people to help compliance staff within companies. It seeks to identify potential sources of help, and ideas for problem solving, and presents easy steps to “bite-sized compliance”. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 The website has been kept simple, and, in addition to providing information on EGAD, itself, seeks to present a practical and simple step-by-step guide on understanding export and trade controls, and addressing the fundamental questions which companies ask: when do I need an export licence and how do I go about trying to obtain and use one? 
default&#xa0;
default1.4 EGAD has also created, with 
defaultCranfield
default University, a series of externally-accredited training courses in export control compliance, at four levels, running from very basic awareness (appropriate for all company staff) up to a Master's equivalent course (for senior export control compliance managers within companies). For further information, details on these are available at: 
defaultwww.strategicexportcontrols.org/index.cfm
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5 EGAD welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the open consultation around Strategic Export Controls; the CAEC invited comment on several specific areas, the response of EGAD to those areas, is detailed below:
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default2.1 From the viewpoint of responsible and law-abiding UK companies, it is clear that we support the continuation of the current UK export licensing system, which operates on a strict “case-by-case” basis. It is our strongly-held contention that the continued retention of the current “case-by-case” basis is the most logical and rational way in which an export control system can function, offering, as it does, the flexibility to permit responsible, whilst preventing undesirable exports, sometimes to the same destinations. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultThis principle is enshrined in the current UK  Open licensing system, that allows the Government to identify categories of “low-risk” goods which can be exported to certain destinations , with minimal intervention from the export licensing authorities and a minimal administrative burden on  UK businesses.
default&#xa0;
default2.4 Concerns raised by the Committee regarding two recent export licenses granted for the export of two dual-use chemicals, sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride, to Syria reinforces the need for a well-informed, evidence-based discussion on Export Controls. Sodium fluoride has a multitude of uses, most notably in dental hygiene products such as toothpaste and mouthwash. In this case, the chemicals in question were for civilian use in the finishing of aluminium profiles used to make aluminium showers and aluminium window frames, as demonstrated by the exporter and company due to receive the chemicals in Syria. The export licenses themselves were only granted once the Government was satisfied that the chemicals were indeed for this use and not for use in the manufacturing of chemical weapons.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 The reasons export licence applications of this nature often take so long to process is due to the scrutiny with which they are assessed and time taken to determine their clear end-use are.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 Responsibility, therefore, lies with UK industry to disclose all relevant information required in the full assessment of export license applications in a timely manner, not only to help speed up the application process but also to create as transparent an audit trail as possible for any subsequent enquiries that may take place. By requesting this information, UK Government officials are doing all they possibly can to try to ensure that the UK acts responsibly in its export activities. UK companies are advised to apply as early as possible and provide as much supporting information as possible to assist UK Government officials in assessing their applications.
default&#xa0;
default2.7 
defaultAs SPIRE , the ECO’s online export licensing system, itself says "
defaultthe ECO has to return roughly half of all export license applications to the exporter, either for more information or because the application has 
defaultbeen completed wrongly. These incomplete or incorrect applications cause delays in processing
default."   The delay in applications has caused instances were shipments have been delayed, impacting on customer confidence and their perceptions of the UK as a supplier.  
default&#xa0;
default2.8 EGAD is working to inform exporters better on how to complete licence applications more thoroughly and to ensure all necessary data is provided at the initial stage, in order to reduce delays in the process and prevent the current unacceptably high level of returned application and delayed shipments.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1 EGAD does not believe that any useful purpose would be served by a successful campaign to abolish DSEI (Defence and Security Equipment International). Held in the UK, in conjunction with the UK Government, DSEI is regulated by tighter controls and higher standards than might be than would be the case should the event take place elsewhere in the world. The event also enables UK SMEs to promote their business, network and meet potential customers that they might otherwise not come into contact with; contributing to the success of the UK’s supply chain.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1 We are aware that UK Government officials are endeavouring to keep abreast of developments in the US on Export Control Reform, which could have considerable commercial and bureaucratic consequences for UK businesses trading with companies in the US. It is important that the UK Government takes an active role in discussing the implications in the context of the Wassenaar Arrangement and considers ways in which it can seek to amend our own national legislation to ensure that UK Defence Industry is not at a competitive disadvantage in the increasingly crucial global marketplace.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1 EGAD believes that an extension of extraterritorial trade controls will fail to achieve the desired results from such measures and will in practice be easily evaded by illegal arms brokers, whilst subjecting companies to two different jurisdictions for the same transaction Extra-territorial jurisdiction should only be exerted in extreme circumstances that warrant it in order to avoid conflicts arising from multiple laws.
default&#xa0;
default Both the EU and the UK have already manifested their opposition to extra-territorial laws through adopting (
defaulti
default) 
defaultCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of 22 November 1996 protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country, and actions based thereon or resulting 
defaulttherefrom
default; (ii) 
defaultThe Extraterritorial US Legislation (Sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Libya) (Protection of Trading Interests) Order 1996; and (iii) The Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 Seeking to improve the level of control on the export of defence materiel by encouraging states to sign and ratify the Arms Trade Treaty is, in our view, a much more productive approach in the longer term. We assume that CAEC members are primarily concerned about undesirable exports of defence equipment from third countries, which may  fuel conflict and human rights abuses rather than those cases of responsible 3
defaultrd
default country exports which tangentially involve a “UK person” because they may be employed by a company established in a third country. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3 The Arms Trade Treaty seeks to address the problem and HMG should be encouraged to provide outreach and assistance to those countries that request it to bring their export control systems up to a comparable level. In the interim, we understand the desire for some measure of enhanced trade controls, but would request that it should expressly exclude legitimate trade from its scope. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1 Industry is initially positive about the new proposed shape and scope of the information, the ECO will seek from companies in an effort to enhance the existing high-level of transparency that we feel more effectively tries to achieve a practical and pragmatic balance, without imposing an unrealistic and disproportionate bureaucratic burden on UK companies.  We remain unhappy, however, that industry should be required to pay the cost in terms of overheads and diversion of resources due to the Government’s inability to modify and interrogate effectively the information that it already has on its own IT systems.
