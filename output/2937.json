It is committed to setting and maintaining professional standards and to promoting excellence in the teaching and practice of pathology. \nPathology is the science at the heart of modern medicine and is involved in 70 per cent of all diagnoses made within the National Health Service. The College aims to advance the science and practice of pathology, to provide public education, to promote research in pathology and to disseminate the results. We have over 10,000 members across 19 \nspecialties \nworking in hospital laboratories, universities and industry worldwide to diagnose, treat and prevent illness.\n&#xa0;2              Introduction&#xa0;2.1\n              \nIt has been recognised that major changes were needed to the inspection regime used by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). We welcome \nthe new posts of Chief Inspectors of Hospitals and General Practice and that their posts will be will be enshrined in law, so they are made permanent.\n We think the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards’ initiative to recruit more inspectors, including hospital patients and their carers, will provide a wider range of perspectives and give a voice to those who are treated by the NHS, helping to ensure safer, effective and compassionate care. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nNevertheless, it is vital that the CQC is supported to deploy health professionals with the expertise and experience to assess quality, standards and clinical governance across a range of complex and specialist areas. This must include prospective and retrospective assessment of quality. The CQC’s commitment to \n“regulate different services in different ways, making better use of tailored information and expert inspection to assess performance”\n is an important step in ensuring there is the expertise available to make sure there is an evidence-based approach for each sector.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nIn October 2012, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) carried out an inspection at King’s Mill Hospital, part of Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, after 79 women with breast cancer were recalled by the Trust due to issues surrounding test results. Its report was published in April 2013, following a detailed inspection and review to look into concerns about the people with breast cancer whose treatment may have been based on incorrect test results. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n              \nAs part of the inspection, the \nRCPath\n was asked to provide specialist input to investigate concerns that the treatment of women with breast cancer between 2004 and 2011 may have been based on incorrect test results. \nRCPath\n \nsuggested the additional involvement of the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) and put together a review team with experience in breast pathology, laboratory management, statistical analysis, quality assessment and service reviews, and clinical governance. \n&#xa0;\n              \nThis collaboration was a first for both organisations; see our full report to the CQC.\n We think this way of working is essential if the nature of sophisticated pathology tests, how their quality can be assured and how they support patients’ care is to be understood.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n              \nThe CQC’s inspection found that King’s Mill Hospital met the national standard concerning the care and welfare of people, but that processes to assess and assure the Trust of its own quality of service had not been sufficiently effective or robust.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n              \nKey findings before the \nRCPath\n was engaged were:\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDetail of the investigation by RCPath&#xa0;3.1\n              \nIn order to get to the root of the problem, a collaborative approach to the investigation was agreed. A review team comprising specialist, expert pathologists led by the \nRCPath’s\n Professional Standards Unit, and including a representative of the IBMS, was set up to work on behalf of the Care Quality Commission. \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThis team investigated the complex issues relating to oestrogen receptor (ER) testing, the role of external quality assessment and the possible implications for other pathology services.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nThe Care Quality Commission completed a ‘deep dive’ according to their procedures. The diagnostic and screening element of the investigation was deferred to the review team led by the \nRCPath\n. This review investigated diagnostic and screening procedures focussing on cellular pathology governance, breast reporting and \nimmunohistochemistry\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nThe team was asked to investigate these issues at King’s Mill Hospital, and related governance and oversight issues at the Trust and at regional and national levels. The investigation process consisted of a site visit, interviews, a slide review and a review of all documentation. In December 2012, members of the review team:\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nThe findings of the report had implications wider than for King’s Mill Hospital alone. It raised questions about the organisation of pathology departments and their workload, and the effectiveness of pathology quality assurance. \n4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFeedback drawn from our work with the CQC&#xa0;4.1\n              \nFirst, the high level of regulatory skills and ethical integrity of the CQC’s operational staff were clear. We experience openness during our collaboration. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nSecond, the CQC may not have enough staff for all the work expected of them and the complexities of specialist care were not matched by the CQC staffs’ more generic regulatory skills. Although the CQC has since introduced a more specialist approach to its investigations, it would still seem that they would need to call on a range of professional expertise. For example, for this investigation the team had experience in breast pathology, laboratory management, statistical analysis, quality assessment and service reviews, and clinical governance. \n4.3\n              \nThis collaboration was the first of its kind for both organisations. We think such collaboration is essential if we are to understand the nature of sophisticated pathology tests, how their quality can be assured and how they support patients’ care. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n4\n              \nWe think this model of collaboration is an important step in marshalling the expertise required and could point to the development of a cost-effective route to make sure there is an evidence-based approach for each sector that needs inspection or investigation by the CQC. This is vital when investigating complex diseases and conditions and specialist areas of practice\n&#xa0;\n4.\n5\n \n              \nThere are often weaknesses in initial internal, or internally commissioned, investigations into healthcare problems. The CQC standards should include all provider organisations to have training in place so that ten per cent of clinical and managerial staff in Case Investigation are trained and competent in Case Investigation and five per cent are trained and competent in Case Management. The recent National Clinical Assessment Service delivered training in these fields has had excellent feedback. Wider roll out of this would reap benefits in patient care, remediation and regulation of the healthcare sector.\n&#xa0;\n4.\n6\n              \nThis issue has resulted in two separate letters from Professor Sir Bruce Keogh\n and the National Clinical Lead for Pathology, Professor Jo Martin,\n which have been sent to all Trust Chief Executives, encouraging a more engaged and scientific approach to pathology quality. \n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pathology-quality-assurance-review-launched\n \nhttp://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/receptor-test-let.pdf\n http://www.rcpath.org/Resources/PDF/Kings%20Mill%20RCPath%20CQC%20report%205%20April.pdf\n https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pathology-quality-assurance-review-launched\n http://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/receptor-test-let.pdf\n"
