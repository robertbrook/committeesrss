"&#xa0;\nVEP 0024Written Evidence Submitted by Leigh Day VEP 0024&#xa0;&#xa0;\nIntroductionLeigh Day is a leading claimant-focussed law firm specialising in International &amp; Group Claims, Clinical Negligence, Personal Injury, Employment Discrimination and Human Rights &amp; Public Law.\n&#xa0;\nLeigh Day’s Human Rights &amp; Public Law department is one of the UK’s largest specialist practices in this field.  \n&#xa0;\nIt is recognised by its peers and the Legal Directories as one the top ranked practises in the country. It is one of only three firms named in Band 1 of both Chambers &amp; Partners and the Legal 500 in the areas of Administrative &amp; Public Law, and Civil Liberties &amp; Human Rights.  Seven of the department’s lawyers are named as leaders in these fields.\n&#xa0;The department has a dedicated Prison Law Team, and has developed particular expertise in relation to the treatment and care of people in prison.  The team’s areas of particular expertise relates to healthcare, discrimination and human rights within a prison context. \n&#xa0;\nBackgroundOver the last decade, the team has successfully acted for prisoners in a wide range of cases, including: personal injury and clinical negligence claims, unlawful discrimination claims, breach of human rights claims, judicial review challenges and applications to the European Court of Human Rights.  \n&#xa0;\nIn recent years, we have been approached by a large number of serving prisoners with concerns over being denied the right to vote.  These serving prisoners have approached us without us advertising the possibility of legal action or compensation.  \n&#xa0;\nTherefore, it is our experience that the issue of prisoner voting is of significant importance to many serving prisoners, and that their motivation is securing the right to vote rather than compensation.\n&#xa0;\nAt present, we are acting for over 550 serving prisoners in claims to the European Court of Human Rights with regard to past and continuing failure by the Government to allow them to vote.  The basis of these claims is that the Government’s failure is in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights\n&#xa0;\nIn a series of cases, including \nHirst v UK (No.2)\n, \nGreens and MT v UK\n and \nScoppola v Italy (No.3)\n, the European Court have confirmed that current blanket ban on prisoners voting is a breach of Protocol 1, Article 3 on the Convention.  Despite this, successive Governments have taken no action over the past decade to rectify the breach.  Therefore, as part of those claims, we are seeking a declaration that the Government’s failure is unlawful, as well as damages for breach of their human rights.\n&#xa0;\nAt present, these claims (together with a large number of additional applications filed by serving prisoners in the UK) have effectively been frozen by the European Court of Human Rights.  The Court have stated that they will consider what further steps to take in relation to these cases in light of the action taken by the UK Government to rectify the breach.  Most recently, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers stated that it would review the position at its 1179\nth\n meeting in September 2013.\n&#xa0;\nIt seems to us that the issue of prisoner voting is being, deliberately or otherwise, hijacked by a wider, and more deep rooted, debate on Europe, including a conflation, deliberate or otherwise, of the roles and responsibilities of the European Union / European Court of Justice and Council of Europe / European Court of Human Rights.\n&#xa0;\nIt seems to us that a main reason why there has been such steadfast resistance to removing the blanket ban is a perceived need to preserve parliamentary sovereignty, rather than strong views on whether or not prisoners should vote.  \n&#xa0;\nRepeated polls show that, whilst the majority of the public are against removal of the blanket ban, this is based on anti-Europe sentiment rather than anti-prisoner sentiment.  Indeed, as the backbench debate in February 2011 showed, this also seems to be a preoccupation of MPs themselves with the majority of the debate focussing on the fact that it should be Parliament not Europe who should decide which UK serving prisoners should be allowed the vote.\n&#xa0;\nThe aim of our evidence is to respond to the Committee’s request for our views on the adequacy or otherwise of the options for changes to the law set out in the draft Bill as well as to address the specific questions asked by the committee in their call for evidence.\n&#xa0;\nLeigh Day’s views on the options for change currently set out in draft BillAs you are aware, the draft bill sets out three options for changes to the law set out in the draft Bill. Namely:\n&#xa0;\na. Disqualifying prisoners sentenced to 4 years or more in prison from voting.\n&#xa0;\nb. Disqualifying prisoners sentenced more than 6 months in prison from voting.\n&#xa0;\nc. Disqualifying all prisoners serving custodial sentences from voting – a restatement of the existing ban.  \n&#xa0;\nWe consider that none of these options are adequate.  Rather we respectfully submit that that the appropriate option, not currently contained in the draft Bill, is the full enfranchisement of all sentenced prisoners.  We consider this to be the correct approach for a number of reasons.\n&#xa0;\nThe voting ban undermines democracyFirst of all, voting is properly considered a fundamental right, rather than a privilege with its entitlement based on a selective reward for those who have been judged as deserving by Government. A democracy should protect a citizen’s fundamental rights.\n&#xa0;\nAt least eighteen countries in Europe recognise the right to vote as a fundamental right, and have no restrictions on prisoners’ voting, including Ireland, Denmark, Sweden or Finland.  Six of the eight countries in Europe which have a blanket ban on prisoners’ voting are former Communist dictatorships.\n&#xa0;\nThe voting ban undermines the rule of lawSecondly, \nthe UK’s refusal to observe its legal obligations simply undermines the rule of law.  \nThe European Convention on Human Rights is an international treaty to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.  The UK is a party to the Convention which entered into force on 3\nrd\n September 1953. \nJudgments are binding on the States concerned.  \nObserving judgments of the Court is an international legal obligation arising by Treaty.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, \nthe Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1\nst\n December 2009, introduced significant changes to human rights protection in the European Union, the most significant of which lie in the amendments to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. These provide that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is now legally binding, having the same status as primary EU law, and that the EU ‘shall accede’ to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  The voting ban is therefore in breach of EU law.\n&#xa0;The voting ban simply represents punishment for punishments sakeThirdly, only in vanishingly rare circumstances will a prisoner’s offence relate to electoral fraud or undermining the democratic process. The removal of the right to vote bears no relationship to the offence and is purely to punish a prisoner. There is absolutely no evidence that the current voting ban is in any way a deterrent to crime and the removal of a prisoners’ right to vote somehow prevents further offending.\n&#xa0;\nThe voting ban undermines rehabilitationFourthly, a crucial part of a prisoners’ rehabilitation is the concept of citizenship and encouraging them to be a responsible citizen.  Voting and being part of the decision-making process is part of being a responsible citizen.  The blanket ban simply further marginalises an already marginalised section of society.\n&#xa0;\nThe voting ban means prisoners are underrepresentedFifthly, the blanket ban means that prisoners are an underrepresented section of society.  MPs do not have to concern themselves with prison issues as prisoners will not be voting for or against them.  If prisoners could vote, these prison issues would become higher up on the political agenda.  Sadly, it is our experience that when contacted by a prisoner from their constituency, many MPs show the most cursory of interest in the issues being raised.\n&#xa0;\nIt addition, the voting ban disproportionately affects minority ethnic groups, with black men, for example, significantly more likely to be barred from voting than their white counterparts due to their over-representation in the prison population.\n&#xa0;\nResponses to additional questions &#xa0;\n1. What are the historical and philosophical justifications for denying prisoners the right to vote?&#xa0;\nThe disenfranchisement of prisoners dates back to the Forfeiture Act 1870 and the earlier common law in which convicted felons forfeited their lands with the consequential effect of removing them from suffrage.  The ban was subsequently restated in the Representation of the People Act 1969 and Representation of the People Act 1983 as amended by the Representation of the People Act 1985 and Representation of the People Act 2000.\n&#xa0;\nThis disenfranchisement was very much linked to the notion of wholly outdated notion of “civic death” whereby offenders were denied any of the rights of citizenship.\n&#xa0;\n2. Why is the right to vote considered to be a human right?  &#xa0;\nThe simple answer is that because it has been identified as such in Protocol 1, Article 3 of the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“European Convention on Human Rights”) which identifies the need for parties to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot under conditions which will ensure the free expression of opinion of the people in the legislature.\n&#xa0;\nThese basic principles of electoral democracy, with the basic principle that every citizen has the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, to vote in elections which have universal suffrage and to have equal access to public services are also set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), adherence to which is monitored by the United Nations Human Rights Committee.  These principles underpin our democratic freedoms.\n&#xa0;\n3. Is disqualifying prisoners from voting a suitable part of their punishment?&#xa0;\nNo, it is important to view prisoners as citizens and that they should be encouraged to be active responsible citizens, engaging with wider society.  Voting is a part of this.  The perpetuation of the notion of civic death simply serves to further isolate those already on the margins of society and make it more difficult for them to integrate back into the communities to which they will return following release.\n&#xa0;\nFirst of all, it should be remembered that prisoners being held on remand as well as people imprisoned for contempt of court remain eligible to vote.  Therefore some prisoners currently are able to vote.\n&#xa0;\nFurthermore, prisoners serving a sentence may well contribute to society from within prison.  They pay tax on their savings, capital gains and any earnings they receive during the course of their sentence.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, those in prison still use many of the services used by those outside prison.  As users of the health service, for example, it is perfectly proper to have views, which can be expressed through the ballot box, on issues such as health service reforms.  \n&#xa0;\n4. What are the financial implications of maintaining the current ban in terms of claims by prisoners for compensation?&#xa0;\nObserving the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights is an international legal obligation arising by Treaty.  Compliance with the Convention is also a requirement of EU law.  The UK’s continuing failure to act leaves it open to claims for compensation from prisoners unlawfully denied the right to vote.\n&#xa0;\nRecent case law has confirmed compensation of 1,500 euros and 3,000 euros has been awarded in cases where people have been deprived the right to vote on the grounds of bankruptcy or being under a partial guardianship for manic depression respectively.  An eminent human rights barrister has suggested that compensation in the order of £750 may be payable to each prisoner denied the vote.\n&#xa0;\nAccording to leaked legal advice given to the Government, the failure to comply with Court judgments could open the Government up to compensation claims from serving prisoners of up to £143 million.\n&#xa0;\n5. Is sentence length a legally robust basis on which to retain an entitlement to vote?&#xa0;\nNo, it is unnecessarily arbitrary.  First of all, as stated above, certain prisoners are currently able to vote.\n&#xa0;\nSecondly, it takes no account of individual circumstances and, to that extent, remain a blanket ban for those serving a sentence of over X years.  It should be remembered that the sentence given to those convicted of the same offence may vary greatly in relation to whether or not they receive a custodial sentence and, if so, for how long.  \n&#xa0;\nIt should also be remembered that given that, for example, General Elections are usually held every 4 or 5 years, it is likely to come down to “the luck of the draw” whether somebody serving, say, two years imprisonment is able to vote or not, depending on the date of imprisonment and the date of the General Election.\n&#xa0;\nFor all the reasons set out above, we remain of the view that all sentenced prisoners should have the right to vote.\n&#xa0;\n6. What would be the likely legal consequences, both domestically and internationally of:&#xa0;a) keeping the law as it is? &#xa0;b) passing legislation giving some prisoners the right to vote, but in a way that maintains a form of blanket restriction?&#xa0;c) seeking to comply by enfranchising the minimum number of prisoners possible consistent with our international legal obligations?&#xa0;\nWe consider that anything short of allowing all prisoners the opportunity to vote is likely to leave the UK in breach of its legal obligations and open to claims for compensation from serving prisoners for past and continuing breaches of their human rights.\n&#xa0;\n7. Would giving prisoners the right to vote have any significant administrative impact on either the prison system or the Electoral Commission?&#xa0;\nNo.  It should be remembered that some prisoners already have the right to vote and the procedures for allowing this are (or at least should be) in place at every prison.\n&#xa0;\n8. Is there any evidence to suggest that allowing prisoners to vote would have a significant impact on particular constituencies? &#xa0;\nWe consider that allowing prisoners to vote in their place of usual residence (most often where they lived immediately before imprisonment) means that the practical effect of allowing prisoners the vote is likely to be very limited in any particular constituency.\n&#xa0;\nThere are approximately 100,000 prisoners in England Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  There are 650 constituencies.  That equates to approximately 150 prisoners per constituency.  Taking into account turnout rates, this means that there are likely to be considerably less than an average of 100 prisoners voting per constituency.\n&#xa0;\n9. What lessons can be drawn from the experience of other countries regarding prisoner voting?&#xa0;\nAs stated above, at least eighteen countries in Europe recognise the right to vote as a fundamental right, and have no restrictions on prisoners’ voting, including Ireland, Denmark, Sweden or Finland.  The sky does not appear to have fallen in on the democratic process in any of these countries.\n&#xa0;\nAs also stated above, it may be worthy of note that six of the eight countries in Europe which have a blanket ban on prisoners’ voting are states emerging from a recently  authoritarian past.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;June 2013&#xa0;\n"
