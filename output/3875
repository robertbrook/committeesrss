[normal]Procedural as opposed to substantive defects in decisions:[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]The rule of law is said to demand that government action conforms
[normal] to precepts of good administration developed through the courts, this being an essential facet of accountable government in a democratic society. The constraints imposed on government through judicial review are in part procedural and in part substantive.
[normal] The range of these principles varies, but normally includes ideas such as: legality, procedural propriety, participation, fundamental rights, openness, rationality, relevancy, propriety of purpose, reasonableness, equality, legitimate expectations, legal 
[normal]certainty and proportionality.
