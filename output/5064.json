"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence from the Rt Hon Hugh Robertson MP, Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (USA 18)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to present evidence to the Committee as part of your inquiry into the Government’s foreign policy towards the United States.  I promised to provide you with further details in response to some members’ questions, as well as answers to some additional questions subsequently raised in the Committee Specialist’s follow-up letter of 9 December 2013.  \nYou will find responses to the Committee’s questions on the policy-making machinery (3, 4, 6-9) and on other issues (9-11) in Annex A. Other Whitehall departments, including the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet Office, have contributed to these answers. \nThe Committee also posed a series of questions on the UK Government’s position on humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect. As agreed with the Committee, we will write separately on these issues shortly.  \nI understand the National Security Adviser is writing separately on other matters raised.\nI hope the Committee finds this additional information useful as it prepares its reports.  \nAll my very best wishes,\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTHE RT HON HUGH ROBERTSON MP\nMINISTER OF STATE\n20 January 2014\nAnnex A&#xa0;\nQuestion 3: How many staff comprise the US team in the FCO’s Americas team under Kate Smith? How, if at all, has the size of the US team changed since 2010? Does the US team include a Research Analyst? Is there anyone in the FCO in London tasked with the longer-term analysis of US politics and policy, or is this work carried out exclusively by FCO staff working in the US?The\nre are five officials in the FCO’s\n North America Department under Americas Director Kate Smith working on the UK’s bilateral relationship with the United States\n.\n The staffing levels were the same in 2010. \nAdditionally, the Americas Research Group includes one analyst dedicated to the US, as well as other North American issues. \nLonger-term analysis of US politics and policy is factored in to all the work carried out by North Americas Department, as well as by \nFCO \nstaff working in Washington and the wider US network. Much of the work carried out by the North Americas Department Research Analyst also looks at the future of US politics, which in turn informs the work undertaken by staff both in London and in the US. As you will be aware, the FCO also has a separate Policy Unit which plays an important role in longer term strategic analysis of the US \nand US policy. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 4: How widely within the FCO and across Government is the Washington Embassy’s reporting distributed? How does this compare to the distribution for reporting from the UK’s Embassies in other major international partners, such as France? Reporting originating from the British Embassy in Washington and the US network (the Consulates-General in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco, Consulate in \nOrlando\n and government office in Seattle) \nreaches all parts of government\n, depending on the subject matter.  This includes\n No 10\n, \nCabinet Office\n, \nHer Majesty’s Treasury\n, the \nDepartment for International Development\n, the\n Ministry of Defence\n, the\n; Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\n,\n UK Trade and Investment\n, the\n Bank of England\n, the\n Department of Health\n, the \nDepartment of Work and Pensions\n, the\n Department for Education\n, the\n Department of Energy and Climate Change\n, the\n Department for Transport\n, the\n National Crime Agency. The reporting is also circulated widely to \nd\nepartments within the FCO in London, as well as to \nFCO p\nosts across the world.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe \nEmbassy \nand network’s reporting covers\n the full range of issues that have the potential to affect UK interests\n, from \nUS foreign and security policy \nto \neconomic and global issues such as finance, trade, energy and climate.\n&#xa0;\n \nR\neporting also covers domestic political and social issues – from developments in Congress and national and regional elections, to some of the longer term trends in US society.\n&#xa0;\nR\neport\ns\n come in many formats: diplomatic telegrams which are distributed widely within the FCO global network and across Government; e-mails of a more technical nature aimed at experts within the relevant parts of government; letters and emails of a more sensitive nature\n, \noften sent from the Ambassador to a narrower, senior Whitehall audience.\n&#xa0;\n The \nEmbassy and\n Consulates General produce more reporting by diplomatic telegram than any other bilateral network in the world. \nG\niven the breadth of subjects it deals with on a daily basis, the reporting is one of (if not the) most shared of all the Foreign Office’s reporting. \nTo give the Committee a sense of the type and quality of the reporting, we would be pleased to offer the Committee the opportunity to view some of it.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 6: Has the National Security Council ever had a dedicated agenda item on any aspect of US politics or policy? (i.e. not simply a discussion of US policy in the context of an agenda item on, say Afghanistan or Syria or another policy issue)Her Majesty’s Government does not comment on any specific agenda items discussed at the National Security Council.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 7: Is there a cross Government country strategy for the US?UK interests in and with the US cover a vast range of issues and engage most if not all UK government departments. It has not been considered feasible to capture the totality of this interest and engagement in a single US strategy document shared across Whitehall.  But engagement with the US i\ns an integral part of\n the strategic objectives of\n many Whitehall departments\n \n– including FCO, MOD, Home Office, DECC, BIS and HMT. \n&#xa0;\nThis \nis reflected in \ndocumentary form in \nthe \nUS Network’s annual \nhigh-level\n Country\n Business Plan – which\n is drawn up with input from across government and reflects cross departmental objectives for the forthcoming year. \n \nIt is designed to be a short snapshot of the top line UK priorities in the US, and is underpinned by additional team and personal objectives across the network. The US network’s \ncore business in the US is the \nimplementation of this Business Plan, as well as the analysis and investment in relationships necessary to sustain our overall engagement and pursue UK interests. A copy of the plan can be found in Annex B.\nTo inform and guide this work, the\n Government does look at longer term dynamics\n - \n where American politics, economy and society are heading, how we expect the relationship to evolve over time, and what risks and opportunities these trends bring for the UK.\n&#xa0;\n Much of this work is led by the Embassy and wider US network, \nincluding its cross Whitehall representation, \nwh\nich\n \nare specifically resourced and best placed to draw on the array of policy practitioners, analysts and experts in the US, including think tanks,\n commentators\n and academics. \n \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 8: Does the National Security staff in the Cabinet Office, or the Defence Strategy and Priorities team in the MoD, or the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) at Shrivenham, have any staff tasked with the longer-term analysis of US politics and policy?The relationship with the US is fundamental to almost all of the work undertaken by National Security Staff in the Cabinet Office. Staff maintain close working relationships with key US contacts and share analysis of politics and policy with colleagues across Whitehall, including the FCO and MoD.\n&#xa0;\nWith regards to the Defence Strategy and Priorities (DSP)\n team in MOD\n, whil\ne\n \nit\n do\nes\n not have any staff permanently assigned to longer-term analysis of US politics and policy\n,\n \nit \nkeeps a very close eye on the strategic direction of our paramount security partner as the Committee would expect. This is \ncentred\n upon a close working relationship with the team in the US Office of the Secretary of Defense which is \nresponsible for leading the Quadrennial Defense Review. We co-operate on strategic planning, sharing analysis and emerging conceptual thinking. DSP has US and French Exchange Officers embedded within it, and there is also a UK Exchange Officer inside the US strategy team in the Department of Defense. Within the UK Embassy in Washington, MOD has a large Defence Section dedicated to strengthening the UK/US bilateral relationship, but wh\nich\n also report\ns\n and provide\ns\n comment on US Defence policy. \nThe Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) also undertake longer-term analysis of US politics and policy, particularly through their work on ‘Global strategic trends to 2045’. \n&#xa0;\nQuestion 9: What work on the US has the DCDC done or commissioned as part of its current work on its ‘Global strategic trends to 2045’ document, due for publication in the first half of 2014?DCDC has conducted \na \nstudy in support of Global Strategic Trends 2045 on the US.\n&#xa0;\nThe study (titled ‘US focus on the Asia-Pacific Region’) aims to examine the effect of Washington’s reorientation of its foreign policy focus away from Europe towards the Asia Pacific region and will be published in December 2014.\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 10: For the US-UK bilateral relationship, I would be grateful for a list of outward ministerial, and inward Administration and Congressional visits, so far this year – as some indicator of the intensity of contact (and in the awareness that patterns may have been disrupted this year by the establishment of the second Obama Administration and 113th Congress after the 2012 elections).We are aware of\n at least\n 59 outward Ministerial visits to the US\n during 2013. Whilst we do not keep a track of all the inward Administration and Congressional visits to the UK, Annex C gives a \nflavour\n of some \n1\n7 inward visits that took place during 2013.\n \nMany of these visits\n compromised a num\nber of Senators and Congressmen/\nCongresswomen.\nG\niven the high volume and frequency of visitors to both the US and UK, \nthere will\n \ncertainly have been other outward and inward visits which are not listed, many of which will have been \norganised\n independently. The FCO is not always involved in inward visits, particularly when Members of Congress undertake private trips. We are also aware of a number of short stopover visits to the UK by Senator Kerry, as well as numerous visits by senior State Department officials to discuss the situation in Syria which are not listed. \nQuestion 11: Did the US Administration inform the UK that it was conducting private bilateral talks with Iran between August and November 2013? Many of the E3+3 (France, Germany, UK + China, Russia, US) have had bilateral discussions with Iran, of which we were aware. The Joint Plan of Action is the\n&#xa0;\nresult of the E3+3 negotiations with Iran\n.\nAnnex B: US Network Priorities – 2013/14&#xa0;\nAnnex C&#xa0;&#xa0;2013 Outward visits to the US&#xa0;January8-10: \nRt\n Hon David Willets MP, Minister of State for Universities and Science - San Francisco\n14-15: \nRt\n Hon Baroness \nWarsi\n, Senior Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office  – New York\n27-29: \nRt\n Hon William Hague MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  – Washington\n&#xa0;\nFebruary 4-5: Ed \nVaizey\n MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries – Los Angeles\n11-13: \nRt\n Hon \nCarwyn\n Jones AM, First Minister for Wales – San Francisco\n&#xa0;\nMarch5-6: \nRt\n Hon Michael Gove MP, Secretary of State for Education – Chicago\n17-21: \nRt\n Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland – Washington, New York\n18-19: \nRt\n Hon Alistair Burt MP, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs – New York – \n&#xa0;\nApril1-4: \nRt\n Hon Mark Francois MP, as Minister of State for Personnel, Welfare and Veterans – Washington\n10-12: \nRt\n Hon Gregory Barker MP, Minister of State for Climate Change – Washington\n14-15: \nRt\n Hon Alistair Burt MP, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs – Washington\n16-18: \nRt\n Hon Michael Fallon MP, Minister of State for Business and Enterprise – Detroit\n17-20: George Osborne MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer – Washington\n17-21: \nRt\n Hon Justine Greening MP, Secretary of State for International Development – Washington\n21-24 Phillip Dunne MP, Minster for Defence Equipment, Support, and Technology – Fort Worth, Texas, Washington\n23-25: Mark \nSimmonds\n MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office – Washington\n30-2 May: \nRt\n Hon Philip Hammond MP, Secretary of State for Defence – Washington\n&#xa0;\nMay5-8: Nick \nHurd\n, MP, Minister for Civil Society – New York, Washington\n12-15: \nRt\n Hon David Cameron MP, Prime Minister – New York, Washington, Boston\n18-21: Norman Lamb MP, Minister of State for Care and Support  – San Francisco, Seattle, Salt Lake City\n27-31: Matthew Hancock MP, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Skills – Washington, New York\n29-30: \nRt\n Hon Justine Greening, MP, Secretary of State for International Development – New York\n&#xa0;\nJune2-5: \nRt\n Hon Jeremy Hunt MP, Secretary of State for Health – Washington, Boston\n4-6: \nRt\n Hon Hugh Robertson MP, as Minister for Sport – New York\n5-6: Mark \nSimmonds\n MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office – New York\n12: \nRt\n Hon William Hague MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  – Washington \n13-14: Elizabeth Truss MP, Parliamentary Under -Secretary of State for Education and Childcare – New York\n24-26: \nRt\n Hon William Hague MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  – New York &amp;
