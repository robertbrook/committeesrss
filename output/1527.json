"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Calor Gas Ltd (HOT08)EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsumption of energy for heat in the home is on a downward trend with promising new technologies offering\n further efficiency gains\n and the prospect of reducing household fuel bills whilst keeping us on course to our 2050 carbon emission targets and offering a measure of protection against power cuts post 2015.\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment, now joining the growing weight of scientific opinion and envir\nonmental campaigners, considers biomass not to be sustainable. Moreover, biomass emissions carry a social cost of £4343m in terms of premature death and extra morbidity. The downsides of biomass\n apply equally in domestic or industrial combustion.\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe susta\ninability criteria of biomass are weak, rely on the honesty box principle and \ntake no account of carbon debt or emissions from indirect use of land change. They provide no safeguard against increased net carbon emissions.\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTests to date on installed heat pu\nmps show m\nany \nfailing \nto qualify as renewable. \n Failures would not count towards our \nrenewables\n target and could either completely waste or forfeit subsidy. \nMany \nheat pumps\n,\n when installed\n,\n do not do what \nthey \nsay on the tin, and no amount of taxpayer’s \nsubsidy can draw a veil over that.\n Air Source Heat Pumps emerge from independent testing as a bust technology undeserving of taxpayer support.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;What progress is the Government making in reducing demand for heat?1.1. \nIn the past 10 years \nthe\n average \nCalor\n \ncentral heating customer has reduced \nhis or her\n fuel usage by over 20% on a weather adjusted basis. \nThis is in line with the recent analysis published by the Office of National Statistics\n which covered\n natural gas demand in urban areas\n. \nPerhaps\n deman\nd for heat has fallen because of better insulation standards\n and more efficient equipment\n, but it is hard to disentan\ngle this factor from energy price rises \ndepressing consumption.\n1.2. \nT\nhe good news is that gas technology still has an enormous amount to\n offer\n in maintaining this downward trend\n. For example, two thirds of properties still have older non-condensing boilers and therefore still have significant savings available at relatively low cost. We are also seeing a raft of exciting new technologies c\noming on to the market which will further accelerate the decline in energy consumption and carbon emissions\n. These new technologies \ncan be used in off gas grid areas \nand are \nable to utilise legacy heating systems such as radiators and \ncirculating \npumps\n. \nThese \ninclude Flue Gas Heat Recovery, \nmCHP\n (micro combined heat and power) and Gas Absorption Heat Pumps – a\nll\n \nlow carbon or \nrenewable gas technolog\nies\n which \ncan \nbe \nreadily \nretrofitted on to a home’s existing central heating system\n.\nWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating compared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? What are the lock in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solutions?2.1. The Energy N\networks Association in their report “Gas Future Scenario Project” (November 2010) stated: “There are credible and robust scenarios in which gas could play a major ongoing role in the GB energy mix while meeting both the 2050 carbon targets and the 2020 ren\newable energy targets”. “Pathways with ongoing gas use could offer a cost-effective solution for a low-carbon transition relative to scenarios with higher levels of electrification.” The report shows potential savings of almost £700bn over the 2010 to 2050\n period – about £20,000 per household or £10,000 per person “with consequential benefits for consumers, the economy, and the competitiveness of GB industry”.  The report points out that the low-carbon technologies all, “Involve significant investment in ne\nw technology, with its associated risks” and concludes that, “There appears to be significant value in retaining the option for a ‘high gas’ future”. \n              \n2.2. For urban areas, it points to the value of enjoying the sunk costs in the gas mains: “The costs of maintaining the existing gas transmission and distribution networks are relatively small in comparison to the other system costs associated with a low-c\narbon transition. Together these findings suggest a compelling economic rationale for maintaining the operation of the GB gas transmission and distribution networks for the foreseeable future”. \n&#xa0;\n2.3. Projects are underway to decarbonise gas (deploying \nbiomethane\n or \nbiopropane\n) but meanwhile we can make the fossil fuel work harder by deploying micro-generation – if decarbonised gas comes down the pipeline then lock-in disappears as a problem becaus\ne we are dealing with bridging technology rather than a temporary fix. \nmCHP\n involves the use of gas to generate both heat and electricity. It is a low cost solution delivering secure low carbon electricity. \nOne possible component of the domestic heating sc\nenarios contemplated in DECC’s “Pathways Analysis” is \nmCHP\n – reaching up to 90% of the technology mix in one illustrated case, and with a maximum penetration of 36 million households by 2050. \n&#xa0;\n2.4. \nOwners of compliant \nmCHP\n units can sell electricity back \nto the grid. So, \nmCHP\n will lower, not raise\n,\n household energy bills\n and could\n be an antidote to fuel poverty\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n. \nmCHP\n units are  compatible with existing grid infrastructure. What is more,\n \nmCHP\n benefits security of supply because the electricity is gene\nrated at or near the point of use, and when it is needed. This obviates losses in transmission (accounting for about 7% of all power generated), reduces the demand for electricity from the grid and the need for investment in central generation and the tran\nsmission and distribution network\n, thus lessening the otherwise crippling cost of the energy strategy (estimated at £376bn by 2030\n1\n)\n. \nmCHP\n \nalso\n \nenhances protection against the risk of power cuts occurring after 2015, since the majority of the electricity needed by a typical home will be generated on site, and \nmCHP\n can support grid generation at times of peak demand. \nIndeed, \nmCHP\n tends to generate \nmore power at times of peak demand (evenings and \nw\ninters) and insofar as it is deployed will lessen the need to operate very expensive fossil-fuel peaking plant. \n A financial benefit \nhas been calculated of 6.2p/kWh of electricity generated from avoided cap\nacity, energy and emission costs provided there is widespread \nmCHP\n deployment\n2\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n. Significant reliance on fossil fuel capacity is dictated for decades to come to compensate for the intermittency of wind, and the slow modulation of nuclear (if indeed it\n can be financed and built in time to meet demand). It is this peaking and balancing fossil plant that \nmCHP\n displaces so delivering carbon savings. As long as there is fossil plant in the grid \nmCHP\n delivers carbon savings.\n&#xa0;\n2.7. \nThe world energy scenario has changed almost beyond recognition in the last decade. Assumptions about “peak” oil and gas now look risible in light of the transformative effects of \nunconventional oil and gas \n on the US \nenergy market and economy\n, and the US \nhas also shown that it is perfectly possible to enjoy the economic growth as a result of this new cheap and secure supply whilst driving down carbon emissions overall. \nmCHP\n can \nhelp exploit this bounty with supreme efficiency.\n&#xa0;\nBiomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspective.  What should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture? There are sustainability guidelines for biomass, do these go far enough?&#xa0;3\n.1. \nThere has \nbeen a steady shift in attitude to the use of biomass within the scientific community, the European Commission, and now, detectably within the\n Government itself. The\n downsides of biomass in electricity generation or \nin\n combustion in the home\n are shared\n: th\ne differences are mainly of scale, except that at the domestic level there is no \nthird party \ncontrol of emissions \nthrough the stack.\n All too often the social cost of these emissions – in terms of early death and disease –\n is\n ignored. This social cost has b\neen computed at £4343m by DECC\n3\n.\n3\n.\n2\n. \nThe Chartered Institute of Water and Environmental Management recently commented: “The encouragement of biomass boilers in urban areas has added new sources of pollution, where there is often existing poor air quality…\nBurning…biomass emits \nNOx\n and PM. The PM is largely composed of black carbon, which is now thought to be responsible for the cardiovascular health effects and premature mortality due to both short term (24 hour) and long term (annual) exposure. It is also \nimportant with respect to climate change\n (NOTE: black carbon is a potent global warming agent, second only to CO\n2\n in its overall impact worldwide)\n. The current regulations on emissions from combustion plant of less than 50MW …are inadequate and for those \nof less than 20MW, it is almost non-existent\n” (“Clearing the Air”, \nJuly 2013).\n3.3.\n \nThe Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution estimated that the 2008 burden level of particulates cost an “\nassociated loss of total population life of 340,000 life\n-years…a greater burden than the mortality impacts of environmental tobacco smoke or road traffic accidents”\n4\n)\n. Remarkably, this figure is exactly the level of extra burden of mortality to have been inflicted on the \nUK\n atmosphere by 2020 under the previous\n Government’s policy on biomass, with its target of 38TWh by that date. No wonder Government has \nresiled\n from a specific target. The last Government was aware biomass boilers deteriorate as they age so proposed an annual MOT test on domestic biomass boiler\ns – all mention of such an annual MOT test on boilers has since been dropped.\n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n \nThere are growing doubts about the sustainability of biomass as a technology. The EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting, \nfor instance, states that the \nassumption that burning biomass is carbon neutral is incorrect: “Using land to produce plants for energy typically means that this land is not producing plants for other purposes, including carbon otherwise sequestered.” If biomass production replaces fore\nsts, reduces forest stocks or forest growth, which would otherwise sequester more carbon, it can increase carbon concentrations net. The RSPB, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace comment that DECC’s flawed emission accounting on biomass has led to a situat\nion where, “Burning whole trees in power stations would make global warming worse, undermining goals of reducing our greenhouse gases by 2050”.\n3.5. \nUsing logged trees as a \nbioenergy\n source – replacing fossil fuel – carries the risk of first increasing CO\n2\n emissions before reducing them. It could in fact take up to 100 years before emissions begin to decrease. Using crop residues or wood waste does not have this downside, or to a lesser extent. If felling were to increase to provide more energy through biom\nass, this could hinder rather than help achieving CO\n2\n targets. This is the main conclusion from the analysis ‘Climate effects of wood used for \nbioenergy\n’ (august 2013), released by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency in cooperation with \nAlterra\n \nWageningen\n UR.\n3.6\n. \nThe Government \nrecently made\n an announcement that after 2027 \npayments to biomass conversions will end “in\n line with Government’s longer-\nterm sustainability objectives as set out in the \nBioenergy\n Strategy”. Belatedly, HMG has realised that biomass is not the sustainable hero it purported \nit to be. As Robert \nHarrobin\n commented on the Today Programme on 17\nth\n July 2013: “Ed Davey told me that \nthey do accept that this is not a sustainable solution to the \nUK\n electricity p\nroblems\n”\n. \nWhy the 2027 cut off? It’s just as unsustainable before as after that date.\n What is not sustainable for burning in \npower plants is not sustainable in domestic situation\ns where the controls are effectively “non-existent”.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n. \nWe are not satisfied that the proposed sustainability criteria are sufficiently demanding. Wastes and residues are not subject to sustainability criteria. In theory, giving waste a free pass appear\ns appealing, but what is “waste” and what are “residues”? The OFGEM guidance is remarkably vague and clearly capable of being exploited: “\nIt is not possible to lay down definitive or absolute rules as to when particular materials will be considered as \nwaste materials or not”. We fear that this complexity of definition could provide the unscrupulous with a loophole to exploit.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n. \nOFGEM effectively points to the weakness of the process of operators verifying the information they supply on \nsustainability: “Under the Orders, operators of generating stations for solid and gaseous biomass are not required to verify the information they provide to us in order to be eligible for ROCs”.\n Reporting of sustainability criteria appears to rely too much\n on the honesty box principle, particularly in the context of “weak governance structures” identified in the “\nReport from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on sustainability requirements for the use of solid and gaseous biomass sour\nces in electricity, heating and cooling” (2010).\n3.9\n. The Government issued new biomass sustainability standards on 22\nnd\n August 2013.  The Chief Scientist at \nGreenpaece\n commented, \n“The loopholes in these sustainability standards are big enough to d\nrive a l\nogging truck through...\nThe government has ignored the latest scientific research and \nproduced standards that will take a potentially sustainable industry and transform it into one more way to \ngreen\nwash\n environmental destruction”\n5\n. \nKeith Richter, speaking \nfor Friends of the Earth said, \"It is incomprehensible \nthat under the new rules the burning of trees in power stations will be counted as \"carbon neutral\" despite the preliminary results of DECC's own research showing that it can be worse for the climate t\nhan burning coal\n”\n5\n. Other critics pointed out that emissions from indirect land use change and carbon debt received no consideration in the new standards. We conclude that in answer to the Committee’s question of whether the biomass sustainability criteria\n go far enough is a resounding, “NO”.\n&#xa0;Why does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?&#xa0;\n4\n.1. \nIt’s not the fault of the RHI, but the fault of the pumps as installed. Leaving aside questions of their e\nxpense to install\n, \nand \nthe\n disruptiveness of their installation, all too often they do not work properly. \nA study of installed heat pump performance published by the Energy Saving Trust on the 8\nth\n September 2010 – “\nGetting Warmer: a field trial of heat pumps”\n revealed that the actu\nal performance of heat pumps installed in the UK was surprisingly poor. The study was financed by the heat pump industry and based on a sample of sites where pumps had been installed pre-selected by the industry. The study showed that only 1 of the 22 prop\nerties with Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) achieved the implicit minimum EU Directive \nCoP\n of 3\n, and only 9 of the 47 sites with ASHPs achieved the standard. Similar results prevailed in the \nRowntree\n Foundation study in \nYork\n. The Association for the Conse\nrvation of Energy calculates C\no\nefficients of Performance for Air Source Heat Pumps from international data of between 2.15 and 2.7. On that basis, they all fail the renewable test.\n4\n.2. \nDECC is well aware of the problem: “We are aware that systems \ninstalled in the past have not always worked as well as they should” (Para. 199, DECC Consultation on the RHI, 20\nth\n September 2012) and again: “It is a common \nfeature in field trials and assessments that there is a significant gap between expected and actu\nal performance” (\npara\n. 1.23, \nMicrogeneration\n Strategy Consultation, DECC, 22\nnd\n Dec, 2010). DECC is currently monitoring 150 heat pumps and preliminary results show that most heat pumps operating on a \nmild\n Spring day were achieving below the required perfor\nmance levels - some significantly below. Far from backing a winning horse, DECC is backing a flop but it has been coy in admitting it, confining itself so far to admit: “We think it is likely that on average the results will still be a long way off the hig\nh-performing systems that are consistently being measured in Germany”. \n&#xa0;\n4.3. \nThe Energy Savings Trust has now published Phase 2 of its testing on pumps (“The Heat is On”, May 2013). The bulk of this work involved a series of interventions on 32 of the fai\nling Phase 1 sites over a three year period. In 12 cases the “interventions were “major”. In 10 cases, the interventions involved the complete replacement of the pump systems. Even with all this no doubt expensive intervention: “Some sites did not improve,\n even with major and medium interventions”. The deficiency in performance was especially marked for ASHPs with \n6\n out of 15 \nstill \nfailing to make the \nrenewable \ngrade. From this we deduce that there is no case for continued taxpayer subsidy to ASHPs since ev\nen after extensive and costly intervention by experts \nan unacceptable proportion\n could not be made to work properly. They would be ruled out as renewable by the EU and energy they generate would not count towards the \nUK\n’s renewable targets. The average per\nformance of ASHPs was under the bar of being counted as renewable.\n4.4. \nTo be fair, after all this desperate effort over three years, most GSHPs did work properly. How much all this extensive and expensive remediation would cost, and who would bear that co\nst – the installer or the householder – is a question for bitter experience in the market, but we draw a strong \nconclusion from this that type-rating technology to a standard is a long way from actual installed performance. Let the buyer beware – and let t\nhe taxpayer beware of pouring subsidy into a technology that does not make the grade. Government should pay out subsidy only on those pumps tested as having delivered\n to minimum performance standards\n after installation.\n4.5. \nThese conclusions echo other studies. Johnson, for instance,  in \nEnergy Policy\n, 2011, vol. 39, issue 3, pages 1369-1381 finds that at UK efficiencies heat-pump footprints (in kg CO2e emitted pe\nr kWh delivered) are comparable or higher than footprints of gaseous fuels used in heating. Compared with fossil fuel gas they don’t save carbon.\n4.6. \nThe Green Alliance  lobby \nin favour\n of heat pumps but even they have admitted, “Heat pumps have performed\n badly in the UK…UK heat pumps have suffered from poor quality technology…bad installation…incorrect use…high running costs…Despite poor installations, heat pump installers aren’t being struck off for malpractice (“Switching the UK onto heat pumps”, 29\nth\n M\nay 2013)”. Time after time he\nat pumps simply do not do what they say \non the tin. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
