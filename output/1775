[normal]Written evidence submitted by the Combined Heat and Power Association (HOT50)[bold]The Combined Heat and Power Association (CHPA) welcomes
[normal] the opportunity to provide written evidence to the Energy and Climate Change Committee’s inquiry on heat. 
[normal]The 
[normal]CHPA
[normal] is the leading advocate 
[normal]of 
[normal]an integrated approach to delivering energy services using combined heat and power and district heating and cooli
[normal]ng.
[normal] 
[normal]The CHPA’s response sets out key elements of 
[normal]the 
[normal]heat 
[normal]sector 
[normal]and highlights immediate issues where policy focus would be of value. 
[normal]We 
[normal]would also welcome the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Committee. 
[normal]Accounting for half of 
[normal]UK
[normal] energy demand, h
[normal]eat is central to the energy debate
[normal]. 
[normal]If we are t
[normal]o achieve our decarbonisation 
[normal]commitments
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]reducing emissions from heat 
[normal]must 
[normal]be at the heart of energy policy.
[normal] 
[normal]DECC’s creatio
[normal]n of a heat directorate in 2011, and the publication of 
[normal]H
[normal]eat 
[normal]S

[normal]demonstrates 
[normal]Government
[normal]’s growing
[normal] 
[normal]recogni
[normal]tion
[normal] 
[normal]of 
[normal]the importance of heat
[normal]. 
[normal]Heat policy [bold]must focus on the needs of the consumer[bold]While p
[normal]ower is a standardised commodity
[normal],
[normal] heat is highly 
[normal]specific 
[normal]to the consumer
[normal]’s requirements
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, h
[normal]omes
[normal] and offices 
[normal]need low-temperature heat for heating and hot water
[normal], while
[normal] 
[normal]i
[normal]ndustries need high temperature heat for industrial processes. 
[normal]The difficulty 
[normal]of transporting 
[normal]heat 
[normal]over long
[normal] distances ensures heat generation is always 
[normal]generated 
[normal]local
[normal]ly
[normal] and
[normal], therefore,
[normal] 
[normal]involves a close relationship with the final 
[normal]user
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]eat 
[normal]policy
[normal], therefore,
[normal] requires
[normal] a more
[normal] decentralised
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]user
[normal]-orientated 
[normal]approach
[normal]. 
[normal]With 
[normal]such an 
[normal]approach, it becomes clear that there 
[normal]is no 
[normal]one 
[normal]solution for decarbonising 
[normal]UK
[normal] 
[normal]heat
[normal]. Rather 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]suite of technologies 
[normal]is needed
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]each
[normal] tailored to 
[normal]specific users’ 
[normal]needs.
[normal] 
[normal]An integrated systems approach controls costs for consumers[bold]With an increased use of elec
[normal]tricity for energy needs, including heat and transport, there is a pressing need to consider how different energy needs interact. 
[normal]The 2013 Heat Strategy recognises the 
[normal]energy system’s 
[normal]complex nature and recognises that a more cost-effective system will ari
[normal]se when all energy uses are better integrated.
[normal] 
[normal]By using tools such as thermal
[normal] 
[normal]stores, a more integrated energy system 
[normal]can 
[normal]help reduce overall costs by better managing electricity demand and supply
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Without considering heat and power 
[normal]together
[normal], the UK risks
[normal] creating a very expensive, inefficient energy system.
[normal]Energy efficiency links key [bold]options [bold]for decarbonising[bold] heat[bold]T
[normal]here are many technologies
[normal] 
[normal]which
[normal] can offer low carbon heat 
[normal]including generation technologies like 
[normal]heat pumps, solar
[normal] thermal
[normal], 
[normal]combined heat 
[normal]and power (
[normal]CHP
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]However, w
[normal]hatever generation solution is deployed, energy efficiency 
[normal]across generation, delivery 
[normal]infrastructure, 
[normal]and final demand
[normal] is key
[normal]. 
[normal]Currently,
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he high temperatures required by 
[normal]industrial 
[normal]processes 
[normal]are
[normal] 
[normal]mostly 
[normal]provid
[normal]ed by individual gas-fired boilers
[normal] or CHP
[normal], but with an increasing role for bio
[normal]energy
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he relatively high cost of electricity makes it 
[normal]prohibitively 
[normal]expensive
[normal] 
[normal]for widespread 
[normal]industrial 
[normal]heat generation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Electrically
[normal]-generated heat 
[normal]is 
[normal]needed for some 
[normal]processes such as iron and 
[normal]aluminium
[normal] smelting
[normal] where the high temperatures required cannot be 
[normal]readily 
[normal]achieved by other means
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Energy efficiency sits at the heart of industrial heat[bold] [bold]decarbonisation[bold] [bold]F
[normal]or medium temperature industrial heat needs, fossil and 
[normal]bioenergy
[normal] will remain the key sources for cost-effective heat
[normal] in the medium term
[normal]. 
[normal]But these
[normal] energy options pose challenges as well. 
[normal]T
[normal]he

[normal]Users

[normal]are exposed 
[normal]to price volatility
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Carbon 
[normal]c
[normal]apture and 
[normal]s
[normal]torage remains a future option, but is 
[normal]currently 
[normal]too expensive for industry in the medium term.
[normal] 
[normal]A focus on energy efficiency is therefore vital to reduce emissions from industrial heat. The key 
[normal]efficiency 
[normal]technolog
[normal]y that is underexploited in UK industry remains combined heat and power
[normal],
[normal] which delivers a reductio
[normal]n in fuel use of up to 30%
[normal]. 
[normal]C
[normal]ombined heat and
[normal] power (CHP)
[normal] is sourced from gas, biomass, biogas and energy from waste.
[normal] [bold]As an energy 
[normal]efficiency technology, CHP rec
[normal]onciles major issues including
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]Please see the 
[normal]CHPA’s response to the 
[normal]Energy and Climate Change 
[normal]Committee’s Gas Generation Strategy inquiry
[normal] for 
[normal]more detail on CHP benefits.
[normal]DECC Heat Strategy [bold]makes the case[bold] for[bold] targeted [bold]support [bold]for new [bold]gas CHP [bold]DECC estimates an economic potential for more than 18 GW of CHP in the UK, almost triple current capacity. 
[normal]However, t
[normal]he Heat Strategy recognised that gas CHP
[normal] requires 
[normal]a 
[normal]policy mechanism 
[normal]for it to achieve its potential 
[normal]in decarbonising the 
[normal]UK energy system. 
[normal]T
[normal]he

[normal]commit
[normal]ment
[normal] to 
[normal]develo
[normal]p
[normal] 
[normal]a bespoke 
[normal]gas fired 
[normal]CHP policy to support 
[normal]CHP’s

[normal]closely 
[normal]with DECC on 
[normal]its
[normal] 
[normal]analysis 
[normal]of 
[normal]policy options
[normal] for its ‘bespoke policy’. 
[normal]Industry 
[normal]currently 
[normal]regards 
[normal]options to either incentivise
[normal] CHP 
[normal]for 
[normal]the energ
[normal]y savings it delivers, or a feed-
[normal]in tariff for efficiently generated 
[normal]CHP-produced electricity heat
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]having 
[normal]the 
[normal]greatest potential.
[normal] 
[normal]However, t[bold]he [bold]Government has not yet committed a dedicate[bold]d budget [bold]for [bold]its [bold]bespoke CHP policy[bold]. This lack of financial commitment [bold]must[bold] be addressed[bold] to ensure investor confidence is created[bold].[bold]E[bold]xisting [bold]gas [bold]CHP[bold] [bold]capacity[bold] [bold]faces challenges[bold]The 
[normal]proposed
[normal] 
[normal]CHP 
[normal]policy is 
[normal]specifically 
[normal]limited 
[normal]to supporting new CHP capacity, and does not recognise 
[normal]the Government’s £
[normal]11
[normal]0m
[normal] to £165m annual
[normal] tax rise
[normal] on CHP operators 
[normal]created 
[normal]by the 
[normal]early
[normal] removal of 
[normal]CHP’s LEC
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]At the time of the 
[normal]LECs 
[normal]decision, t
[normal]he Government 
[normal]indicated 
[normal]a solution would be found, but n
[normal]o action 
[normal]was taken 
[normal]to return this value to existing CHP operators
[normal]. 
[normal]The impact of this decision, which was implemented in April 2013, is now starting to hit British industry and undermine the competitiveness of 
[normal]CHP
[normal] sites
[normal]. 
[normal]Some CHP 
[normal]operators 
[normal]are reducing 
[normal]th
[normal]eir 
[normal]CHP 
[normal]generation
[normal] 
[normal]because, with the 
[normal]removal
[normal] of LECs and the addition of Carbon Price Support, it is no longer economical to 
[normal]operate
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Damaged investor confidence limits new[bold] CHP[bold] investment[bold]M
[normal]uch of the expected investment for new CHP installations will likely come from those companies which operate existing CHP. 
[normal]The CHPA is
[normal] aware of a number of companies who 
[normal]are hesitant 
[normal]to invest in CHP again because of the Government’s 
[normal]decision 
[normal]to remove 
[normal]LEC
[normal]s. For example, 
[normal]E.ON
[normal] has stated that
[normal] the removal of LECs has not given “much encouragement to take further investment”
[normal]. 
[normal]If investors attach higher risks to CHP projects, it will raise 
[normal]the cost to industry, business and taxpayers. 
[normal]Support investment [bold]and [bold]c[bold]ompetitiveness[bold] with Carbon [bold]P[bold]rice [bold]S[bold]upport relief [bold]T
[normal]o address the twin concerns of investor confidence and existing CHP operation, t
[normal]here is a need for DECC to urgently consider
[normal] returning the value lost to CHP operators from the removal of LECs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A simple, direct way to [bold]restore investor confidence [bold]is[bold] to give CHP plant relief [bold]from [bold]Carbon Price Support[bold],[bold] equal [bold]in [bold]value [bold]to [bold]the LECs, [bold]helping [bold]the Government to meet its[bold] [bold]original [bold]2011 commitment.[bold]Current support levels for renewable CHP-generated heat appears to be sufficient to bring forward new investment, but the Government 
[normal]has 
[normal]not introduce
[normal]d
[normal] a mechanism to allow investors to ‘lock in’ the value of the RHI payments when 
[normal]investments 
[normal]reach financi
[normal]al close.
[normal] 
[normal]Without 
[normal]such a 
[normal]mechanism, 
[normal]called 
[normal]Enhanced
[normal] 
[normal]Preliminary Accreditation
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]more than £1.5 billion in renewable CHP investments
[normal] are ‘very unlikely’ to come forward
[normal], according to a survey of CHPA members. 
[normal]The [bold]RHI [bold]needs an enhanced preliminary accreditat[bold]ion scheme as a matter of urgency if [bold]large-scale renewable investments[bold] are not to be [bold]put [bold]at [bold]risk. [bold]High-temperature heat, as used by industry
[normal] or power stations
[normal], can often be re-used for low-temperature demands, such as housing. 
[normal]Either on t
[normal]he same site or via a network, proce
[normal]sses requiring high temperature heat
[normal] can pass lower temperature ‘waste’ heat to a secondary user.
[normal]More than half of energy wasted in power generation[bold]Power generation wastes most of its heat through cooling towers, losing valuable efficiency and savings, and even the most efficient gas power plants 
[normal]waste 
[normal]half
[normal] of the energy they consume
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]CHPA analysis found p
[normal]ower stations waste more energy from their coo
[normal]ling towers than the total
[normal] UK
[normal] 
[normal]gas 
[normal]demand for heating
[normal].
[normal]Across Europe, 
[normal]the amount of waste heat 
[normal]from thermal power generation 
[normal]is
[normal] substantial. 
[normal]One academic study estimates 
[normal]waste heat from thermal generation 
[normal]add
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]up to 
[normal]nearly 2
[normal],000
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]Wh 
[normal]annually
[normal] (enough to 
[normal]mee
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]total 
[normal]UK 
[normal]heat demand two and a half 
[normal]times over)
[normal], with o
[normal]nly 
[normal]17% 
[normal]of 
[normal]that energy captured and 
[normal]recycled.
[normal] 
[normal]Challenge of[bold] link[bold]ing[bold] industrial heat to demand[bold]Despite improving the efficiency of industrial processes, reducing and reusing waste products, there is 
[normal]often low temperature heat (below 100°C) which has no further industrial application.
[normal] Total 
[normal]potential recoverable industrial 
[normal]heat 
[normal]in Europe 
[normal]is estimated at over 
[normal]580 
[normal]T
[normal]Wh 
[normal]annually
[normal], or about 80% of total UK heat demand
[normal].
[normal]In 
[normal]an
[normal] 
[normal]integrated 
[normal]energy system
[normal], this w
[normal]aste heat
[normal] from power production and industry
[normal] can be supplied to a community heat network for local homes, public and commercial buildings
[normal] at low cost and zero carbon, as occurs in Dunkirk
[normal], France
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Crucially, Dunkirk’s 
[normal]scheme design was 
[normal]championed by
[normal] 
[normal]cit
[normal]y 
[normal]leaders
[normal] and
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]ithout 
[normal]similar 
[normal]coordination, 
[normal]waste heat 
[normal]opportunities are lost
[normal]. 
[normal]For example, w
[normal]e are aware of UK 
[normal]cases where
[normal] 
[normal]housing developers install individual gas boilers rather t
[normal]han access
[normal] available waste heat from local industry.
[normal]R[bold]ecoverable heat [bold]assessment welcome, but coordination is key[bold]We welcome 
[normal]DECC
[normal]’s commitment to 
[normal]assess the technical and economic potential for re-use of recovered hea
[normal]t and to 
[normal]explore incentives for use 
[normal]of recoverable
[normal] heat. 
[normal]However, there are a number of institutional challen
[normal]ges to linking this heat to demand. Recovering waste heat requires partnerships which do not naturally or currently exist between industry, local authorities, and housing developers. 
[normal]The development of[bold] [bold]a waste heat incentive[bold], alongside increased coordinat[bold]ion,[bold] [bold]is [bold]necessary to exploit [bold]this potentially valuable resource[bold].[bold] [bold]More ambition needed for industrial steam networks policy[bold]Aggregating industrial energy users into 
[normal]clusters 
[normal]can allow steam 
[normal]networks to serve multiple sites
[normal],
[normal] increas
[normal]ing
[normal] efficiency and 
[normal]compet
[normal]itiveness
[normal]. 
[normal]Vitally, i
[normal]ndustrial clusters would allow future carbon capture and storage 
[normal](CCS) 
[normal]infrastructure to be concentrated at 
[normal]key
[normal] sites with costs shared among several users. These industrial clusters may also serve to attract new industry through reduc
[normal]ed energy costs
[normal].
[normal]T[bold]he Heat Strategy notes the industrial clustering opportunity, [bold]but [bold]unfortunately [bold]does not propose [bold]how to develop this policy further. [bold]H
[normal]ouseholders, businesses and public sector organisations 
[normal]need affordable heating, hot water and, increasingly, cooling
[normal] in commercial buildings
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Currently, individual gas-fired boilers predominate but this will need to evolve as 
[normal]villages, 
[normal]towns and cities decarbonise.
[normal]For lower density areas
[normal] 
[normal]individual heating so
[normal]lutions are more appropriate. The starting point should be considering 
[normal]building efficiency
[normal] and then
[normal] generation
[normal] technologies
[normal] including 
[normal]individual 
[normal]heat pumps
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]microCHP
[normal] (gas, LPG and eventually biogas) and wood boilers. 
[normal]Large public sector and commercial bui
[normal]ldings are increasingly turning to small-scale CHP, which allow them to save carbon and reduce waste. The number of CHP schemes below 10MW increased nearly 50% in the last four years, from 1,257 in 2008 to 1,860 in 2012.
[normal] An example is the
[normal] 1.1MW CHP plant 
[normal]installed in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital in June 2008 
[normal]which 
[normal]saves £650,000 
[normal]annually 
[normal]and reduces CO
[normal]2
[normal] emissions by 8,000 tonnes per year. 
[normal]High density urban areas are characterised by space restrictions and high land values
[normal]. Air quality and noise 
[normal]regulations limit the suitability of individual solutions such as heat pumps or biomass boilers.
[normal] 
[normal]H
[normal]igher densities, however, make community solutions servicing households, commercial and public sector buildings potentially more cost-effective than individua
[normal]l ones.
[normal]Whilst it is vital to seek to reduce heat demand, it is also critical to look at the efficiency of heat supply. 
[normal]Heat networks 
[normal]are pipe infrastructure that 
[normal]deliver heating or cooling
[normal],
[normal] generated communally
[normal],
[normal] to homes and b
[normal]usinesses, rather than generating heat 
[normal]at
[normal] 
[normal]individual properties
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]network
[normal] infrastructure facilitates gains in
[normal] economies of scale 
[normal]in heat generation
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]is 
[normal]efficient, flexible and easily upgradeable.
[normal]H
[normal]eat networks
[normal] can 
[normal]incorporate
[normal] 
[normal]a range of different 
[normal]he
[normal]at sources
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]including 
[normal]heat pumps, solar thermal, boilers (both renewable and fossil fuelled), CHP (both renewable and fossil fuelled), geothermal, waste heat or energy from waste – some 
[normal]options 
[normal]of which cannot be harnessed at an individual building level. 
[normal]Benefits of district heating to consumers[bold]T
[normal]he UK Committee on Climate Change 
[normal]recognises
[normal] that
[normal] district heating, using 
[normal]low carbon generation
[normal] or waste heat
[normal] in high density area
[normal]s
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]one of the most cost effective 
[normal]forms of 
[normal]carbon abatement
[normal], and
[normal] 
[normal]academic 
[normal]studies have
[normal] found 
[normal]that
[normal] 
[normal]in urban areas, 
[normal]district hea
[normal]ting is a cheaper solution 
[normal]than
[normal] 
[normal]other options
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This cost effectiveness means a lower cost for consumers and taxpayers. 
[normal]Whether serving public or private rented sector or 
[normal]owner
[normal]-
[normal]occupiers district heating
[normal] is steadily growing, in cities like London, Sheffield and Nottingham, saving carbon 
[normal]and
[normal] combat
[normal]ing
[normal] fuel poverty.
[normal] 
[normal]Heat networks 
[normal]also 
[normal]remove
[normal] the need for the property owner to maintain, and ultimately replace, 
[normal]a 
[normal]boiler.
[normal]Industry protecting consumers with proposals for independent regulation [bold]Recognising that heat customers should be afforded protection of comparable levels to those in the regulated gas and electricity sectors
[normal],
[normal] the CHPA, on behalf of the district heating i
[normal]ndustry, 
[normal]is
[normal] facilitating the development of an Independent Heat Customer Protection scheme for domestic and micro-business customers. 
[normal]A
[normal]n independent steering committee, with representatives from consumer groups, government and the district heating industry
[normal], 
[normal]are developing 
[normal]proposals
[normal] and after 
[normal]public consultation, 
[normal]aim to 
[normal]establish 
[normal]a
[normal] scheme in 2014.
[normal]The Government’s Heat Strategy ruled out regulation for heat networks and announced that Government “will seek to endorse an industry-led consumer protection schem
[normal]e”. 
[normal]DECC’s support will be a critical component of the Independent Heat Customer Protection scheme’s success.
[normal]Participation in the [bold]customer protection [bold]scheme should [bold]be a condition for local authorities[bold] [bold]to receive [bold]support from HNDU and other [bold]programmes[bold].[bold]Gov[bold]ernment recognises key role of local authorities[bold]Local authorities are central to the development of new district heating networks
[normal], acting
[normal] as brokers between key agencies, owning critical heat demand
[normal], and
[normal] through Planning and street works permissions. Deve
[normal]lopers are unlikely to risk initiating city-wid
[normal]e schemes, so local authorities’ 
[normal]long
[normal]-
[normal]term strategic view of heat, developing heat masterplans to facilitate interconnected networks
[normal], are important
[normal]. 
[normal]We 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]welcome the commitment to 
[normal]launch the Heat Netwo
[normal]rk Delivery Unit
[normal] (HNDU)
[normal], a 
[normal]‘
[normal]hand-
[normal]holding
[normal]’
[normal] service for local authorities.
[normal]However, we have outlined four other key measures which would help 
[normal]sti
[normal]mulate heat network development, both in the short term and long term, below.
[normal]Once the development stages of a project have been undertaken and a project is deemed viable, 
[normal]it may still be difficult 
[normal]to secure adequate funding at appropriate interest rates. Whilst the low but steady returns a heat network 
[normal]can deliver are well suited to 
[normal]low-risk 
[normal]investors such as pension fund
[normal]s
[normal], 
[normal]district heating schemes can be too small to meet 
[normal]these funds
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]minimum investment 
[normal]thresholds.
[normal] 
[normal]A national fund, [bold]as proposed under Allowable Solutions, would provide [bold]a [bold]professionally-managed concentration of capital[bold] at a[bold] suitable sca[bold]le for cost-effective, community-[bold]scale schemes such as [bold]heat networks[bold]. [bold]While district heating is eligible under two targeted householder carbon reduction schemes, it does not currently receive any bespoke support from Government. 
[normal]Government [bold]should consider ways to encourage renewable district heating, [bold]potentially including [bold]s[bold]upport[bold]ing[bold] renewable district heating under the renewable heat incentive after its 2014 review[bold].[bold]3. [bold]Use [bold]planning requirements [bold]to drive[bold] district heating investments[bold]Planning requirements are currently driving deployment of net
[normal]works in new build developments, 
[normal]local authorit
[normal]y-
[normal]initiated schemes in social housing blocks
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]city-centre developments 
[normal]encompassing a diverse mix of buildings.
[normal] 
[normal]Unfortunately these planning-led carbon emission investments are being undermined 
[normal]by 
[normal]unambitious
[normal] targets under Part L of the 2014 
[normal]Building Regulations
[normal] and the proposed removal of the Planning and Energy Act 2008.
[normal]It is important that these important [bold]planning [bold]levers are retained. [bold]4. Develop [bold]wider, longer-term [bold]vision[bold] [bold]for [bold]future heat networks[bold]The Gover
[normal]nment’s Heat Strategy recognised the role of district heating as a route to decarbonise heat where suitable heat density exists. 
[normal]DECC 
[normal]modelling estimates 
[normal]an economic 
[normal]potential 
[normal]of 
[normal]20% of domestic heating and hot water demand met by heat networks in 2030
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]District heat scheme investments are made on 
[normal]6
[normal]0-year timetables,
[normal] and
[normal] if the Government’s aim to significantly expand the amount of heat delivered through networks is
[normal] to be
[normal] 
[normal]realised
[normal], it will require a step change in deployment levels and more long-term thin
[normal]king.
