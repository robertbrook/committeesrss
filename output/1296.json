"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Janet Erskine (TIC 17)\nGreat \nChishill\n in So\nuth Cambridgeshire has only one week\nday bus service to Cambridge and \nAddenbrooke’s\n hospital (one outward in the morning and 2 inward in the evening). \n This bus is at the moment subsidised by \nCambs\n CC.  This subsidy is soon to be withdrawn.  \nCambridegeshire\n County Council has as yet not come up with an alternative service to take 6\nth\n formers to their colleges or workers from the village into work or to the Cambridge railway station.\nBecause the village is on the cusp of 3 counties (Cambrid\ng\neshire, Hertfordshire and Essex) \nt\nhere is an early morning bus service under contra\nc\nt to Hert\nford\ns\nhire\n which goes \nfrom Great \nChishill\n \nto Royston \nrailway\n station on school days only.\nGreat \nChishill\n cannot be left without an adequate public transport service to Cambridge.\n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
