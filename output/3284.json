"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Royal College of Surgeons (PEX 0003)&#xa0;\nIntroduction1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Royal College of Surgeons’ \n(RCS) \nprime responsibility is \nto maintain and improve\n surgical standards to deliver high quality patient care. \nIn t\nhis evidence to the Health Select Committee \nwe \ntherefore \nfocus \non our concerns about where financially-driven decisions are undermining patient safety and the quality of care. We also set out \nou\nr views on \nhow to \nmake\n cost-saving measures\n more transparent\n, and what the RCS is doing to support commissioners. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0; \nReports show the\n NHS is generally performing well on certain measurable indicators despite the financial pressures facing the health\n service.\n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe RCS is realistic about the financial challenges facing the health service\n and we recognise tough decisions will need to be made about what the NHS can fund\n. While our role is to promote good standards of care, our members are keen to work wit\nh commissioners and providers to save money \nwithout undermining patient care\n.\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nNevertheless, we are \nconcerned by\n factual and anecdotal evidence that commissioners are rationing clinical\nly\n necessary services. \nThis is likely to increase as commissioners and providers look to achieve short-term savings \nas budgets decrease and they exhaust \nnon-recurrent and contractual savings. \n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nData published exclusively on the RCS website shows wide variations across CCG areas i\nn the number of \nage and sex standardised \nprocedures being performed \nper 100,000 population \nfor some surgical interventions. For example, there is large variation in activ\nity volumes for tonsillectomies. This suggests \nsome commissioners \nand/or clinicians ma\ny be rationing services and others over-relying on surgical interventions. \n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe RCS and the surgical speciality associations are playing their part to reduce \nunexplained\n variations in services. We \nhave published, \nthrough a NICE accredited process\n and funde\nd by NHS England,\n surgical service commissioning guidance on our online commissioning centre\n which will cover \n28\n areas. Our guidance\n provides advice on best practice referral procedures\n and broader commissioning support\n which is designed to\n help commissio\nners to \nbetter understand local activity volumes\n and assess when surgical or non-surgical interventions may be more appropriate. \nThis \nhelps the NHS to seek value and \npatients t\no be treated in the right place. \n2.6.\n&#xa0; \nCCGs are required by law to publish their poli\ncies on providing medicines, surgical procedures and other techniques and interventions. We are therefore concerned that many CCGs have still not published this information. We would like the Government and NHS England to remind CCGs that this is a legal r\nequirement. \nThe RCS is also keen to \nsee more transparency about education and training budgets. \n2.7.\n&#xa0; \nRecent reports from the National Audit Office and Monitor have made clear that redesigning services is essential for extracting large-scale savings from the system. \nHowever, we caution against \nfinancially driven service changes\n. Clinically-driven changes c\nan save money, but the priority should be \non improving patient care. We must not sacrifice safety \nfor \nsavings\n. \n2.8.\n&#xa0; \nThe Committee should clarify how the Government intends to fund the £3.8bn integrated care pilots and where in the system this money will come f\nrom.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important to acknowledge that, as the National Audit Office has set out\n, the NHS is generally performing well on certain measureable indicators (such as referral to treatment waiting times) despite the unpreced\nented financial pressures facing the health service. \nSimilarly, the recent publication of surgical outcomes data shows the vast majority of surgeons in England are performing to high standards with few falling outside expected mortality rates. These achiev\nements should not be underestimated. \n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nDespite such successes, the College is aware of factual evidence and anecdotal information from our members which indicates \nsome\n NHS commissioners are rationing clinically necessary services. \nThere may also be misunder\nstanding from clinicians about when some surgical procedures are appropriate\n. \nRestrictions on access to surgery can affect the outcomes of surgery and patient safety, with evidence that patients are less mobile and suffer more pain if their operation is d\nelayed or denied. For example:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nThese findings are despite the fact that the Government has repeatedly said restrictions should be b\nased on clinical and not financial criteria:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nA 2012\n National Audit Office \n(NAO) \nreport\n notes that NHS savings so far have been primarily generated through \nshort-term \ncontractual levers \napplied by the Department\n rather than savings extracted through redesigning services\n or preventing ill-health\n. \nA more recent \n2013 NAO report \nalso \nhighlights that a number of trusts and commissioners in 2012-13 received non-recurrent financial support to \nal\nlow\n them to break-even.  \n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nAs \nMPs\n will have noted, the Government’s recent comprehensive spending review proposed shifting further funding from the NHS to social care after 2015. Sir David Nicholson, Chief Executive of NHS England, has indicated that this t\nransfer of funds would mean ‘radical changes’ to hospitals as ‘there is nowhere else to take it from’\n. The Nuffield Trust have also indicated that the funding gap facing the NHS could grow to as much as £44-54 billion in 2021/22. \n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nClearly the unprecedente\nd scale of the financial challenge facing both the NHS and social care \nwill\n create significant challenges \nthat\n will involve tough decisions about how best to use a decreasing budget. \nGiven the current reliance on \ncontractual and \nnon-recurrent savings\n – and\n the difficulty in redesigning services ahead of an election – there is a danger that further rationing of clinically necessary services and treatments will take place in the near future as commissioners look for other short-term ways of saving money. \n4.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe\n RCS strongly believes that p\natients’ access to treatment should be driven by need based on clinical assessment, and must not be compromised by financial pressure. Most methods to restrict access to surgery use unproven and arbitrary thresholds which unfai\nrly deny patients some of the most successful operations which vastly improve quality of life. Efficiency must not lead to shortcuts on quality and patient safety.\n4.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe RCS and the surgical specialty associations are also playing their part to work alongsid\ne commissioners to reduce \nunexplained\n variations in services. We have published – through a NICE accredited process – surgical service commissioning guidance on our online commissioning centre\n which has been funded by NHS England\n. This will eventually cov\ner approximately twenty eight surgical areas. Our guidance and broader commissioning support aim to improve the health and wellbeing of patients\n and\n reduce unexplained clinical variation of surgical services.\n4.6.\n&#xa0; \nThe guidance does not promote unnecessary surge\nry but looks to promote best \nclinical \npractice\n and help patients to be treated in the right setting\n – thus seeking good care for patients and value for the NHS\n. \nFor example, the guidance on tonsillectomy produced by the RCS and ENT UK only recommends \nreferral if there have been 7 or more clinically significant, adequately treated sore throats in the preceding 12 months or 5 or more episodes in each of the preceding two years, or 3 or more in each of the preceding three years.\n Similarly, the guidance on\n foreskin conditions highlights the number of unnecessary referrals to secondary care. \n4.7.\n&#xa0; \nExamples of how commissioners can directly save money are also provided. For instance, our guidance on rectal bleeding highlights \nclinically effective \ndiagnostic tools \nthat can save £390 per diagnosis. \n4.8.\n&#xa0; \nCommissioners should \ncontinue to \nreduce access to clinically unnecessary procedures. The ‘Clinical responses to the Downturn’\n report in 2010, which brought together NHS managers and clinicians, set out some areas for pot\nential savings. Many of our commissioning guidance documents also describe patient pathways where a non-surgical, rather than a surgical proc\nedure, may be more appropriate. This \naims to\n help commissioners to design appropriate care pathways and inform deci\nsions about \nwhen\n procedures may have low clinical value. \n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 requires clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and the NHS Commissioning Board ‘to have regard to’ NICE’s quality standards. These will set out aspirational but achievable areas for quality improvement in a defined care o\nr service \narea, including for obesity. However, they will not be mandatory and it remains to be seen how the legal duty to ‘have regard to’ will be interpreted locally. \n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nWe support the Department of Health’s decision to require CCGs to publish their level \nof compliance with NICE technology appraisals\n. However, it is important to note that NICE technology appraisals only cover a small proportion of the services provided by the NHS so rationing of clinically necessary services may still occur. For example, N\nICE guidance on bariatric surgery is not classified as a technology appraisal so there is therefore no legal requirement on the NHS to fund bariatric surgery despite its proven clinical effectiveness.\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nGovernment legislation\n also requires CCGs to publish p\nolicies on providing medicines, medical devices, diagnostic techniques, surgical procedures, or other therapeutic interventions. This should \nhelp to \nimprove transparency around rationing decisions. However, while this was a legal requirement from 1 April, \nwe are concerned that many CCGs have still not published this information. \nWe would like the Government and NHS England to remind CCGs that this is a legal requirement. \n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe \n2012 \nNAO report argued that ‘Service transformation is key to making future savings, but only limited action has been taken to date’. We agree that service transformation has been slow. To an extent, health service staff must take some responsibility for slow p\nrogress on reshaping services. Too many reconfigurations have failed to win the support of doctors, nurses or the public. Consultations have sometimes been a loaded tick-box exercise designed to secure token support, rather than engage in a genuine convers\nation with the public. We must ensure the public understands the substantial clinical benefits that can be achieved, while addressing natural concerns regarding the availability of emergency care and transportation issues. We also agree with the report’s r\necommendation that the DH and the NHS Commissioning Board should work with the NHS to reduce barriers to transforming services. \n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, as the College made clear in ‘\nR\neshaping surgical services\n’\n – published earlier this year – \nit is essential that any service change is based primarily on clinical evidence, not purely financial motives especially where that may lead to a reduction in available services. \nMany clinical\nly-driven service changes will improve outcomes and should help to reduce long-term costs.\n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nThere is a strong clinical case for reshaping some surgical services. Scientific and medical advancements mean it is no longer necessary or appropriate to deliver ce\nrtain operations or procedures in acute hospital settings. At the same time we know from the comprehensive evidence currently available that for many procedures and conditions concentrating specialist surgical services into fewer, larger centres of excelle\nnce can improve outcomes, and often save lives.  \n6.4.\n&#xa0; \nAs we get closer to an election in 2015 there is a danger that some service changes will be swept up in election campaigning. It is important for politicians to engage with the clinical case for reshaping s\nervices, as much as public concerns, and take leadership to support solutions that improve patient treatment and care. Once a decision has been made, it should be quickly implemented as delays will affect future planning of services. \n&#xa0;\nSeven-day services6.5.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe RCS strongly supports the need for seven-day services. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges will shortly be publishing a report from a taskforce, chaired by our President Professor Norman Williams, that will set out how to help achieve this. \n6.6.\n&#xa0; \nMany cons\nultant surgeons already work at weekends, and many come in to see patients on whom they have operated in the previous week, but they cannot work effectively if the back-up services, such as pharmacy and physiotherapy are not there.\n&#xa0;\n We also need access \nto \nradiology and pathology services so that decisions on a patient’s care can be made at the right point. When a doctor does a ward round, they rely on the whole team behind them, including administration support. That support also extends in to the community\n, where we need to integrate with social care services so a patient can return home to be cared for when they no longer require a hospital bed.\n6.7.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, all of this will cost the NHS money. While, in the long-term, some money might be saved through more ef\nficient use of facilities; better outcomes of care; and changes to the way services are provided, there are likely to be some short-term costs involved\n such as providing staff with time off in lieu\n. Increasingly, the NHS will need to have an honest convers\nation with the public about \nwhat should be funded and it may be necessary to reshape services to ensure seven-day services can be delivered.\n&#xa0;\nFunding integrated care6.8.\n&#xa0; \nEarlier in the year, health minister Norman Lamb MP invited local areas to bid for \na slice of the proposed £3.8 billion funding to run integrated care pilots. \n6.9.\n&#xa0; \nThere is broad agreement in the health sector that integration between and within services needs to improve. However, given there is no proposed extra cash available, it is unclea\nr where the funding for these pilots will come \nfrom\n and \nwe encourage the Health Select Committee to seek clarification from the Government. It would be unfortunate if a move designed to improve care for patients diverted money away from other \nclinically \nes\nsential care.\n&#xa0;\nTariff funding6.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are a number of examples of how financial incentives in the system can help to transform service\ns and patient care\n. For instance, hospitals are now financially rewarded for treating patients within 48 hours of a hip fracture which has helped to promulgate best practice. \n6.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitor recently announced that the 2014/15 tariff will better link payment for hip and knee repla\ncements to outcomes, and encourage participation in the national joint registry. We believe this approach could be applied to further surgical areas.\n \n6.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAcross London\n,\n commissioners have used CQUIN payments to incentivise the roll out of enhanced recovery pr\nogrammes. These aim to improve a patient’s recovery after surgery through better pre and post operation planning and assessment, reducing the physical stress of the operation, and improving pain relief during and after operations. \nThere is also some eviden\nce they reduce costs. For example, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust said they saved £44,000 over eleven months for providing better support for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery\n. \nGiven the wealth of evidence in support of enhanced recovery prog\nrammes, t\nhe RCS believes similar local programmes should be rolled out\n through financial incentives. The NHS has sometimes been slow to adopt new innovations, and incentives – when used appropriately – \nshould be used\n to \nhelp \nspread clinical best practice.\n&#xa0;\nMonitor’s proposals for orthopaedic and cardiac surgery6.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent report from Monitor ‘Closing the NHS funding gap’ set out a number of proposals to save money in the NHS. This included applying the ‘Aravind\n Eye Care’ approach in India to orthopaedic and cardiac surgery which Monitor claims would save the NHS £1.1 billion a year. \n6.14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhile we agree surgeons should look for ways to improve productivity and quality of care, this particular example needs to be trea\nted with some caution. \nThe Aravind model uses less experienced doctors with fewer senior consultants having a holistic overview of the patient’s care. There are also questions about the arrangements for pre and post-\noperative care. In many areas of surgery\n effective post-operative care is essential for improving the outcomes of the patient. \n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0; \nMuch of the debate on NHS funding has focused on the provision of services and treatments. However, \npolicy makers must\n not forget that t\nhe NHS also spends \na significant amount on the \neducation and training of current and future staff.\n Health Education England, for example, currently receives around £4.8bn a year. \n7.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe Council of Deans of Health has warned that any reductions are most likel\ny to impact on the continuing professional development (CPD) of healthcare staff. The NHS must guard against this: cutting back on training now will undermine the \nquality of current and future care.\n7.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe Government’s response to the Future Forum’s report on\n developing the NHS workforce (June 2011) said they would ‘explore ways to provide greater transparency about the overall level of investment across the [education and training] system, including for continuing professional development’. Two years on from \nthis report, it would be helpful if the Government clarified what steps they are taking to achieve this.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.rcseng.ac.uk/providers-commissioners/nscc\n \n \nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/report/2012-13-update-on-indicators-of-financial-sustainability-in-the-nhs/\n \n Lancet Vol 382; Numb 9898 (2013), pp.1121-1129.\n See \nhttp://rcs.methods.co.uk/pet.html\n (this data is \nfor 2012 which is the most recently available data). \n \nhttp://www.gponline.com/News/article/1136671/Exclusive-90-PCTs-rationing-care/\n \n \nhttp://www.patients-association.com/default.aspx?tabid=80&amp;Id=55\n \n \nHC Deb, 20 June 2012, c855\n \nThe letter is available here: \nhttp://www.hsj.co.uk/Journals/2011/10/10/k/d/d/Keogh-letter.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/di\ngitalasset/dh_131089.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/report/progress-in-making-nhs-efficiency-savings/\n \n \nhttp://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/nicholson-transferring-nhs-funds-to-social-care-would-mean-radical-changes-to-hospitals/5059401.article\n \n \nhttp://www.rcseng.ac.uk/providers-commissioners/nscc\n \n \nhttp://www.ao\nmrc.org.uk/publications/statements/doc_details/9319-clinical-responses-to-the-downturn.html\n \n \n \nhttp://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/12/ihw-creating-change/\n \n \nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2996/part/7/made\n \n \nhttp://www.rcseng.ac.uk/publications/docs/reshaping-surgical-se\nrvices/\n \n \nNHS Enhanced Recovery Partnership (April 2012) \nFulfilling the potential – A better journey for patients and a better deal for the NHs\n"
