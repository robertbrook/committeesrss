[[[Written submission from the ]]]

[[[Electrical Safety Council (BRC 54)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1&#xa0; The Electrical Safety Council (ESC) welcomes the opportunity to submit written evidence to the Communities and Local Government Committee inquiry into the Building Regulations certification of electrical installation and repairs in dwellings.&#xa0;2.1&#xa0; As the UK’s only charity committed to reducing electrical fires and electricity-related injuries at home and at work, our remit is to promote and encourage public awareness of issues surrounding electrical safety. We therefore have a particular interest in ensuring consumers know how and where to find a competent, qualified electrician. &#xa0;1.2&#xa0; Our submission focuses on:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;1.3&#xa0; We are also currently working with industry partners to address concerns expressed by the Committee over the existence of two registers, and to reach a solution that best meets the interest of consumers.&#xa0;1.4&#xa0; We wish to reaffirm our commitment to Part P, which is vitally important to regulate industry and ensure consumer safety. We have argued strongly in favour of Part P, and were supportive of the Committee’s recommendation that it should be retained.&#xa0;1.5&#xa0; We believe that the Competent Persons Scheme remains the best and most cost-effective way to maintain standards amongst electrical contractors.&#xa0;1.6&#xa0; However, we have seriously considered the written evidence of individual contractors who expressed concerns over the existing system, and have sought in this response to address the points they made. &#xa0;&#xa0;2.1&#xa0; Part P is a cost-effective way for government to ensure that electrical work in new and existing homes is carried out to a standard that minimises the health and safety risks associated with electric shocks and electrical fires. Its importance is likely to grow as the type of electrical work carried out in the home continues to change and broaden; supporting Government policies on renewables, electrical vehicles and smart meters by ensuring that electrical installation work in dwellings is carried out competently.&#xa0;2.2&#xa0; Competent Persons Schemes (CPS) licensed under Part P ensure that all registered electricians are trained to a high standard and assessed regularly. Though CPS membership is voluntary, over 40,000 firms had chosen to register as of February 2013.&#xa0;2.3&#xa0; Since the introduction of Part P, 27,000 more contractors carrying out electrical installation work in dwellings have been inspected on a periodic basis than was previously the case. The Part P Impact Assessment stated that the number of properly qualified individuals and firms represents a “strong proxy” for the quality of electrical work undertaken.&#xa0;2.4&#xa0; Consumers have benefited as a result. Whilst they may not be aware of Part P specifically, the existence of regulation has deterred ‘cowboys’ and provides consumers with confidence about the work they are paying for.&#xa0;2.5&#xa0; In addition, Part P prevents approximately 2.6 fatalities and 421 injuries per year due to electric shock, and 2.8 fatalities, 10 serious injuries and 77 minor injuries due to electrical fires.&#xa0;2.6&#xa0; Respondents to the Government’s recent consultation supported the view that Part P has had a positive impact on the quality of electrical installation work; of those who had a view, 64% stated that the standard had improved, including 96% of the building control bodies that gave an opinion. &#xa0;2.7&#xa0; A 2011 survey of nearly 4,000 electricians, registered across the three main Part P Competent Persons Schemes, found that 53% believed the standard of electrical work had improved as a result of the implementation of Part P. This outcome was supported by a separate but less wide-ranging study commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government and conducted by built asset consultancy EC Harris . &#xa0;2.8&#xa0; Crucially, through Certsure, consumers now have a way to follow up any deficient work and a guarantee that applies to the work even if the company undertaking the work has ceased to exist. &#xa0;2.9&#xa0; One submission made to the Committee and published on 9 October questioned the ESC’s use of statistical data in our original evidence from February 2012, stating we had claimed there had been a drop in fires when in fact there had been an increase since Part P came into force. This misrepresents what ESC stated. From 2004-2008, there was a 17.5% drop in the combined number of fault fires associated with two categories of data that we believed to be most relevant to the operation of Part P, ‘Mains Wiring: After Meter’ and ‘Mains Wiring: Before Meter’ (Relevant data tables, as provided to ESC by the Department for Communities and Local Government, are set out in appendix 1). &#xa0;2.10&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since this time, the category used to record such fires has been broadened to ‘Electricity supply - Wiring, cabling, plugs’. This effectively collates three former categories into one, making a direct comparison – as cited by the respondent in order to prove ESC’s error – impossible. However, as the data used to inform the submission had not at the time of writing been made available, we have been unable to fully corroborate this view.&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1&#xa0; Whilst there is significant evidence of the value of Part P, its impact could be greater and more needs to be done to raise consumer awareness – which according to our latest poll is 14%. We welcomed the Committee’s earlier recommendations to Government and are pleased that the issue again features in this inquiry. &#xa0;3.2&#xa0; Changing consumer behaviour and raising awareness of important safety issues takes a long time and substantial investment. As the industry’s only consumer-focused organisation, the ESC is committed to promoting and encouraging public awareness of issues surrounding electrical safety. Over the last 7 years we have invested £7.89 million in consumer awareness campaigns and have an important role to play in ensuring that consumers know how and where to find a competent, qualified electrician.&#xa0;3.3&#xa0; The ESC spent £1.42 million on consumer awareness campaigns focussing on electrical safety in 2012/13. By the end of 2013/14 the ESC will have spent a further £978,000 on similar consumer campaigns.&#xa0;3.4&#xa0; Over the last 5 years, the ESC has provided over £1million to community groups across the UK in direct grants to help raise awareness of electrical safety and improve electrical installations in vulnerable people’s homes.&#xa0;3.5&#xa0; In addition to regular annual campaigns to boost awareness of the importance of electrical safety, the ESC has over the last year funded four campaigns focussed on Part P and the importance of using a competent, qualified electrician. Audience research shows that these consumer campaigns have been seen or heard by consumers 204.5 million times this year. A full breakdown of audience reach for each of these campaigns is below:&#xa0;February campaign–  32 millionJune campaign–  127 millionAugust campaign –  40 millionNovember campaign – 5.5 million3.6&#xa0; Consumers will further benefit from the new conditions of license for competent person scheme operators, which will require them to spend a defined amount on public awareness activities. This condition will be effective from June 2014.&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1&#xa0; We believe the system is robust and there is significant evidence to prove this, which we have set out below. &#xa0;4.2&#xa0; We have also seriously considered the written evidence of individual contractors who expressed concerns over the existing system, and have asked the relevant Competent Persons Schemes to address the detail within their submissions.  Our submission provides a brief overview of the overall system. &#xa0;4.3&#xa0; In its report into Building Regulations applying to electrical and gas installation and repairs in dwellings (March 2012), the Committee described the “stringent criteria” which must be met by organisations wishing to establish a Competent Persons Scheme. Those organisations must set an appropriately high standard of competence for members, and commit to testing members to that standard. &#xa0;4.4&#xa0; In turn, prospective electrical contractors must undertake an accreditation process in order to become members of a Competent Persons Scheme. Contractors must complete a minimum of 224 guided learning hours in order to gain the qualifications necessary to be considered for accreditation.&#xa0;4.5&#xa0; A further advantage to the current system is the focus on improving standards year-on-year. We are pleased that the Minimal Technical Competence (MTC) to apply for Part P certification has been gradually raised since the introduction of the regulations in 2005. As of April 2013, those wishing to register with a Scheme must demonstrate competence equivalent to a Level 3 qualification. &#xa0;4.6&#xa0; Nor is accreditation guaranteed. The average first time pass rate of the accreditation process is 81.4%.&#xa0;4.7&#xa0; Once qualified, electrical contractors are subject to regular assessment as members of the Competent Persons Scheme. Contractors are inspected at least once a year by an appointed supervisor who records a range of indicators, including the quality of their workmanship and the state of their equipment.&#xa0;4.8&#xa0; The Select Committee’s original report concluded that an “expected benefit” of this system of stringent accreditation and regular assessment had would be higher quality workmanship, and a fall in the number of installations by poorly qualified contractors.&#xa0;4.9&#xa0; The process of assessment is under constant review, with improvements made as necessary. For example, as a result of the Part P Impact Assessment, the principle of “risk-based inspection” has been introduced.  This means, for example, that members with poor customer complaints records can be inspected more often, and those with exemplary records less.  &#xa0;&#xa0;5.1&#xa0; The Committee has made clear its reservations over the existence of two registers of electrical contractors and the potential for confusion amongst consumers. Reasons for the development of two registers were discussed at length in the course of oral evidence to the Committee on 2nd September 2013. &#xa0;5.2&#xa0; However, we recognise the Committee’s concerns and in order to address them have held meetings&#xa0;with Certsure and NAPIT, agreeing to seek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electrician to carry out work in their home.&#xa0;5.3&#xa0; It is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P Scheme Operators in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline (June 2014), and would lead to the removal from the market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the Electrical Safety Register).&#xa0; We, along with the above mentioned organisations, have written to the Parliamentary under Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard.&#xa0;5.4&#xa0; We are keen to work closely with both the Committee and the Department on the development of a new register, to ensure that it meets the objectives of policy makers, and will keep all parties informed of on-going developments.&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1&#xa0; In light of the Committee’s on-going inquiry focused on the building regulations, the ESC would like to raise its concern regarding proposals for third party inspection and testing. We believe that, by allowing professional electricians the opportunity to sign off the work of their peers, the new scheme undermines the self-certification principle of Part P and thus could lead to significant numbers of electricians de-registering in favour of having their work signed off by others. If this scheme does lead to mass deregistration, it would also mean a fall-back in the number of electricians being inspected and tested every year and resultant safety implications.&#xa0;6.2&#xa0; In order to avoid the outcome above, we recommend that third party inspections exclude work carried out by means of trade. This mirrors requirements for gas installations and would, in our view, mean that the system does not have the unintended consequence of encouraging electricians to renege on their Competent Person Scheme membership. &#xa0;&#xa0;7.1&#xa0; The ESC is a UK-wide charity committed to reducing electrical fires and electricity-related injuries at home and at work.&#xa0;7.2&#xa0; Every year over 20,000 domestic fires are caused by faults and misuse of electrical appliances and installations throughout Great Britain. A further 2.5 million UK adults experience a mains voltage electric shock each year and around 70 people die from electrical accidents in the home.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; Building Regulations Part P, Electrical Safety in Dwellings, impact assessment, Dec 2012, p5 Ibid, p18, para 67 EC Harris report for DCLG, February 2011 OfQual - EAL Level 3 Certificate In Installing, Testing and Ensuring Compliance of Electrical Installations in Dwellings - http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Qualification/Details/600_7695_1 Building Regulations applying to electrical and gas installation and repairs in dwellings, p20
