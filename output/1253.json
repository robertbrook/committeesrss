"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Siraj Ahmed Shaik (WSC005)Executive Summary1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis evidence has a primary focus on computer science, which is an important STEM subject and \nunderpins a large majority of professional roles in the \nInformation Technology (\nIT\n) \nindustry both in private and public sectors. \n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSome of the key messages included in this evidence are summarised as follows\nAll of the above issues are systematically addressed in dedicated sections \nbelow. This is followed by \na set of \nbrief \nrecommendations\n.\nThe final item in this document is \na list o\nf references\n that have been \nconsulted \nfor compiling this \ndocument. \nThis \nis important as it serves as a set of surveys, scientific observations an\nd studies, and research contributions, \nthat form the basis of a set of coherent views presented in this document. \n \nAuthor (and Declaration of Interest)3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis evidence is submitted in \npersonal capacity by Dr. Siraj Ahmed Shaikh, who is a Reader in the Department of Computing at the Faculty of Engineering and Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, UK. He has been actively involved in teaching and research of computer science for over \n12 years. He holds a PhD in Computer Science and a MA in Higher and Professional Education. \nHe is a Chartered Scientist (Member of the Science Council) and a Chartered Fellow of the BCS-The Chartered Institute of IT. \n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs part of his day-to-day professional\n activities, he works with female colleagues (both senior and junior in rank), and female students (in class room and one-to-one supervisory capacity).\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe set of views and opinions presented in this document \nbelong solely to the \nauthor and do not represen\nt \nthe views of \nCoventry University.\nThe Image Problem6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom a philosophical perspective, computer science has been criticised from a feminist perspective and called ‘another masculine science’. The underlying epistemology – the nature of knowledge – for \nthe subject has been shown to be ‘masculinist’ and ‘decontextualised from its objects of study’, attributed with abstraction, reductionism, sacredness and value-freeness. Such \ncharacterisations reinforce traditional \nstereotype of science\n as an exclusive \ndo\nmain of male scientists.\n \n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \neducation process does not \nhelp the image problem either. \nThe subject is typically aligned with mathematics and e\nngineering, carrying forward a\n ‘pure’ and ‘masculine’ image as students progress through school and university education. \nAt school, there is some evidence to suggest that there is a \ngeneral lack of enjoyment of computer use by girls, not helped by a \nlack of well-trained I\nT teachers an\nd staff. \n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA contributing factor is also to do with the associated professional culture\n, which in the case of \ncomputer science \nis seen as highly demanding, male dominated, individually isolating, ‘nerdy’ and ‘boring’\n. \nThis \ndo\nes\n not help school girls’ percep\ntion of \nthe \nIT\n \nprofession \nwho are encouraged to make early career choices in an increasingly competitive world. \nConfidence and Self-Esteem9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is \nevidence of lack of self-belief and confidence \nin\n female students in their ability to perform \nand progress \nin computer science as a subject. \nSurveys show\n this gap between perceived and actual ability \nof female students despite being successful in the discipline. \nThe findings include\n \nthat \nfemale students are less likely to correct a professor in cla\nss than their\n male counterparts\n,\n and \na \nlack of self-confidence in software programming abilities in female students\n, which lies at the heart of many high-paid\n IT jobs.\n10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA lack of an adequate number of women is in itself an excluding factor for women from a subject. A critical mass is necessary for a particular subgroup to influence the group it belongs to in any way. In order for women to constructively participate in the\n discourse and reshape gender relations in classrooms, a critical mass of women is necessary among men. Studies have shown, while examining various \nuniversity \ndepartmental characteristics that affect retention of female students, computer science departmen\nts with a higher number of female students are more likely to retain them\n,\n as gender-related perceptions and tensions \nare less likely to be prevalent. \n \nLack of Role Models11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn aspect of the critical mass factor, which serves as both a cause and a consequen\nce of it, is the lack of mentoring and female role models in \ncomputer science\n. The media coverage of the IT industry moguls, like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs (along with so many others – mostly men), projects an image of a male-dominated profession where wom\nen are either not present at all or their achievements have not been significant. A lack of female role models propagates the masculine image further, one where only geeky, workaholic men, with no family or social responsibilities\n and,\n with an unethical ‘h\nackers’ mentality can survive\n.\n \n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe role model process ought to start early for girls, with teachers at schools to act as examples of women working with computers. \nSurveys on\n \ngender and computer use in schools\n \nfind a correlation between the number of women\n teachers at school and the gender equality in terms of computer use. \n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe presence of female \nacademic staff \nin universities \nis one important source of mentoring. Fresh new students look up to their lecturers and professors for inspiration and future guida\nnce. What better example of successful women in \ncomputer science \ncan be served t\no female students than their \ntutors? \nEvidence suggests that \nthis is particularly important as a positive higher education environment \nserves to inspire \nwomen\n,\n and \npositive fee\ndback is more important to them\n than their male counterparts\n.\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\nome other evidence suggests\n that university \ndepartments with \nless \nfemale \nacademics \nlost female student\ns at high rates relative to men\n. \nRecent figures show that \nin the UK \nonly one in 20 computin\ng professors, one in eight computing researchers and one in four PhD students are female\n.\n \nReversing Trends15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nomputer science\n as a discipline is unique, both in its history, as young but fast developing and, in its nature as problem-solving, algorithmic and technology-oriented. In recent years, its boundaries have expanded to overlap and adjoin a number of other disciplines, inc\nluding business and management (information systems), philosophy and psychology (human computer interaction and artificial intelligence), physiology (genetic algorithms and neural networks), digital art and graphics (multimedia and entertainment) and lingu\nistics, which have been traditionally outside the realm of science. It is important to observe this \nso that it offers a unique proposition for sustaining and welcoming many more women in IT-related careers, as \nopposed to traditional sciences and many other\n STEM subjects\n.\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe IT \nindustry more re\ncently has launched some encouraging initiatives \nwhich offer hope and \na bright future for a lot of women entering IT-related careers. The notable of these initiatives include The Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship\n, Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, \nAthena SWAN (an initiative of the Equality Change Unit (ECU) and UK Research Councils (UKRC)) \nand BCSWomen (a specialist group of the British Computer Society dedicated to women members). \nRecommendations17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nComputer Science, along with \nthe \nwider \nrange of \nSTEM subjects,\n \nneed\ns\n an image makeover. \nA \ncoordinated \nnational effort is needed to \naddress \nthis and raise the profile of STEM as \nprogressive and welcoming careers \nfor women.\n \nThis has to be \nrealised thro\nugh a\n mix of \ntop-down \nand bottom-up policy \ninitiatives\n, and should be a medium- to long-term goal. \nNo quick fixes would serve to be effective. \n \n \n \n18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe early years, through school and university education, are critical \nif we\n are to allow women to raise confidenc\ne and self-esteem.\n \nA variety of areas need particular attention including \nappropriate \ntraining\n of school staff in STEM subjects, \nfemale\n mentoring\n,\n and \nafter-school \nresources\n,\n to overcome cultural and confidence issues for female students. \n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLarge industry players, such as Google, IBM, Intel and \nMicrosoft\n,\n \nare beginning to play a positive role for women scientists in the IT sector. \nThe go\nvernment and the third-sector \nneed to work with \nthem to \naddress this jointly, through more scholarships and\n internships,\n better recognition of achievement of women in STEM sectors, \ndedicated professional networking opportunities, \nand more family-friendly \nworking policies \nto allow for a \nbetter \nwork-life balance.\n \nReferencesAAUW (2000) American Association of Un\niversity Women, Tech-savvy: Educating girls in the \n              \nnew computer age 2000
