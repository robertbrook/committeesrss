[normal]We wish to comment on the Government's intention in clause 21 of the Draft Deregulation Bill to remove the power of ministers to require local authorities in England to prepare local housing strategies under Section 87 of the Local Government Act 2003 (including the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers).

[normal]In closing, let me also mention that during my visit I have also received multiple testimonies on the shortage of sufficient, adequate and safe sites for Gypsy and Traveller communities across the United Kingdom, many of whom feel this is part of the stigma and discrimination they regularly face from Governments and society as a whole.  
[normal]Despite multiple efforts and policies put in place to address this situation, it is fair to say that leaving local authorities to make their own decision with no accountability and national process to reconcile the Gypsy and Traveller settled communities remains a source of concern.[bold]
