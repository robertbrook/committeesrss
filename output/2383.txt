[[[About CRAE]]]&#xa0;1. The Children’s Rights Alliance for England (CRAE) seeks the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in England. Our vision is of a society where the human rights of all children are recognised and realised. CRAE protects the human rights of children by lobbying government and others who hold power, by bringing or supporting test cases and by using national, regional and international human rights mechanisms. We provide legal information, raise awareness of children’s human rights, and undertake research about children’s access to their rights. We mobilise others, including children and young people, to take action to promote and protect children’s human rights. Each year we publish a review of the state of children’s rights in England. &#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2. In 2010 the Government made a commitment to give due consideration to the United Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) when making new law and policy. The Government must comply with this commitment when shaping its policy in respect of legal aid. Any reform to legal aid must ensure that it respects, protects and fulfils children’s rights. CRAE is concerned that the Government’s proposals for the reform of legal aid show a serious disregard for children’s rights.&#xa0;3. Legal aid is central to the rule of law – it ensures accountability in the event that public bodies breach the law, including those laws which protect children’s rights, by allowing people to complain to the courts. Legal aid also makes the law effective outside of the court room. It makes it a realistic possibility that people can bring a case when their rights are breached – this possibility encourages public bodies to comply with the law. It is also an essential element of a fair justice system, ensuring that it is not only the rich and powerful who can access the courts by providing a vital safety net for those who cannot afford to pay for legal assistance. Legal aid is an important aspect of the right to a fair trial and the right to a remedy. &#xa0;4. Children’s rights, as enshrined in the law, are meaningless unless children can take action when their rights are violated. An effective system of legal aid is crucial to ensuring that children are able to access the court to challenge breaches of their rights. This is recognised by the international human rights bodies. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has said:For rights to have meaning, effective remedies must be available to redress violations.  This requirement is implicit in the [UNCRC] and consistently referred to in the other six major international human rights treaties.  Children’s special and dependent status creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights.  So States need to give particular attention to ensuring that there are effective, child-sensitive procedures available to children and their representatives.  These should include … access to independent complaints procedures and to the courts with necessary legal and other assistance. &#xa0;5. The guidelines adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe relating to child-friendly justice are intended to allow children to effectively exercise their rights or act upon breach of their rights. They provide that:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6. Without appropriate legal aid, children will be left without a remedy when decisions are made which breach their rights and they do not have the independent means to fund a legal challenge. Even those children with strong cases will be unable to pursue them, placing justice beyond the reach of many children, with alarming gaps in protection.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the ]]]

[[[UK]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]7. CRAE does not agree with the introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants. Children may have strong cases in relation to crucial aspects of their human rights, such as community care, housing and private family law cases, but be unable to meet the residency test. For example, unrecognised trafficked children who do not claim asylum, the children of undocumented migrants, and British children born abroad may all be unable to bring proceedings when their rights are breached if this proposal is implemented. Furthermore, the test is likely to have a discriminatory impact on certain groups of children, in breach of children’s right to access justice without discrimination. There must be access to justice and equality before the law for all. The residence test clearly undermines both of these principles.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[The proposed restriction on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]8. CRAE does not agree with the proposal to cut legal aid for treatment cases. All aspects of prison law should remain within the scope of legal aid for children.9. The UNCRC is clear that those children who are placed in custody do not lose their fundamental rights, and must continue to enjoy these to the full extent compatible with their deprivation of liberty. This means that children in custody should enjoy all of their rights, including adequate food, clothes, health care, education, family contact, religion and belief, play, privacy and protection from violence and abuse. Yet CRAE’s work has shown that children in custody are highly vulnerable to treatment which breaches their rights whilst in prison. It is vital that children should have access to legal representation to challenge any such abuses. &#xa0;10. The Government’s proposals are based on the notion that internal complaints procedures provide an adequate means of redress in respect of treatment issues. However, such procedures have been shown to be inadequate to address children’s rights abuses in the past. In a judicial review brought by CRAE the court found that if a child had complained in relation to unlawful restraint ‘he would have been met with the riposte that it was perfectly permissible’. Without recourse to a court, internal complaints mechanisms do not secure access to justice for children. The proposed changes to the scope of legal aid in relation to prison matters will substantially reduce the prospect of external legal scrutiny and accordingly the authorities’ accountability for abuses of children’s rights whilst in prison.

[[[The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed ]]]&#xa0;11. CRAE does not agree with this proposal. As the Ministry of Justice itself recognised in its earlier consultation on legal aid:&#xa0;In our view, proceedings where the litigant is seeking to hold the state to account by judicial review are important, because these cases are the means to which individual citizens can seek to check the exercise of executive power by appeal to the judiciary. These proceedings therefore represent a crucial way of ensuring that state power is exercised responsibly.12. Judicial review is a vital legal safeguard against an unlawful or unreasonable decision, act or omission by a public body. Not only is it central to promoting good decision-making by public bodies by making them accountable to the public but it also provides an important means by which individuals can hold the state to account and seek redress in the event that a public body does act unlawfully or in breach of a child’s fundamental rights. As previously highlighted by the Children’s Commissioner, judicial review proceedings have been widely used to uphold children’s rights in nearly every area covered by the UNCRC.&#xa0;13. The proposals will undermine the ability of legal representatives to offer legal advice in respect of judicial review, by requiring them to bear the risk that the case may be unsuccessful. This will undermine access to justice for children where their rights have been breached. &#xa0;

[[[The proposal that legal aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]14. CRAE does not agree with this proposal. The proposals could encourage a risk-averse approach by legal providers that would undermine access to justice for children where their rights have been breached.&#xa0;15. It is often difficult to establish at the outset whether a case is weak or strong. An assessment of a child’s case as borderline means that there remains a significant chance that there will be a successful outcome.  It does not mean that the case is without merit. It simply may not be possible to assess the merits of the case accurately because, for example, of disputed law or facts. Children in such cases should not be denied access to justice.&#xa0;16. Appropriate legal representation will be particularly important in securing access to justice for children in such borderline cases which, by definition, are not clear cut. Without representation, there is a serious risk that borderline cases will fail at first instance.  &#xa0;17. Borderline cases are often those which allow the law to develop, and as such are of importance to the individual child concerned and to the wider public interest. It is crucial that such cases receive the necessary funding to allow important points of law to be tested. &#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0; The contents of this response do not necessarily reflect the view of all CRAE’s members.
