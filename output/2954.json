"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Soil AssociationOverviewOur response covers \none\n key area\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Introduction &#xa0;Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue. This response is made on behalf of the Soil Association and produced by its policy department.  The Soil Association is\n the UK's leading membership charity campaigning for healthy, humane and sustainable food, farming and land use\n, with over 20,000 members.\n  \nThe Soil Association also owns an accredited organic certification company with around 4,000 licensees. \n&#xa0;\nWe would be happy to discuss these issues in an oral evidence session with the Committee.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Lowest Organic farming support in the EU&#xa0;\n1. \nWe \nare urging \nDefra\n to ensure \nthat \nin future \norganic maintenance payments should be at least in line with \nthe average of \nth\nose\n paid in the rest of the EU 27.\n It \nis \nwrong \nthat the payment rates being received by UK farmers are the lowest in the EU\n. Research, \ncommissioned by DG \nAgri\n (European Commission) \nconfirms this (Sanders 2012).\n See table below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2\n.\n \nThis confirms \nprevious \nSoil Association research\n which showed that the UK Government is failing to support British organic farmers. \nOther governments across the EU recognise that organic farmers deserve support because their farming methods deliver multiple benefits to the environment and society; they also recognise organic practices hold the key to \ndeveloping more \nsustainable farming system\ns\n.\n3\n.\n \nThe global production of organic food is set to grow substantially, with the organic market frequently cited as one of the most significant growth markets in the food industry.\n4\n.\n \nThis potential is demonstrated in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany and Switzerland\n,\n where sales of organic food continued to grow despite the recession. In the UK, sales fell, although they are now recovering. A range of factors may explain the recent decline of the UK organic market compared to our European neighbours, but the passive role of successive UK governments in supporting organic food and farming is one of the reasons commonly given. \nDespite the unique decline in organic sales in the UK, not found in any other major organic market in the world, sales have now started to recover. \n5. Market data shows that during the recession in the UK, the 30% of organic retail food sales that do not go through supermarkets generally did not suffer any decline. So sales \nin organic farm shops and organic box schemes remain steady or even increased slightly during the recession, and online sales of organic food have been growing at about 30% per annum. However, the fall in sales of own label (not branded) organic food in the largest supermarkets were enough to depress the figures for whole market, and these sales are now recovering. See graph below.\n6\n.\n \nWe have found that most European countries have acted confidently to normalise and champion organic food and farming as a pioneering, sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce food. \n This means that our nearest EU neighbours will be well-placed to export organic food to the UK as our market grows, unless UK production grows to meet the increased demand.  \nFor English organic farmers to receive such significantly lower payments in return for public goods delivered by the organic system is clearly unfair. \n7. A further significant danger in CAP Reform is that the English scheme, which until now has had the merit of being open to all organic farmers without further bureaucratic requirements, may become subject to additional rules and regulations, requiring significant involvement in officials in vetting applications. We believe that once a farmer has taken the significant financial and management decision to convert to organic, has applied for and succeeded in obtaining organic certification, and has committed to this significant change in their farming system, they should then automatically qualify for support from the Pillar 2 of CAP.  This support is designed to compensate farmers for at least some of the additional costs in the organic system which delivers significant public benefits, in the form of lower diffuse pollution, higher animal welfare, more biodiversity, more jobs, greater soil carbon sequestration and soil conservation, lower flooding risks and greater resilience to drought. Decisions by farmers should not then be second guessed by other bureaucratic requirements, which will simply risk distorting the organic market.\n16 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nUse and efficiency of public support measures addressing organic farming’ commissioned and published by DG \nAgri\n (European Commission).
