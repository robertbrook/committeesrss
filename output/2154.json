"&#xa0;\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland – Written evidence&#xa0;\nPartial authorisation of insolvency practitioners\nRemoval of power of Secretary of State to authorise individual insolvency practitioners\nSchedule 5, part 5 - Basic bank accounts for undischarged bankrupts\nAdditional insolvency provisions – Schedule 5\nAnswers to specific questions\n3.\n              \nAre the changes proposed in the draft Bill evidence based and have any risks associated with the changes been taken adequately into account?\nWe do not consider that the proposal to introduce a partial licensing regime for IPs (Clause 9), is evidenced based and we are not aware of any evidence that the changes proposed will result in achieving the Government’s objective of increased competition within the sector. \nWe do not believe the proposed partial licences will be widely taken up by practitioners as an overwhelming majority of the profession practise in both corporate and personal insolvency and as such would not wish to be partially licenced. \nIn addition, the Bill prevents partial licence holders from acting in relation to partnerships. This is not consistent with the insolvency law of partnerships in Scotland which are dealt with under personal insolvency legislation. \nWe are concerned that the move to introduce a partial licensing regime has a number of risks for the provision of appropriate insolvency advice. We believe that it is necessary to have knowledge of insolvency legislation in its entirety in order to identify possible risks and solutions when providing advice. Insolvency is already a narrow specialism and reducing it further could impact on the quality of advice provided to individuals and companies. This could also result in a reputational impact on the profession and it is imperative that all stakeholders in insolvency situations \nhave confidence in the profession to deliver quality advice and services which is maintained through appropriate qualifications and regulation.\nICAS supports the insolvency provisions contained within Schedule 5 of the draft Bill and believe they will reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and individuals. \nHowever, as discussed in our response, we have serious concerns about Clause 9, which \nproposes changes to the authorisation of IPs. There is no evidence to suggest that these changes will result in increased competition within the sector. The proposed partial licencing regime will only add complexity to a licensing regime that currently works well. The changes would therefore make the licencing regime unnecessarily complex, with little tangible benefit. We would therefore urge the Government not to introduce these measures.\n              \n&#xa0;\nThe changes contained within Schedule 5 should generally benefit businesses. The proposals will make the conduct of insolvency processes more efficient, which in turn should see an improved return to creditors, many of whom are businesses.\n&#xa0;\nThe proposed changes to Clause 9 may have a disproportionate impact on smaller insolvency firms or sole practitioners. The changes may also risk reducing the quality of advice given to individuals in debt and struggling businesses.\n&#xa0;We are not aware of any cost-benefit analysis or wider impact assessment for the changes proposed in Clause 9 of the draft Bill having been carried out.\n&#xa0;This power would allow the repeal of legislation without parliamentary scrutiny. We are concerned that without adequate public consultation measures legislative changes which adversely impact on insolvency may be overlooked by legislators. A broad range of legislation impacts upon insolvency matters and much of this is not immediately apparent when changes to legislation are proposed. There is therefore a real risk that potentially detrimental changes may slip through unnoticed. \n&#xa0;\n23. What are the consequences of the draft Bill for the devolved administrations?\n&#xa0;\n              \nClause 9 will specifically impact on the devolved administration in Scotland. As highlighted in comments above, the insolvency law in relation to partnerships in Scotland is dealt with under personal insolvency which is a devolved matter. The \nproposals to allow partial licencing do not sit comfortably with the legislative position in Scotland in relation to this area. While we do not support partial licencing, should this proposed amendment be pursued then significant amendment to the proposals will be required to ensure an appropriate approach is taken in relation to the Scottish legislative provisions.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPart 2 – administrationThe appointment of administrators\nWe support the provision to enable a company or directors to appoint an administrator despite the presentation of a winding-up petition, if the petition was presented after a notice of intention to appoint an administrator was filed. \nAdministration is a key business rescue tool and this move, which aims to facilitate administration, is likely to assist with this resulting in saving businesses and jobs.\nNotice of intention to appoint an administrator \nThe Bill proposes to remove the present requirement to give notice of intention to appoint an administrator to persons who are not themselves entitled to appoint an administrative receiver or administrator in certain circumstances.\nWe support this move as it appears to support the original intention of the legislation of informing only those parties who have the power to appoint an administrator themselves of the directors’ intention to appoint.\nThe release of an administrator\nThere are regular cases in which there are insufficient assets to make a return to unsecured creditors and as a result the unsecured creditors will have no financial interest in the administration. Current legislation requires that when an administrator wishes to obtain his release as office-holder a resolution of all of the creditors is required in addition to a resolution of all of the secured creditors. This situation gives rise to unnecessary creditors’ meetings, physical or held by correspondence, arranged with the sole purpose of giving the administrator their release.\nThe proposed changes in Schedule 5, part 2, will clarify the situation and make clear that where unsecured creditors have no interest in the administration, by virtue of the fact they will not receive a dividend, they are not involved in the administrator’s release and that the release can be granted through the resolution of the secured creditors and, if relevant, preferential creditors. This will avoid the need for unnecessary creditors’ meetings, thereby reducing the costs of the process.\nSchedule 5, part 3 – winding-up companiesPayment to the Bank of England\nWe support the proposal to remove section 151 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The powers contained within this section are no longer necessary and date back to the Companies Act 1862, when the insolvency profession was largely unregulated.\nThe release of the liquidator when a winding-up order is rescinded\nSchedule 5, part 3 inserts a new subsection, which provides that when a winding-up order is rescinded, the liquidator has his or her release with effect from the time the court may determine. \nWe consider this to be a useful provision and \ncorrects\n an omission as the release of a liquidator in all other circumstances is already provided for within section 174 of the Insolvency Act 1986. This new subsection will avoid the need for the liquidator to make a subsequent, separate application to court.\n&#xa0;Schedule 5, part 4 – disqualification of unfit directorsWe support the proposal to enable the Secretary of State or official receiver to request directly from any person information that they consider relevant to a person’s conduct as a director. Currently, the Secretary of State/official receiver may only request information from the office holder, which imposes an administrative burden on the IP. The proposed changes should reduce this statutory burden and make more efficient the process of disqualification of unfit directors.\nSchedule 5, part 7 – preferential debts of companies and individualsWe support the repeal of one element of priority given to employees’ wages in certain insolvency proceedings as ‘year in hand’ employee contracts to which it relates no longer exists.\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
