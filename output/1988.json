More detail is needed on how much it costs to call using\n \ndifferent networks.\n• Communications should be in plain English. More work is needed to \nrevise how \nchanges to products can be more easily communicated whilst remaining within the guidelines from the financial regulator.\n• Product offerings should be presented in a way that helps consumers compare the full range of services and know that they can switch.\n• The complaints process should be available from all points of contact,\n \nverbal \ncomplaints logged and actioned and leaflets available in branch displays.\n• A review of packaged accounts, eligibility processes and usage of\n \nindividual \nservices is needed.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSwitching bank account\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPeople in Northern Ireland have told us they use branches of banks quite regularly.
