defaultI like 
defaultadvert free
default radio and believe it should be preserved
default however I don’t see why a commercial station couldn’t bid for the money to provide advert free
default programmes.  It wouldn’t bother me if there were adverts in between shows.
defaultI think the current 
defaultlicence fee is completely wrong
default and the fact that a man from the state broadcaster can come to your door and threaten you with prosecution is 
defaultcringeworthy
default.  
defaultNow that everyone has digital the 
defaulttelevision 
defaultchannels should be locked until a subscription is tak
defaulten out, the s
defaultubscription should be flexible, 
defaultit should be possible
default to pay for a month or twelve months or a single event
default or programme
default.
default  
defaultThe 
defaultiplayer
default could have advertising, however if you are a subscriber you could enter a code and watch advert free.  Perha
defaultps an online only subscription to watch live via the 
defaultiplayer
default could be on offer cheaper than a main Television subscription.
default  
defaultThe most important thing is to radically cut down the cost of the 
defaultcompulsory 
defaultlicence
default to just cover the cost of Radio, a small webs
defaultite and news.  All television should 
defaultbe supported by advertising or subscription.
