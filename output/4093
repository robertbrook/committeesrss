[normal]I like 
[normal]advert free
[normal] radio and believe it should be preserved
[normal] however I don’t see why a commercial station couldn’t bid for the money to provide advert free
[normal] programmes.  It wouldn’t bother me if there were adverts in between shows.
[normal]I think the current 
[normal]licence fee is completely wrong
[normal] and the fact that a man from the state broadcaster can come to your door and threaten you with prosecution is 
[normal]cringeworthy
[normal].  
[normal]Now that everyone has digital the 
[normal]television 
[normal]channels should be locked until a subscription is tak
[normal]en out, the s
[normal]ubscription should be flexible, 
[normal]it should be possible
[normal] to pay for a month or twelve months or a single event
[normal] or programme
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]The 
[normal]iplayer
[normal] could have advertising, however if you are a subscriber you could enter a code and watch advert free.  Perha
[normal]ps an online only subscription to watch live via the 
[normal]iplayer
[normal] could be on offer cheaper than a main Television subscription.
[normal]  
[normal]The most important thing is to radically cut down the cost of the 
[normal]compulsory 
[normal]licence
[normal] to just cover the cost of Radio, a small webs
[normal]ite and news.  All television should 
[normal]be supported by advertising or subscription.
