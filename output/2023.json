"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by the Equality and Diversity Forum (LAI 006)&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;The Equality and Diversity Forum (EDF) \nis a network of national \norganizations\n committed to equal opportunities, social justice, good community relations, respect for human rights and\n&#xa0;\nan end to\n&#xa0;\ndiscrimination based on age, disability, gender and gender identity, race, religion\n&#xa0;\nor belief, and sexual orientation\n.\n \nFurther \ninformation about our work is available at \nwww.edf.org.uk\n and a list of our members is attached.\n&#xa0;\nThe EDF considers that access to legal aid is vital to ensure \nthe rule of law in a modern democratic society and the nee\nd for fairness to ensure a level playing field for access to justice.\n It appears that the Government, in introducing these proposed provisions, is attempting to ensure that it is out of reach of criticism.\n&#xa0;\nThe common law, the European Convention on Human \nRights (ECHR)\n,\n \nthe\nEuropean Charter of Fundamental Rights\n and the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights\n \nexpressly recognise the right of access to legal aid in complex\nlegal proceedings. In the words of the lat\ne Lord Bingham:\n \n&#xa0;\n \n…\ndenial o\nf legal protection\n \nto the poor litigant who cannot afford to pay is [the] enemy of the rule of law.\n&#xa0;The\n UN Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women \nhas been very critical \nof previous restrictions on the availability of legal aid\n \nso \nfurther restrictions \nmay well put the UK \nin breach of \nits\n international obligations.\n&#xa0;Proposal to introduce a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a ‘strong connection’ with the UK&#xa0;The proposal is \nto require\n applicants for civil legal aid to satisfy a residence test in order for civil legal aid to be available.\n This means that the applicant\n \nmust be \nlawfully resident in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories at the time an application for c\nivil legal aid was made\n and \nthe individual would also be required to have resided lawfully in the UK, Crown Dependencies or British Overseas Territories for 12 months\n.\n (An exception will be made for asylum seekers \nwhile their application is being considere\nd\n,\n but once asylum has been granted they will have to wait for another 12 months before they are eligible for legal aid).\n \n&#xa0;\nThe legal aid provider \nwould need to see evidence that the client was lawfully resident and had previously been lawfully resident fo\nr 12 months, and they would need to retain copies of this evidence on file for audit purposes. \nThis will put an onerous burden onto legal aid providers whose time is already very constrained to investigate their client’s immigration status as well as havin\ng to get proo\nf of their length of residence.\n This is a complex and potentially time consuming task. \n&#xa0;This proposal \nwill take away access to civil legal aid\n,\n no matter how important the issue at stake. It \nappears to run contrary to a number of the UK’s \ninternational obligations as well as disproportionately disadvantaging non-UK nationals.\n It \nwill exclude\n from access to legal aid\n:\n&#xa0;\nThese people will be unable to access legal aid even if the claim concerns domestic violence, the consequences of being trafficked, homelessness or habe\nas corpus. \n&#xa0;\nIn relation to discrimination law claims\n,\n we \nconsider\n that this provision will be contrary to the provisions in the European Equ\nality Directives \nwhich\n say that ‘\nMember States shall ensure that judicial and/or administrative procedures, includi\nng where they deem it appropriate conciliation procedures, for the enforcement of obligations under this Directive are available to all persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to them\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\nAdditionally, w\ne \nconsider\n that this provision would be contrary to article 16 \nof the Refugee Convention 1951, which states:\n&#xa0;Proposal to restrict the availability of legal aid to prisoners&#xa0;The EDF is concerned about the proposal to \nrestrict the availability\n \nof legal aid to prisoners\n for prison law matters.\n The proposal is that\n \nprisoners \nwill no longer be \nable to get\n legal aid for\n \nadvice and representation relating to treatment, sentencing\n or\n disciplinary matters\n unless \nth\ney involve\n: \n&#xa0;\nThis means that cases \nconcerning the treatment of prisoners including prison conditions (food, access to work, access to services, \nreligious worship)\n;\n assault, including sexual assault by staff\n; discrimination; withholding correspondence;\n barring visitors\n;\n separation of mothers and their babies\n; and\n attendance at behaviour courses\n will \nall \nbe excluded\n. It will \nalso \nexclude legal aid f\nor cases concerning categorisation, segregation, resettlement and other sentence issues\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nWe consider that this will have a significant adverse impact for certain equality groups.\n  \nIt is well know\nn\n that people from ethnic minorities are over-represe\nnted in the prison population. \nOn 31 March 2013, 26% of the prison population, 21,462 prisoners, was from a minority ethnic group.\n This compares to around one in 10 of the general population.\n&#xa0;\nThere are also a disproportionate number of disabled people i\nn prisons compared to the general population.\n This is harder to estimate\n:\n nevertheless, an estimate\nd\n 36% of prisoners interviewed in a Ministry of Justice study were considered to have a disability when answers about disability and health, including mental health, were screened.\n \nEighteen per cent (\n18%\n)\n of prisoners interviewed were considered to have a p\nhysical disability\n.\n Twenty to thirty per cent \nof all offenders have learning disabilities or difficulties that interfere with their ability to cope with the criminal justice system\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nc\nonsultation paper suggests that\n prisoners can just use the prisone\nr\n \ncomplaints mechanism\n as an alternative to legal aid\n. However, under existing rules, prisoners are only eligible for\n \nlegal aid if their case cannot be resolved under the complaints mechanism. \nConsequently the current cases are already ones that have not o\nr cannot be resolved by the existing complaints process.\n \n&#xa0;\nHer Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons \nis critical of\n complaints management,\n \nwhich is slow and ineffective\n. They\n comment\n:\n&#xa0;\nWe are concerned by the proposal that criminal legal aid for prison law ma\ntters should be restricted to the criteria set out in the consultation paper, and that it is reliant on both an effective complaints system and on reasonable adjustments being made to ensure prisoners with learning difficulties and/or mental health problem\ns can use the complaint system. Our \ninspection evidence suggests a distinct lack of confidence in the prisoner complaints system, particularly amongst those prisoners reporting as having a disability or a mental health issue. It is our view that prisoners \nwith identified communication, mental health problems and learning difficulties should be able to obtain legal aid on the current basis.\n \n&#xa0;\nAdditionally, any legal aid that is made available under these restrictions will have to be delivered \nby provider\ns \nwith a criminal law contract.\n We do not cons\nider that this is appropriate. \nMost \nexisting prison law experts are \nnot criminal practitioners, but individuals and firms who specialize in prison law\n which is \na niche form of public law.\n&#xa0;\nProposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed&#xa0;The EDF strongly disagrees with this proposal as it will weed out the \nstrong\n cases as much as the weak ones;\n it will act as a disincentive to early settlement or resolution of cases and will discourage solicitors from taking any judicial review cases on behalf of individuals \nhowever strong their case\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe EDF considers tha\nt Judicial Review is a vital remedy and one of the most important ways for individual people to hold national and local public bodies to \naccount for acting unlawfully. \nWe note that the Ministry of Justice in its press release for the earlier Consultation o\nn Reforming Judicial Review acknowledged \n‘the important role that Judicial Review plays in holding Government and others to account’.\n The power to judicially review public decisions is an important reserve power enabling citizens to ensure good governance \nand further constraints on its use should be approached with considerable caution.\n&#xa0;\nIf this proposal goes ahead, it will create a situation where individuals will not be able to bring cases challenging the decisions of local authorities or central government because they will not be able to find lawyers willing to take the risk of not get\nting paid for this work. \nIf, as seems likely, \nlawyers stop doing this type of work people facing injustice because of public law failings by public bodies will find it increasingly difficult to find anyone to advise them.\n&#xa0;\nIt is neither reasonable nor sens\nible to expect individuals to take judicial revie\nw action without legal advice. \nLitigants acting without advice are more likely to take cases that will not succeed, whatever their intrinsic merits, because the case has\n not been adequately prepared. \nThey ar\ne also more likely to take weak cases which might have been deterred by good legal\n advice at the outset. \n&#xa0;\nAny lawyer who did bring these challenges to court would have to pursue the court proceedings to make sure they were paid for their work. This would \ncreate a perverse incentive for cases to be pursued in court even when the initiation of judicial review is sufficient to persuade a public body to acknowledge its error and reconsider a decision (and there is ample evidence\n that this happens regularly). \nL\nawyers will hav\ne\n an incentive to fight cases rather than to reach an early resolution \nwhich will waste court time and ultimately cost public funds. We do not believe that this is good value for money nor does it assist the Government’s objective of securin\ng early settlement and preventing litigation wherever possible.\n&#xa0;\nI\nf it is introduced \nthis provision \nwill significantly limit access to justi\nce for \nsome of \nthe most disadvantaged\n people\n. \nWe consider that this means that it \nis likely to\n impact on acce\nss to \nlegal rights contrary to A\nrticle 6\n of the ECHR\n.\n&#xa0;1\n3\n September \n2013\nAnnex 1&#xa0;Equality and Diversity Forum members &#xa0;Action on Hearing Loss\nAge UK\nBritish Humanist Association\nBritish Institute of Human Rights\nChildren’s \nRights Alliance for England (CRAE)\nCitizens Advice\nDisability Rights UK\nDiscrimination Law Association\nEnd Violence Against Women\nEquality Challenge Unit\nEREN – The English Regions Equality and Human Rights Network\nFawcett Society\nFriends, Families and \nTra\nvellers\n \nGender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES)\nJUSTICE \nLaw \nCentres\n \nNetwork\nMind\nNational AIDS Trust\nPress for Change\nRace on the Agenda (ROTA)\nRefugee Council\nRNIB\nRunnymede Trust\nScope\nStonewall\nThe Age and Employment Network (TAEN)\nTrades Union Congress (TUC)\nUKREN (UK Race in Europe Network)\nUNISON\nWomen’s Budget Group\nWomen’s Resource Centre\n&#xa0;\nPage \n2\n of \n6\n \nArticle 6(3)(c), and see \nAirey\n v Ireland (1979) \n2 EHRR 305\n.\n Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights\n.\n \nArticle 14(3)\n(d) of the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights\n.\n Bingham, Tom (2010)\n \nThe Rule of Law (London: Allen Lane): p\n88\n.\n UN Committee for the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women, UK report, \nJuly 26th\n 2013, \npara\n 22 at \nhttp://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_lay\nouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=INT%2fCEDAW%2fCOC%2fGBR%2f14761&amp;Lang=en\n \nEg\n \nCouncil Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, article 7(1).\n \nMinistry of Justice (2013) \n‘\nOffender Management Statistics Quarterly Bulletin, October to December 2012\n’\n (\nLondon: \nMinistry of Justice): \nTable 1.7,\n Equality and Human Rights Commission (2010) \n‘\nHow F\nair is Britain?
