[[[Our Mission: ]]]Promoting human rights and holding governments to account, drawing upon the lessons learned from the conflict in Northern Ireland. &#xa0;

[[[Our Expertise and Achievements: ]]]Since 1990 we have provided support and services to anyone whose human rights were violated as a result of conflict. Our interventions have reflected our range of expertise, from the right to a fair trial to the government’s positive obligation to protect life. We have a long record of working closely with NGOs and government authorities to share that expertise. And we have received wide recognition, as the first winner of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Prize in 2009 alongside other honours.

[[[Our Judicial Review Experience: ]]]We have substantial experience as a third party intervener in a number of judicial review applications before the courts of England and Wales and Northern Ireland.  We have intervened as both a sole third party intervener and as a co-intervener with other NGOs.  Our interventions have included a range of human rights engaged issues including the length of pre-charge detention in terrorist cases and the certification of trial without jury in Northern Ireland.  In addition we intervened in an application engaging minority language rights regarding the reasonable expectation to speak Irish in the courts in Northern Ireland.  We have also intervened in applications before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).  Our most recent co-intervention before the ECtHR was in Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v UK [61498/08] following litigation before the domestic courts on the issues of the jurisdiction of the European Convention of Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.  We are in the process of developing a human rights strategic litigation policy.Rights watch (UK) has responded to both the Consultations of the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial review.  Our submissions to the Joint Committee on Human Rights are limited to the issues arising from the latter Consultation paper “Judicial Review (CM 8703) encompassing questions of standing and intervention and costs.” 

[[[Standing and Interventions]]]We see no problem in a judicial review application being made by a claimant with no direct interest in the matter.  In particular when the case involves issues encompassing human rights, the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA98), which partially incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 (the Convention), and the powers invested in the judiciary to strike down aspects of policy and legislation which are found to be incompatible with the Convention. The purpose of a judicial review by the judiciary is to hold the executive to account in the exercise of its power when engaged in decision making on the implementation of legislation or policy.   In matters relating to the exercise of executive power when human rights are engaged, it is in the public interest that the exercise of these powers, which raise human rights based challenges, can be brought to the attention of the judiciary for review The public has an interest in the operation of this process, as well as in the substantive issues concerned specifically when there has been an actual or possible human rights violation, an issue of incompatibility between domestic law and the Convention or the possibility of derogation from an Article of the Convention. In terms of specific problems that would arise from a more restrictive test for standing, we are concerned about the impact this would have on human rights NGOs in particular and their ability to engage in the judicial review process. An NGO can hold an important position in civil society that bridges the gap between a particular legislative instrument or policy proposal, and those directly or potentially affected by it. It is possible that in some situations members of the public would be unaware of particular legislative details that would affect their human rights, and an NGO plays an important role in representing and assisting individuals and groups to ensure they are not detrimentally affected by any such proposals which interfere with their human rights, and by extension the rights held within wider society. &#xa0;Rights Watch (UK) understands that the policy motor driving the proposed reforms to standing in judicial review interventions is the incorrect assumption put forth in the Consultation that “Parliament and the elected Government are best placed to determine what is in the public interest” (paragraphs 79-80). We consider this  to be fundamentally wrong in the context of judicial review and human rights, specifically when it is the operation of executive powers that are being scrutinised and challenged to remedy or prevent human rights violations.  This may be directly by the state,  through a failure of the state to protect human rights, or through a failure to comply with the Convention or under the HRA98. The present Consultation misunderstands the purpose of judicial review and the need for public scrutiny of executive decision-making.   This is particularly important when human rights issues (broadly defined and interpreted) are engaged given the primacy of the Convention and its effect under the HRA98 and the powers of the judiciary to make declarations of incompatibility.   &#xa0;A similar concern can be seen in the context of the proposals regarding access to legal aid, where the assessment of financial eligibility is in part based on the prospects of success (merits) of the case. In our opinion, the mere process of investigating and reviewing particular executive actions is essential to the process of effective public scrutiny and this is placed in danger if the process is amended along the lines proposed by the government. It may be that in other areas the government’s superior expertise would be a convincing argument, but we do not consider that it is justified in the context of what is fundamentally a constitutional challenge. The proposed  restriction has the effect of reducing scrutiny and accountability on issues of human rights which have possible supranational consequences. It would also impact on the powers vested in the judiciary to strike down as incompatible legislation and policy which offends the Convention. &#xa0;A more restrictive test for standing would place both the effectiveness and the potential benefits of judicial review in an even more vulnerable position by limiting those who could challenge to individuals or groups that are, in the government’s perspective, most engaged.  Assuming that judicial review is a constitutional tool for accountability exercised by the judiciary in relation to the executive, the whole of society has an interest in ensuring it is used to its full extent and potential and a more restrictive test for standing misunderstands this. Of particular concern is the issue of when a human rights based challenged needs to be made when the effect of domestic policy or legislation is potentially incompatible with the Convention.  Judicial review remains the primary vehicle through which such a human rights challenge can be bought and this should be protected. &#xa0;We stress judicial review in relation to human rights is not a campaigning tool but is an issue of assistance and representation, government accountability and human rights compliance. Furthermore, it is not clear what issues may arise in the future and a more liberal approach to standing, such as exists presently, allows for such flexibility as issues evolve.  The presence of an NGO adding value to a judicial review application or as claimant asserts the importance of civil society in the litigation system and enables a broader consideration of factors introduced by those with expertise and knowledge to be taken by the judiciary in its consideration of the challenge made in the application. &#xa0;A more restrictive test for standing not only misunderstands the nature and purpose of judicial review as a constitutional tool, but also may mean in specific cases that there is no individual or group claimant to challenge a decision in the exercise of power or policy when human rights issues are engaged. For example, there may be cases where a particular policy has not had a direct effect on an individual yet or the individual is unable to bring a challenge. The standing of a human rights NGO would therefore ensure that these human rights concerns are ventilated before the courts ensuring the executive does not escape its human rights obligations or avoid human rights compliance. &#xa0;In our view, the government has failed to explain why the current test for standing is unsatisfactory. There is no evidence to suggest that the courts misapply the current test in a way that leads to problems asserted by the government such as “to seek publicity” or “hinder the process of proper decision-making” (paragraphs 79-80) (however ‘proper’ decision-making is defined). Therefore, we do not consider that any of the proposed alternatives would be more reasonable.  The current test for standing allows for flexibility that depends on context and issue whilst at the same time recognising the importance of judicial review in assessing the exercise of executive powers specifically when human rights issues are engaged and where human rights compliance is in question. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]The government has suggested that providers should only be paid for work carried out in an application for judicial review in cases either where permission is granted or where the LAA exercises its discretion to pay the provider in a case where proceedings are issued but the case concludes prior to a permission decision. We do not agree with the above government proposal. Specifically in relation to human rights challenges through judicial review it would discourage public lawyers from undertaking applications for judicial review as the financial risk, if the case does not proceed beyond the permission stage, will lie with them and permission stage is inevitably challenged by the government through the Treasury Solicitors. Public lawyers cannot be expected to bear this financial burden on matters as urgent as human rights as it would mean that the focus of the application would be the financial risk as opposed to the benefit to the claimant whose human rights are in issue or the potential wider public interest importance of the application.  &#xa0;The government’s proposal would lead to judicial review cases being restricted to those who could bear the financial risks associated with proceeding to the Administrative court, thus reducing the ability of many members of the public and civil society organisations such as human rights NGOs to challenge important policy decisions of the executive which have implications for human rights. &#xa0;For example the important recent Supreme Court judicial review judgment in Osborne and Booth v The Parole Board; In the application of James Clyde Reilly for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland) [2013] UKSC 61 might not have been taken if the current funding proposals had been in place because public lawyers instructed on behalf of the claimants would have been deterred by the financial risk incurred in undertaking preliminary work before the permission stage. This case engaged human rights principles articulated in both common law and under the Convention. &#xa0;Furthermore, the proposal undermines the purposes of judicial review and legal aid.  Judicial review should enable members of society to challenge the actions and decisions of the executive and this ability should be based on the importance of the policy and the merits of the challenge, not the ability to fund such a challenge. Legal aid should enable those who cannot afford legal assistance to engage in the judicial review process and obtain the legal representation that is necessary to ensure fair legal access irrespective of finances.  This is with the safeguard that the judiciary determines standing and that the public interest should be defined within the context of the balance and the separation of powers between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive.  When human rights issues are engaged then this demand for open access to justice becomes an imperative. &#xa0;The proposal undermines these principles by distinguishing which stages of the process merit  financial assistance, i.e. only if it satisfies the permission stage. This distinction offends the equality of arms principle which is enshrined in the Convention jurisprudence.  However, the preparatory stage of a judicial review application is important in the process and legal service providers should not be expected to bear the costs themselves. The proposal also means that a decision about which cases are the most deserving is determining the availability of legal assistance. Legal representation is fundamental to the whole process of judicial review and should not be dependent on the case reaching a certain stage, contested by the government. &#xa0;Restricting funds until after the permission stage would discourage many public lawyers from engaging in the process at the preliminary stage, further reducing the number of judicial review applications. This reduction would be based on the inability to meet the costs, which would have a detrimental effect on the most vulnerable members of society. Far from meeting the government’s objectives of reducing judicial review to cases that are the most important (a judgement that is based on a flawed presumption that the government is always best placed to decide who is most deserving) it would only serve to skew judicial review applications to those with greater financial resources and exclude members of society who are most vulnerable in the face of the proposals that require challenge. These are the members of society whose human rights will often be the subject of the application. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]The government has asked whether it is appropriate to stipulate that PCOs will not be available in any case where there is an individual or private interest regardless of whether there is a wider public interest.  We oppose the restriction of the availability of PCOs. We do not consider it is suitable to prevent PCOs being available in a case where there is an individual or private interest in the case. The public interest in the case is the most important form of interest and it would not be appropriate to restrict PCOs just because there is also a private or individual interest at stake. &#xa0;The proposals would generate greater uncertainty for claimants who may be deterred by the costs they may incur if their application is unsuccessful. It would create a chilling effect by placing financial barriers on those who want to engage in the judicial review process. NGOs and vulnerable individuals who would not be able to bear the financial risk that would be associated if the availability of PCOs was limited would be discouraged from bringing claims which might be important to bring in the public interest. This would especially be true for NGOs whose role involves bringing cases to the attention of the court and the public even if the policy has not had a direct effect on an individual or group as of yet. &#xa0;There is a link between the importance of bringing the case into the public attention by NGOs who may take on the responsibility if the policy is not publicly known yet, and the consequent chilling effect because they are hindered by the potential costs. Sometimes, it is important for issues to be brought to the attention of the public and the courts, even if in the particular case is not successful as it is   the process of challenge in itself that must be preserved, and this should not depend upon financial resources. NGO funding is reliant on a mixture of philanthropy or other form of membership subscription.  Those funding NGO work in terms of strategic litigation would also be deterred from funding if they were to be co-joined as potential bears of litigation risk costs, as would corporate sponsors (for example pro bono units of commercial law firms) who might be exposed to unacceptable unquantifiable costs in public interest litigation.

[[[&#xa0;]]]The government asks how could the principles for making a PCO be modified to ensure a better balance a) between the parties to litigation and b) between providing access to the courts with the interests of the taxpayer?  We do not consider that the principles for making a PCO should be modified. The public interest at stake in bringing certain cases to the attention of the courts should not be dictated to by the financial security of the parties. It not only restricts access to the legal process itself, but also jeopardises the purpose of judicial review as it may mean that cases that are in the public interest (yet may also involve individual or group interests) are not brought to the attention of the court and the policy would go unchallenged. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]Further, we do not consider that the source of funding should be relevant to the consideration of a PCO. The principles that currently govern the availability of PCOs are sufficient to achieve their purpose of protecting claimants from undue financial burdens and the source of funding is not relevant for that purpose.  For example, NGOs are sponsored either through public subscription (membership) or by private philanthropy.  To require disclosure beyond what is available in the public domain through the Charity Commission is an unnecessary and pervasive invasion into the funding arrangements of these civil society organisations.

[[[nterveners]]]&#xa0;The government asks whether third parties who choose to intervene in judicial review claims can be responsible in principle for their own legal costs of doing so, such that they should not, ordinarily, be able to claim those costs from either the claimant or the defendant? &#xa0;We do not consider that an NGO third party intervener should be liable for their own legal costs. We are concerned that the proposals relating to third party interveners would have a detrimental impact on the role of NGOs and other important actors in the judicial review process. This is because making an NGO third-party intervener liable for their own costs not only impacts negatively on the quality of the decision by dissuading parties who may add substantive and significant arguments from intervening, but would also have a disproportionate effect on the ability of NGOs and charities to engage in the judicial review process, insulating the executive further from proper scrutiny and accountability in the exercise of power and demonstrating human rights compliance.&#xa0;Third party interventions can be extremely beneficial to the quality of the decision making process in the application. They may be able to bring additional expertise and arguments, particularly if they are an interest group that represents a particular group within society or an issue. The rules on costs might therefore discourage those who could bring something significant to the case due to their inability to bear the financial burden, particularly if they are an NGO with restricted financial resources. This would consequently limit the ability of NGOs to engage in the judicial review process in general as the costs would prove a practical hindrance. This would furthermore affect the effectiveness of the judicial review process by limiting those who can engage in it to the financially stable and resourceful. Such a policy would again misunderstand the role of judicial review as a tool for the public to challenge the decision making function of executive powers by dictating the process along the lines of costs rather than the importance of the public interest/human rights issues in play.

[[[&#xa0;]]]From a practical perspective, the quality of the decision making process may be hindered if certain arguments or opinions are excluded. It may lead to an increase in subsequent costs because of the need for further litigation if important points are not raised or clarified in the original case due to a costs barrier. There is no real evidence to support the assertion that third party interveners greatly increase the costs in the first place, and their participation at the outset may lead to a more efficient and thorough consideration of the issues in the application. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]The intervention of a third party NGO may bring an important perspective to the application that would not have otherwise been considered. The benefits that they can bring mean they should not be responsible for any additional costs that may be incurred. Furthermore, any intervention is at the discretion of the court who are in the best position to restrict the involvement if it may not add anything of value to the process. A key consideration in deciding whether to apply to make a third party intervention in a judicial review is whether the intervention will add value to the application, and thus appropriate safeguards are already in place.
