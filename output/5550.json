"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Blue Marine Foundation &#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the \nBlue Marine Foundation (BLUE)\n:  BLUE\n is a \ncharity and a \nmember of the Marine Reserves Coalition \nthat\n has submitted a \nhigh level \nresponse to the EA Committee on the points the committee requested.  We do not wish to add to members\n’\n reading by duplication.  \nT\nhese are exp\nanded notes,\n referred to in paragraph 8 of th\ne\n \nmain MRC \nsubmission, \nto back up the assertion\n \nthat\n BLUE has built a public/private partnership \nin Lyme Bay on the south coast\n \nthat has made\n an MPA more successful\n and indeed given it a vision that initially was absent. We \nbelieve\n \nthat there is \npotential for many such partnerships in the future.  Indeed, our researches have found \nan enormous unmet need for more of \nthis way of working around the coast to make MPAs a valued reality.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLyme Bay\n - summary\n&#xa0;\nBLUE has discovered in its project in Lyme Bay, a European marine site, that regulation on its own does not make for a successful marine protected area.  It is a necessary and essential part of the picture but there are occasions where the vision and facilitation that can be achieved through co-management on the ground can achieve an even better result, one where the financial and community benefits are tangible to the existing users of the sea and the MPA plays a valued part in community life.  \n&#xa0;\nIt has often been overlooked that both European sites and MCZs will continue to be fished, so the fish and shellfish that comes from them, provided it is caught according to the agreed management measures for the site, offers greater reassurance to retailers and to consumer\ns\n themselves that it is from a sustainably managed source.  It may even be possible in the future to develop a certification scheme that applies to seafood caught from such sites, with the effect of creating demand and value for fishermen’s produce, and building in their support for the area, even where the volumes extracted are lower than they were before.  We would invite the committee to examine the benefits and the constraints of this approach and to ask themselves whether the necessary flexibility of regulation currently exists on the ground.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLyme Bay background\n&#xa0;Lyme Bay’s rocky reefs are known as\n \n”England’s coral garden.”  The \nreef \narea is protected as a European marine site for its globally significant flora and fauna\n- and there is a new MCZ as well as a European SAC\n.  It is also home to an active fishing community and supports a significant tourism trade. A closure to destructive trawling and dredging was implemented \ninitially \nacross \n60 \nq miles of the reefs in 2008, through a statutory instrument.  This ban on mobile gears had the unexpected effect of increasing fishing pressure from \npots and set nets to such a degree that it led to unsustainable fishing, economic damage to fishermen’s livelihoods and potentially a threat to the recovery of the protected reef. \n&#xa0;\nCreating a working groupIn an attempt to solve the problems caused by the closure, BLUE convened informal meetings with fishermen, regulators and conservationists. This was an achievement in itself as these meetings brought together traditionally ‘warring’ parties around the same table and, as a result, together they formed a new body, spanning two IFCA areas, the Lyme Bay Working Group. \n&#xa0;\nSince then (2011) BLUE has been working with the local fishermen to devise a model of self-management which financially benefits and motivates fishing communities to fish in more sustainable ways. \nThis project has been hailed as a “world-first” by Fishing News given its radical collaborative approach involving fishermen in stock management and research.\n&#xa0;\n“\n….those involved in Lyme Bay fishing have come together with all the bodies involved in seeking to preserve the ecological balance, and they have together drawn up a remarkable voluntary code……Lyme Bay is leading the way.”Oliver Letwin, Conservative MP for West Dorset.\n&#xa0;\nSince its inception project activities and achievements have included:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nScience and ecosystem based managementPrior to the creation of the reserve there had been no ecosystem based approach to management of the area and there was lack of data documenting the fisheries of Lyme Bay. \nIn order to create an evidence-based management plan for Lyme Bay, the project has put in place significant scientific studies. These will inform the level of fishing effort and other measures required to sustainably manage the fisheries and maintain a balanced ecosystem. Examples of these studies are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Project next stepsBLUE is now planning to lead the project through the next stage to ensure a properly planned, well-managed, scientifically-backed, and sustainable fishery. \nThis project will: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;“It’s a win-win situation for all involved. It’s good for the fish, good for us fisherman, the environment and it shows what a good scheme it is because it’s now going national.”\nAlex Jones, Lyme Bay fisherman.\n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;This project located in England’s very own “coral garden” offers a “win-win-win” for fishermen, conservationists and communities. \nIn short, the fishermen will play an important role in creating a sustainable future for their businesses and benefit from an enhanced market for premium quality, sustainably caught fish; conservationists will benefit from scientific data collected by the fishermen which will act as a foundation for the conservation and protection of sensitive habitats and species both in Lyme Bay and throughout the UK;  and communities will benefit from an enhanced local economy (from both fisheries and tourism). \nKey outcomes will be an improved market for premium\n \n“sustainably-caught” Lyme Bay seafood that can be branded and labelled as such, the collection of important scientific data to inform marine planning and importantly\n the \nestablishment of a model project for roll out to other coastal areas in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n Adopting the Lyme Bay model elsewhere in the UK&#xa0;\nThe aim of the Lyme Bay project was always that it would become a blueprint for successful, \npragmatic marine conservation. The basic framework of the Lyme Bay model can be applied to any Marine Protected Area (MPA), Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) around the coast and much of the work done in Lyme Bay can be used in full or in part depending on the nature of the fishery and the marine site. In September 2013 BLUE hosted a conference at the National Sailing Academy in Weymouth attracting 170 delegates. The day was used as an opportunity to share BLUE’s experiences from Lyme as well as offering a platform to fishers, regulators and conservationists from around the UK to discuss challenges and opportunities from their regions. Following on from the conference more than 10 sites around the UK approached BLUE looking for support. \n&#xa0;\nIt is not possible yet to name the areas, as this should remain confidential between them and BLUE until they are comfortable about going public, but this might be possible by the time of the committee’s evidence session.  BLUE is currently carrying out a feasibility study in each of these areas to gain a better understanding of the area, key stakeholders and to identify how and where best to can get involved. In early 2014 BLUE will be shortlisting these candidate sites ready to develop two or three projects in these areas.\n&#xa0;\nThe key benefits of translating the Lyme model to other areas of the country are: \n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe facilitation of a shared vision between different stakeholders, managers, fishermen of several gear types and tourism and community interests.\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential to generate additional funding from charity funders to carry out projects that coincide with the management objectives for the area when public funding faces constraints.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe involvement of retailers in developing brands based on sustainable fishing systems\n within or adjacent to MPAs\n. \n&#xa0;\nSummary of \npossible \nareas of interest for the inquiry\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhere agreement can be found between communities, as on the Lyme model, is regulation flexible or rapid enough to capitalize on that agreement and rectify agreed problems – given that a consultation for a bylaw takes 18 months?\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre all IFCAs and other regulators open to such public/private partnership arrangements?  Some are less so than others.\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAre there ways of achieving new MPAs with multiple benefits through this way of working?\n We think so.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
