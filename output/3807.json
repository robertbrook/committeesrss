"&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by The Equality And Diversity Forum (JRR 0007)&#xa0;\nStanding Public law is not at base about rights, eve\nn though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts have always been alive to the fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issue or the outco\nme may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for [permission to bring judicial revi\new], the court’s only concern is to ensure that it is not being done for an ill motive.\n’\n \nThird party interventions &#xa0;Costs – legal aid&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n‘If a person with a potential claim cannot get legal aid, there are two possible consequences. The first is \nthat the claim is dropped: that is a rank denial of justice and a blot on the rule of law. The second is that the claim is pursued, in which case it will be pursued inefficiently, and will take up much more of the court staffs’ time and of the judge’s time\n in and out of court. So that it means greater costs for the court system and in delay for other litigants’.\n&#xa0;\nCosts – protective costs ordersPublic Sector Equality Duty26\n November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAnnex&#xa0;Equality and Diversity Forum members &#xa0;Action on\n Hearing Loss\nAge \nUK\nBritish Humanist Association\nBritish Institute of Human Rights\nChildren’s Rights Alliance for England (CRAE)\nCitizens Advice\nDisability Rights \nUK\nDiscrimination Law Association\nEnd Violence Against Women Coalition \nEquality Challenge \nUnit\nEREN – The English Regions Equality and Human Rights Network\nFawcett Society\nFriends, Families and Travellers\nGender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES)\nJUSTICE \nLaw Centres Network\nMind\nNational AIDS Trust\nNational Alliance of Women’s Org\nanisations (NAWO)\nPress for Change\nRace on the Agenda (\nROTA\n)\nRefugee Council\nRNIB\nRunnymede\n Trust\nScope\nStonewall\nThe Age and Employment Network (TAEN)\nTrades Union Congress (TUC)\nUKREN (\nUK\n Race in \nEurope\n Network)\nUNISON\nWomen’s Budget Group\nWomen’s \nResource Centre\n&#xa0;\nIn addition the following EDF observer organisations have indicated their support for this submission:\n&#xa0;\nThe National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO)\nInclusion London\nEquanomics UK\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPage \n5\n of \n6\n R (in the application of Cart) v Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28 at para 122\n See V Bondy &amp; M Sunkin, How many JRs are too many? 2013 Available at \nhttp://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2013/10/25/varda-bondy-and-maurice-sunk\nin-how-many-jrs-are-too-many-an-evidence-based-response-to-judicial-review-proposals-for-further-reform/\n \n \nR v Somerset County Council, ex p Dixon \n[1998] Env LR 111 at 117-121.\n Tom Sargent Memorial Lecture, Lord Neuberger, October 15\nth\n 2013 at para 44 available at \nhttp://www.justice.org.uk/data/files/resources/357/Neuberger-2013-lecture.pdf\n The Scottish and Welsh governments have taken rather\n different approaches to implementation of the PSED.\n We have not considered the case of \nStuart Bracking and others (Appellants) v Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions (Respondent)\n &amp;\n Equality and Human Rights Commission (Intervener) Court of Appeal (Civ\nil Division), judgment 6 November 2013\n as it is too early to assess the result.\n&#xa0;\n"
