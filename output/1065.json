"VEP 0032\nWritten Submission by Victim Support VEP 0032&#xa0;\nVictim Support\n would like to thank you for providing us with the opportunity to outline our stance on the draft eligibility bill. However we cannot specifically recommend any particular option as outlined in the original letter.\n&#xa0;The Draft Voting Eligibility Bill has attracted much controversy since its first appearance in the Houses of Parliament in 2010, proposing only those sentenced to four or more years imprisonment should be ineligible to vote. In February 2011, the blanket ban remained. It appears the UK has little choice but to reform in order to comply with EU directives from the Hirst 2005 case, and the EU Convention on Human Rights. \n&#xa0;\nVictim Support recognises the positive role social responsibility and citizenship can play on a prisoners’ rehabilitation process and that in some cases this may contribute to reductions in reoffending. However, there is currently little \navailable \nby the way of a robust evidence base to show the positive impact of citizenship on reductions in reoffending.\n&#xa0;\nAt Victim Support we strongly believe in the rehabilitation of offenders as a means to reduce further offending. But we \ndon’t have the evidence to comment \non the issue of prisoners voting without evidence to clearly demonstrate the link between the enfranchisement of offenders and lower recidivism.\n&#xa0;\nDifferent victims will feel differently on this issue – there is no one single viewpoint. But what is clear is that this issue has been drawn out for far too long and has taken up too much of government and the public’s time. What is needed is a clear and swift decision so that the government can concentrate instead on what should be the most important issue – the needs of victims of crime, whose confidence in the justice system is already far too low and who too often feel marginalised by the criminal justice process.\n&#xa0;\nIn conclusion, at Victim Support we believe that the government’s focus should shift from offender\ns’\n rights to the rights and needs of victims of crime.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJune 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
