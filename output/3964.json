"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Private Eye (GMC0018)EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY DR PHIL HAMMOND AND ANDREW BOUSFIELDThe purpose of this submission to the Health Select Committee is to demonstrate that the Committee can have little confidence in the GMC's regulation of its doctors or its commitment to systems of safe care.In the wake of the Mid-Staffs Inquiry the Secretary of State has made his expectations clear.\n&#xa0;\n He expects there to be a new culture of openness and transparency wi\nth \na \ncommitment to candour \nby staff and organisations.\n&#xa0;\n He expects regulators such as the GMC to hold staff to account.\nThis submission will show that at its first key test\n,\n the GMC has failed to meet these expectations it and that its disciplinary arrangements\n are not fit for purpose\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nOn July 29, 2012, w\ne referred Dr \nHakin\n,\n currently Deputy Chief Executive of the Commissioning Board and previous Chief Executive of East Mid\nlands Strategic Health Authority to the GMC for her conduct in relation to United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust\n (ULHT)\n.\n&#xa0;\n The GMC have a key disciplinary role in relation to doctors in management.\n&#xa0;\n The complaint was wide ranging.\nAt the heart of our comp\nlaint was \nthe requirement\n of doctors \nto put patient safety first\n and the potential conflict between targets and safety\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe GMC \nwould seem to condone the mindless pursuit of targets\n and its analysis of our complaint and response from the GMC \non October 25\n, 2013 \ndoes not reflect the learning from Mid Staffordshire\n.\n  The GMC \naccepts in \nthe\nir\n report that there is no dichotomy between targets and safety.  Whilst that may be applicable in well funded, well staffed health systems with ample capacity it clearly c\nannot be said of health systems such as those of Mid Staffordshire or Lincolnshire which were under severe pressure.  Indeed the first investigation into Mid Staffs highlighted the conflict between targets and safety and recommended that Boards:\nensure that a focus on elective work and targets is not to the detriment of emergency admissionsThe GMC found that in those parts of \nour\n allegations dealing with inappropriate pressure on staff there was generally insufficient evidence to have a realistic prospect of successful if the GMC moved to a disciplinary hearing.\nHowever our complaints were much wider than \n‘bullying’\n and encompasse\nd allegations of the pursuit of targets in overfull hospitals and that as a result patients came to harm.\n&#xa0;\n The GMC’s analysis \nof \nDr \nHakin\n’\ns\n response\n to these \nallegations \ncan be \nbroadly \nsummarised\n by four assertions\n:\nThe \nGMC had ample evidence to refute all of these assertions.\nBased upon \nits\n \nflawed analysis and \nuntested \nassertions the GMC concluded that \nfor that part of our complaint, \nallegations of the pursuit of targets in overfull hospitals result\ning in patients \ncoming\n to harm\n, t\nhere was \nalso \nno realistic prospect of pursuing Dr Hakin.\nThe Committee will be aware that \nULHT has been described by Prof Sir Brian \nJarman\n as ‘similar to Mid-Staffordshire’\n an\nd\n so these matters are important\n.\n  They are also important as the case involves one of the most senior doctors in \nNHS \nmanagement who should set an example to others.  \nThe quality of the investigation carried out by the GMC can give little confidence that the GMC as an organisation is cap\nable of responding effectively to the expectations of the Secretary of State.\n&#xa0;\n Not only were there a number of serious procedural defects and flaws in the investigation carried out, its findings and conclusions were \nnot \nconsistent with the evidence before \nit.\n&#xa0;\n \nWe attach a critique of the\n GMC\n investigation at \nAnnex A\n focussing in on the four false assertions above.\nOne of the procedural defects by the GMC was that it failed to show us, the complainants, the evidence put forward by Dr \nHakin\n and as such it wa\ns not challenged.\n&#xa0;\n If the GMC report accurately reflects Dr \nHakin\n’\ns\n evidence then \nwe strongly contest it. \nThe failure of the GMC to comply with one of the most basic rules of an investigation and share with us conflicting evidence\n,\n as part of the inquiry p\nrocess\n,\n is\n merely one of the grounds for \nconsidering \nseeking a Judicial Review of their decision.\n  Indeed\n we have been informed that the GMC\n would normally share controversial and conflicting evidence and have given us no reason for not doing so in this case.  We would only note th\nat the complaint concerned one o\nf its most senior members.\nFinally we \nare\n \nalso \nconsidering \nmaking a further compla\nint to the GMC that\n,\n \non the assumption that \ntheir analysis of Dr \nHakin’s\n response \nis correct\n,\n \nshe \nmay have \nmisled them. Whilst this submission is designed to inform the Health Select Committee in its annual review of the GMC\n,\n we are conscious that the evid\nence before you should cause concern about the leadership at the top of the NHS\n and the unlikelihood of \nthe \ndesired change \nto a safer, kinder culture \nwhilst that leadership persists. \nThe GMC process \nis \nin our view \nunkind, \nuntimely, unfair, \ninefficient\n and fails to protect patients\n or \nadequately \nconsider the emotional health of those referred. \nOver two years ago, \nw\ne \nr\neported the medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital to the GMC for failing to act on the concerns of Baby Peter whistleblower Dr \nKim Holt. The GMC\n is\n still investigating, \napparently \nhampered by the lack of an independent expert. \nThe GMC also does not appear to be proactive, relying on others making referrals to it rather than acting on media reports. The article that gave rise to bo\nth these referrals is authored and attached, and yet despite the grave allegations the GMC has never contacted us proactively for information. Our published response to their assessment of Dr Hakin’s referral is also attached. \nFinally, in investigating th\nis matter the GMC instructed outside solicitors, Field Fisher Waterhouse, no doubt at great expense.  However, this has another benefit for the GMC.  It means that all communication in pursuance of the investigation is covered by legal professional privile\nge, and therefore not susceptible to a freedom of information request, or perhaps even Parliamentary scrutiny.  Whilst it is reasonable to instruct lawyers if required to collate evidence, it should not be used to impede proper accountability\n.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;Annex AFailure of the GMC to respond to the evidence which has emerged from Mid Staffordshire and to challenge effectively evidence by Dr Hakin in their preliminary investigation into her conduct.As we were not shown Dr Hakin\n’\ns evidence the comments which follow\n \nabout Dr Hakin \nare made \nin good faith and \non the basis that they may be reasonably deduced from the GMC report\n of her evidence.\n1.  The first assertion is that ULHT was no different to any other hospital, there was nothing unusual in Lincolnshire in terms of demand or capacity which would have warranted Dr Hakin not insisting on targets being met.&#xa0; Analysis of the report shows:\nThe implication\n of Dr Hakin\n’\ns evidence is that\n ‘\nThe demands and pressures on the Trust to perform better were reasonable\n’\n.\nThe \nGMC conclude ‘..\nthere is no evidence that the SHA could or should have allowed the Trust to derogate because of the demand and capacity problems\n’\nIt is difficult to conclude other than such \nanalysis is incompetent.\n&#xa0;\n Dr \nHakin\n is aware of the following\n:\n \nThis is a very significant point as Dr Hakin’s assertion that there was nothing unusual in Lincolnshire is then used to justify her other actions.The GMC had before it reports that ULHT was unusual due to \nits\n geography, witness statements confirming that new \nwards\n were to be built, data from Prof Sir Brian \nJarman\n showing that \nLincolnshire’s\n hospitals had significantly less available capacity to meet\n additional demand and reports fr\nom\n staff of the \nEMSHA\n expressing safety concerns arising from the \nhospitals\n being overfull.\nComments on Dr HakinIf Dr Hakin \nassert\ned\n that there was nothing different in terms of demand and capacity \nin Lincolnshire it would \nin our view \nbe de\nceitful and fall far short of the candour the Secretary of State is entitled to expect from a senior official.\n  There are few hospitals in the country where the position was so dire that additional wards had to be \nbuilt as a result of the PCT failing to reduce demand in accordance with its plans.\nComments on the GMCThe GMC had significant evidence before it to show that there were \nsevere \ndemand\n and capacity issues at ULHT\n and were of such magnitude that additional \nwards were to be built and were therefore were significantly worse than elsewhere\n.\nThe failure to recognise this is gross incompetence on behalf of the GMC but worse still it makes their remaining analysis fundamentally flawed\n as all of the rest of their a\nnalysis is based upon ULHT not having \nexceptional \ncapacity and demand problems\n.\n2.  The second assertion in her defence, Dr Hakin has claimed that all she was doing was following government policy and that as such she could not countenance any hospital failing to meet its targets.&#xa0; In March 2009 \nDr \nHakin sent an e mail to all East Midlands chief executives stating \n‘I need to make i\nt very clear that I expect you personally to ensure that your organisations deliver 100% for the next three weeks.... We cannot afford even one day when one single organisation falters.’\n \nThe GMC report states\n“\nHer [Dr Hakin] argument is that safety and ta\nrgets are inextricably linked and the complaint is based on a false dichotomy between the two\n.\nShe says she was accountable to the Chief Executive of the NHS, who in turn was accountable to the Secretary of State for compliance with targets, and that allow\ning Mr Walker's failure to meet the targets to go unchallenged would have been a breach of her statutory obligations, a dereliction of her duties as a doctor and denied patients' rights.\n'as a matter of basic common sense, it is inconceivable that an SHA C\nhairman could reasonably agree with a request from a Trust Chairman to objectives which envisage local abrogation of national targets', which she says would have disadvantaged patients in the area\n.\n”\nThis \nmisrepresents the arrangements that were in place.  \nIt was never intended that all hospitals be required to meet all targets at all times regardless of the circumstances.  \nI\nt was policy under a published Code of C\nonduct that if a hospital ha\nd\n met more than\n its contracted demand and cannot continue to meet t\nargets, then\n under a so called Capacity Review’ \nthe requirement to meet targets is temporarily suspended until for example new capacity can be built or other arrangements made.\n&#xa0;\n This \ninterpretation\n of the Code\n has been confirmed \nin writing \nby the D\no\nH.\n&#xa0;\n D\nr \nHakin appears to have \nwilfully ignored this \nCode \nand led others to believe that her demand to meet targets was consistent with government policy \nand the arrangements in force \nwhen it was not. \nWors\ne\n still given the learning from Mid Staffordshire\n,\n it is ex\ntraordinary that such a senior public official could take such a stance with hospitals so overcrowded and under pressure that there\n was a\n plan to build new wards.\nComment on HakinD\nr\n Hakin by both ignoring the Code of Conduct on Capacity Reviews\n \nand the fa\nct that the position at ULHT was such that \na Capacity R\neview\n (\nwhich would have resulted in the temporary suspension to meet targets\n)\n would be warranted\n, appears to have\n misled the GMC investigation\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nComment on the GMCThe analysis by the GMC \nin accepting Dr Hakin’s evidence \nwas incompetent.  It had \nreceived \nfrom witnesses explanations of what should happen in these circumstances and documents from the DoH confirming that targets should be temporarily suspended\n when Capacity Reviews are warrant\ned\n.  It also had data showing that the contractual situation at ULHT wo\nuld have more than justified a Capacity R\neview\n and the suspension of targets\n.\n3.  The third assertion is that a Capacity Review which would have to allow a derogation of targets was not blocked by Dr Hakin, and was not in any case warranted.The report states:\n“\nMr Bowles \n[the Chair of ULHT] \nrefers to raising a capacity review with both the PCT and the SHA and that there was an \"absolute flat out refusal', though he provides no evidence of the request to or the refusal by the SHA. Nonetheless, his evidence provides some limited support to the \nalleged fact of the refusal but no support as to the involvement of Dr Hakin.\n”\n \nIt then however says the evidence of Dr Hakin\n about this matter was:\n“\nas a matter of basic common sense, it is inconceivable that an SHA Chairman could reasonably agree with a \nrequest from a Trust Chairman to objectives which envisage local abrogation of national targets', which she says would have disadvantaged patients in the area\n \n…..\n”\nThe GMC report is internally inconsistent.  On the one ha\nn\nd\n,\n it sa\ny\ns there is little evidenc\ne of Dr Hakin’s refusal to support a Capacity Review but then contains evidence\n from Dr Hakin \n that she would not support a abrogation of a n\national target \nin any event \nwhich is \nprecisely \nwhat a C\napacity Review would have delivered.\n  Clearly Dr\n Hakin did not agree with a Capacity Review.\nThe GMC from the flawed analysis on the second assertion above clearly did not consider a Capacity Review necessary.  \nDespite the\n national code dealing with Capacity Reviews\n,\n it is astounding that the GMC do not\n question why Dr Hakin placed pressure on demonstrably struggling hospitals.\nComments on Dr HakinNotwithstanding the GMC report it is evident from Dr Hakin’s own evidence that she \ndid \nnot support a Capacity Review which would have suspended targets and ea\nsed concerns about safe care.\nComment on the GMCAs commented above the GMC had ample evidence before it to show that targets should have been\n suspended through a Capacity R\neview until new awards were built.  Furthermore it had before it the Code on Board \nAccountability which clearly state that it is a role of the SHA to ensure that the local plans meet the needs of the population.  \n4.  The fourth assertion is that no patients came to harm.The report states\n:\n“\nIn fact, there is very little evidence to \nindicate that there was any risk to patient safety caused by anything said by Dr Hakin to Mr Walker. There is no statistical or expert evidence to demonstrate that anything said or done by Dr Hakin contributed to any diminution in patient safety or care.\nM\nuch of the complaint appears to be founded on the dichotomy between safety and targets for which there is so little evidence\nWe found very little evidence that there was any risk or harm to patients\n”\nIn its analysis the GMC only looked at safety reviews \nbeing carried out in July 2009.\nThe complaint \nto\n the GMC was not about patients coming to harm in Ju\nly\n 2009, \nwhich \nappears to have been\n the focus of Dr \nHakin\n’\ns\n response\n. \n \nThe complaint was that the continued pursuit of targets would result in patients coming to harm and patients did come to harm.It was not claimed that the hospitals were unsafe in July 2009; indeed the reverse as the Board of ULHT, unlike Mid Staffordshire, had passed a resolution in June 2009 making it cle\nar that it would not pursue n\non-\nurgent targets at the risk of safety.  The issue \nof concern is\n what happened after Mr Walker \nand his Chairman were \neffectively removed some months later. \n&#xa0;\n It is clear that \nafter \nMr Walker’s\n removal \ntargets did \nstart \nto be pursued \nin a manner \nwhich comp\nromised safety. E\nvidence \nwas submitted to the GMC \nfrom the \nClinical Director of P\nlann\ned\n \nCare \ncomplaining\n,\n \nin \nearly \n2010\n,\n that following Mr Walker's removal\n as C\nhief \nE\nxecutive there had been a shift in emphasis to the pursuit of targets at the expense of safety.\n&#xa0;\n There is evidence that some patients did come to harm \nwith letters from clinicians specially referring to targets in those cases.  This correspondence was made\n available to the GMC\n which specifically identified cases and patient harm\n.\nI\nndeed considerable evidence\n exists \nof significant failures \nat\n ULHT from 201\n0/11\n onwards leading to \nULHT\n being one of 14 hospitals \nsubject to Keogh R\neview and \nis \nnow in special mea\nsures\n.\nComments on the GMCThe GMC narrowed the scope of its investigation to the period round July 2009, to the benefit of Dr Hakin. \nThe GMC had ample evidence before it to challenge \nsafety post July 2009.\n \n There were allegedly no warning signals to the r\nelevant SHA in the case of Mid Staffordshire.  The same cannot be said of ULHT.  The performance of ULHT in terms of the patient experience deteriorated sharply from 2010/11.\nThe GMC refused to take additional evidence when the Keogh report was issued.\n  Wh\nether this was\n just incompetence on behalf of the GMC or\n ‘political’ \nis\n not clear.  \nTaken together \nwith the \nthree assertions above\n,\n if \nour submission and the evidence of others\n had been properly examined the GMC could well have \nrevealed \nthat in a case \nliked to Mid Staffordshire there was evidence\n potentially implicating \na \nsenior \ndoctor\n \nin a top management post \nin either acts of commission or omission\n. Due to such failures an opportunity to intervene properly and ensure that the PCT worked to deliver a h\nealthcare system to meet the needs of Lincolnshire was lost\n.\n  Even worse the failure to intervene in an appropriate way led to patients coming to harm.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
