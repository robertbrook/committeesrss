[normal]Submission by Natural England[bold]Executive Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]              [bold]Introduction[bold].[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]Natural England is the 
[normal]Government’s statutory advis
[normal]e
[normal]r on the natural environment. Natural England’s purpose is to ensure that the natural environment is conserved, enhanced and managed for the benefit of present and future generations, thereby contributing to sustainable develop
[normal]ment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Natural England is responsible for delivering, on behalf of the 
[normal]Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
[normal] (Defra),
[normal] 
[normal]Environmental Stewardship 
[normal]and other 
[normal]schemes which offer payments to farmers and 
[normal]other 
[normal]land m
[normal]anagers in England for un
[normal]dertaking
[normal] land management
[normal] practices
[normal],
[normal] which
[normal] go beyond 
[normal]minimal regulatory compliance
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]to protect and enhance the environment and wildlife. These schemes form part of the 
[normal]current 
[normal]Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) (2007-20
[normal]13
[normal]).
[normal] Natural England 
[normal]delivers 
[normal]over 51,000 agri-environment agre
[normal]e
[normal]ments, covering about 70% of English agricultural land, which provide over £400m support 
[normal]each year 
[normal]for 
[normal]environmental
[normal] land management
[normal] by farmers and land managers
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Natural England is 
[normal]also 
[normal]Defra’s largest del
[normal]iverer of on-farm advice
[normal].
[normal] Our advisers deliver around 
[normal]13,000 farm visits each year
[normal] 
[normal]advising on a range of environmental, ecological, agronomic and management issues,
[normal] specialising
[normal] in helping farmers access funding streams for environmental land management and assessing the outcomes they deliver. We deliver our advice through face to face visits; to groups; through farm walks, demonstrations, farmer meetings and conferences. In addi
[normal]tion, we provide telephone support and on line services to farmers to support their delivery of our agri-environment
[normal] programmes
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]As well as delivering advice, we work closely with farmers to monitor the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes and the co
[normal]ntribution they make to environmental outcomes. These include the impacts on individual habitats and species; landscapes such as 
[normal]A
[normal]reas of 
[normal]O

[normal]The latest thinking on the design of future agri-environment schemes
[normal]

[normal]specific 
[normal]areas.
[normal]  A highly targeted site-specific offer for high priority sites on farmed land (e
[normal].
[normal]g
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]statutory designations such as SSSI
[normal]s), broadly 
[normal]analogous
[normal] to the existing higher level stewardship (HLS), is anticipated to remain.  
[normal]A more widely available element support
[normal]ing simple one-off investments designed to deliver environmental benefits is also being explored
[normal] by Defra
[normal]. 
[normal]The successor sch
[normal]eme is anticipated to launch du
[normal]ring 2
[normal]015 with the first agreements st
[normal]arting 
[normal]on the 
[normal]1
[normal]st
[normal] January 2016.
[normal] 
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he scale of the 
[normal]environmental challenge
[normal] is significant
[normal].  Delivering the 
[normal]Department’s 
[normal]B
[normal]iodiversity 2020 strategy (including
[normal] 
[normal]EU level 
[normal]commitments under the H
[normal]abi
[normal]tats and Birds Directives) and requirements under the Water Framework Directive have 
[normal]recently 
[normal]been 
[normal]estimated to co
[normal]st approximately £1bn/yr
[normal].  
[normal]Similar estimates have also been generated by previous work
[normal].  
[normal]This 
[normal]requirement 
[normal]is in excess of twice the funding available 
[normal]under
[normal] the current programme and
[normal],
[normal] although some alternative funding sources exist
[normal],
[normal] they are currently small scale
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he future RDPE will remain the main source of funding to deliver these policy objectives for the 
[normal]foreseeable
[normal] future.  
[normal]Consequently there will be a need for clear 
[normal]and transparent 
[normal]prioritisation
[normal] 
[normal]between 
[normal]different policy obje
[normal]ctives 
[normal]and also scheme targeting processes that seek to exploit the maximum synergy 
[normal]across the 
[normal]delivery of policy objectives wherever possible.
[normal]1.6
[normal]              
[normal]The framework of EU legislation that will govern the future CAP is becoming clearer
[normal].  H
[normal]owever, there are man
[normal]y outstanding issues that will be significant considerations for implementation 
[normal]and 
[normal]which remain to be clarified as part of the Implementing Regulations and Delegated Acts.  Many domestic policy decisions that 
[normal]will
[normal] impact on the implementation of the futur
[normal]e CAP also remain to be taken. Without this detail the scope to finalise implementation planning is limited at this stage.  It is also important to note that 
[normal]Defra 
[normal]is leading work to develop the new 
[normal]digitalised CAP services 
[normal]to support delivery of the futur
[normal]e CAP and 
[normal]has yet to confirm the detailed 
[normal]release and 
[normal]delivery arrangements for the future 
[normal]service
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is within this context that our evidence is provided.  
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]Fairness[bold].[bold]2.1
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Ultimately f
[normal]airness 
[normal]can be considered at 
[normal]many different scales and levels 
[normal]and 
[normal]is 
[normal]a 
[normal]function of 
[normal]policy decision
[normal]s
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Throughout the whole process of negotiations, Defra Ministers have been at pains to stress that the CAP reform must be ‘fair’ for the environment, taxpayers
[normal] and
[normal] consumers, as well as farmers
[normal]  The implementation of the r
[normal]eforms clearly must retain this broad perspective, balancing any conflicting pressures among these different actors to ensure the most effective attainment of explicit Government policy priorities. 
[normal]In the context 
[normal]of future 
[normal]CAP
[normal] 
[normal]implementation two broad type
[normal]s of issue arise: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]Modulation[bold]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Any consideration of fairness 
[normal]in this context 
[normal]also 
[normal]needs to take into account the underlying distribution of Pillar 2 
[normal]funds between Member
[normal] States.  This continues to be based on ‘historic’ patterns of spend pre-2000, rather than any objective criteria that reflect the need for spending to achieve defined policy objective
[normal]s
[normal] through Pillar 2 support,
[normal] and results in an
[normal] extremely low UK Pillar 2 
[normal]allocation.  
[normal]Conversely
[normal],
[normal] the UK Pillar 1 allocation is close to the EU average (although there are significant differences both within the UK and between 
[normal]EU countries
[normal] and indeed, between the payment regions within England
[normal])
[normal].  
[normal]These distributional issues hav
[normal]e been subject to extensive analysis
[normal]. 
[normal] Therefore, a
[normal]ny transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 needs to be considered in this context 
[normal]- 
[normal]as
[normal] 
[normal]utilising
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]fl
[normal]exibility of EU-level regulation
[normal] to better reflect domes
[normal]tic circumstances and 
[normal]priorities
[normal].  
[normal]A
[normal] 
[normal]reduction
[normal] in the level of modulation 
[normal]resulting in reduced Pillar 2 budgets 
[normal]could effectively penalise 
[normal]those already doing the right thing by the environment and their expectations regarding ongoing access to Pillar 2 funding.
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Regardless of the underlying positi
[normal]on t
[normal]here is n
[normal]o evidence that modulation during 
[normal]the 
[normal]current period has resulted in 
[normal]any 
[normal]comp
[normal]etitive
[normal] disadvantage
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as a study for the European Commission has demonstrated
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]There are many 
[normal]factors, such as exchange rate
[normal] fluctuations and national taxation polic
[normal]ies
[normal], 
[normal]which
[normal] drive the relative competitiveness of farming in different countries.  
[normal]Furthermore
[normal] there is also good evidence that spending on Pillar 2 delivers both agronomic and economic benefits
[normal] in addition to enviro
[normal]nmental ones
[normal] 
[normal].
[normal]  For example 
[normal]£1m of 
[normal]HLS
[normal] expenditure generates 
[normal]2.3
[normal] 
[normal]FTE 
[normal]additional 
[normal]jobs 
[normal]and 
[normal]£1
[normal].72m additional 
[normal]spending in the local economy
[normal] (compared to no-scheme).  
[normal]Based on anticipated annual scheme spend i
[normal]n 2013 ES will sustain 778 jobs and 
[normal]generate 
[normal]£415m of spending in the local economy.
[normal]  The majority of these 
[normal]income and employment benefits are retained within the local economy (80%). 
[normal] [bold]              [bold]Environmental ambition of greening[bold]2.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]The context for considering the most appropriate domestic implementation of
[normal] the greening provisions can be usefully framed in the Government response to the EFRA Committee’s previous ‘Greening
[normal] the CAP
[normal]’ inquiry. In its response, the Government agreed with the Committee’s assertion that the Commission’s ‘one size fits all’ approach
[normal] was too rigid and that it did not take into account variations in environmental circumstances or agronomic conditions
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]The response also allowed the Government to reaffirm its commitment to “ensure a better balance of benefits to costs from greening” and to continue to work to “secure greater flexibility in recognition of Member State’s agricultural and agronomic diversity
[normal]” 
[normal].
[normal]2. 
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]provisions for 
[normal]greening
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]agreed 
[normal]as part of the consolidated legislative text
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]provide
[normal] considerable scope for a wide-range of implementation options from the basic practices through a range of spe
[normal]cified ‘equivalent’ options or the alternative
[normal] of a 
[normal]more flexible 
[normal]certification scheme
[normal] approach
[normal].  
[normal]In this respect Defra negotiators deserve praise for securing the ability to use a more flexible national certification scheme approach as the sole route to farmers meeting their greening obligations. 
[normal]How
[normal]ever, 
[normal]it looks increasingly likely that the 
[normal]implement
[normal]ation of
[normal] greening in England 
[normal]will be 
[normal]based 
[normal]solely 
[normal]on the 
[normal]three 
[normal]basic greening practices.  
[normal]Our analysis 
[normal]suggests that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]under this scenario,
[normal] the overwhelming majority of farms will have to do little, if anything, to comply with the b
[normal]asic greening requirements
[normal] and 
[normal]that greening in this form is unlikely to deliver measurable environmental benefits.  We 
[normal]elaborate on the other potential implicatio
[normal]ns of such an implementation decision

[normal]

[normal]              
[normal]Until now, t

[normal] monthly start dates.  
[normal]However, t
[normal]he
[normal] new

[normal]will

[normal] is

[normal] at the earliest
[normal], it is 
[normal]not 
[normal]going to be 
[normal]p
[normal]racticable
[normal] to establish new multi-annual agreements in time
[normal] for a 1
[normal]st
[normal] January 2015 start.  
[normal]New multi-annual agreements under the future programme will not be available until 1
[normal]st
[normal] January 2016.  
[normal]No 
[normal]existing

[normal]  
[normal]It is important to remember that 
[normal]multi-annual agreements are only one part of the 
[normal]future 
[normal]programme and 
[normal]that, subject to programme approval
[normal] and policy decisions
[normal], 
[normal]it should be possible

[normal]to offer

[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]An inevitable consequence of a move away 
[normal]towards a more focused and targeted 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]is 
[normal]t
[normal]hat agreements under the landscape scale element of the future scheme will be 
[normal]more 
[normal]concentrated in certain geographical areas (reflecting the policy objective being add
[normal]ressed)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]greements under the site-specific element will 
[normal]largely 
[normal]be 
[normal]focused on existing high value sites.  
[normal]This is a necessary consequence of improving the environmental effectiveness of the scheme. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]the other elements 
[normal]of the Programme 
[normal]such as 
[normal]adv
[normal]ice
[normal], training and capital 
[normal]works 
[normal]should, subject to policy decisions, 
[normal]be more universally available. 
[normal]Future digital [bold]delivery[bold]2.1
[normal]0
[normal]              
[normal]Defra ha
[normal]s
[normal] taken the decision that 
[normal]access to 
[normal]all 
[normal]future 
[normal]CAP schemes
[normal] will be through digital channels
[normal].  Natural England already 
[normal]ha
[normal]s
[normal] extensive experience of operating a voluntary online application process for ELS
[normal],
[normal] with 16,791 applications submitted via ELS online to
[normal] 
[normal]date
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]In 2012/13
[normal],
[normal] 42% of applications were submitted online
[normal] and 
[normal]89% of customers providing feedback rated the overal
[normal]l quality of ELS online as good or excellent
[normal].  
[normal]However, a mandated digital approach raises further implementation issues which are yet to be resolved
[normal], including
[normal]:
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]Bureaucracy[bold] [bold]What st[bold]ep[bold]s does the Government need to take to ensure the reformed CAP will be less bureaucratic than its predecessor and what might prevent this ambition from being achieved[bold]?
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]It is 
[normal]i
[normal]mportant to 
[normal]note that a
[normal] 
[normal]narrow 
[normal]comparison of 
[normal]the 
[normal]public and private 
[normal]administrative burden 
[normal]of different elem
[normal]ents of the CAP 
[normal]fails to recognise the value to society of the 
[normal]public goods
[normal] that are being delivered. 
[normal] 
[normal]This is especially true for Pillar 2 
[normal]where a
[normal] narrow focus on simplification
[normal]/reducing delivery cost
[normal] risks being detrimental to the delivery of environmental outcomes.  
[normal]On this point w
[normal]e note the 
[normal]useful guiding principl
[normal]e
[normal] provided in
[normal] the March 2011 Agriculture Council paper on simplification, which was
[normal] roundly supported by the UK and around three-quarters of EU Member States
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t reads: 
[normal]“An acceptable justification for increased cost might include better targeting of funding towards th
[normal]e provision of public goods, or a reduction in risk to EU funds – providing these benefits exceed the costs of achieving that”

[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]The addition of gre
[normal]ening in Pillar 1 is almost certain to 
[normal]add to, rather than reduce, 
[normal]the overall level of complexity
[normal] and administrative burden (for applicants and delivery bodies alike)
[normal].  From 
[normal]a Pillar 2 
[normal]delivery body perspective this is likely 
[normal]to add complexity in the following ways:

[normal]during the current programme and has also gained Customer Service Excellence (CSE) accreditation
[normal]. Our current average customer satisfaction rating is 84%
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Natural England has considerably improved the way in which we offer HLS agreements to farmers over the past few years. We have gone from a reactive stance at the start of HLS in 2006, providing only broad-brush targeting advice, to a much more proactive ap
[normal]proach.  We have published detailed advice on the HLS opportunities in local areas.  We now discuss opportunities for potential HLS agreements with farmers and agents at local “clinics” 
[normal]before
[normal] they have to embark on detailed applications. This is followed-
[normal]up with detailed, on-farm advice when the suggested HLS applications are taken forward.

[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]Greening[bold]How should the Government ensure that CAP delivers the best environmental benefits while supporting food production[bold]?[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]We fully appreciate the considerable delivery challenge and disallowance risk that implementing greening (in any form) by 2015 represents 
[normal]and that this favours an implementation based on the basic greening measures
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]at least in the short-term 
[normal](see Defra’s 
[normal]forthcoming consultation)
[normal].  I
[normal]ndeed we face challenges handling the interface between existing agri-environment agreements and greening to ensure that there is no double funding
[normal] between greening and agri-environment payments
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]However,
[normal] 
[normal]such an 
[normal]implementation of greening 
[normal]is unlikel
[normal]y t
[normal]o generate measurable environmen
[normal]tal benefits
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In this context 
[normal]it will be critical that implementation decisions across the whole of the future CAP represent the 
[normal]best 
[normal]overall 
[normal]balance between minimising the public an
[normal]d private costs of delivery, minimising the risk of disallowance and maximising the 
[normal]delivery of 
[normal]environmental 
[normal]public goods
[normal] for society from public funding.
[normal] A comprehensive programme of environmental monitoring and evaluation of greening
[normal],
[normal] to enable an accur
[normal]ate assessment of the environmental benefits 
[normal]of the policy
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]will also be 
[normal]important.

[normal]              
[normal]The relationship between sustainability and agricultural production is sometimes referred to as a balance or trade-off
[normal]: there is an assumption that actions taken to improve environmental performance decrease production and 
[normal]vice versa
[normal].  Sometimes this is the case, but often production is only increased in the short term or requires significant additional inputs.  Integrate
[normal]d actions resulting in win-win outcomes are possible, enhancing both farming’s sustainability and its productivity.  In addition, the services provided by the natural environment are vital to production.  Sustainability, by definition, is a necessary pre-r
[normal]equisite of ongoing agricultural productivity.
[normal] Evidence demonstrates that the l
[normal]onger-term sustainability of food production 
[normal]is inherently linked to the 
[normal]integration of environmental 
[normal]and agronomic 
[normal]priorities
[normal]. 
[normal]4.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]E
[normal]xperience from current delivery has demons
[normal]trated that delivering 
[normal]the majority of
[normal] 
[normal]environmental 
[normal]objectives 
[normal]effectively is inherently complex 
[normal]and that Pillar 2 is 
[normal]generally 
[normal]the best tool for supporting this.  
[normal]There is no evidence that voluntary environmental land management agreements under Pillar 2 
[normal]have any significant 
[normal]negative 
[normal]impact on levels of food production or productivity
[normal] 
[normal]– the majority of evidence indicates that 
[normal]they
[normal] actually contribute to sustainable 
[normal]production eg floristic margins 
[normal]supporting
[normal] pollinators
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]Lessons learnt[bold]What are the principal lessons the Government should learn from the implementation of the previous CAP[bold]?[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]A r
[normal]ange of lessons learned reviews 
[normal]were 
[normal]undertaken, principally of Pillar
[normal] 1 implementation
[normal], following the 
[normal]previous
[normal] reform
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The delivery of activity under Pillar 2 of the CAP, especially Environmental Stewardship, has typically been less problematic.
[normal] 
[normal] The mid-term evaluation (MTE) of the current rural development programme
[normal] con
[normal]cluded that “
[normal]Axis 2 Measures 
[normal][
[normal]Improving the environment and countryside
[normal]]
[normal] have generally performed well, with outputs and results in line with targets and
[normal] 
[normal]broadly positive feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders
[normal]”
[normal].
[normal]6[bold].[bold]              [bold]Conclusion[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The limited 
[normal]core 
[normal]Pillar 2 budget 
[normal]that is likely to be 
[normal]available in England 
[normal]coupled with the scale of environmental need means that it will be important that 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]implementation decisions, such as 
[normal]the transfer
[normal] 
[normal]of funds 
[normal]from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 and the design of greenin
[normal]g in 
[normal]P
[normal]illar 1, represent the 
[normal]best 
[normal]overall 
[normal]balance between 
[normal]minimising 
[normal]the public and private costs of delivery
[normal], 
[normal]minimising the risk of disallowance
[normal] and 
[normal]maximising the 
[normal]environmental benefits for society
[normal] from public funding
[normal]. 
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]Agri-environment schemes in P
[normal]illar 2 have a proven track record of delivering environmental benefits and help to support the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems.  However, even with the maximum 
[normal]permitted 
[normal]rate of transfer from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2
[normal] 
[normal]and a future RDPE focused
[normal] on the delivery of environmental objectives it will not be possible 
[normal]for the future
[normal] programme
[normal] 
[normal]to satisfy all 
[normal]environmental policy objectives 
[normal]and there will be a need for clear and transparent
[normal] prioritisation
[normal] between objectives.
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]Natural England has 
[normal]overseen the ongoing evolution and dev
[normal]elopment of agri-environmen
[normal]t schem
[normal]es during the current programme. We have successfully delivered improvements to scheme design intended to improve environmental effectiveness alongside
[normal] 
[normal]improved customer satisfaction a
[normal]nd significant 
[normal]efficiency savings
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]6.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]Natural England is working closely with D
[normal]efra, the Rural Payments Agency, Forestry Commission, Environment Agency and stakeholders 
[normal]to ensure that the transition to and implementation of the future environmental land 
[normal]management scheme under the next RDPE is a smooth as possible. 
[normal]We are also working hard to simplify 
[normal]the design of the scheme and simultaneously improve its environmental effectiveness.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]However, t
[normal]here remain considerable implementation challenges that can 
[normal]only be 
[normal]fully 
[normal]addressed when 
[normal]there is greater clarity about the 
[normal]EU
[normal] legal framework and domestic policy decisions have been confirmed.
