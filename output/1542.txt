&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Peter G Rayner (SLC 003)&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;&#xa0; We have many years’ experience of Level Crossing design, maintenance and operation and we have both given evidence at a number of Inquiries concerning rail safety.  Notably Lord Cullens Inquiries into the Paddington Accident and Professor Uff’s Inquiry into the Southall train crash, and many others.  Additionally have chaired or been members of countless Inquiries into railway accidents.  Our CV’s are available if required.1.2 We are offering this evidence because we have been involved in two recent accidents which        concern level crossing operation.  In addition we expressed concerns regarding the safety of a level crossing in Nottingham in a detailed private correspondence with the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) which correspondence others chose to put in the public domain.1.3 We are aware reference to our involvement has been mentioned by the Union TSSA in a  written submission from the General Secretary Manuel Cortes.  Also that our correspondence with the ORR has been forwarded to the Rail Accident and Inquiry Bureau (RAIB) in connection with yet another Level Crossing Incident.1.4 It should be known we have not written this submission on behalf of nor in collusion with any other party and do so only in the interests of railway safety.&#xa0;

[[[2.1]]] 

[[[Are current safety measures at Level Crossings adequate?  How should they be improved?]]]2.1.1 The regulations presently in place for signalled level crossings of various specified types is adequate.  The position could be improved by a review to ensure all crossings are in fact signalled in accordance with the regulations and that the required electrical or mechanical locking is in place.&#xa0;2.1.2 Examples exist, notably illustrated by the Moreton on Lugg accident where adequate protection was not in place.  This is a key issue and our concern is the culture that is now developing in the railway industry.&#xa0;2.1.3 Following the Clapham Accident on 12th Dec 1988 Antony Hidden QC made recommendations that were accepted by the industry.  One of the most important was No 50 which stated:  “BR shall ensure that the organisational framework exists to prevent commercial considerations of a business led railway from compromising safety”&#xa0;It is our view that commercial considerations surrounding the installation of Approach Locking, a standard procedure, prevented that safe system being applied despite knowledge within the industry that it was missing.

[[[In addition to Bridges and underpasses what other cost effectiv]]]

[[[e measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at Level Crossings?]]]2.2.1 The safety of footpath crossings remains an area of concern.  Modern trains are faster and quieter as investment takes place in new rolling stock.  Commercial considerations must not inhibit the provision of Red/ Green warning lights and audible warnings being provided.  Complaints of noise from local residents should not result in audible warnings being reduced.&#xa0;2.2.2 In the case of Bayles and Wylies Crossing on Nottingham Tramway, due to public complaints and indeed commercial considerations a contrived Risk Assessment allowed a deeply flawed arrangement to be put in place.&#xa0;2.2.3 Elsewhere on the Tramway, crossings have been dealt with correctly and safely.  This Crossing could have remained  a crossing, provided it was correctly signed and installed.&#xa0;2.2.4 The correspondence surrounding this case is referred to in 1.2 of this evidence.  (We assume the Committee has the correspondence from others.)&#xa0;

[[[How should expendi]]]

[[[ture on improving safety at level crossings be prioriti]]]

[[[sed]]]

[[[ in relation to other demands on the rail budget?]]]2.3.1 We have no views to express on this difficult issue other than to acknowledge the problem and be thankful that we no longer have to address it.  However the situation might be improved if the costs of improving or removing level crossings could be shared by road budgets if the net effect of bridges or underpasses reflected improvements to vehicle and pedestrian flows.2.3.2 It might be possible for the provision of basic safety interlockings to be installed in a less costly way by not using expensive high technology solutions.2.3.3 Too often assessments for simple procedures produce prohibitive costs to the overall detriment of a safe railway.  However, to attempt to now “turn the clock back” is to expose oneself to criticism and being “out of touch”.

[[[2.4 ]]]

[[[Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority at level crossings?]]]2.4.1 Firstly we accept the historical practices and acknowledge Level Crossings for pedestrians in particular are a difficult area because custom and practice, design and installation has grown up over more than 100 years.  Thus an arrangement in one part of the country is different from that in another location particularly with methods of locking wicket gates and other devices.2.4.2 The accident at Elsenham in 2005 and more recent examples indicate there is a need for the safe bringing together of systems to ensure safety is paramount.  The Elsenham case points to a cost cutting exercise in that only one side of the line was it possible to purchase tickets.  Thus the children crossed the line to purchase tickets before boarding the train resulting in their death.2.4.3 An in house review of different geographical locations, the history and position of level crossings in those different locations with a view to best procedure would be sensible.2.4.4 Network Rail we believe is addressing this problem, details are not known to us but we would not recommend the employment of Consultants.  Expertise exists within Network Rail to address the issue which in view of the different types in existence is a difficult one to address.2.4.5 In this context we believe the present risks model used by the Industry (ORR and NR) called ACRAM (All Level Crossing Risk Model) is flawed in that it covers in great detail road and pedestrian user but pays little attention to Rail levels of traffic, frequency and speed of trains.

[[[Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety and level crossings adequate?  What more should the Government and ORR do?]]]2.5.1 Care must be taken to ensure there is clear water between the Engineers of similar professions employed within each organisation.2.5.2 One of the problems arising more and more is the lessening of the role of Railway Operator.  The Engineering culture is paramount and it has been forgotten that traditionally railway safety was vested in the Superintendent of the Line, latterly known as the Chief Operating Manager, a qualified operator with the equivalent knowledge comparable with the ticket of a Master Mariner at sea.2.5.3 That office had to work with three engineering disciplines, Mechanical and Electrical Engineers, Civil Engineers and Signalling Engineers, all of whom are different and equally important.2.5.4 That culture has to a great extent has been lost.  For example the decision not to provide vital interlocking at Moreton on Lugg was taken without any discussions with railway operating experts.  It was also taken without any detailed knowledge on the risks of human error.  We believe both organisations i.e. ORR and NR are fit for purpose and have difficult but different tasks.2.5.5 It is our view that operating expertise should reside within NR and not be left to the ORR to pick up.  Historically the industry prided itself in its professionalism and felt shame if found wanting  by the Railway Inspectorate, the predecessors of the ORR.

[[[How should the ]]]

[[[legislation governing]]]

[[[ level crossings be updated?]]]2.6.1 There is no need for further legislation unless it is thought extra powers should be given to ensure land owners give up little used farm crossings if sensible alternative routes exist for them to use their land.  Many of these crossings date back to the late nineteenth century.

[[[2.7 ]]]

[[[How should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?]]]2.7.1 On-going publicity such as school visits, posters, adverts etc. and perhaps television campaigns regarding reckless motoring.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
