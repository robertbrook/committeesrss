defaultSummarydefault: There is some good work being done in the field of climate science and some of this is well summarised in the IPCC AR5 WG1 Report; unfortunately the IPCC report is marred by a misleading presentation, with some distortion of the facts and spin, particula
defaultrly in the Summary for Policymakers. This is unscientific and casts doubt on the validity of the exercise and the credibility of the IPCC.

default1. I am an applied mathematician with expertise in fluid dynamics, mathematical modelling and computer simulation.
default I have not worked directly in the field of climate science but have been following the field with interest for the last 5 years. This brief document is submitted in a personal capacity. I confine my attention to the first six bullet points of the committe
defaulte's terms of reference, discussing questions such as the robustness of the conclusions, scope to question the conclusions, range of views, uncertainty and reliability of models, and the pause in warming. I have no expertise on economic or policy aspects. O
defaultn this point, the Committee should note that the IPCC itself is not supposed to comment on policy (from the IPCC website, “
defaultThe work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive
default”).
default&#xa0;
default2. A key headline fro
defaultm the IPCC Report, emphasized in the Summary for Policymakers (SPM is
default“
defaultIt is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of  the observed warming since the mid-20th century
default.” This terminology “extremely likely” means at least 95% cert
defaultainty. This has been sold by the IPCC as an increase in confidence over its previous report, AR4 (2007), where the corresponding terminology was “
defaultvery likely
default” (90% certain). However, a closer examination of the wording shows that the goalposts have been mo
defaultved. The AR4 statement referred to man-made greenhouse gases, while the AR5 one refers to greenhouse gases “
defaultand other anthropogenic 
defaultforcings
default”.  Thus the IPCC is not comparing like with like. 
default&#xa0;
default3. When we turn to the chapter providing the detail behind the 
default95% claim (Chapter 10), we find that the statement there is “
defaultMore than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) from 1951 to 2010 is very likely due to the observed anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations
default” - I
defaultn other words, the 90% claim, as in AR4, showing in fact no increase in confidence. One climate scientist, Dr Judith Curry, has suggested at her blog that the IPCC is deliberately trying to mislead readers, with its statement in the SPM.
default&#xa0;
default4. Searching thro
defaultugh Chapter 10 for detailed justification of this claim, there seems to be very little. In fact a bizarre figure (Fig 10.5) appears to show wide error bars for man-made greenhouse gases and aerosols, but much smaller error bars for the combination of the t
defaultwo. This makes no sense – unless that IPCC had decided in advance that the warming was man-made, but was not sure how to split it between the different contributions.
default&#xa0;
default5. AR4 (2007) made a confident statement in its SPM:  “
defaultFor the next two decades, a warmi
defaultng of about
default 0.2°C per decade is projected for a range of SRES
default emission scenarios
default”.  This projection is looking distinctly unlikely, since there has been no warming whatsoever now 
defaultfor over a decade. The IPCC does not make any comment on this in the AR5 S
defaultPM, nor does it make any similar statement this time, suggesting a decrease in confidence.  Given the lack of any warming since the last report, and the increasing numbers of scientific papers by mainstream climate scientists pointing out discrepancies bet
defaultween observations and models, any rational scientist would conclude that confidence in the claims made by the IPCC should have decreased since the last report, not increased.
default&#xa0;
default6. Table SPM1 compares AR5 statements with corresponding ones for AR4. It is cle
defaultar from this that there has been a reduction of confidence, for example on the discussion of the link between climate change and tropical cyclones and droughts. The table claims that there has been an increase in cyclone in the North Atlantic since 1970, b
defaultut this is an example of misleading cherry-picking by the IPCC. Looking at  a longer time-scale shows no trend, and other ocean basins show no trend (using the IPCC's own data, fig 2.34.
default&#xa0;
default7. An example of the misleading presentation of the data is IPCC fig
defaulture SPM 1a.  This peculiar graph shows the annual temperature graph in its upper half, but a 'decadal mean' graph in the lower half. In the decadal mean graph, the slowing of temperature rise over the last decade is hidden. This in itself is not so worryin
defaultg (although the graph serves no useful purpose). However, in talks on the IPCC Report, the WG1 co-chair Thomas Stocker has only shown the lower half of the graph, deliberately hiding the slow-down in warming from his audience. This again appears to be a de
defaultliberate attempt to mislead.  Note that this odd graph was not included in the draft SPM that was reviewed by scientists, it was inserted into the final version.
default&#xa0;
default8. Another example of misleading cherry-picked presentation of data concerns the claims about
default snow cover. It is stated that “
defaultNorthern Hemisphere snow cover extent decreased 1.6 [0.8 to 2.4] % per decade for March and April, and 11.7 [8.8 to 14.6] % per decade for June, over the 1967–2012 period.
default” A graph is shown, also only showing snow cover for 
defaultthe months of March and April. What is not mentioned is the fact that for the winter months, there has actually been an increase in snow cover.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default9. Conclusion: These are just a few examples of the misleading distortion of the truth employed by the IPCC. 
defaultThis type of behaviour is completely unacceptable in science, which requires, in the words of Richard Feynman,  “
defaulta kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty - a kind of leaning over backward
defaults
default”.  Sadly, today's climate scientists do not appear to live up to Feynman's standards, and regrettably therefore it has to stated that politicians and policymakers need to be very cautious before accepting their conclusions.
