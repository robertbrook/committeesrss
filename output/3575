[normal]Supplementary written evidence submitted by Kelly Butler, BEAMA (HOT0060)[bold]I was asked at the Select Committee this week what my views were on shifting ECO into a different levy structure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]As I said at Committee, we are supportive of the supplier delivery model which is tried and tested for many years. They have purchasing power, routes to customers and marketing weight.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However, we do feel that it may be more transparent for customers to pursue the old Standards of Performance approach which was a fixed price levy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This means the suppliers are tasked to meet their obligations at a pre-d
[normal]e
[normal]termined price point.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Under this approach the suppliers cannot apply wildly varying levies on to the customer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The positive is that we retain the target based obligation but with a cost ceiling.
