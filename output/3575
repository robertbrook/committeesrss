defaultSupplementary written evidence submitted by Kelly Butler, BEAMA (HOT0060)defaultI was asked at the Select Committee this week what my views were on shifting ECO into a different levy structure.

defaultAs I said at Committee, we are supportive of the supplier delivery model which is tried and tested for many years. They have purchasing power, routes to customers and marketing weight.
default&#xa0;
default However, we do feel that it may be more transparent for customers to pursue the old Standards of Performance approach which was a fixed price levy.
default&#xa0;
default This means the suppliers are tasked to meet their obligations at a pre-d

defaulttermined price point.
default&#xa0;
default Under this approach the suppliers cannot apply wildly varying levies on to the customer.
default&#xa0;
default The positive is that we retain the target based obligation but with a cost ceiling.
