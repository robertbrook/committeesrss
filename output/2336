defaultThe issue of 
defaultdisproportionately high numbers of looked after children in the youth 
defaultjustice system
default is one that the YJB is currently 
defaultaddressing on a number of levels, which will be detailed below.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.
default              
defaultThe role of the YJB is to oversee the youth justice system in England and Wales.  The statutory responsibilities of the YJB incl
defaultude:
default4.
default              
defaultWhile the YJB is responsible for overseeing the performance of youth justice services including multi-agency Youth Offending Teams (YOT
defaults) and secure accommodation providers, 
defaultthe 
defaultYJB does not directly manage any of the services.
default5. 
default              
defaultThe Committee will be aware that Looked After Children (LAC) are disproportionately represented within the youth justice system. Less than 1% of all children i
defaultn England and Wales are looked after at any one time, yet up to one half of all children held in young offenders institutions are, or have previously been, looked after. 
defaultLast year t
defaulthe YJB work
defaulted
default with a virtual reference group of YOT practitioners, and have engaged in discussion with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Magistrates’ Association to draw together evidence of the key issues facing many young people in care, and specifical
defaultly those in residential children’s homes, that unfairly increase the likelihood of them ending up within the youth justice system. 
default6.
default              
defaultThese 
defaultkey issuesdefault are:
default- 
defaultrespond to challenging behaviour within children’s homes without relying on the 
defaultpolice
default, and;
default- 
defaulteffectively support a young person through a community sentence, leading to disproportionately high breach rates;
default&#xa0;
defaultPolice and courts do
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt have flexibility in charging and sen
defaulttencing decisions for minor offences committed by looked-after children and the corporate parent sometimes fails to fulfil their duties towards young people in court;
defaultOngoing issues with poor care placement decisions that c
defaultan place children at risk of harm to themselves or others, leading to offending
default;
defaultPoor communication and information sharing between placement authorities, YOTs and other children’s services
default;
defaultThe complex legislative rules concerning which young people hit the criteria as a ‘
defaultcareleaver
default’, mean that there are many young people in the youth justice system who do not receive this vital transitional support, and are therefore more likely to conti
defaultnue to offend as adults, leading to the disproportionate representation of 
defaultcareleavers
default in the adult prison population (over 25% of the adult population has previously been in care).  Offending rates amongst the general population have significantly reduced
default amongst children and young people in the last 5 years, but the gap between looked after children and all children has remained, and they continue to be more than twice as likely to offend. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;

defaultThe
default developments which have within the youth justice system
default to begin to t
defaultackle the issues outlined above are summarised below together with the key challenges that remain. These challenges can only be addressed long term through
default partnership working across Gov
defaulternment, and a commitment from all partners to tackle the issues surrounding looked after children, will we be able to create long term positive change.

default              
defaultThe 
defaultYJB continues to work closely with Government Departments and youth justice services to improve the system.
default Particular progress has been made regarding behaviour management and the use of restraint across the Secure Estate. The
default use of restorative justice is also a key feature of youth justice practice, and is one in which many local youth offending teams have developed an ‘expertise’.

default.
default              
defaultThe YJB would therefore recommend that
default:
default10
default.
default              
defaultA working group has recently been established by the Department for Education (
defaultDfE
default) to review the qualifications fra
defaultmework for residential home staff. Currently, there are significant numbers of staff who have not achieved the basic NVQ Level 3 qualification to work with children and young people. This has led to a workforce who feels unprepared for dealing with the mos
defaultt challenging of behaviours, and young people who are not managed appropriately, leading to high numbers of placement breakdown and higher arrest and conviction rates. The YJB is a member of the working group, and is working with 
defaultDfE
default to ensure that the qua
defaultlifications framework includes a clear and explicit focus on the needs of children and young people in the youth justice system. 
default11
default.
default              
defaultCurrently, young people completing a community order while they are in care do not receive the same level of support as yo
defaultung people living with their parents. This leads to higher than average breach rates
default, which then creates further convictions and an increased risk of a custodial sentence. As part of the qualifications framework review, the YJB would recommend that there 
defaultis a specific module focusing on the youth justice system, to raise awareness of the implications of failure to provide the appropriate support.  A working protocol between the local youth offending team and residential placement which outlines roles and r
defaultesponsibilities of respective members of staff would further support improvements in practice.

default              
defaultFrequent and inappropriate out of area placements increase a young person’s risk of offending and vulnerability; as highlighted by 
defaultthe high profile reports from the Office of the Children’s Commissioner (OCC) 
defaulton 
defaultchild sexual exploitation in 
defaultgangs and groups
default and the Joint All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) Inquiry on
default children who go missing from care. These reports 
defaultoutline
default particular concerns about the care of children who were placed, often at short notice, in children’s homes a long way fr
defaultom the authorities responsible for their care. Children in such circumstances were vulnerable to going missing from their placements and could be targeted for exploitation. 
default20.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultDfE
default has been proactive in tackling this issue, and recently two key consul
defaulttations were launched 
defaultwhich consider proposals to amend the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England
default) Regulations 2010. The
default propos
defaulted
default amendments 
defaultare designed 
defaultto ensure that where looked after children are placed out of authority in distant placemen
defaultts they are effectively safeguarded and their welfare is promoted. 
defaultThe YJB has completed a response to the consultation, and welcomes the proposals. 
defaultThe second consultation proposes to amend the Children’s Homes Regulations 2001 (as amended) (“the Children
default’s Homes Regulations”), with a related amendment to the Care Standards Act 2000 (Registration) (England) Regulations 2010 (“the Registration Regulations”), and a minor amendment to the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 (covered at paragraph 12)
default (“the Fostering Services Regulations”). 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe amendments are necessary to improve collaboration and partnership between children’s homes and services in their local communities so that there are effective safeguards in place for the vulnerable group of chi
defaultldren relying on residential care.
default The YJB welcomes the proposed changes.
default21.
default              
defaultSpecific consideration needs to be given to the issues faced when a young person is placed ‘over the border’ in Wales or vice versa. 
defaultAs the Welsh Government and 
defaultDfE
default are increasin
defaultgly working to different sets of regulations, it is important that they work together to ensure consistency
default of pr
defaultactice for this group of young people, who otherwise run the risk of ‘falling through the net’.

defaultThe YJB 
defaulthas identified and disseminated pr

defaultIdefaultnformation sharing between local agencies  default&#xa0;default23
default.
default              
defaultPoor communication and information sharing between placement authorities, YOTs and other children’s services
default has been an unfortunate feature of care for looked after children for many years. There are a number 
defaultof in
defaulti
defaulttiatives underway to improve practic
defaulte, and the YJB have been involved in developing each of these. Firstly
default th
defaulte Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 proposes to amend current arrangements 
defaultfor out of borough placements 
defaultwh
defaultich can result a host authority receiving 
defaultnotification 
defaultafter a child 
defaulthas been 
defaultplaced. 
default&#xa0;
default24
default.
default              
defaultIt is proposed 
defaultplacing authorities 
defaultwill be required 
defaultto consult with the authority where the child will be placed, prior to placement. The consultation document also proposes to ensure effective notification
default arrangements are in place, and that all relevant services are consulted as part of the assessment of the potential move. The YJB has strongly recommended that where a young person is open to youth justice supervision, consultation with the home and host Y
defaultOT should take place, and there should be effective protocols in place to back this up.
default default&#xa0;default25
default.
default              
defaultIn DFE’s amendments to the Children’s Homes Regulations 
default2001,
default there are two specific provisions which will impact on information sharing. The first is the proposal that children’s homes should be required to notify the authority where they are located, whenever a child is admitted or leaves the home. The YJB has req
defaultuested that the YOT should also be notified, to ensure joined up working, and so that unnecessary enforcement action is not taken on an Order, which could lead to further criminalisation of a young person. 
default&#xa0;
default26
default.
default              
defaultThe second proposal is for an annual “risk a
defaultssessment” of the area where a home is located. This work would require liaison with the local police and with local authority children’s services responsible for safeguarding. Again, the YJB has suggested that liaison takes place with the YOT, who will ha
defaultve information about a young person’s associates, and whether the placement would place them at further risks such as gang involvement or child sexual exploitation.
default&#xa0;
default27
default.
default              
defaultThe proposals contained within the two consultations are very positive, and the YJB wo
defaultuld encourage 
defaultDfE
default to require areas to consult with youth offending teams as a routine matter. The provision of effective and active information sharing and joint working protocols is crucial in dealing with this issue. The YJB has contacted all 158 YOTs to
default identify good practice in this area. Where protocols are in place to oversee information sharing, staff report that this has improved joint working between professionals to manage a young person. As such, the YJB has highlighted two particular areas of go
defaultod practice, and invited them to attend the Youth Justice Annual Convention in November 2013. Following the workshop the YJB will produce a model protocol to be shared with all youth offending teams and partners. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSdefaultupport for defaultcareleaversdefault28
default.
default              
defaultThe complex l
defaultegislative rules concerning which young people hit the criteria as a ‘
defaultcareleaver
default’ in the 
defaultThe
default Care Leavers (England) Regulations 2010, mean that many professionals do not understand which young people are entitled to support. It is therefore no surprise tha
defaultt many young people do not understand their own entitlements. The current rules result in a large group of young people who have previously been ‘looked after’, but are not entitled to support as a ‘
defaultcareleaver
default’. This is concerning, and the YJB would recomm
defaultend an urgent review into the current legislative framework.
default29
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultDfE
default also proposes to 
defaultamend Part 7 
defaultof the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, in regard to 16 and 17 year old looked after children, so that a decision to 
defaultcease looking after this group of children is not put into effect until it has been approved and signed off by the Director of Children’s Services. 
defaultThis will ensure that there is an appropriate pathway plan in place before a young person ceases to be looke
defaultd after. This is an encouraging step in the right direction, but we would recommend wholesale changes to the current legislative framework are required if the state is exercise its duty as a corporate parent and ensure that this vulnerable group of young p
defaulteople make a successful transition to adulthood.
default&#xa0;
default30
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCareleavers
default Association have completed some work to address the disproportionate numbers of care leavers in the criminal justice system. They have established a peer mentoring scheme at a number of 
defaultadult prisons, which is showing early signs of success. Former 
defaultcareleavers
default work with their peers in custody, and help them resettle and seek the appropriate support upon release. The YJB are currently in discussions with the 
defaultCareleavers
default Association about t
defaulthe potential to adapt the scheme for the under 18 Secure Estate.
default&#xa0;
default31
default.
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCareleavers
default Foundation recently received funding from 
defaultDfE
default to provide support to 9 local authorities to better address the needs of 
defaultcareleavers
default over the coming 12 months. The YJB are 
defaultin close contact with the 
defaultCareleavers
default Foundation to ensure that the local youth offending teams are involved in this project, and also to identify any lessons learnt and good practice which could then be disseminated amongst all other YOTs. The 
defaultCareleavers
default Foundation have created a 
defaultCareleavers
default Charter, which they would like all local authorities to sign up to. The YJB will promote the charter amongst YOTs so that they can discuss signing up to it at a local level.
default&#xa0;
default32
default.
default      
defaultA key concern highlighted by part
defaultners is that when a young person moves from YOT Supervision to Probation Supervision upon turning 18, much of the key information surrounding their care status, and support is lost. This leaves 
defaultcareleavers
default particularly vulnerable. The YJB have undertaken s
defaultignificant work in this area, and in partnership with NOMS, recently announced a number of measures and resources to tackle this issue. Guidance for young people on community orders who move to probation has been developed. A similar set of guidance has al
defaultso been developed for when young people move from the under 18 estate to the adult YOI estate. In addition a secure web-based portal, ‘Y2A’, has been created to allow for the safe transfer of all information on a young person to the adult estate. These are
default important and significant steps forward in ensuring that the transition from child to adult support for 
defaultcareleavers
default is more effective.
default&#xa0;
defaultImpact of LASPOAdefault33
default.
default              
defaultThe Committee will be aware that following the implementation of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Pu
defaultnishment of Offenders Act 2012 LASPOA, from April 2013, all remanded young people receive LAC status. Early indications from the Secure Estate are that this has led to increases in the proportion of LAC young people within custody, and then attracting leav
defaulting care support upon release. 
defaultIt is therefore important that any
default Government response considers the impact that LASPOA is having on an already stretched youth justice system.

default&#xa0;defaultConclusiondefaults and Recommendationsdefault&#xa0;default34
default.
default              
defaultThere is some encouraging work taking placdefaulte to reduce the disproportionate numbers of looked after children in the youth justice system. The YJB are involved in many key pieces of work and have developed some good practice examples to meet the needs of looked after children and defaultcareleaversdefault in the defaultyouth justice system. However, there continues to be a need to work with local partners and government departments to highlight the defaultovercriminalisationdefault of looked after children in the youth justice system to ensure that thisdefault issue is adequately addresseddefault.default&#xa0;
