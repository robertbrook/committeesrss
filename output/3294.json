"PUB0008&#xa0;Written evidence from the Foundation Trust Network (FTN) &#xa0;\nSUMMARY&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDETAILED RESPONSE&#xa0;\nQUESTION\nS\n \n1 and 3: Accountability to the people that use NHS services \n1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFoundation trusts (FTs) \nhave a unique governance model which builds on the tradition of \nmutuals\n and ensures the trust board is accountable to local communities\n through members and governors\n.  FTs also \nbenefit from greater financial fr\needoms than NHS trusts, enabling them to respond more effectively to local needs\n.  There are now \n146 \nFTs nationally, delivering acute, mental health, community and ambulance services\n to their local communities\n.  \n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe FT model of local governance helps empower the public and build in local accountability for significant sums of public expenditure.  Foundation trusts are embedded within the communities they serve, particularly as\n \nmembers (comprising local individuals, staff, patients and carers) elect the majority of governors.  FT memberships and representative governor bodies also help foster public participation in the delivery of public services and promote social solidarity.  Engaging \nwith patients and service users, and acting on their feedback, concerns and complaints, is central to robust governance and how the quality of care is viewed. \n&#xa0;\nQUESTION 2: Delivering better outcomes \n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn May 2013, the FTN and Barclays published the findings of \na \njoint project to examine the economic and social value that foundation trusts and NHS trusts add to their local communities.\n  \nAll trusts clearly provide essential services to society by treating illness and protecting and improving the health \nof their populations but they are also often a major employer in their locality and add \nsocial value for communities in ways above and beyond their core role. \n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSocial value seeks to capture the\n \nbroader impact of an activity on populations, communities and organisations. As major employers, trusts contribute directly to the economy locally and nationally, as well as supporting the long-term well-being of each of their employees as consumers, with families and lives outside of work, and indirectly, as citizens more generally.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunities greatly value the wider social, economic\n and environmental benefits generated by healthcare providers\n.  \nIn addition to the local governance and public participation fostered by FTs\n (described above)\n, the social value of FTs and trusts \nis\n illustrated \nas follows\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\ncross England, foundation trust activities contribute £30 billion annually to the economy. Their direct contribution– through employment, partnerships and procurement\n,\n for example – is \nhigher than that of universities, the pharmaceutical industry, or the aircraft and spacecraft industries.  In turn, they indirectly provide additional employment opportunities and economic benefits to their communities.\n \n The economic value of trusts\n includes:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQUESTION 6: Working together to deliver public services \n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NHS increasingly has to provide care for people with long-term conditions and complex co-morbidities across different settings.  \nResponding to these challenges and to patient expectations requires \na system-wide shift towards integrated health and social care models which deliver better, more co-ordinated care for patients.  \nMoves to integration may involve organisational, governance, budgetary or structural changes, but above all they need to improve patient pathways and experiences.  The desired result is effectively captured in \nthe \ndefinition given by the \nIntegrated Care and Support Collaborative: \n“My care is planned with people who work together to understand me and my carer(s), put me in control, co-ordinate and deliver services to achieve my best outcomes”.\n   \n&#xa0;\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent examples of integrated care and pathways which our members have led include: using ‘managed clinical networks’ to provide care and treatment for mental health patients who need a range of co-ordinated services; an NHS provider organisation / third sector partnership to create an integrated, early intervention service for dementia to provide a co-ordinated service to assess, diagnose and support people identified with early signs of dementia; a paramedic pathfinder tool which assists ambulance crews in deciding the most appropriate care service for patients; and deployment of \njoint emergency teams to\n provide a multidisciplinary response within 24 hours to emergencies arising within the community.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJon Rouse, DG Social Care at the Department of Health, has stated that international best practice suggests successful, patient-focussed, integrated health and care systems share 11 common \nfeatures\n:\n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis list makes clear that successful health and social care integration depends on close working and alignment at all levels between and within providers, commissioners, Whitehall departments and statutory bodies.  It is a hugely complex task which faces strategic, financial and local operational challenges, but it is one which must be achieved if we are to retain quality care which is nationally affordable and meets 21\nst\n century needs.\n&#xa0;\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Government is currently implementing the Integration Transformation Fund to support more co-ordinated services between the acute sector and social care.  While FTN supports the principles driving the fund, we have considerable concerns about the transfer of funding from the NHS frontline in the next two years before new models have had chance to become embedded. There needs to be much greater recognition that achieving the integrated models we need requires time, investment and commitment, with the right incentives, resources, risk management and leadership in place. \nThe NHS can't degrade or cut services or reduce frontline staff, \nin the context of\n demand rising by 5% a year.  \nTo maintain \nexisting NHS service delivery, the activities funded by investment in integration have to offset the risks caused by the transfer of funding\n.\n  \nNew models should be transparently developed and explained and best practice shared to assist with capability building and organisational adjustments.  \n&#xa0;\nQUESTION 8: Choice and control of public services by citizens\n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe FTN supports the use of \npatient \nchoice\n and improvements to patient information\n as drivers of quality and service improvement, alongside other possible drivers\n. Many of our members are directly involved in supporting patients to manage their own conditions and to take decisions about the choices of treatment, and of provider, available to them.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt a policymaking level, government \nneeds to be careful about how it balances the potentially competing agendas of competition and choice \nwith\n ensuring that NHS providers are financially and clinically sustainable\n for the longer term\n.  The process of evaluating the impact of significant \ntransactions (be they reconfigurations, mergers or other collaborations) \nshould be streamlined and fit for purpose for the NHS.  \n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompetition and choice can be successfully applied to drive up quality within the NHS, but with the important caveat that there is a need for a more refined set of industry specific guidance for the health sector\n if it is to be workable.  \nIndustry specific guidance must centre \non a \nfuller definition of ‘patient interest’ which\n takes account of the \nlongterm\n financial and clinical sustainability of the trust, and\n, where proven, should override concerns about signif\nicant lessening of competition and choice.\n \n \n&#xa0;\nQUESTION 9: Response to service delivery failure \n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NHS is currently developing a regime to respond to situations \nwhen quality falls below required standards.  Recent announcements on the single failure\n regime for quality and finance, \nspecial measures, \nand \ntrust special administration arrangements have begun to clarify \nhow \nthe system\n will operate\n.  However, further work is needed to ensure alignment and fitness for purpose. \n \nThere needs to be a rigorous, independent, credible and carefully calibrated way of identifying quality failure and a system of consequences to follow. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the clear links between financial and quality failure, \nit is paramount that we\n address the growing number of trusts that will \n– in the absence of appropriate support – \nbecome unsustainable \nas financial pressures increase.  \nNHS providers are experiencing a toxic cocktail of pressures: rising demand for unplanned admissions that are paid for under punitive tariff arrangements; erosion of elective income through tariff deflation; inflationary pressures in staff pay, consumables and PFI repayments; the transfer of £1.9 billion in funding away from the NHS through the integration transformation fund; and an unhelpful emphasis on competition at the expense of service sustainability.\n  \n \n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe failure regime needs to be carefully calibrated.  The range and complexity of healthcare means that p\nockets of poor care can exist across all types of trust at various times, including in the very best trusts who manage risk well\n – it is those trusts who will be aware of their deficiencies and will work to improve the situation\n. \n \nThis is very different \nfrom \nconsistently struggling to meet a range of national standards.\n  We need a clear \nand appropriately calibrated scale of failure and resulting consequences, \ndesigned to deal with such chronic issues as experienced \nat Mid Staffordshire at one end \nof the spectrum \nto an isolated incident in a single setting at the other.\n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNHS improvement models should draw more heavily on existing expertise within the sector, rather than management consultancy or the top-down, centrally driven models that have marked the service’s traditional approach to improvement. \nWe need to learn to celebrate and share success. The FTN\n welcome\ns\n the idea of \n“\nbuddying\n”, with \nthe best trusts supporting improvement \nin others \nwhere it is needed.\n  However, accountability \nfor improving performance in a trust\n \ncan only be the re\nsponsibility of the trust board.  I\nn Don Berwick’s words, \n“When responsibility is diffused, it is not clearly well owned: with too many in charge, no one is”\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the same time, w\ne need to be careful about assuming that failure is solely a product of the individual institution. \n \nMost failing trusts tend to sit within failing wider local health and social care economies. \n \nA model that concentrates solely on improving individual trust leadership, without tackling the underlying wider structural issues and ensuring the whole system can work together effectively, is likely to fail.\n An \neffective failure regime must support trust boards to find the right solutions to what are usually complex, long established, system-wide, problems.  \n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPoliticians need to play a much greater role locally and nationally in leading the public debate on service transformation in the NHS and other public services, including in promoting the potential benefits of the reconfiguration of some services.\n&#xa0;\nQUESTION 11: Reviewing Payment by Results \n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBetween 60 and 70% of acute services \nin NHS providers \nare\n currently\n funded through \nthe NHS \nPayment by Results (\nPbR\n)\n national tariff\n.  This \nrules-based and transparent system supports patient choice as “\nmoney follow\ns\n the patient\n”,\n and ensures providers are reimbursed for the services \nthey provide\n.\n  \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDifferent payment approaches are likely to be needed for different care needs, with room for local flexibility bounded by rules.  The FTN is supportive of \nrules-based payment systems\n being adopted across other \nnon-acute \nhealthcare sectors with appropriate \nadaptions\n being made to recognise the particular characteristics \nand desired health outcomes \nof those sectors.  For example,\n \na “year of care” payment approach\n for certain conditions, or\n blended approaches where a per person payment is combined with service delivery payment\n, \nare likely to be applicable to the comm\nunity and mental health sectors\n. \nIn the absence of such rules-based systems providers of NHS services will be put under unsustainable pressure as the demands on the service increase while funding is capped under current inflexible block contract arrangements. \n \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, i\nn applying \nPbR\n-style systems\n, it is critical that the rules and tariffs fully reflect the\n true\n cost of care and fulfil their policy intent.  For example, under the marginal rate policy, if the value of an acute hospital provider’s emergency admission activity exceeds its 2008/09\n \nlevel\ns, \nthe provider only \nreceives 30% of its full income for this extra activity. \nThe aim was to incentivise admission avoidance and delivery of care closer to home.  \nHowever, \nadmissions have risen in \nalmost\n two thirds of hospitals since 2008/09. Hospitals are therefore being \nsubstantially\n underpaid for their work and the financial impact is reducing \nproviders’\n ability to implement admission avoidance initiatives\n to treat patients closer to home\n. \nIn this case the “money follows the patient” ethos of \nPbR\n is subverted and as a result the hospital sector is having over\n £300 million \nin funding withheld each \nyear\n.  \nThis is a clear example of payment systems being inappropriately used to micromanage care delivery – a more balanced approach to the use of payment systems is needed to achieve better care for patients\n. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe pricing system should \nalso more appropriately \nrecognise capital investment\n and the additional costs of service transformation\n as a means of supporting better outcomes, through adoption of new technologies (which are often inflationary), or in changes to estate or delivery.  It will be important that innovation in care delivery is sufficiently enabled\n. We believe the NHS experience of different payment mechanisms, including \nPbR\n and the emerging development of outcome-based contracting and payment systems, provide considerable learning for the wider public sector, and our members are similarly interested to adopt good practices from elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\nNovember \n2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Foundation Trust Network (FTN) is the membership organisation and trade association for the NHS acute hospitals and community, mental health and ambulance services that treat patients and service users in the NHS. The FTN helps those NHS trusts deliver high quality, patient focussed, care by enabling them to learn from each other, acting as their public voice and helping shape the system in which they operate. The FTN has over 225 members – more than 90% of all NHS foundation trusts and aspirant trusts – who collectively account for £65 billion of annual expenditure and employ more than 630,000 staff.\n National Audit Office (2013) Emergency admissions to hospital: Managing the demand\n"
