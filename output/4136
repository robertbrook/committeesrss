[normal]Written evidence submitted by TV Licensing Watch [FBB0054][bold]Summary[bold]Raise the issues:
[normal]Why 
[normal]people in the UK 
[normal]are 
[normal]by law denied and deprived of access to live television programme services because they cannot afford to fund the BBC or do not want to fund the BBC
[normal].
[normal]Why
[normal] people in the UK are by law subject to legal sanction in UK courts because they cannot afford to fund the BBC or do not want to fund the BBC.
[normal]Why people in the UK are denied the right to exercise personal choice of 
[normal]whether or not to 
[normal]fund the BBC
[normal] as a norm
[normal]al private purchasing decision.
[normal]Introduction[bold]TV Licensing Watch 
[normal]are 
[normal]private individuals who 
[normal]monitor
[normal], blog
[normal] and report on issue
[normal]s concerning BBC tv licence, 
[normal]the realities of BBC 
[normal]licence enforcement activities and 
[normal] victims of the BBC tv licence enforcement reg
[normal]ime
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]A
[normal]s a consequence of the experiences of what
[normal] we do we want to persuade Parliament that it is no longer appropriate that the BBC 
[normal]nor anyone else 
[normal]is funded by an enforced 
[normal]broadcast receiving
[normal] licence regime.  That there must no longer be any criminal or
[normal] civil sanction used against people who cannot afford to or do not want to fund the BBC.  Bring a permanent end of 
[normal]the by 
[normal]denial of access 
[normal]by law 
[normal]to live television programme services because people in the UK cannot afford to or do not want to fund the 
[normal]BBC.
[normal] To end any form of enforced broadcast receiving licence regime.
[normal]How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? [bold]1
[normal]In 2012, on behalf of the BBC, Capita TV Licensing brought 181,880 prosecutions and secured 155,135 convictions for tv licence evasion.  The n
[normal]umber of prosecutions and convictions for tv licence evasion have been increasing year on year and for many years and show no sign of decline.  The figures speak for themselves.  It has become increasingly evident that this increasing trend has been going 
[normal]on for far too long and cannot be allowed to continue after 2016.
[normal]  Arguably, there are as many reasons for people no having tv licences as there are people who are unlicensed.  However, the point has to be made that prosecuting and convicting people who ca
[normal]nnot or do not want to fund the BBC
[normal] cannot be allowed to continue.  
[normal]Any pretence that enforcement activities carried out by Capita TV Licensing on behalf of the BBC in any way detect, prevent or reduce the “crime” of tv licence evasion have long since been
[normal] exposed as false.  According to the BBC’s own figures approximately 3 million letters of varying degrees of threat are sent to unlicensed addresses each and every month.  That is approximately 2.6 million more unlicensed addresses than there are “no licen
[normal]ce needed” declarations.  If the BBC are to be believed there are approximately 400,000 “no licence needed” declarations on record.
[normal]   
[normal]2
[normal]There are as many reasons for addresses being unlicensed as there are unlicensed addre
[normal]sses.  However, may we
[normal] suggest th
[normal]at a significant reason for the huge discrepancy between unlicensed addresses and no licence needed declarations is the simple fact that people just cannot be bothered
[normal] with the BBC and its broadcast receiving licence
[normal] any longer.  They have made what amount
[normal]s to a private purchasing decision in the audio-visual broadcast market and decided that they no longer want to or need to fund the BBC.
[normal]  People seem to have decided that what they do in the privacy of their own homes is no business of the BBC or Capita TV
[normal] 
[normal]Licensing.
[normal]  People are voting with their viewing habits, 
[normal]purchasing decisions, 
[normal]wallets and purses and turning their backs on the BBC and the BBC broadcast receiving licence regime.  People are rejecting the BBC and no amount of BBC enforcement 
[normal]by Capita T
[normal]V Licensing 
[normal]will change it and seeking to criminalise people or subject people to a civil enforcement regime for what amounts to a private buying decision 
[normal]for
[normal] products and 
[normal]service
[normal]s
[normal] consumed 
[normal]in 
[normal]the privacy
[normal] and intimacy of
[normal] their own homes 
[normal]by people in an 
[normal]expanding audio-visual media market in which the BBC has a declining share is plainly absurd.
[normal]3
[normal]There is no 
[normal]logical 
[normal]reason why people in the UK should deprived of 
[normal]and denied 
[normal]access to all live television programme services on the bases that they cannot aff
[normal]ord to fund the BBC and or 
[normal]that 
[normal]they do not want to fund the BBC.  
[normal]May we point out that people who purchase products advertised on television have in essence paid to watch the commercial television channels concerned as those channels are funded through a
[normal]dvertising revenues.  Under the present BBC tv licence regime people who have thus alr
[normal]eady paid in advance to watch/
[normal]record live commercial television programme services are denied access by law to those services that they have already paid
[normal] for if they cann
[normal]ot afford to or
[normal] do not want to fund the BBC.  
[normal]There is definitely no reason why
[normal] 
[normal]such private purchasing decisions for services consumed in the privacy of the home should be the subject of sanction whether through criminal e
[normal]nforcement or civil enforcement f
[normal]or that matter.
[normal]4
[normal]Proposals to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC broadcast receiving licence by introducing a system of civil enforcement 
[normal]recently introduced in the House of Lords 
[normal]seem to 
[normal]us
[normal] to be as
[normal] fundamentally flawed and as
[normal] nonsensical as the contin
[normal]uation of the BBC broadcast receiving licence. For example, parking was decriminalised and made subject to civil enfor
[normal]cement 
[normal]and the number of penalty charge notices issued by civil enforcement officers employed by private enforcement companies contracted 
[normal]by local councils increased exponentially with concomitant increase
[normal]s
[normal] in the number of complaints about indiscriminate, vexatious and petty issuing of penalty charge notices for financial gain
[normal] as well as the terroristic follow-up activities of bailiffs seek
[normal]ing payment
[normal].  
[normal]5
[normal]The main reason why penalty charge notices for non-payment of the BBC broadcast receiving licence are unacceptable is simple.  The activity of watching and or recording 
[normal]live television programme services takes place in the privacy of peopl
[normal]e’s homes.  Making what goes on in the privacy of people’s homes
[normal], 
[normal]the 
[normal]watching and recording of audio-visual media the 
[normal]subject of a civil enforcement regime is inappropriate, disproportionate and grossly intrusive for what is really a petty infraction
[normal] conc
[normal]erning a private contractual matter
[normal] to supply
[normal] between customer and 
[normal]live television programme 
[normal]service provider
[normal].  
[normal]6
[normal]As intimated 
[normal]by the DCMS 
[normal]Select Committee 
[normal]request for submissions, the audio-visual media market has burgeoned with a huge variety of platfor
[normal]ms which currently fall outside the scope of the BBC broadcast receiving licence.  Arguably, those audio-visual media platforms currently outside the scope of the BBC broadcast receiving licence should continue to remain outside the scope of the BBC broadc
[normal]ast receiving licence
[normal] if the BBC broadcast receiving licence were to continue
[normal]. The reason is very simple, 
[normal]despite the obligations set out in the Charter, 
[normal]the BBC played 
[normal]little or 
[normal]no part in the 
[normal]financing, 
[normal]development and content of such unlicensable audio-
[normal]visual media platforms
[normal] which numerically far outnumber BBC channels.
[normal]  With the plethora of audio-visual platforms now available people are free to pick and choose where they source their public service content from.  There is no longer any rational argumen
[normal]t to restrict public service content 
[normal]to the BBC and have an enforced
[normal] private hypothecated television access tax 
[normal]levied by and 
[normal]payable only to the BBC to fund it.  However, any form of enforced television or live television programme service provider licensing regime is 
[normal]no longer acceptable 
[normal]in our view 
[normal]and the UK should follow Australia’s example and abolish any form of enforced b
[normal]roadcast receiving licensing.
[normal]7
[normal]However, numerically outnumbering the BBC 
[normal]in 
[normal]the way that they do, private channels offering unlicensable audio-visual content to the overall 
[normal]media 
[normal]market 
[normal]in the UK 
[normal]complain vociferously and with some justification that the 
[normal]revenues that the BBC are guaranteed through the combination of BBC broadcast receiving licence, taxpayer funding via The Treasury for various BBC broadcast receiving licence concessions (over 75, blind) in addition to the revenues of the BBC’s commercial 
[normal]activities through BBC Global and BBC Worldwide lead to the BBC structurally dominating and distorting the wider media markets 
[normal]and production facilities 
[normal]within the UK.
[normal]8
[normal]There are 
[normal]four basic 
[normal]model
[normal]s to fund the BBC: tv licence revenue with merchandising, fo
[normal]rmat and content revenues (the current model): advertising, format, content and merchandising revenues only: voluntary subscription with format, content and merchandising revenues: combination of advertising, subscription, format, content and merchandising
[normal] revenues
[normal].
[normal]9
[normal]Although it is not widely known, John Reith, first BBC Director General was against the BBC being funded through licensing revenue.  
[normal]In 1922, 
[normal]John Reith preferred voluntary subscription and had no fundamental objection to the BBC 
[normal]broadcasting advertisements and 
[normal]receiving advertising 
[normal]revenue. However, 
[normal]he believed
[normal], wrongly as
[normal] 
[normal]it turned out, that
[normal] no company would be prepared to pay the advertising rates the BBC could 
[normal]demand and 
[normal]command.  
[normal]However, Reith disliked
[normal] the BBC licence revenue model and argued with the Postmaster General who did not believe that the Post Office should be in the business of collecting mere subscriptions. 
[normal]Reith was overruled and t
[normal]he BBC broadcast receiving licence was created 
[normal]as a conseque
[normal]nce 
[normal]and
[normal] although fundamentally flawed and regressive
[normal] 
[normal]for the reasons John Reith cited in 1922 
[normal]the BBC broadcast receiving licence 
[normal]is still current.
[normal]10
[normal]In our opinion, and in this 
[normal]submission 
[normal]as with many other submissions from private 
[normal]parties
[normal] it can be diff
[normal]icult to separate opinion from fact in the matter of how the BBC s
[normal]hould be funded post-2016, in our
[normal] opinion the BBC should be funded by voluntary subscriptions paid by people who want to 
[normal]fund the BBC.  We
[normal] believe that people must have the right to exercise
[normal] their personal choice in making a private buying decision in the wider audio-visual media market.  If the BBC need to or want to supplement subscription revenues with other revenues from advertising, placement, content and format licensing and merchandisi
[normal]ng then they should be commercial decisions made by a fully privatised media company and be the subject and consequences of market forces alone.  In other words, that is the 
[normal]BBC should become a private commercial concern 
[normal]with business development its
[normal] only
[normal] 
[normal]commercial concern
[normal]s
[normal].  Whether the individual potential subscriber buys into the BBC and its 
[normal]products, 
[normal]s
[normal]ervices
[normal] and commercial ethos
[normal] is 
[normal]the free will concern only of the individual concerned and not the subject of 
[normal]monitoring and 
[normal]com
[normal]pulsion through BBC 
[normal]enforcement or indeed any other enforcement processes.
[normal]11
[normal]The transfer from licence to subscription will involve huge restructuring for the BBC and I do not underestimate the task.  However, nor do I overestimate the task.  The task was not and is not beyo
[normal]nd 
[normal]networks and 
[normal]services such as Sky
[normal], Al Jazeera, Russia Today, Japan Satellite TV, and numerous others freely available in the UK 
[normal]who 
[normal]successfully 
[normal]market their services and therefore exercise no compulsion
[normal] but still 
[normal]operate viable, profitable media busine
[normal]sses
[normal] from
[normal] and for 
[normal]their customer base
[normal].  Nor was the subscription task beyond the mobile telephone service 
[normal]operators
[normal] who are in state of permanent n
[normal]etwork and structural changes.  If private media businesses can do all of th
[normal]ese
[normal] structural strategic 
[normal]things 
[normal]s
[normal]uccessfully 
[normal]and still operate as viable businesses
[normal] then so can the BBC. 
[normal] 
[normal]The project would be on a similar scale to the ending of analogue services in the UK
[normal] and may be fraught with difficulties
[normal].  How should the project be funded.  
[normal]We suggest w
[normal]ith the fina
[normal]l year
[normal]s’ BBC tv licence revenue in 2015-2016 the rest of the BBC can fund itself th
[normal]rough its commercial activities which
[normal],
[normal] by the way
[normal],
[normal] it already does and 
[normal]apply to the City for
[normal] 
[normal]investment funds and issue shares to raise money for large scale proje
[normal]cts the way any other plc would and would take the BBC back to its 
[normal]pre-Charter 
[normal]private business entity roots as the British Broadcasting 
[normal]Company Ltd.
[normal]12
[normal]It cannot be any longer legitimately argued that people in the UK who cannot fund the BBC or do not wan
[normal]t to fund the BBC should any longer be denied access to all live television programme services as a consequence.  The argument deployed against subscription funding of the BBC by willing subscribers was and is that subscription excludes those with the leas
[normal]t money to be able to afford the subscription.  The fact of the matter is that people are already excluding themselves from the BBC and
[normal] 
[normal]all 
[normal]live television programme services
[normal] in the UK
[normal] altogether either through choice or 
[normal]fear 
[normal]because they cannot afford eit
[normal]her the cost of the BBC tv licence nor the 
[normal]fines, 
[normal]costs
[normal] and victim surcharges 
[normal]associated with 
[normal]being prosecuted and convicted for
[normal] so called tv licence evasion.  Exclusion already 
[normal]h
[normal]appens
[normal] under the present 
[normal]broadcast receiving
[normal] licence funding model for and op
[normal]erated by the BBC.  Were the B
[normal]BC tv licence to scrapped, and we
[normal] firmly believe that the BBC tv licence 
[normal]and the Charter obligations cited and deployed as excuses f
[normal]or the continuation of the BBC broadcast receiving
[normal] licence 
[normal]should be scrapped at the earliest 
[normal]opportunity, then people in the UK would still have access to live television programme services for which they would not have to pay a subscription for and not face the 
[normal]fear
[normal] of prosecution and conviction because they were unable 
[normal]to afford to 
[normal]or unwilling 
[normal]to pay 
[normal]into 
[normal]the BBC
[normal] and its
[normal] 
[normal]broadcast receiving
[normal] licence.
