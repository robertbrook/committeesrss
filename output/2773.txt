[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Living Street believes pedestrian safety is just as important as preventing road traffic accidents. Clearing pavements and paths serving key local destinations should be given the same priority as key roads in relevant plans and winter maintenance schedules.&#xa0;&#xa0;During times of severe winter weather trips and falls on icy pavements can have a serious impact on pedestrians – especially the elderly – and also significant costs to the economy in terms of health care. This is before any consideration of the physical and emotional impact of injuries. There were over 16,000 emergency hospital admissions in England due to falls on snow and ice during the winter of 2009/10 costing an estimated £42 million. The following winter 14,300 admissions were recorded involving falls on ice and snow.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Local councils have the power and duty to ensure ice free pavements for pedestrians. As such we believe every local authority should, as a minimum, make sure:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013
