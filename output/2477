default&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Big Lottery Fund welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Scottish Affairs Committee’s consultation on comprehensive land reform in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe Big Lottery Fund is responsible for distributing 40 per cent of the money raised for good causes by the National Lottery. We are committed to bringing real improvements to communities and to the lives of people most in need so every year we give out millions of pounds to community groups and to projects that improve health, education and the environment.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultThe Fund has been an enthusiastic supporter of the community ownership of land and other assets for over 12 years now and over that time we have provided communities with around £77 million to help them acquire and/or develop a wide range of assets that are important to them.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultAs the Committee’s briefing paper, 
default“432:50 – Towards a comprehensive land reform agenda for Scotland”
default, contains excerpts from the evidence the Fund submitted to the Scottish Government’s Land Reform Review Group (LRRG), it is clear that the Committee is familiar with our views and position on the ownership of land and assets. As we have no wish to alter that evidence, the evidence we are submitting to you does not revisit or repeat what we said to the LRRG to any great extent. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultSince we submitted our evidence to the LRRG, however, we have published the final report of the evaluation of the first phase of Growing Community Assets (GCA1), our landmark community ownership investment programme which operated between 2006 and 2010. The evaluation was undertaken by SQW Ltd. from 2008 to 2013. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default              
defaultA summary of the evaluation report, together with details of how to access the full report from the Big Lottery Fund website, was sent to all MPs on 13 September 2013. Both the summary and full evaluation report can be found at: http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/research/stronger-communities/evaluating-growing-community-assets  
defaultWe hope that the findings from the evaluation will be of use to the Committee in its deliberations.
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default              
defaultThe second phase of GCA – GCA2 – is currently open to applications and to date, 17 projects have been awarded funding of around £12 million.
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultThe remainder of this evidence gives our comments on various sections of the briefing paper provided by the Committee.
default&#xa0;default2.default              defaultScottish Land Funds – Past and presentdefault&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe point in paragraph 6.4 about the inherent tension between the Scottish Government’s target for the area of land to be brought into community ownership and the size of the current Scottish Land Fund is well made and well taken. However, the Fund’s experience of overseeing the original Scottish Land Fund would suggest that unless there is a significant change in the right of communities to acquire land, such as a simplification in the acquisition process making it easier for them to do so, large estate buy-outs will continue to be the exception rather than the norm.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultThe original Scottish Land Fund is well known for having supported big community buy-outs of the Isle of 
defaultGigha
default and estates in 
defaultAssynt
default and North Harris. However, these big projects were not typical Land Fund projects. Of the 116 acquisition projects supported, 112 received an average grant of £90,000. Half of these projects were for the acquisition of buildings with minimal areas of associated land or bare land of less than one hectare. A further 19 grants helped acquire areas of 
defaultunder 10 hectares. Thus, a very significant part of the original Land Fund’s business focused on relatively small areas of land which were often strategically important to communities for social or amenity use (such as extending or enhancing community buildings, footpaths and other access). This pattern is being repeated under the new Scottish Land Fund.
default&#xa0;default3.default              defaultThe case for community ownershipdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultIn relation to paragraph 7.2, we can assure the Committee that only community-led and community–controlled organisations within identifiable local geographic areas can be supported by GCA and the Scottish Land Fund. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe Fund endorses the point made in paragraph 7.4, highlighting the extent of the impressive socio-economic betterment that communities can generate as a direct result of acquiring assets. The example provided, the South 
defaultUist
default Estate, is a particularly pertinent one.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe grant of £2.25 million made to 
defaultSealladh
default 
defaultna
default 
defaultBeinne
default 
defaultMoire
default from GCA1 in October 2006 to help with the acquisition of the South 
defaultUist
default Estate (and some revenue costs) is still the largest award made from the investment area for asset acquisition. We have since made further awards of just over £1 million to 
defaultSealladh
default 
defaultna
default 
defaultBeinne
default 
defaultMoire
default under GCA2 to support  developments on the community-owned Estate. Given the significant increase in the value of this asset as reported in the briefing paper, we would argue that our contributions represent excellent value for money in terms of the financial returns now being earned for the community, and which, in turn, can be used to support all sorts of community activity.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultWe know from the independent evaluation of GCA1 that about one third of the projects funded under that phase of the investment area have developed other projects on the back of the ownership of their new asset or have used it to leverage additional funding. Despite the challenging financial and operational climate currently facing some projects, we hope to see this percentage increase a time goes on.   
default&#xa0;default4.default              defaultFurther potential reforms : Community Ownershipdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultIn relation to paragraph 8.2, we would remind the Committee that GCA has been enabling communities in both rural and 
defaulturban defaultScotland to acquire, manage and develop all sorts of assets that matter to them – not just land and land assets – for over seven years.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultWe can report that almost all the acquisitions the Big Lottery Fund has supported since we made our first intervention in this area in 2001 have been negotiated between the sellers and the community buyers. As we point out in the introduction to our evidence to the LRRG, although this first intervention through the original Scottish Land Fund was designed to complement the community right to buy provisions in the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, only six of the projects we have funded to date have been from applicants whose right to buy have been approved by Scottish Ministers. What this demonstrates is that whilst we have been happy to support projects that have received Ministerial approval to buy land and assets under the 2003 Act, having such approval has never been a prerequisite for receiving funding from the Big Lottery Fund and it is highly unlikely that it ever will be.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultParagraph 8.6 makes mention of the challenges that Co 
defaultChomunn
default Na 
defaultPairc
default have encountered whilst trying to acquire the 
defaultPairc
default estate under community right to buy. The Committee may be interested to learn that Co 
defaultChomunn
default Na 
defaultPairc
default received approval from the Fund as far back as December 2010 to proceed to the second stage of the GCA application process. The compilation of the second stage application was, of course, put on hold while the legislative process ran its course.
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default              
defaultLater in that same paragraph, it is reported that overall, respondents to the Scottish Government’s consultation on the proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill were in favour of communities having the right to request a local authority to use compulsory purchase powers on their behalf. To clarify the Fund’s position on this matter, we would wish to see any land and buildings purchased compulsorily by local authorities in these circumstances transferred into the ownership of the communities concerned and not retained by the authorities. Although some local authorities are supportive of communities acquiring, owning and developing assets, as might be expected, the attitude of Scotland’s 32 Councils to this issue and their practice on it varies considerably.
default&#xa0;
default4.5
default              
defaultParagraph 8.8 relates how impressed the Scottish Labour Party leader, Johann Lamont, was following her visit to the 
defaultGalson
default Estate Trust. The Fund is pleased and proud to have provided 
defaultUrras
default 
defaultOighreachd
default 
defaultGhabhsainn
default with a grant of £668,000 from GCA1 to help build their multi-functional business centre and thereby contribute to the economic regeneration of the area.
default&#xa0;default5.default              defaultFurther potential reforms : A tenant farming right to buydefault&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultParagraph 9.7 speculates on the terms of a possible absolute right to buy for tenant farmers. For clarification and confirmation, only community-led and community–controlled organisations can benefit from GCA and the Scottish Land Fund. Neither programme, as presently constituted, can support individuals or private companies.   
default&#xa0;default6.default              defaultFurther potential reforms : land in public ownershipdefault&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultThe Big Lottery Fund welcomes the suggestion made in paragraph 15.18 that the Scottish Affairs Committee might usefully enquire into 
default“whether there are any requirements within UK Treasury rules that necessitate restrictive interpretations of the sort evident in the way the Scottish Public Finance Manual is interpreted by Scottish Government officials handling land/asset disposals.”
default This is because the Fund knows from experience (informed in large part by the independent evaluations of the original Scottish Land Fund and GCA1) that the development of an asset, once acquired by a community, is, in many respects, significantly more challenging than its acquisition. It is for this reason, therefore, that we strongly support the view put forward by the West Harris Trust to the Scottish Government’s LRRG, as reported in paragraph 11.3 of the briefing paper, that the Community Right to Buy process should facilitate rather than hinder asset transfers to communities. This would enable community groups like the West Harris Trust to focus their energies on how they can make the best of the asset after acquisition, rather than on the acquisition itself.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultThe Fund encourages all applicants that approach us for acquisition costs to investigate obtaining a discount in the transfer value. The Fund approaches applications to acquire public sector assets on a case by case basis and GCA has, in the past, supported a project where although the local authority sellers were unable to reduce the purchase price of the asset they were transferring to the community, they did transfer all of the asset’s fixtures and fittings at no cost.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultThe value that public bodies attach to assets they wish to dispose of will, in the first place, determine whether or not communities can afford to buy them. In the second place, the transfer value also affects how much money communities may have left, or then have to find, to develop the asset once it has been acquired. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultGCA is an open, competitive investment area with a limited budget. So that our funding can ‘go as far as possible’, we prefer, where possible, to see less of our funding going on the cost of acquiring the asset, and more on its future re-development. We think this will help ensure that the asset is financially sustainable in the longer term, and lead to more sustainable services and facilities for the communities we support. It must be strongly emphasised again, however, that this does not mean that GCA will not fund asset acquisition : it has done so and continues to do so.
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultThe remainder of section 11 of the briefing paper goes on to discuss State Aid. We support this issue being considered to ensure that the application of State Aid rules optimise – rather than limit – the potential of community ownership and community enterprise.
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default              
defaultHowever, we would draw the Committee’s attention to another aspect of the State Aid regulations which we also raised in our submission to the LRRG and which has implications specifically for the disposal of public assets at less than market value.
default&#xa0;
default6.7
default              
defaultAnnex A to the consultation paper on the proposed Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill issued by the Scottish Government (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00394524.pdf) makes it clear that central and local government have to comply with strict requirements when disposing of public sector assets at less than market value, including, in particular, with European Union competition law (or State Aid). Nevertheless, over the lifetime of GCA to date, most public bodies, including many local authorities and government departments or agencies, have found a variety of ways to transfer assets to community groups at less than market value (and sometimes at little or no cost at all) while still legitimately complying with the requisite rules and regulations. It is important to maintain that positive contribution to the community ownership agenda at a time of increased financial constraints for public bodies. 
default&#xa0;default7.default              defaultFurther potential reforms : The Crown Estate Commissiondefault&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultThe grant programmes and investment areas that we have operated over the past 12 years have demonstrated the Big Lottery Fund’s firm commitment to the principle of the community ownership of assets. We therefore think that, to avoid any doubt, where the term “responsibility” has been used in the final sentence of paragraph 12.2, it should be made clear that ‘responsibility’ means ‘ownership’.
