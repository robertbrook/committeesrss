"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nTravelsure\n (TIC 062)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCar owners are privileg\ned that they do not have to plan their \nday around how they are going to get to their venue. Usually the people who do not have their own transport have the weakest voice \nin council affairs, and seldom have the knowledge or ability to \nsuggest a bus service \nis introduced.\n \nOften\n \nw\norse than this is when a service which has been running for a year or more and is suddenly cut because it is no longer viable. \nThe passengers which did use the service are \nleft with little option of how to resume their \nnormal life and\n public service loses \nit’s\n credibility. \n&#xa0;\n2. \nIt is easy to run a service around connecting villages which then leads to a major town \nand hope that anyone who wishes to use this facility can get to a bus stop near to where they live. It is more difficult to\n \nserve a community which is off the beaten track but still have the same needs as everyone else. \nOne of our\n local villages has\n fought vigilantly \nto keep their once a week service into the local town. This village was fortunate that it had a go\nod voice in their community \nand a strong spirit to see it through. Other bus \ncuts have not been so lucky. The people who use this once a week service are mainly concession holders \ntherefore little money is collected, however it is well \nused and they are ab\nle to make appointments etc around the time they have in town. \nThere is a lack of low floor,\n easy accessible buses on t\nhe market which have\n 16seats or less. It is quite easy to supply a bus with only 16sts \nbut it probably won’t have the features which are\n necessary for disabled access or pushchairs etc. \nThe cost of buying these buses are usually about the same as bigger 28seat\n \nPlaxton\n Darts etc. Therefore it is more viable for the operator to purchase a larger bus and \nuse it on a more profitable\n busy route\n. \nGovernment may think about helping operators to source and purchase these type of buses and \nuse them on less profitable routes which serve smaller communities?\n&#xa0;\n3. \nThe most important factor of public transport is reliability. The bus service needs to be \nplanned so that connections can be made, doctor’s surgeries etc. are accessible and that there is a return service available. Timetables should be readily available, on bus stops as well as on the buses.\nIt is better to not introduce a service than to do s\no then cut it after a short time. \nThe travelling public need to be certain the bus is running before making preparations to use it\n . Any change to timetables etc need to be planned well in advance and advertised as such. \n&#xa0;\n4. \nIn our area there has been so \nmany cuts in local government \nprojects that there is little hope left that a service such as a new local bus route may be available. \nIf it was suggested to local P\narish Councils\n meetings then an answer from local opinion could be sought\n. This \nwould be especially appreciated \nas it seems that many of these rural villages are grown in size but not in amenities.\nWe operate services both in \nEngland\n and \nScotland\n and find there is a difference in usage of the travelling passengers. In \nScotland\n \nthe distances are not great \nyet people seem to use the buses far more than in \nEngland\n. Times of the buses are more frequent and \nboth passengers and the buses are more reliable. \n&#xa0;\n5. People in isolated communities should not be expected to rely on taxis \nor \ncommunity transport for their daily needs. \nTaxis\n are only available at times which suit the operator and this may not be the time the passenger is \nwanting \nto travel. \n&#xa0;\n6. Funding local tra\nnsport is easy where there is knowledge that the bus route will be u\nsed and viable. Routes which are new and maybe \nused only occasionally are a big risk, not just for the person funding the bus but also for the travelling passenger who may find it \nvery useful and then fall into the trap of starting to depend on it. \nIn \nSco\ntland\n some of our services are connecting from villages to a main bus rout\ne and this works well for the passenger and the council as there is no need to continue the through journey with two buses. \nWe have villages around our\n area which are more populated\n in the summer as there are caravan sites and hotels\n nearby\n. A route which serves the local community all year and yet may only need subsidising in the winter \nwoul\nd be feasible and become a reliable and used \nservice. \nThe introduction of the free concessi\nonary fare travel has \nhad a detrimental effect on public transport in isolated communities. The formula which\n dictates reimbursements to the operator works well in built up communities \nwhere there are many people travelling, \neg\n town services. However in ru\nral areas where there are few passengers and the majority are concessionary pass holders \nthere is little incentive for an operator to introduce a new service as the fares taken will only equate to about 33% of the appropriate fare\n. This coupled with the decreasing \nreimbursement \nof fuel duty rebate is a major factor of\n why\n fewer services\n are\n being \n \nintroduced or even \nspeculated.\nA route which is planned, \nadvertised and activated then becomes used and relied on. It is then cut for th\ne winter which immediately loses credibility \nfor the people who need it most.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
