defaultCurrent state of public understanding 
default(
defaultand recent changes in that state
default)
default : 
default educated adults used to understand 
defaultthe words 
default“climate change” as meaning 
defaultobservable and measurable movement
defaults
default 
defaultin the ever-changing  global and regional climate over all time-scales 
defaultin the history of planet 
defaultearth 
defaultand 
defaultof 
defaulthuman civilisation
default, 
default 
defaultand also as experienced by 
defaultany 
defaultobse
defaultrvant individual
default throughout 
default his or her
default  lifet
defaultime . 
defaultOver the last one or two decades, 
default 
defaulteducated 
defaultpeople 
defaulthave been surprised and disappointed to see and  hear these words used 
defaultalmost exclusively
default, both
default 
defaultby 
defaultmany
default 
defaultill-informed 
defaultpoliticians
default and 
default by alarmist doomsayers
default, 
default as if they meant “catastrophic 
defaultanthropogenic
default global warming
default (CAGW.) 
default”
default My own understanding has improved immeasurably from nearly 5 years of 
defaultcareful and detailed 
defaultreading on all sides 
defaultmostly of the scientific, but also of the 
defaultpolitical
default, 
default arguments. Above all I have come to understand how the modesty of early climate scientist-historians such as Hubert Lamb has given way to the arrogance of those who pretend 
defaultthat 
defaultmankind’s 
defaultknowledge of 
defaultthe different 
defaultfactors
default which
default drive the earth’s climate is 
defaultanything 
defaultother than minimal
default,
default prim
defaultitive, and thus incidentally grossly inadequate in terms of supporting any related Governmental policy initiatives other than a need to carry out fundamental research on ALL climate drivers.
default2.
defaultTrusted voices
default :  those very few
default who concentrate on measurable and observed climate data  and who use moderate and temperate language
default, 
default rather than 
defaultthose who rely
default on unproven and falsifiable hypotheses, 
default publicise 
defaultcomputer-modelled scenarios,  
defaultissue public 
defaultdoomsday predictions,  
defaultand
default/or
default  
defaultmake highly 
defaultpersonal attacks on those who disagree with them.
default3.
defaultRole of Government
default :  it was the Nazi propagandist Dr. Goebbels,  of eternal infamy,  who said “It is the absolute right of the State to supervise the formation of public opinion.” 
default  All decent people should and 
defaultmost 
defaultdo recoil in horror from the direction in which this sort of thinking leads.  The lamentable track record to date of 
defaultU.K. 
defaultGovernment Departments , “scientific advisers” and “publicly funded scientists”  in 
defaultlargely 
defaultsupporting a
default highly dubious 
default and often scientifically illiterate 
defaultalarmist 
default“climate change” 
defaultmessage to the public underscores the view that 
default Governments and their advisers should lean over backwards to avoid ALL  propaganda in respect of “climate science.”
default4.
defaultImproving public understanding
default :  
defaultyour questionnaire 
defaultis
default fundamentally 
default flawed. It 
defaultstarts from a number of wrong premises  --  
default you appear to proceed from the assumption that CAGW (see above) is true, deadly and happening now. This leads to the second assumption  : that rising scepticism must be because people are ignorant or ill-informed. The third  -- and typically totalitarian  --  assumption then follows, namely that what is needed is re-education. 
defaultBarriers to understanding
default : t
defaulthe main 
defaultone 
defaultis a lack of knowledge. The answer is personal effort to
default obtain, study and interpret  data
default, not 
defaultto read 
defaultGovernment propaganda. 
defaultThe media’s role
default : this is already, and
default is more likely  than  not to 
defaultcontinue to 
defaultbe
default, 
default largely negative
default in terms of 
defaultworking against 
defaultthe public interest which Government is supposed to serve 
default  : bad news sells, and alarmist 
defaultclimate 
defaultpropaganda is “bad news.”
default The worst possible scenario is of a Government-controlled media. To quote the appalling Dr. Goebbels again, “Think of the Press as a great keyboard on which the Government can play.” 
default5.
defaultPublic understanding and policy formation
default:  one can only hope that the public will increasingly recognise
default the folly of 
defaultits 
defaultGovernment behaving like King Canute of legend.  The arrogance and folly of humans p
defaultretending to have a 
default“climate change policy” 
defaultat all,  let alone an effective one, 
defaultis beyond belief
default ;
default  and if one looks at the entire global picture,  the arrogance and folly of the U.K. Government in particular is unparalleled.
default6.
defaultPublic attitudes and energy policy
default : 
default there is much evidence that most politicians are still unaware of the extent to which the educated public is waking up to the folly of recent and current U.K energy policy, based as it is on promoting and subsidising the least efficient, least reliable and highest cost forms of electricity generation on the basis of “climate science” and in the name of “saving the planet from dangerous climate change.”    One must fervently hope that  our political class will very soon wake up to the scientific realities and to the 
defaultextremely damaging 
defaulteconomic and social consequences of 
defaultrecent energy policies and initiatives.
default7.
defaultGovernment expertise in social and behavioural sciences
default : your question is confused,  but has unpleasant Orwellian undertones of totalitarian thinking.
default8.
defaultCan lessons be learned from other countries
default ?  Global evidence points to increasing public disaffection with 
defaultand (with the exception of small but very well-funded pressure groups) disengagement from 
defaultGovernmental focus on “climate change policy”  as a major societal concern. It seems probable that Governments which continue with  such a focus will 
defaulteventually lose public support for their entire political platforms, simply  because of the severe economic and even environmental damage which some of those policies are increasingly wreaking.
