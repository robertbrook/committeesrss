The last of these is the servant of the Court of Alderney and of the States when it sits as a legislature
default.  Accordingly capacity is limited, although this should not prevent appropriate communications through the office of the Chief Executive or the Greffier.

defaultNo specific issues have arisen recently in respect of the relationship between Alderney and the Ministry of Justice. Indeed contact at officer level has been sufficiently frequent to ensure that issues are dealt with promptly.  Ministerial contact has also been maintained.

defaultAlderney were disappointed by the way that the announcement on Low Value Consignment relief dis-application was handled.  Having been announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on 9 November 2011 and in the Chancellors’ Autumn Statement on 29 November 2011 it was effected only against the Channel Islands.  Alderney had no communication from the UK and when this was pointed out to the Treasury they cited Guernsey as the appropriate channel of communication.  The effect of this change on the small population of Alderney was considerable, and proportionately higher than on our fellow Channel Islands.  
defaultThe States of Alderney has seen Guernsey’s memorandum and concurs with what has been stated in particular about the withdrawal of Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR).

defaultThe MOJ is the filtering point for issues where discussions may be required with individual UK Government Departments; it is clearly stepping back from being the main channel of communications between the Islands.  Given its limited Civil Service resources, Alderney needs determine the extent to which it would like direct relationships with departments (eg DECC) or where Alderney is happy to maintain those relationships through Guernsey.  Relationships with the Department for Energy and Climate Changeon marine renewable energy have been excellent and facilitated by the MOJ. The States of Alderney notes the significant improvement in the speed of passage of legislative matters though the MOJ and the Privy Council.
