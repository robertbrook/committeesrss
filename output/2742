[normal] SCAP 2012, published 1 March 2013. The data includes the number of school places available at the end of the academic year 2011-12 and forecasts of the number of children who will need school places in September 2015, and so it is not surprising that there is 
[normal]a difference in these figures, as local authorities create
[normal] new places each year. 
[normal] The Targeted Basic Need programme invited LAs to apply for funding to expand existing schools or establish new schools â€“ academies make up 22% of the expansion projects. 
[normal] The Academies Capital Maintenance Fund has supported 60 popular and successful academies to expand, and 25% of bids to this fund are to support expansion.
