&#xa0;We are pleased to respond to the Science and Technology Committee (Commons) inquiry into Women in STEM careers.&#xa0;We have divided our response into four sections: (1) key points; (2) the Society for General Microbiology and its role in UK microbiology; and recommendations for (3) universities and the higher education sector, and (4) government, in promoting women in STEM careers.&#xa0;We hope this information is useful to you as you work on your review. With our national reach, and deep knowledge of our discipline, we can provide further information as needed.&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Key points&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; About the Society for General MicrobiologyThe Society for General Microbiology (SGM) is a membership organisation for scientists who work in all areas of microbiology. It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe with a worldwide membership based in universities, industry, hospitals, research institutes and schools. The SGM publishes key academic journals in microbiology and virology, organises international scientific conferences and provides an international forum for communication among microbiologists and supports their professional development. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, through a comprehensive framework of communication activities and resources. Further information about SGM is provided in Appendix 1.&#xa0;In early 2013, the Council of the Society for General Microbiology agreed to establish a short-term Working Group to make recommendations to Council to improve the equality of opportunity and diversity of representation in the Society’s membership. The Working Group is chaired by Professor Hilary Lappin-Scott, Equality and Diversity Champion. The Working Group is currently preparing the SGM Policy on Equality and Diversity for Council to consider.&#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Role of universities and the higher education sector&#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Role of Government&#xa0;&#xa0;
