"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written evidence submitted by The Football Association [WAS0048]&#xa0;\nMany thanks for inviting me and The Football Association to give \nevidence to the Select Committee\n \nlast week. I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with a little further information following\n \nour discussion which perhaps you can consider as supplementary evidence. I shall also share this\n \nletter with the member\ns of your committee too.\nTwo points which seemed to strike a chord with the committee were mixed football and the new\n \nstructure the Women Super League, so I wanted to briefly expand on those two points for you.\nThe FA reviews mixed football on a yearly bas\nis and last approved an extension of mixed-football to\n \nU1\n5\ns in May this year. This was completed on the back of extensive research with Brune\nl\n University\n \nand consultation within the game. We will continue to review the need for extending the age range\n \nof m\nixed football based on physical development, empirical evidence and legal expertise.\nThe FA continues to oppose mixed-football in adult football and prohibits it within any of its\n \naffiliated teams or competitions; this is based on the lack of evidence of s\nafety. The FA is, however,\n \nkeen to review this matter regularly, but it should be noted that we do so from the perspective of\n \nequality rather than encouraging female participation. Girls taking part in mixed football are nearly\n \nalways those who have played\n regularly before and only amount to approximately 500 players per\n \nyear in England.\nIn terms of elite football, we are very encouraged by the progress made by the FA Women's Super\n \nLeague since its inception. In the last year FAWSL attendances have increase\nd by 23 percent with\n \nmajor games regularly attracting over 1,000 spectators. A new broadcast platform has also been\n \nsecured for 2014-17 with BBC and BT Sport working in partnership to broadcast live senior\n \ninternationals and The FA Women's Cup with weekly \ndomestic coverage of the FAWSL on BT Sport.\nThe introduction of a summer league was completed in consultation with the women's teams across\n \nthe country and the overwhelming majority were in favour of what has proved to be a successful\n \nchange. I'm aware th\nat a concern was raised about the leve\nl\n of funding for teams in the Women's\n \nPremier League today compared to before the FAWSL was introduced, however this simply does not\n \ncompare like for like. The WPL today is the third tier of English women's football wh\nereas it was the\n \ntop tier previously; it is the status of the League and not the name of the League that should indicate\n \nthe level of comparison in this instance.\nShould you like further information on these or any other topics please do let me know as I w\nould be\n \nhappy to provide more information for you for the final report. I am sure that the final document\n \nwill not only examine the work done by national governing bodies to raise the profile of women's\n \nand girls' football in recent years but, alongside sp\norting recommendations, provide non-sporting\n \nrecommendations for Government which will help improve participation.\nFor example, the Government should be commended for recent changes to the CASC programme\n \nwhich sees further financial help extended to sports\n clubs. However, if the Government were to\n \nprovide additional benefits such as further rate relief or tax benefits for providing specific\n \nprogrammes for girls and women, we would see an increase in community lead interventions for\n \nwomen's sport.\nThe FA wou\nld also recommend that Government considers ensuring that Local Authorities have a\n \nstatutory obligation to provide sport and produce a Local Authority Development Plan which\n \nexplicitly considers girls' and women's provision. 80% of football is played on Lo\ncal Authority\n \nfacilities and, as a non-statutory provision, local investment in sport is beginning to be hit hard\n \nespecially\n \nin northern England.\nFinally, football has experienced a real change in the perception of elite women's football in recent\n \nyears th\nanks to improved media coverage of the product. We recommend Government continues to\n \nencourage broadcasters to promote better coverage of women's sports. Football has undoubtedly\n \nbenefitted from the increased coverage we have received by being able to attr\nact sponsors who\n \nwant to be associated with the product and want to activate their sponsorship- our football festivals\n \nsponsored by Continental Tyres and supported by UEFA and Sport England have reached over 10,000\n \ngirls this year at 33 Football Festivals \nand match day fanzones. Unfortunately the Women's Super\n \nLeague is still heavily subsidised by the sponsorship and media rights from our men's team;\n \nhowever, we are putting the building blocks together for a long term sustainable product.\nMany thanks again \nfor inviting me to give evidence and I wish you success in creating the final\n \nreport.\n&#xa0;\nKelly Simmons\nDirector of National Game and Women's Football\nThe Football Association\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
