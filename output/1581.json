"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the UK CCS Research Centre (CCS10)&#xa0;UK Parliament Select Committee for Energy and Climate Change Call for Evidence – Parliamentary Inquiry into Carbon Capture and Storage &#xa0;\nWritten submission from the \nUK Carbon Capture &amp; Storage Research Centre  \n&#xa0;\nThe UKCCSRC is the focus for academic CCS research throughout the \nUK\n, with approximately 200 members.  This submission was prepared by the UKCCSRC Management Team using input from\n \nmembers, but recognising the principles of academic freedom should \nnot be ta\nken to represent the views of all members\n.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSupporting Evidence&#xa0;About the UKCCSRC\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCCS Technologies\n&#xa0;\nFigure 1: Pictogram of CCS value chain.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRole of Research i\nn Commercialisation\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Figure 2: CATs R+D - an Industrial Viewpoint, Mike Farley, APGTF 8th CATS Workshop, 27 February 2008http://www.apgtf-uk.com/files/documents/8thWorkshop2008/09JMFIndustryAPGTF%20Forum27Feb08.pdf&#xa0;\nUK CCS Research Landscape\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRecommendations for action&#xa0;\nEnabling and Encouraging Feedback Cycles\n&#xa0;\nPre-Q\nualification of Storage Sites\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n17.  ANNEX 1 SUMMARYCurrent and recently completed CCS research projects involving UK universities and research institutes&#xa0;\nA survey of ongoing \nacademic CCS research is necessarily a work in progress and the information presented here should be taken as indicative only.  The Annex lists a total of 24\n4\n grants, of which approximately 20 are from EU funding sources, 1\n1\n from other international fundin\ng\n, \n4\n4\n from industry\n/government\n sources\n and 13 from the UKCCSRC\n.  \nEntries for 156\n grants from Research Councils UK ending in 2009 or later are also included; consistent data is\n available for these so further \nanalysis is possible.  The total investment in th\nese RCUK projects is over £95M.  Approximately 84% of this total (as shown in Figure 1) is from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and a further 8% each from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and S\nocial Research Council (ESRC).  Reflecting the respective scientific remits of these funding Councils, the majority of funding (42%) is estimated to have gone towards projects that are relevant to CO\n2\n Capture (see Figure 2 and 3).  The next largest  area ,\n Capacity (34%), includes funding such as doctoral training centres or research centres where a core objective is in training, networking or building capacity within the academic community (but often also with some research).  Cross-Cutting Issues (13%) in\ncludes CO\n2\n transport, whole systems analysis, CO\n2\n properties/chemistry, economics, environmental aspects, public perception and policy.  CO\n2\n Storage research for CCS is estimated to have received the least amount of funding (11%) out of these categories.  \nIt should be noted that core funding for NERC Research Institutes such as the British Geological Survey are not included here. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n \nhttp://eti.co.uk/downloads/literature/E\nTI_CCS_Insights_Report.pdf\n \nhttp://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/publications/RCUKFrameworkforCapitalInvestment2012.pdf\n \nAEA, 2010 - \nhttp://www.ukccsrc.ac.uk/system/files/09738.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S18766102\n13009090\n"
