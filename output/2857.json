"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Written evidence from the Civil Aviation Authority (WRT 026)1.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe CAA is the UK’s specialist aviation regulator. It exists to protect consumers and the public.\n1.2.\n&#xa0; \nOur activities include: making sure \nthat the aviation industry meets the highest technical and operational safety standards; protecting consumers’ rights; enhancing competition; preventing holidaymakers from being stranded abroad or losing money because of tour operator insolvency; planning \nand regulating all UK airspace; regulating airports, air traffic services and airlines; and providing impartial advice on aviation policy.\n1.3.\n&#xa0; \nIn the submission below, the CAA \nprovides its observations on how the aviation sector has responded to the challenge \nof improving its resilience to severe winter weather conditions and, when disruption does occur, how effective it is in looking after passengers. \n1.4.\n&#xa0; \nAlthough the focus of much of \nthis submission is \non resilience and passenger welfare, the CAA’s primary focus\n during any major disruption to aviation is on public safety. Although coping with the severe winter weather conditions that the UK has experienced over the last few years has proved challenging\n for the aviation industry\n, at no time during any of the resul\nting disruption was the CAA concerned that \naviation \nsafety was being compromised.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0; \nDecember 2010 was the coldest month in the UK since records began\n,\n according to the Met Office\n,\n with heavy snowfall during late November and December causing significant disruption to air transport. At Heathrow, this disruption was felt particularly heavily between 18 and 22 December, when heavy snow caused extensive disruption for several days, wit\nh significant disruption also occurring at a number of other UK airports.   \n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nFollowing this,\n a\n number of separate but linked \nworkstreams\n \ncommenced\n to consider how the aviation sector \ncould improve its response to the threat of disruption, including that po\nsed by severe winter weathe\nr\n.\n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nAt the systemic level there\n was \nwork from the Government’s South East Airports\n Task Force (SEAT), where the CAA \nled \na \nsub-group examining how to improve delay and resilience \nperformance, including how best to manage capacity r\neduction in \nsevere winter weather \nconditions and \nto \nensure an efficient and timely return to full service. \nA number of \nindividual airports \nalso took forward their own work on improving \ntheir \nresilience \nto severe weather conditions \n– most notably \nDavid \nBegg\n’s\n Heathrow Winter Resilience Inquiry, on which the CAA \nsat \nas an independent observer.\n Similarly, many airlines reviewed\n their own policies, procedures\n and practices for communicating passengers\n during disruption and for looking after them in the event th\nat they become stranded.\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe CAA also\n undertook \nits own work to consider the passenger experience during disruption, examining what worked well for passengers as well as what failed to meet their needs\n, with the aim of feeding \nintelligence into the work \nbe\ning taken forward by the industry. The CAA’s work concluded in summer 2011. In its final report\n, the CAA identified three areas where\n performance should be improved\n:\n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nWorking \ntogether \nwith the Airport Operators Association (AOA) and the British Air Transport Association (BATA), \nthe CAA has ensured that the findings of its investigation have been embedded into the ongoing work o\nf airports and airlines to reduce the number of passengers affected by major disruption, and then to improve the care given to those passengers that remain\n \nstranded at\n the airport\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nSince winter 2010/2011, signific\nant improvements have been made to how the aviation sector responds to major disruption.\n Below, the CAA has highlighted a number of these key improvements.\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe CAA is continuing to work\n with the aviation industry, both in the UK and internationally,\n to ensure that it can maximise its contribution to improving winter resilience\n for the benefit of passengers\n. \n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe CAA is currently undertaking a number of seminars for airlines and \ngroundhandlers\n at Heathrow airport to ensure that the airport community, in particular non-EU airlines\n, who may not be as used to complying with the reg\nulations as EU ones\n, understands its legal obligations to passengers during periods of disruption. \n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nTo ensure that if severe \ndisuprtion\n does occur we have an accurate picture of compliance with the regulations across the country, t\nhe CAA is also expanding \nits capability to observe disruption events first-hand so that it can cover a number of regional airports as well as airports around London. In addition, the CAA is currently engaging with the travel agent community to ensure that passengers that book via \na travel agent or other intermediary can be notified by the airline in the event of flight disruption. \n3.5.\n&#xa0; \nOn the subject of passenger rights, the CAA and members of the BATA airlines group have developed a short, easy to understand leaflet on passenger right\ns which this group of airlines have agreed to distribute to passengers in the event of flight cancellations or long delays. This is important to ensure that passengers are aware of what the airlines should be doing for them, and alongside our oversight wil\nl help to ensure that airlines comply with their obligations at all times.\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nAlthough the weather experienced\n during \nwinter 2010/2011 was unusually severe, the last two winters have also been challenging.\n The fact that, despite\n these challenging conditions, we did not see a repeat of the major disruption in winter 2010/2011, \nhighlights the benefits \nof the improvements that have been made, in particular by \nairports to improve their resilience to severe winter weather. \nA\nirlines ha\nve played their part also, in particular through improving how they communicate with passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, and also through improving the capability and flexibility for passengers to rebook \nonline \nwhen disruption does occur.\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nThi\ns is not to say, of course, that there is no further room for improvement. Despite the significant improvement in resilience achieved by Heathrow airport since winter 2010/2011, \nthe last two winters have seen significant disruption to British Airways\n’\n oper\nations at the airport, in particular at Terminal 5. \nThe sheer scale, intensity, and complexity of British \nAirways’ operation at the airport \nmeans\n that it faces a number of unique challenges. \nThese challenges are likely to be similar for any operator who ha\ns a large proportion of operations at an airport, particularly if capacity is constrained, either at peaks or as with Heathrow generally.\n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nWe believe that to \nensure airlines who face these circumstances are prepared for them\n, there are series of steps that \ncan be taken to ensure passengers are supported during disruption no matter how challenging the circumstances\n. These include, \nensuring their systems for proactively contacting passengers about flight disruption are robust and they have correct contact details for their passengers; being \nready\n \nto deal effectively with \nlarge and growing numbers of \npassengers when disruption occurs \n(for instance avoiding long queues for all passengers by breaking them into groups based on their flight’s status and ease of rebooking); making sure their all their staff have the same \ninformation to handle customer queries,\n and \nthat\n information is up-to-\ndate.\n \n4.4.\n&#xa0; \nIn addition, \nin circumstances where airlines have a large fleet operating from a single airport, there are also particular operational challenges, for instance in terms of de-icing, \nwhich they need to ensure they are ready for during future severe w\neather events.\n4.5.\n&#xa0; \nTo ensure that they are prepared for future events, and that disruption to passengers is minimised, th\ne CAA continues to work closely with \nUK and foreign airlines to \nensure they are addressing these issues\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe Civil Aviation Act 2012 allows much more flexible regulation as rules will be set within a licence that can be amended (subject to due process). On 3 October 2013 the CAA published our final proposals for regulation at Heathrow and Gatwick if we make a\n final decision in January that these airports have substantial market power that requires regulation. \n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nConsistent with better regulation principles, we have not sought to regulate for all eventualities but pick only key priorities for inclusion in the fir\nst licences granted to the airports. \n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nBecause we understand how important service quality during disruption is to passengers, one of the first licence conditions will strengthen each airport’s approach to operational resilience. The rules will ensure that \nthe airport has robust plans to deal with disruption, and an effective approach to collaboration; and will ensure full communication with affected passengers.\n \n5.4.\n&#xa0; \nWe are in the process of consulting on our Final Proposals for \nregulation for the period after A\npril 2014. \nThese licence conditions are part of that consultation. \nThe licences would come into force on 1 April 2014 so will not have an effect this winter, but plans and processes should be in place by October 2014\n to ensure that by winter 2014 regulated\n airports have a licence-condition obliging them\n to\n strengthen their readiness for disruption\n for the first time\n.\n5.5.\n&#xa0; \nThis condition would mean that if the airports failed to have adequate provisions in place \nto deal with \ndisruption \nto their operations or had \nnot followed their plans\n, and the CAA judged that more could have been done \nby the airport \nto protect passengers from the impact, they could be subject to fines, \npotentially up to 10% of \nthe airport\n’\ns\n turnover.\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2011/cold-dec\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.caa.co.uk/docs/5/CAA%20review%20of%20snow%20disruption%20-%20Final%20Report%20-%20WEB%20VERSION%20_2_.pdf\n \n"
