"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from See Me Save Me (CYS 059)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. Introduction&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI founded the See Me Save Me campaign after my sister Eilidh Cairns, \na fit and experienced cyclist of \n30yrs, was run down from behind by a fully laden tipper truck in Notting Hill Gate as she cycled to work on 5\nth\n February 2009\n;\n and \nas \nit \nbecame apparent how frequently cyclists and \npedestrians\n were being killed and seriously injured by HGVs\n;\n and how little preventative action\n,\n or even acknowledgement\n,\n was\n given by industry, government \nor the legal system to such systematic failure and loss.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the majority of cases where a cyclist is killed the driver claims they did not see them. In the majority of cases there is no prosecution. See Me Save Me campaigns for elimination of blind spots in HGVs and for greater visibility for cyclists in the j\nustice system.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI trained as a civil engineer and have worked in the construction industry for 20 years\n, currently as an independent sustainability advisor\n. I am a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers\n \n(ICE) \nand s\nit on its\n national Cycle Working \nGroup and \nas such \nrepres\nent the ICE on the TfL \nconstruction logistics \nindustry \nworking group currently drafting an industry standard to manage work related road risk to vulnerable road users (VRU). \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI am a member of\n the national charity for road crash victims,\n RoadPeace\n, which hosts the See Me Save Me website and I recently set up a regional branch in the North East wi\nth other bereaved families and\n local solicitor\n. \nI\n sit on the\n \nLondon based \nLorry Danger\n Reduction Group alongside\n LCC, CTC, RoadPeace, British Cycling\n, Sustrans\n and Living Streets. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI have instigated two Early Day Motions (EDMs),\n a ten-\nminute rule bill (by Sir Alan Beith\n MP\n) and lobbied at European Parliament to successfully persuade over 4\n00 MEPs to sign up to written declaration (WD) 81, submitted by Fiona Hall MEP\n,\n calling for \nEurope wide \nmandatory \nelimination of blind spots in HGVs through the \ninstallation \nof technology\n.\n I obtained permission from \nMayor \nBoris J\nohnson to install the first\n permanent ghost bike.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI am an experienced and regular \nurban and rural \ncyclist, \nmo\ntorcyclist and car driver with\n previous \ndaily \nLondon cycle \ncommute\ns ranging from \n10 to 20mile round trip\ns\n.\n \nI regularly cyc\nle with my three children aged 3, 6, 8\n in \nrural \nNorthumberland.\n I have experienced Exchanging Places and I have joined lorry dr\nivers in on-bike cycle training sessions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBackground&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main cause of death and injury to cyclists and the main b\narrier to the uptake of cycling\n is the danger posed by HGVs. \nWhilst \nHGVs are represented disproportionately in \ncyclist deaths they also \non average\n kill\n more than twice as many pedestrians than cyclists. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the majority of cases the driver says they did not see the cyclist or pedestria\nn (SMIDSY – Sorry Mate I Didn’t See You)\n. This can\n be because of a) blind areas, b) not looking, c) looking but not at the right time d) looking but not seeing. Many of the cyclists killed were fit and experienced and aware of the dangers of HGVs. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nfocus for prevention must rest with reducing the danger at source, that is the danger posed by the vehicle, by the driver and by the environment. This will have benefits to all of society on a far wider scale beyond preventing death, injury, and the cost o\nf such.\n As such t\nhis submission focuses on the measures to address the failings in the construction industry, the legal system and the political system to reduce the risk posed by HGVs to cyclists and other vulnerable road users.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecommendations&#xa0;A. Whether cycling is safe, particularly in towns and cities&#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are many \nstatistics\n used to arg\nue how safe or unsafe it is to cycle, some of them more appropriate than others\n. In reality perception is as important\n as statistics. The fact is\n the vast majority of the active and able adult \npop\nulation, including\n \nSir Bernard Hogan-Howe\n, \nthe Metro\npolitan Police commissioner,\n the man in charge of enfor\ncing road safety in the capital, \ndoes not\n consider cycling a\n safe \nmode of transport for themselve\ns, despite their desire to do so, and cite this as the main barrier to uptake\n. Any person slightly more vulnerable\n be it because they are\n older or younger\n,\n pregnant or\n carrying cargo or a child,\n less able\n or in bad weather,\n is usually deemed at best foolish for attempting to cycle \nand more often than not deserving of any injury that may befall them from a motor vehicle. This is far from the vision of a safe environment for cycling.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nB. What central and local Government could do to improve cycling safety&#xa0; Ideas could include better training and advice for drivers and cyclists, better enforcement of the law applying to drivers and cyclists, and better vehicle and road infrastructure.&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is much that central government can\n do to improve cycling safety through legislation for better standards for HGVs, the vehicles that pose the greatest risk\n,\n and best practice driver training but also through stipulation and enforcement of such standards through contractual\n documents for\n pu\nblicly funded construction projects\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are many technologies designed to prevent scratches on bumpers. Vehicle safety technology to date has focussed solely on protection of the occupant\n resulting in a respective significant fall\n in death and injury\n \nof car drivers\n. \nWhilst there are call\ns to cut traffic speed to 20mph,\n in the case of \ncollisions with \na lorry\n death of a VRU\n will \noccur at \na speed of only 2mph\n. A report published by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in April 2012 called for the \nmandatory implementation of ‘collision avoidance technologies’ to eliminate blind spots on all buses and lorries by 2015.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: \nM\nandatory requirement to have best available \ndesign and \ntechnology \nin HGVs to eliminate blind areas\n firstly focussing on \ndesign for \ndirect vision (lower cabs and clear doors) and secondly focusing on technology primarily that which automatically controls the vehicle eg ABS, vehicle\n departure warnings and sensors\n when danger of collision occurs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOn-bik\ne training for lorries drivers regularly results in an epiphany for them resulting in understanding of \ncyclists’\n positions, motivations and actions and subsequent acceptance of behaviour and consideration when sharing space. \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Mandatory on \nbike\n cycle awareness\n training for all drivers of HGVs\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe construction industry has recognised the specific risk it poses to vulnerable road users and is working on a voluntary construction logistics national standard on Work Related Road Risk due to be \nlaunched in December 2013. However, even with wide adoption by the major companies and strict attempts at enforcement and compliance due to the complexity of the supply chain and the well documented lack of compliance at the lower end of the haulage indust\nry (see operation Mermaid) it will be years before every HGV on the road meets the standard without the support of legislation.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Greater legal \nculpability of employers who allow ill-equipped or incompetent drivers to negotiate crowded stree\nts in ill-equipped or inadequate lorries which are effectively mobile places of work.  Employers must be legally required to have and enforce appro\npriate risk management policies that deal with risk from activities off site as well as on site.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDAT\nION: All public sector funded projects adopt the new construction industry standard for construction logistics and Work Related Road Safety and \nen\nsure its enforcement throughout the supply chain\n.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: All planning permission for major developme\nnts to include requirement to adopt national construction logistics Work Related Road Safety standard\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent government announcement to introduce exemptions to driver training\n requirements allowing untrained drivers to take charge of an HGVs for distances up to 50km flies in the face of the spate of recent deaths and the long heard calls for better driver training and the most recent and concerted efforts of industry leaders.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediately withdraw the proposals to any exemptions to driver training requirements\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInsufficient priority is given to keeping dangerous drivers off the road. Driving bans are short and can overlap with custodial sentences. There is a \nmisconception that many drivers are convicted and imprisoned but there are less than 250 drivers a year convicted of causing death by dangerous driving or careless driving whilst under the influence.\n&#xa0;\n3.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe driver who ran over and killed Eilidh\n Cairns in February 2009 later went on to run over and kill pedestrian Nora Gutman in June 2011. \nBoth bereaved families asked the judge not for retribution but that the driver never be allowed to drive an HGV again. Their requests went unheeded. \nThere are \nmany \nother cases where drivers h\nave a string of convictions, show no remorse and continue to driver irresponsibly.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMM\nE\nN\nDATION: Greater consideration of lifetime bans for drivers who kill or seriously \ninjure.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current culture of conflict and animo\nsity is created and inflamed by confusion over road space, lack of driver’s appreciation of a good cycle positioning, inadequate infrastructure causing fear and survival tactics, lack of enforcement of road traffic law designed to protect the vulnerable su\nch as use of ASL, mobile phone use, parking in cycle lanes and dangerous overtaking. \nWhilst there are\n calls for \ncyclists to exerc\nise greater caution\n, an analysis by Transport for London in 2011 of fatal and serious collisions involving cyclists shows that \n56 per cent of cases are caused by the motorist driving in an “unlawful or anti-social” manner, compared to only 6 per cent of collisions caused by a cyclist doing the same\n. \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: On-bike cycle awareness training to be a mandatory module of ev\nery\n motor vehicle\n driving test.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRecent cases of police officers stopping cyclists and clearly being unaware of\n the rights of cyclists and\n traffic law\n \nand they\n \nthemselves driving illegally\n \ndo little to \ninstil\n confidence in the legal system.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Review and refres\nh of police officer training with respect to\n cyclists and road traffic rules and regulations\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExisting cycle lanes are positioned on the left side of the highway. Over 50% of cyclist deaths \nare \ncaused by left turning \nvehicles. Much danger is presented to those in cycle lanes\n \nby motor vehicles entering cycle lanes and advanced stop boxes whilst driving and parking\n generating fear and conflict\n.  \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: A review of road traffic regulations to include a change s\no that turning traffic has to give way to through traffic and an incentive for motorists to respect areas designed to be safe for cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are no national standards in collision investigation; the ACPO road death investigation manual is advisory \no\nnly and \nnor is there any monitoring of consistency or procedures used by the 43 different police services across the country.  \nMany police investigations fall well below the level of acceptable competence (Jake Thompson, Eilidh Cairns, Marie Vescoe) result\ning in little chance of prosecution or prevention of further similar deaths through corrective action\n.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: A national minimum good practice standard agreed by ACPO and others including the national charity for collision investigators (ITAI).  \nThis should include prompt dealing with witnesses and the use of the Self Administered Questionnaire that allows witnesses to record information immediately.\n&#xa0;\n3.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA review of the court outcomes for drivers prosecuted for killing or seriously injuring cyclists in London found that between 2007 and 2010 of the 50 fatal cyclist collisions considered only half were taken to court. Of those 25 prosecutions only 12 were c\nonvicted of death by dangerous or careless driving. Law breaking committed with vehicles is treated much more leniently than with other dangerous machinery, or other crime committed on the street. Prosecutors do not receive specialized training and they ra\nrely visit the crash site or attend any inquest. \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Greater accountability and transparency during the investigation process including reporting of all police forces on the number of cases put forward to the CPS for prosecution \nand the numbe\nr of cases not put forward and the reasons why\n not\n.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Greater accountability and transparency during the prosecution process including a requirement for prosecutors to consider visiting the scene and \nfor \nthe publication of \nthe \nnumber of cases which are deemed not suitable \nfor prosecution and the reasons why\n not\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is a lack of transparency with the charging decision in road crashes, especially by the police in injury collisions, and the number of drivers in crashes that ha\nve broken the law is not counted.\n Therefore t\nhe victim of a road crash is not counted in crime statistics so the number of people killed or injured by law breaking drivers is not recorded or monitored at all at present. We do not know the number of innocen\nt victims injured by Dangerous Driving, Careless Driving, or Drink-Driving, as these charges do not mention when an injury has resulted. \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Vi\nctims of law breaking drivers to be included in victim of crime statistics.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCollision investigators are often asked in court what could be done to prevent these deaths. Their answers are unusually ill-informed and without due consideration. Coroners have powers make recommendations to prevent further similar deaths. These are ofte\nn not excersized because coroners are unaware of preventative low cost measures. In the case of Judicial Review into the inquest of Eilidh Cairns the coroner argued that ‘there were no practicable, preventative measures’ which could have been implemented\n t\no prevent death\n. This is simply untrue.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: M\nandatory and regular training and monitoring of collision investigators, prosecutors and coroners so they can consistently explain the full circumstances of the death and propose preventative \nmeasures to reduce future road deaths.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEvent Date Recorders (EDRs) or ‘Black Boxes’ are a simple, cheap and increasingly available technology, which can dramatically reverse the escalating problem of road death and long-term disability.  Black boxes are \nused to improve safety by monitoring the manner in which vehicles are being driven by recording distance driven, start and end time, average speed and time above speed limit, acceleration and deceleration and the highest speed for each trip. Information ca\nn be used for driver training and supervision through provision of continuous records, and for crash reconstruction and prevention through detailed vehicle data just before and after a crash. They can also incorporate automatic crash notification (e-call) \nusing GPS to alert the police and emergency services detailing location and potential severity. Drivers driving for work cause the majority of vulnerable road user deaths. \n&#xa0;\n3.17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers\n \n‘Intelligent Transport Intell\nigent Society’ published in March 2012 calls for vehicles to be installed with collision-avoidance technologies, which could help eliminate cyclist and pedestrian deaths caused by driver ‘blind-spots’, and state that they should be made mandatory for al\nl U\nK buses and lorries by 2015\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION:\n L\negislation to require and regulate \ncollision avoidance technologies\n with all devices meeting minimum technological standards \nfor all high risk groups including \nyoung or novice drivers, all public sector agencie\ns, all commercial drivers including public transport vehicles, company cars, and all construction vehicles accessing public roads.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nC. Whether it would be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours.&#xa0;\n3.18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStatistics show that deaths and serious injuries of cyclists peak at rush \nhours.\n \nA report by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) published in 1994 stated that in inner London, in relation to their traffic volume, HGVs cause 30 times as many cyclists deaths as cars and five times as many as buses.  It \nconcluded: \n\"Until the factors\n leading to this excess risk are understood, a ban on HGVs in urban areas should be considered.\"\n&#xa0;\n3.19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA study published a decade later in 2004 showed that between 1999 and 2004 nothing had changed. In fact over that period 85% of female cyclist fatalities in L\nondon involved heavy goods vehicles.\n&#xa0;\n3.20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Nov 2010 a report by Researchers from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) analyzed police road casualty data over a 15-year period from 1992 to 2006 and again called for a ban on heavy goods veh\nicles in Britain's cities after a study found that despite making only 4% of road trips they were involved in 43% of London's cycling deaths.\n&#xa0;\n3.21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe President of the Institution of Highways Engineers at the end of June 2012 called for a ban on HGVs on motorw\nays on Sundays.\n \nHGVs are banned in Dublin, Delhi, Paris and Dhaka. A lorry ban occurred in London during the 2 weeks of the Olympics. Not only were no adverse effects obvious but also it was widely reported that London was a much safer, more attractive and\n efficient place to be and through which to travel. \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: \nC\nonsideration of ba\nnning of HGVs during rush hours \nwhen statistics show pea\nk collision rates with cyclists, a recommendation which has been made by experts for over two decades.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Greater consideration and requirement for freight to travel by rail and water rather than by road in order to reduce the number of HGVs on road, and for this to be a requirement of all public sector construction projects\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.22\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe adoption of \nstricter liability would reduce the unfairness of outcomes and encourage the insurance industry to invest in reducing the threat posed to vulnerable road users as they already have with occupant safety\n and vehicle security.\n Stricter liability would also he\nlp create a safer road environment, promoting active travel. \n&#xa0;\n3.23\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn a \nreport for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, on Making walking and cycling normal, changing the civil legal liability system was identified as a key measure (Pooley, 2012).\n&#xa0;\n3.24\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMost countries in the world have a civil liability system whereby pedestrians and passengers are assumed to qualify for compensation. In Europe this includes Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain. In Sweden all casualties qualify for co\nmpensation. Stricter liability is the norm outside of Europe and can be found in Asia, including India, Bangladesh, Viet Nam. It was introduced in China less than 10 years ago.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Adoption of strict liability\n&#xa0;\n3.25\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGeneral animosity on the road is\n a result of con\nfusion and fights for space, \nbreaking of rules and\n uncertainty of\n unpredictable behaviour. The Dutch Sustainable Safety system shows that\n if\n infrastructure \nis designed to \nbe designed fit for purpose \nthen there is an increase in\n predictabili\nty of behaviour, which \nin turn breeds\n consideration between road users.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: review of design guidance and standards to allow \ncreation of cycle \ninfrastructure \nfit for purpose that is \nconvenient, fast, safe and comfortable with segregation where \npossible to \nfacilitate\n diversity \nin age, culture, disability, \nof people able to ride bikes. \n \n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Any highway or road maintenance works to include a review \nto improve \ncycle facility\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.26\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGeneral animosity on the road is a result of prejudice and stereotyping of those who chose a particular mode of transport and a lack of understanding of facts.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION: Road safety and bike awareness campaigns to dispel some of the negative myths around cycling to show that cyclists are just people on bikes, that most people on bikes are also drivers and so have insurance, that a person on a bike will norm\nally suffer more in a collision than another road user, that road tax does not exist any more, that road maintenance is paid for through general taxes and \nthe benefits the cyclist presents to all of society.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.27\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRoad death and injury is not unavoidable, it i\ns not inevitable. Road death is preventable and the reference to deaths as accidental removes culpability, presumes innocent, excuses law breaking and risk taking, undermines prevention efforts and aggravates suffering of the bereaved\n. \n&#xa0;\nRECCOMMENDATION: \nP\nolicy makers and the media to stop using the word ‘accident’ when referring to road crashes, and to adopt an appropriate, constructive and accurate terminology such as crash or collision.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.28\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCurrently most inquest verdicts in the case of road deaths are \nlogged as ‘accidental deaths’, a term families bereaved find insulting. As a result there is no way to count the number of road deaths and therefore acknowledge the true scale of road death and so attached any meaningful priority.\n&#xa0;\nRECOMMENDATION:  Introdu\nction of a \nspecific short ‘road death’ verdict. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.29\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI would welcome the opportunity to give oral evidence\n&#xa0;\n3.30\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI fully support\n o\nther submissions\n by\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n7\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://road.cc/content/news/99432-met-chief-says-some-londoners-ride-because-they-cant-afford-public-transport-he\n \nhttp://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/article3606032.ece\n \nhttp://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/cyclist-taking-kids-to-school-in-cargo-bike-hits-out-at-police-officer-who-stopped-him-during-safety-blitz-8962080.html\n \nhttp://road.cc/content/news/95184-video-police-apologise-stopping-helmetcam-cyclist-after-admitting-their-officer\n \nhttp://www.imeche.org/news/institution/all/12-04-30/Institution_report_on_intelligent_transport_systems.aspx\n \nhttp://www.roadpeace.org/resou\nrces/C\nrash_not_Accident_May_11_2011\n"
