default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPact is the UK trade association representing and promoting the commercial interests of independent feature film, television, digital, children's and animation media companies.
default&#xa0;
default2)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe UK independent television sector is one of the biggest in the world. Despi
defaultte the difficult economic climate, independent television sector revenues have grown from £1.3 billion in 2005 to nearly £2.8 billion in 2012.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2012, the BBC spent £507 million on commissions from UK independent producers. This was an increase from £4
default37m in 2011
default. The BBC commissioned 36% (37% in 2011-12) of eligible television content from external producers
default.
default&#xa0;
default4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBBC Commissions are important for independent producers as they account for 33% of all UK commissions, making the BBC the biggest buyer of con
defaulttent made by independent producers in the UK.

defaultPact is a supporter of the licence fee and recognises the important role that the BBC plays in British broadcasting. The BBC is also a leader on the world stage in terms of public services broadcasting. Howeve
defaultr, Pact highlights a number of areas in the submission where improvements could be made.

default&#xa0;
defaultFdefaultuture of the BBC inquirydefault&#xa0;defaultExecutive Summarydefault&#xa0;
defaultPact is a supporter of the BBC and the licence fee, re
defaultcognising
default that it plays an important role in terms of both value
default to the UK economy and culture and promoting the British brand overseas. Removing or reducing the licence fee in any way could have negative repercussions for the broadcasting sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn terms of the BBC achieving against its public purposes, Pact would l
defaultike to see improvements in number of areas:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultBeyond 2016, Pact would like to see mor
defaulte of the BBC licence fee 
defaultinvested in conten
defaultt. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe BBC should become a publisher/ broadcaster. The WoCC (Window of Creative Competition) should not act as a cap on external commissions and the BBC should opt for the best programme regardless of whether this is produced in-house or by an independen
defaultt producer (excluding news).
default&#xa0;
defaultPact supports the licence fee in order to fund the BBC beyond 2016. The licence fee
default is one of the key drivers 
defaultin the 
defaultcreation of intellectual property in the UK which can then be exploited overseas, creating and sustaining tho
defaultusands of jobs within the 
defaultUK 
defaultbroadcasting industry. Any redistribution of the licence fee 
defaultwould seriously erode the ability of the BBC to act as a corner stone of excellence
default. Such a move would limit its
default risk taking without any de
defaultmonstrable benefits to the 
defaultover
defaultall UK broadcasting ecology.
default&#xa0;
defaultResponse to the Inquiry questionsdefault&#xa0;defaultMission and purposedefault&#xa0;default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes? 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe purpose of the BBC and public service television broadcasting should be to create excellent and innovative content across a range of programme genres. It should act as a benchmark for the commercial sector by setting the creative standard for other PSB
default and commercial channels in the UK and increasingly abroad.
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC must continue to take risks and invest in drama, comedy and entertainment; taking risks that may be more difficult for commercial broadcasters. This helps to identify new talent that the w
defaulthole industry benefits from. The BBC must also maintain its world-class reputation for factual content.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPact is a supporter of the BBC and the licence fee, recognising that the BBC brings both economic benefits to the UK economy and influence or ‘soft powe
defaultr’ as part of its role in promoting the British brand overseas. The benefits attached to the licence fee are reflected in the value of the services provided and the wider economic benefit to the UK.
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe BBC is an integral part of UK life and its editorial 
defaultoutput is an important part of British culture and society. Any policy which diminishes the licence fee further could result in the loss of a number of positive multiplier effects. The BBC and other PSBs set broadcasting standards for other media channels 
defaultin the UK and worldwide. Arguably, this is positive for UK creativity and innovation in the wider creative industries too. Quality PSB programming is clearly something that UK audiences appreciate hence the significant investments by Cable and Satellite ch
defaultannels into high quality original programming that is
default often indistinguishable from
default that provided by licensed PSB channels.
default1.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of achieving its mission and public purposes, the BBC has performed well against its public purposes over
default the current Charte
defaultr period. With regard to 
default‘sustaining citizenship and civil society’, the BBC should continue its excellence in coverage of news and current affairs and factual programming. On ‘stimulating cultural creativity and excellence’, it should continue to inspire 
defaultcreativity, innovation and talent across a range of genres. On ‘bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK’, we will touch on in the submission the value of the BBC overseas and the increase in TV exports.
default1.6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe current public purposes remain broad
defaultly well targeted but Pact would like to see improvements in the following areas:
defaultPromoting education and learning
default1.7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe recent BBC Trust Review of Children’s Services report revealed that funding for children’s programming has not been ring fenced and faces 
defaultbudget cuts. In this regard, it is concerning that the BBC has emerged as the last 
defaultdominant investor and buyer of children’s programming over recent years, with ITV and Channel 4 playing a noticeably lesser role in this space.
default1.8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn light of this, the Governm
defaultent should, on the back of the success of tax credits for film, high end TV and animation, look into providing appropriate fiscal incentives to support children’s programming into the future. Investment in children’s programming is important in developing 
defaultand sustaining British culture and language and a generation of viewers that will enjoy content from the BBC and public service broadcasters into the future.
default1.9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince the publication of the BBC Trust report, Pact is engaged in further discussions with the BBC
default around improving communication and transparency in the commissioning process and also investigating future funding options for children’s programming, for example, through collaboration with other channels.
default&#xa0;
defaultRepresenting the nations, regions, communities
default1.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPact will continue to the monitor the BBC’s progress towards the target of realising 50% of network television by spend, outside London, by 2016. This target, set by the BBC Trust, includes 17% to be spent in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respective
defaultly. We are pleased to see that the BBC is on schedule to achieve this with 46% of spend achieved out of London and just under 16% in the devolved countries. The progress made on out of London spend will help contribute towards the sustained and organic gro
defaultwth of the sector across the UK.
default&#xa0;
default1.11.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn terms of diversity, BBC programming content should reflect the diversity of licence fee payers in England and across the devolved countries. It seems that there is still further work to do in terms of appealing to viewe
defaultrs in lower income brackets and particularly the 16-24 age range within that. 
defaultDelivering the benefits of emerging communications technologies
default1.12.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPact is plea
defaultsed that IPlayer has emerged as
default a world standard for IPTV (Internet Protocol TV) that other UK channe
defaultls and broadcasters globally are keen to emulate. Pact recognises the volume of investment that was injected into fully realising this project.
default1.13.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPact is keen that any future projects tapping into new technologies should be developed in collaboration with the industry and not separately. We expand on this theme later in the submission. 
defaultScope, scale and remitdefault•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat scope, scale and remit should the 
defaultBBC have?
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShould the BBC
default’
defaults output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences? What balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?
default&#xa0;
default2.1 The k
defaultey issue for Pact is, 
defaultwhat 
defaultis an appropriate 
defaultbalance
default for
default the BBC 
defaultto 
defaults
defaulttrike 
defaultbetween production in-house and external commissions. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultPact would reiterate the point made in previous submissions that the BBC should primarily be a publisher-broadcaster (apa
defaultrt from the news
default which should be retained). 
defaultAll demand for programming could be filled and supplied by the market, driving efficiency
default savings in the BBC,
default releasing more funds to invest in high quality content and providing other benefits to the broader UK 
defaultTelevision industry.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultBeyond Charter Renewal in 2016, Pact would like to see more funding released to the wider supply market. We would like to see the BBC always 
defaultable to 
defaultopt for the best programme regardless 
defaultof who the supplier is. This will ensure th
defaultat the BBC focusses on securing the best ideas at the best price from the market and the market will absorb the costs that currently are met by the BBC servicing a large fixed cost base of personnel and facilities.
default&#xa0;
default2.4 The BBC can easily
default ensure continuity
default of supply by 
defaultentering into long running agreements as it currently does for a number of key programming strands such as Question Time and Waterloo Road made by an Independent and non 
defaultIndependent production company respectively
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 Adopting a 
defaultpublisher/ 
defaultbroadcaster approach could have the potential of a ‘
defaultbig bang
default’ effect and 
defaultcontribute to the further 
defaultdevelopment of the UK TV industry. This would be good for the market overall, creating savings for the BBC and far from displacing talent, it would release t
defaultalent 
defaultthat could be utilised by the BBC, other 
defaultPSBs and commercial broadcasters driving 
defaultfurther 
defaultcompetitio
defaultn and innovation.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 
defaultLicence fee payers will continue to demand more value, more quality and more options in the future. BBC ratings show that top I
defaultndie shows are amongst the most popular e.g. Sherlock, Master Chef, The Voice and others. In 2012, UK Indies won half of all TV Baftas (12 out of 24).
default&#xa0;
default2.7 The 
defaultBBC is well placed to meet the needs of licence fee payers but to do so it has to ensure that it
defaults primary focus is on delivering the most creative, high quality programming that they can provid
defaulte while driving down the BBC's 
defaultcost base in order to continue to invest in original UK content across all genres.
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow have the BBC
default’
defaults commercial activities dur
defaulting the current Charter fitted with the BBC
default’
defaults public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?
default2.6 BBC Worldwide from the BBC’s commercial arm is an i
defaultmportant distributor of content. Looking to the future, BBC Worldwide should remain focused, based on its current remit and continue to operate as trading body at arms length. Its operations should remain clear and commercially transparent. Potentially, by
default opening up opportunities through the WoCC, BBC Worldwide could have more opportunities as the distributor of a broader rights base.
default&#xa0;
defaultDeveloping technologydefault•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?
default&#xa0;
default1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Graf Report published in 2005, reviewed BBC online and set out that the BBC had failed to use the licence fee to support the digital production sector. Opportunities were not taken at the time and issues were raised around external commissioning.
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn so
defaultme ways, eight years later the position has not sufficiently improved. 
defaultThere is still work to do in creating a fully 21
defaultst
default century digital production sector. Pact’s submission to the BBC Trust’s Online Service review outlined concerns, amongst others, aroun
defaultd:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe fact that the online quota is largely met by commissioning several pieces of low value content and services from many different external suppliers. This suggests outsourcing is happening rather than a genuine investment by the BBC on content, servic
defaultes and technology from external suppliers
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe decision made by the BBC Executive not to introduce a digital WoCC, allowing independent producers to access more opportunities beyond the 25% quota.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 Pact would be sceptical about future attempts made by t
defaulthe BBC to introduce any significant or new technical solutions without the involvement of the wider industry. Significant investment went into developing the technology behind IPlayer from scratch. At some point in the future, an IPlayer refresh may take p
defaultlace in order to make the service and contents more relevant and user friendly.
default3.4 Faced with the future option of developing new technology or buying a solution off the shelf from an established digital company, Pact would welcome the BBC 
defaulttaking the oppo
defaultrtunity to partner with digital companies and use expertise and solutions that are already being developed, to save investment costs where possible.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 The Charter allows for development in new technology platforms and we would want to see this provision
default continue into the future, preferably as already articulated, investing in solutions already being developed. Pact also recognises, as does the BBC, that further work will need to be done working with digital companies to integrate the BBC’s service offeri
defaultng with existing and future social media platforms.
default&#xa0;
default3.6 In terms of digital identifiers, the BBC should move quickly to introduce digital identifiers for content. The BBC’s Digital Media Initiative failed earlier in the year after £100m was invested into 
defaultthe project. Digital identifiers in the form of ISAN (the international audio visual standard) have already been developed by the industry. BBC should look into integrating and using this international standard for registering audio visual works rather tha
defaultn going down an alternative route.
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding beyond 2016default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? Is there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC? What comparisons can be made with the provision of public serv
defaultice content in other countries? 
default4.1 Pact is strong supporter of the BBC licence fee; this is essential for the delivery of quality broadcasting in the future and should be protected. The licence fee which is channelled
default into BBC programming also acts as seed funding driving the creation of British intellectual property. The licence fee gives the UK a competitive advantage and a platform into international markets, creating and sustaining thousands of jobs in the process.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 The BBC is the envy of public broadcasters around the world and a recent report
default underlines the value of the BBC in creating and selling Britain’
defaults 
default‘soft power’ overseas. The report demonstrated that cultural factors such as language, creativity and 
defaultvalues contribute to the UK’s attractiveness as a source of overseas trade and investment and that:
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPeople who consume BBC services more frequently have more favourable perceptions of the UK
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe more business leaders know and consume the BBC, the more like
defaultly they are to trade with the UK.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 The success of the current regime is demonstrated in the fact that TV exports have more than doubled over the last few years. The most recent Pact/UKTI Export report shows that UK TV exports continue to rise and were 
defaultup 4% overall to £1,178m in 2012. The main markets are the US and Europe but with strong growth in China 
default(+90%), Indonesia (+81%) and India (+42%) and future potential in other markets also.
default4.4 In terms of funding beyond 2016, Pact would support an approp
defaultriate annual increment to the licence fee. This may be in line with, or higher than, inflation taking into account the changing economic environment. Pact would be concerned that a failure to secure future funding for the BBC would erode the budget for fut
defaulture original content which is a driver of IP creation.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 Pact is opposed to any redistribution of the licence fee to other broadcasters. The BBC has integrated the licence fee into its business plan and operating model and demonstrated that it can creat
defaulte, deliver and sustain high quality content over a period of time. By redistributing this fee to other broadcasters, the current impact of the Public Service Broadcaster would be lost.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 Competition amongst the broadcasters is important to drive creativ
defaultity and innovation. By replacing the licence fee with advertising revenue in any way would damage the BBC’s unique service model. The BBC drives the world’s best TV industry which is vastly different from similar sized countries such as Italy with RaiUno. 
defaultThe competition angle is important in sustaining future success in the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultGovernance, Regulation and accountabilitydefault•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDoes a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secret
defaultary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?
default5.1 Pact agrees that there should continue to be an appropriate governance structure that holds the BBC management to account. A ten year Charter that provides conti
defaultnuity and a strategic view, agreed by the Government, is still the most appropriate constitutional framework.
