In Afghanistan, Persons with disability, Recent War Victims, Landmine Survivors both men/women and children live in extreme poverty having very limited skills and education which segregated them from job, comprehensive education because of their disability and inadequate support.Persons with disability have very little capacity for competition in the job markets with those who has no disability with quality of their educations.  According to the recent information from the Ministry of Labour Social Affairs Martyrs and Disabled (MoLSAMD) , there are 

[[[680000]]] Six Hundred Eighty thousand persons living with disability as consequence of from War, Landmine , UXO, Suicide Attack and Accidents. There is no public survey conducted in Afghanistan for the exact number of P.W.D,  but random survey indicated that there are more than 3 million people living with different types of disability including the above War victims figures.&#xa0;In Afghanistan, Persons with disability especially women /children are not aware of their social, political and economic rights because, there are still no comprehensive services available for P.W.D. neither from government and nor from the International community such as UN and others stakeholders.&#xa0; The government of Afghanistan has 5% employment quota and law for employment of the persons with disability but it is not implemented so far due to discrimination, neglecting of disability and lack of financial and human resources.&#xa0;The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan officially ratifies the UN-CRPD Convention but it is not put in to practice yet. AOAD is very keen in the implementation of the CRPD Convention along with the Afghan law for the well-being of P.W.D, recent war victims and others in the country.  &#xa0;Persons with disability are challenged with Physical barrier also very limited rehabilitations facilities available only in the main provincial capital. Unemployment and barrier to education confront access barriers on a daily basis for equal participation their life is not improved yet. There is general agreement that financial support for collection of better data with implementation is required to provide a basis for action and policy to address challenges to access comprehensively. However, basic prevalence data do not provide guidance to those who seek to dismantle barriers, and there is a lack of empowered disability organization because, currently they are lacked shortage of funding for such activities for disability development activities in Afghanistan to proceed with data collection and analyst the situation and improve the activities.&#xa0;

[[[Situation of Rehabilitation of persons with disability in Afghanistan:]]]Thousands of persons with disability both women/men and children lacked mobility problems there is no wheelchairs distribution free of charges including the crutches. ICRC has producing every month around 27 wheelchairs but it is only for their registered patients.Healthcare of persons with disability is a challengeable issue in Afghanistan. There are no free medical systems for free and accessible medical or surgery treatment for persons with disability only ICRC has some facilities but they are only operating mainly in Kabul, Mazar, Jalalabbad, Hirat. Theses provinces cannot say yes to the solution of the whole Afghanistan people with disability. ICRC has no limitation from others provinces they say yes to any Afghan with disability, but for persons with disability it is difficult for coming from one province or far district to another long distance due to their poverty it is difficult to afford the expensive rent of bus with huge challengeable physical accessibility before receive artificial limbs or outhouses.&#xa0;

[[[Employability of persons with disability in Afghanistan:]]]Employment is an parts of the life for every one also it is basic rights of the human being, but people with disability are the poorer of the poor because, of their haven-gone skills due to their disability, discrimination and lacked skills prevent them from work in the labor market lacked unemployment. In Afghanistan, Persons with disability is always the last to be hired and the first to being discharges.&#xa0;

[[[Sustainability: ]]]Steps toward the elimination of all the above problems will be preventing through sustainable development activities for inclusion of persons with disability in the job markets and providing equalizations are the followings:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Needs assessments survey for persons with disability with data collection with interest of P.W.D for interestable vocational training for sustainable jobs.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Lobby and advocacy for implementation the Afghan law in general public&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Providing sustainable rehabilitations services with durable Artificial limbs and Outhouse’s&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Micro-Credit for self/help socio economical business.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Assistive technology such as wheelchairs, White Can and Crutches &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Improvement of the physical accessibility with Ramps constructions and adaptation of classes and door steps schools. &#xa0;

[[[activities ]]]

[[[in Afghanistan]]]

[[[:]]]As far as I know DFID in Afghanistan, they are spending for supporting the government, and also providing huge support to International Organization as implementing partners for developmental and humanitarian’s affair. For Afghan disabled people NGOs, they have very limited support to persons with disability in Afghanistan. I several time knocked the door of DFID in Afghanistan, they only said that we are supporting the International Organizations not have so far plan to support local NGOs. There are very limited NGOs running by persons with disability working for the mission and vision to support persons with disability in Afghanistan. In the present context, many of the Afghan disabled people organization are collapsed due to the 2014 alarm of the media.  The Afghan government has no systems to support the Afghan CSOs, DPOs and NGOs. Several Afghan NGOs working for persons with disability has shortage of funding for their activities and administrative support because; the donor’s agencies are not interesting to support disability development activities in Afghanistan because, it is not related to politics.&#xa0;DFID must take the responsibility to capacitate the Afghan NGOs for expandable support to persons with disability in the following systems:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Mainstreaming disability as top agenda&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Providing long term developmental project with sustainable mission and vision&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Enhance empowerment program to persons with disability for their equal participation as decision makers&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Enhance disability equality program through leadership, management program in the country and abroad&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Eradication of poverty of the persons with disability through ours owns decisions with self-help activities &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Integration of children with disability to education with accessible schooling and provide schools fee for their transportation as scholarships.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Providing support to improve the physical accessibility to change mindsets of general public regarding the equalization of persons with disability.&#xa0;Once again thank you very much &#xa0;Abdul Khaliq zazaiAOAD Director and founderCountry Rep of GAATES Canada for AfghanistanWeb: aoad-af.org &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
