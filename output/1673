defaultA largely decarbonised electricity 
defaultsector consisting of nuclear, renewables and CCS, combined with energy storage and demand response is technically achievable.  Without CCS, the UK would need a lot more nuclear if it is to meet greenhouse gas (GHG) targets.
default&#xa0;

defaultThere are three main compone
defaultnts to CCS: capture, transport and storage. All three components use proven technologies that have been demonstrated independently in different industries. The three have not yet been implemented together in an end-to-end system in the power sector.
default&#xa0;
default4.
default              
defaultIn
default this submission, we have concentrated on CCS in the context of power generation because that is the scope set out by the ECC Committee in its call for evidence.  Once proven, CCS will be applicable to industries other than power generation, thus allowing 
defaultcuts in CO
default2
default emissions that could not readily be achieved otherwise.
default&#xa0;
default5.
default              
defaultAll of the CCS technologies currently available will impose an efficiency penalty, effectively requiring approximately 10-15% more fuel to be burned in gas-fired power plants and 20-25
default% in coal-fired power plants to produce the same amount of electricity.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default              
defaultThe key barrier for CCS technology is that, to date, there have been insufficient economic reasons for companies to develop and implement it or even to undertake the demonstrations
default necessary to bring the technology to maturity.
defaultWhat types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? default&#xa0;
default7.
default              
defaultThe three main components of CCS are capture, transport and storage. 
default 
defaultAll three use proven technologi
defaultes that have been demonstrated independently in different industries.

default&#xa0;
defaultCarbon Capture Technologies
default&#xa0;
default8.
default              
defaultThere are three principal methods of carbon capture
default:
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPre-combustion: carbon is removed from the fuel prior to combustion so that the exhaust is essentially carbon-free;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPost-combustion: carbon dioxide is removed from the plant exhaust after combustion;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOxy-fuel: the fuel is burnt in pure oxygen resulting in 
defaulta high concentration of carbon dioxide in the exhaust so it can be removed more easily. (If the fuel is burnt normally in air, the exhaust contains a large amount of nitrogen from the air, meaning that there is a greater volume of gas to treat, making remo
defaultval more difficult.)
default&#xa0;
default9.
default              
defaultPre-combustion processes are suitable for new construction, which fits the situation for coal generation in the UK, where new plants would replace existing coal plants that are all quite old and relatively inefficient by modern sta
defaultndards.  Post-combustion (and potentially oxy-fuel) is suitable for retrofit to existing coal and gas plants as well as new build.  There are numerous available reports that provide additional details on these three technologies, providing a comparison of 
defaultcosts, efficiencies and trade-offs.
default  
default&#xa0;
default10.
default              
defaultIt is important to note that all of the technologies currently available will impose an efficiency penalty, effectively requiring approximately 20-25% more coal or 10-15% more natural gas to be burned to produce 
defaultthe same amount of electricity.  The reason for this is the high energy consumption of the carbon capture stage of the process at the power station site.  Approximately twice as much CO
default2
default 
defaultis produced and therefore 
defaulthas to be captured per unit of electricity 
defaultgenerated when using coal compared with using gas.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default              
defaultEach technology has a number of potential variations and there are a number of promising refinements. 
default 
defaultFor example, alternative absorption materials for post-combustion capture may offer significant f
defaultuture reductions in the inherent efficiency penalty associated with 
defaultCO
default2
default capture.
default&#xa0;
default12.
default              
defaultWe would suggest that narrowing the UK focus to one particular technology (either pre- or post-combustion, or oxy-fuel) would not be beneficial, as different generation 
defaultplants will benefit from different capture technologies: new construction is likely to be most relevant for coal in the UK, while natural gas plants, if built in quantity to meet a shortfall in generation, could have more potential for retrofit.
default&#xa0;
defaultTransport
default and Storage Technologies
default&#xa0;
default13.
default              
defaultCarbon dioxide transport is a mature technology following decades of operation for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications in the US and more recently for offshore storage in the North Sea.  Onshore 
defaultCO
default2
default transport has been pr
defaultincipally for EOR away from centres of 
defaultpopulation.  There are potential concerns over safety should a pipeline rupture occur close to a population centre and these need to be addressed and managed (See Question 5 for further discussion of safety)
default.
default&#xa0;
default14.
default              
defaultLon
defaultg-term storage is less well developed with only a small number of reference sites. For example, Norway has been injecting approximately 1mt of 
defaultCO
default2
default a year into the North Sea at Sleipner since 1996. 
default 
defaultWe would suggest that exploration and proving trials for 
defaultoffshore UK storage sites are accelerated to ensure that this part of the chain is fully developed.
default&#xa0;defaultWhat contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?default&#xa0;
default15.
default              
defaultProviding a
defaultll the decarbonised electricity required to meet the carbon reduction targets for the electricity sector using a combination of renewables and nuclear power alone would be logistically demanding and costly, even with significant demand reduction through en
defaultergy efficiency and the active management of peak demand.  All these technologies carry development and deployment risk, as well as economic risk, which makes a wider portfolio of options highly desirable.
default&#xa0;
default16.
default              
defaultIn all global scenarios and modelling through
default to 2050 that we have seen, fossil fuel generation sources will be essential to meet overall energy demands.  In order to meet EU and UK carbon reduction targets and global needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we believe fossil fuel generation will ne
defaulted to decarbonise through the application of CCS.
default&#xa0;
default17.
default              
defaultThe 2010 Royal Academy of Engineering report 
defaultGenerating the Future
default 
defaulto
defaultutlined four energy scenarios that could meet the 2050 emission reduction target. 
default 
defaultIn all scenarios there is contribution from CCS i
defaultn order to meet the UK’s 80% reduction target.
default 
default Only the 
default“
defaulthigh demand reduction
default”
default scenario shows a limited deployment of CCS and the report did not recommend implementing a policy based on this scenario. 
default 
defaultThe report highlighted the urgent need to progress a
default full suite of low carbon technologies if we are to meet the targets. 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default              
defaultThe government’s expectations to achieve a largely decarbonised electricity sector by 2050 are reasonable as a largely decarbonised electricity sector, consisting of nuclear, 
defaultrenewables and CCS, combined with energy storage and demand response, is technically achievable.  It is difficult to estimate the cost of achieving this and we may find over the timeframe we are reviewing, one or two new technologies appear and/or existing
default technologies achieve a step change in cost/performance.  In addition, technologies currently favoured may hit barriers in development or deployment and become less significant than currently predicted.
default&#xa0;
default19.
default              
defaultThe DECC July 2013 levelised cost forecasts for 
defaultgeneration technology projects commissioning around 2025
default show coal and gas generation equipped with CCS and renewables to be at a similar cost (within margins of error to be expected over this planning horizon). 
default 
defaultThere are some indications that the cost o
defaultf renewables will fall below the estimates of coal and gas with CCS towards the end of the 2020s but this is difficult to predict and depends on fuel price expectations and anticipated advances in the efficiency of renewables delivery.
default 
default We believe that CCS
default could potentially become economically viable over this period alongside other low carbon technologies, assuming demonstration proves successful and decarbonisation targets are not relaxed.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default              
defaultThere are further potential CCS applications in industry (suc
defaulth as refining, cement, iron and steel production) that could materially contribute to the UK meeting decarbonisation targets.
default&#xa0;
default21.
default              
defaultIn the longer term, once CCS has been developed and proven, it has the potential to create “negative” carbon emissions by bei
defaultng applied to power stations fuelled by biomass from sustainable sources.  This is potentially an important capability because it could theoretically be used to offset the carbon emissions from applications where it is hard to imagine replacing unabated fo
defaultssil fuels, such as aviation.  A number of respected analysts including the Energy Technologies Institute see this as an important part of decarbonising by 2050.
default&#xa0;defaultAre there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of succesdefaultsfully developing CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?default&#xa0;
defaultCommercial benefits:
default&#xa0;
default22.
default              
defaultThe main benefit of CCS is that it offers a means of decarbonising fossil fuels, which are a stable, reliable and proven generation source.  On a global basis
default,
default fossil fuel generation will continue to be a major part of the energy mix. 
default 
defaultRecent trends show the developing economies of the world largely powering their economies through coal and gas fired electricity generation, and fossil fuels for transportation.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default              
defaultThere exists the opportunity for the UK to design, develop and implement 
defaultworld
default-
defaultleading CCS projects.
default 
default Research is underway at UK universities that may lead to valuable IP which could be exploited on a global scale.  However, much of the work to be don
defaulte is industrial, moving from pilot scale, through to demonstration in large-scale projects. 
default 
defaultThis could provide commercial opportunity for a number of UK companies involved, some of which are conducting world-leading large pilot demonstrations, such as Doo
defaultsan Babcock at Renfrew, Glasgow.  We would expect to see economic value throughout the supply chain and the creation of jobs that would have value, but this would depend on the UK’s success in this activity versus global competitors.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default              
defaultSuccessful demons
defaulttration of CCS in the UK could kick start the technology elsewhere and create first mover advantage.  We would however caution that a number of countries have also invested in CCS research, development and deployment, particularly Canada, the USA, Norway a
defaultnd China, and first mover advantage will need effort to be gained and sustained.  One area where the UK may be more likely to gain competitive advantage could be the application of CCS on 
defaultgas
default-
defaultfired plant, which seems likely to be a major part of the UK’s r
defaultequirements.  Most other countries are focusing on CCS on 
defaultcoal
default-
defaultfired plant.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default              
defaultThe potential benefits of exporting know-how does, however, depend on a continuing and increasing global response to addressing climate change, which is not certain at this st
defaultage.
default&#xa0;
defaultDiversity and flexibility:
default&#xa0;
default26.
default              
defaultCCS power generation offers advantages as part of a diverse energy mix in that it could be deployed at scale with an established fuel supply chain. 
default 
defaultCCS can be combined with flexible generation plant (such as combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT)), which is needed for grid balancing.  Once proven, it is likely that CCS-equipped power stations would evolve to be specified for flexible operation to obtain th
defaulte greatest benefit from the technology.  Most analysts believe that such power stations would be cost-competitive with nuclear and 
defaultrenewables once deployed at scale, subject to demonstration and continued commitment to carbon targets and supporting price/r
defaultegulatory mechanisms.
default&#xa0;
defaultDisadvantages:
default&#xa0;
default27.
default              
defaultThe disadvantages are the continued dependence on fossil fuel (and therefore world fuel prices), concerns over security of supply, and integrity of the permanent storage.  In the shorter term, a further disadvanta
defaultge is the large adverse impact on power station thermal efficiency which, in today’s world of low carbon prices, makes CCS appear only to add cost and degrade performance.  However, this situation should not last if the world becomes serious about abating 
defaultclimate change.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? default&#xa0;
defaultEconomic
default&#xa0;
default28.
default              
defaultThe key barrier for CCS is 
defaultthat a mechanism is required to create an economic driver as CCS adds costs without any direct economic benefit.  In the UK, we have legislated for our 2050 GHG targets and as a consequence have developed economic incentives to ensure that these are achiev
defaulted.  These comprise the carbon price floor which penalises plant that emits carbon and therefore will give CCS technology a cost advantage.  However, the main mechanism is a long term Contract for Difference (CfD) which would need to be negotiated with gov
defaulternment. We support the recommendations from the CCS Cost Reduction Task Force Report
default that we need make progress here to ensure that funding mechanisms are ﬁt-for-purpose and that the contracts are bankable. 
default&#xa0;
default29.
default              
defaultIt is difficult to comment internationall
defaulty other than the same principles would need to apply, i.e. GHG targets supplemented by incentives to ensure they are achieved.
default&#xa0;
default30.
default              
defaultPlease see also the response to Question 1.
default&#xa0;
defaultPolitical
default&#xa0;
default31.
default              
defaultGovernment action to fund the first project as soon as possible would strengthen the UK’s pathway to decarbonising its fossil fuel generation (and assist with decarbonisation of other heavy industry outside of power generation) in order that CCS can be pro
defaultven and applied to the rest of the fossil fuel generation mix (and other industrial sources). 
default 
defaultWithout it, it is difficult to see how the UK will decarbonise its electricity system and industrial sectors to meet the targets.
default 
default The danger in not having demon
defaultstration projects operational that prove the technology is that commitment to achieving the country’s carbon reduction targets may begin to erode.
default&#xa0;
defaultRegulatory
default&#xa0;
default32.
default              
defaultThere are safety risks in the construction and operation of CCS, as there are with any 
defaultlarge-scale enterprise, which will require analysis, mitigation and the development of appropriate regulation.  These are discussed further in our response to Q5.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default              
defaultThe UK has not yet addressed the legal framework around 
defaultCO
default2
default disposal and sequestration offshore but it is a significant issue.  A key issue will be to put in place an effective commercial and regulatory structure. 
default 
defaultThese (and more) questions need to be answered before investors would start to invest:
default&#xa0;
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWill a monop
defaultoly 
defaultCO
default2
default network be a regulated industry, like National Grid? 
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWill the reservoirs be owned by a monopoly state organisation or will there be a competitive market in which reservoir owners bid to 
defaultpower stations to take their 
defaultCO
default2
default?
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWho will regulate this mark
defaultet?
default•
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat is the role of The Crown Estate? Who will issue licences to sequester carbon?
default&#xa0;
defaultScientific
default&#xa0;
default34.
default              
defaultThe storage component has some geological integrity risks to be addressed.  We are not able to comment on the permanent integrity of geological sequestr
defaultation for saline aquifers or depleted oilfields, but would suggest opinion is best sought from the British Geological Survey and academic researchers in that area.
default&#xa0;
defaultTechnology
default&#xa0;
default35.
default              
defaultThe greatest technology challenges are around improving the efficiency of the capture process, which typically requires 10-15% (for gas) and 20-25% (for coal) more fuel to be burned for the same electrical output.  The cost associated with this is the larg
defaultest contributor to the overall cost of CCS. 
default 
defaultThe process will typically sequestrate 85% of the 
defaultCO
default2
default typically produced, rising to 90% predicted by 2020. 
default 
defaultThere is opportunity for technology development to improve that level, which if coupled with a high car
defaultbon price, could also improve the economics.  There are technologies in the research stage that show promise in these areas.
default&#xa0;
default36.
default              
defaultThe other key challenges are pulling together several technologies, all of which may have been demonstrated in different appli
defaultcations but which have yet to be integrated with a large power station (either new or being retrofitted), a network of new 
defaultCO
default2
default pipelines and various storage reservoirs – probably mainly offshore. 
default 
defaultThe systems engineering and project engineering of all this
default and its control systems, while essentially routine, is distinctly “non-trivial” and is something that is likely to be developed over the first half-dozen projects.
default&#xa0;
defaultSocial
default&#xa0;
default37.
default              
defaultThere is further work to do on public outreach to ensure the safety and storage integrity components are fully understood by key stakeholders. 
default 
defaultConsiderable public resistance to CCS has been seen in Europe, but there the permanent underground 
defaultCO
default2
default storage w
defaultas planned to be onshore.
default 
default The UK’s intention to store 
defaultCO
default2
default in saline aquifers offshore should ease the public concern. 
default 
defaultWe suggest thorough public engagement on the benefits and risks of CCS.
default&#xa0;
default38.
default              
defaultAs with other new low-carbon technologies, costs will be hi
defaultgher than for current systems and public acceptance of this will be crucial.
default&#xa0;
defaultAre there any safety issues associated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe? default&#xa0;
defaultCapture
default&#xa0;
default39.
default              
defaultCapture plant is standard i
defaultndustrial process technology.  
defaultThere are significant safety management issues but they should be wholly within the capabilities of a competent operator and would be regulated by the HSE in the normal way.
default&#xa0;
defaultTransport
default&#xa0;
default40.
default              
defaultCO
default2
default is inert but heavier than air, 
defaultand in the event of an escape it will tend to settle at ground level and potentially expose people and animals in the area to risk of suffocation.  There are thus safety risks associated with accidental or malicious pipeline ruptures that will need to be a
defaultddressed and managed.  The Energy Institute has produced technical guidance
default 
defaulton how to manage the transport of 
defaultCO
default2
default safely where there is increased population density.
default&#xa0;
default41.
default              
defaultSafety will be the prime responsibility of the asset owner, regulated by the HSE. 
defaultRisks associated with a properly maintained and regulated CO2 pipeline transmission network should be seen in the context of other potentially hazardous operations such as transporting natural gas and ethylene, which are routinely carried out in the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultS
defaulttorage
default&#xa0;
default42.
default              
defaultStorage facilities for the UK will be offshore, and will carry risks of offshore working as for offshore oil, but these should be manageable by a competent operator.  Studies of reservoir integrity will be an important part of the development o
defaultf sequestration sites, and we would not expect either seepage or sudden release of 
defaultCO
default2
default from properly designed storage reservoirs.  Safety will be regulated by the HSE as for other offshore activities.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow have other countries incentivised CCS development?default How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? default&#xa0;
default43.
default              
defaultThe Global CCS Institute (GCCSI) maintains a list of global projects and their status.
default In power generation applications there are demonstration projects in the ‘execute’ stage in USA and Canada.  Those at the ‘Define and Evaluate’ stage include Europe (10), US (5) and Canada (1).  In the US and Canada projects, the

defaultWe believe projects that are for end-to-end power generation application will be directly funded by governments, and potentially smaller projects linking in industrial sources of 
defaultCO
default2
default to the existing networks will be too. 
default 
defaultThose projects capturing 
defaultCO
default2
default from 
defaulta power plant and using the

default for EOR have some government funding to support the commercial value of the 
defaultCO
default2
default.
default&#xa0;
default45.
default              
defaultWe do not believe that other countries have developed or implemented incentives or mechanisms that specifically encourage private sector development and deployment of CCS. 
default 
defaultThis represents an opportunity to take a leadership position by progressing models 
defaultto ensure the first commercial full scale CCS project takes place in the UK.
default&#xa0;
defaultIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?default&#xa0;
default46.
default              
defaultThe roadmap is a welcome demonstration of the government’s i
defaultntention to see CCS become a commercial reality, especially including the cost reduction activity which is underway to identify and promote cost reduction efforts.
default&#xa0;
default47.
default              
defaultSince the report was published in April 2012, key milestones appear to be slipping. 
default 
defaultWe
default believe a decision on granting the £1bn funding and additional EMR support to the first project will now not be made until mid-2015, whereas the plan indicated that would be 
defaultmid-2014
default.
default 
default We believe it would be possible to take this decision as early as late
default 2013 for some projects given the voluminous work and FEED studies that have already been undertaken. 
default 
defaultThese slips emphasise the industry’s concern as to whether CCS will become a commercial reality.
default&#xa0;
default48.
default              
defaultThe key is to have the first project operational as
default soon as possible in parallel with clear development of the regulatory framework and commercial model. 
default&#xa0;
default49.
default              
defaultProgress towards a demonstrator is currently constrained more by the terms and requirements of public competitions than by the capability to develo
defaultp and construct the plant.
default&#xa0;
defaultCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in this? default&#xa0;default50.
default              
defaultAn affordable and reliable decarbonised electricity sector, broadening in time to encom
defaultpass heavy industry, would demonstrate the UK’s ability to deliver leading edge energy projects. 
default 
defaultShould economies around the world similarly aspire to achieve a decarbonised energy sector, then the UK would be in an ideal place to seize on those opportunities. 
default 
defaultAt least as important as the technologies will be the economic and regulatory environment t
defaulthat creates the platform for investment.
default&#xa0;
default51.
default              
defaultCCS offers one of those areas where UK expertise could be exported as we expect that the majority of the world to have a fossil fuel-based electricity sector for the foreseeable future.
default 
default Additionally, the carbo
defaultn intensity of other major industrial processes (such as cement production) can be improved through the application of CCS on their processes. 
default&#xa0;
default52.
default              
defaultMitigating fossil fuel emissions has potential for significant large scale impact on a global scale, provid
defaulting a pathway for developing countries to meet 
defaultCO
default2
default reduction targets whilst utilising readily available fuel resources.
default&#xa0;
default53.
default              
defaultWe would add, however, that for CCS to make real impact there needs to be a stronger global consensus on carbon emissions reduction
default, with rich countries (including the UK) being prepared to bear the costs of carbon emissions abatement on a large scale, and a way found to bear the costs in developing countries.  This seems challenging in the present economic climate, and given reduced 
defaultpublic interest in climate change globally, but this needs to be viewed in the context of developments taking place over several decades.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fdefaultails?default&#xa0;
default54.
default              
defaultIf CCS is not taken forward at sufficient scale, additional measures and/or technologies would need to be implemented if we are to meet the carbon reduction target. 
default&#xa0;
default55.
default              
defaultThe primary alternative technology is probably new nuclear.  Without CCS, 
defaultthere would be a need for a much larger UK nuclear build programme than currently envisaged
default. 
default This is deliverable from an engineering perspective, but would require large amounts of capital and the substantial expansion of UK and global supply chains.  Fro
defaultm a risk perspective it leaves a significant exposure to the costs of nuclear, especially in a market with relatively few approved vendors and fuel sources.
default&#xa0;
default56.
default              
defaultAlternatively, or additionally, a greater capacity of reliable renewable generation would need
default to be developed. 
default 
defaultIn the case of offshore wind, expansion on a scale to replace the potential role of thermal power stations equipped with CCS would probably be unfeasible given the need to manage generation intermittency on such a large scale.
default 
default To suppor
defaultt this, we would need very large scale and potentially long term energy storage and/or interconnection across Europe and potentially beyond.  Such scenarios have been explored in models, but carry substantial development and deployment risks, which again e
defaultmphasise the value in the optionality of CCS.
default&#xa0;
default57.
default              
defaultTime of use tariffs and demand response techniques could be developed to reduce and adjust the timing of energy usage.
default 
default However, given the scale of the deployment of these techniques that would be needed t
defaulto meet the targets, in the absence of CCS and/or nuclear at the right scale, the impact on the electricity and energy system would be profound, and would probably challenge the limits of public acceptance.
default&#xa0;
