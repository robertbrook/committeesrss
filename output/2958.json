"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Mark Ryan (CRJ 01)&#xa0;\n1. \nMy name is Mark Ryan and I am a Senior Lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at Coventry University. My submission, however, is made in my personal capacity and indicates my personal observations \nin respect of the r\nole of the courts in the \ncontext of a codified constitution\n. It in no way reflects the view\ns \no\nf\n my employer (Coventry University). \n&#xa0;\n2. Question 1\n: \nT\nhe constitutional role of the judiciary in the United Kingdom is to determine the law \nlaid\n down in statu\nt\nes \nand \nthat \ndeveloped \nin th\ne common law. In short, the courts settle legal disputes by interpreting and applying the law to a particular case before it. \nIn terms of our uncodified constitution\n,\n \nthe \njudiciary \nhave historically assumed a responsibility for protecting the individual fr\nom the state. \nIn particular, this \nhas been achieved by \nthe courts \ninterpreting legislation in the light of certain constitutional presumptions (\ne.g.\n access to the court) and developing  the common law within the context of constitutional principles (\ne.g.\n b\ny providing remedies).  A central \nrole of the judiciary\n has been \nto uphold the rule of law and thereby protect the individual\n by ensuring that \nstate/executive bodies act strictly within \nth\ne \n legal\n powers conferred. \n \nIn fact, judicial review \n- as\n implemente\nd by the judiciary \n- can\n be viewed as the rule of law in operation. \n \n&#xa0;\n3. \nIf the United \nK\ningdom were to ad\no\npt a codified constitution (albeit \nthis is highly \nunlikely given that constitutions are typically fashioned in the context of a \ncrisis/\nwatershed)\n,\n it would \nnecessarily \nalter the courts’ relationship with both the executive and the legislature\n.\n In terms of the executive\n, it seems \nl\nikely that \nthe \ncurrent \nprocedural nature of judicial review\n, \nwhich focuses on the decision\n-\n making process\n, \nwould \nshift \nt\no\nwards\n one involving a \ncloser examination of the decision itself. In \nother words, it seems clear that the jud\nges - \narmed with the \nspecific \nauthority \nin\nvested by a codified constitution\n \n- would\n \ninevitably adopt a more \nrobust \napproach \nin \ntheir \ndealings \nwith \nthe executive\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n4. \nThe\n m\nost important \nchange\n,\n \nhowever, \nwould \nundoubtedly \noccur \nin \nrespect \nof the courts\n’\n relationship with the legislature\n,\n as a codified constitution \nwould \nrender the common law principle of parliamentary sovereignty redundant\n.\n \n \nAfter \nall, the\n laws contained within the new \nconstitutional \ndocument would be \nconsidered to be \nof a fundamental and \nhigher\n legal order\n. T\nhe role of the courts in \nthe \ncontext \nof a codified constitution\n,\n \ntherefore\n, \nwould be to uphold the \nnew \ncodified \ndocumentary \nc\nonstitution\n. \n \nIn \nother words, \nsovereignty would have shifted from Parliament\n (albeit \nthat\n according to \nDicey\n \npolitical \nsovereignty \nultimately \nr\nests\n \nwith the people)\n to the new codified constitution.\n \n&#xa0;\n5. \nA central way in which a new codified constitution would benefit the individual is that \nthe \nconstitution\nal \ndocument would\n undoubtedly contain a Bill or Charter of Rights\n. This would \nconstitutionally ring fence\n \nthe \nfundamental rights \nof the individual\n,\n whic\nh t\nhe courts \nwould \nbe required to \nprotect f\nrom infringement from \nboth\n the executive and the legislature. It must be pointed out, however, \nthat the more constitutional power enjoyed by the judiciary the more interest there w\nould \nbe in, and scrutiny of, \nseni\nor \njudicial appointments.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nQuestion 2\n:\n The principle of \nconsulta\nt\nion \nis very important (\nit is \nafter\n \nall \na general\n principle in public \nlaw)\n. \nThe results of such \na \nconsultation \nexercise \nwould \nrather \nusefully\n indicate how t\nhe \njudges would\n \nperceive\n \ntheir role in \nthe context of \na codified constitutional \nlandscape\n. Such consultation should also extend \nbeyond serving members of the judiciary\n and \nembrace \nthose \nretired senior judges \ncurrently \nsitting in the House of Lords\n.\n&#xa0;\n7. \nQuestion 3\n: \nIt is submitted \nthat under a codified constitution the \nconstitutional \nrole of the judiciary should be enhanced by \nconferring \nthe power to strike down (or part of\n) \nan Act \nof Parliament \nwhich is deemed “legally” unconstitutional.  \nA\nccordingly\n,\n if an Act \nwere to be \ndeclared \nunconstitutional (\ni.e.\n \nas \nbeing \ninconsistent with the\n provisions of the\n codified constitution) it should be declared invalid\n,\n or at the very least\n,\n suspended\n. The latter \nscenario \nwould \nthen \nallow \nParliament\n to \nsubsequently \nalter \nthe legislation \n(\nanalogous \nto the \nposition following the \ndecision \nof the \nH\nouse\n \nof Lords in the \nex parte \nFacto\nrtame\n l\nitigation\n: \nR v Secretary of State for \nT\nransport, ex parte Factortame\n Ltd (No 2)\n [1991] 1 AC 603\n)\n. \nIt is recognised that \nempowering \nthe courts to strike down Acts of Parliament would represent a \nfundamental \nshift in our constitutional arrangements\n and would be considered highly controversial in some quarters\n. In contrast, t\nhe striking down of delegated legislation deemed unconstitution\nal \nw\nould \nclearly be less \ncont\nentious\n. \nAfter all, t\nhe \ncourts can already invalidate secondary legislation in judicial review proceedings if it is, for example, \nultra vires\n \nits parent Act\n. \n&#xa0;\n8. Question 3(\na\n)\n: The\n impact of a codified constitution on parliame\nntary sovereignty is that \nth\nis \nprinciple \nwould \nsimply \ncease to \nexist \nas it\n is, after all, \na common law construct. \nIn short, as noted earlier, the \nnotion \nof sovereignty would shift from Parliament to the new codified constitutional document\n. This \nconstitutional transfer \nwould \nundoubtedly hav\ne\n to be \nauthorised by the people in a \nnational referendum.\n \nIn \nrespect of primary legislation, \nas elsewhere, \njudicial review\n \nwould be\n known as “\nconstitutional review\n”. \n \nI\nn relation to the executive\n,\n it seems inev\nitable that acting \nunder the authority of \npower conferred by \na codified constitution, judicial review of \nG\novernment \naction \nwould become \nmuch \nmore robust \nand move \nfrom a\n technically procedural remedy to a \nmuch \nmore substantive one\n.\n      \n&#xa0;\n9. Question 3(b)\n: \nT\nhe history of the Court of \nJustice of \nthe European Union (ECJ) \nillustrates \na court \ngaining in confidence and \ndeveloping its role. Indeed, the two major principles of European \nlaw developed by the \nC\nourt, viz., \nthe \nprimacy of European law \nand the doctrine o\nf direct effect\n \nwere \nnot \nexpressly set out in the original Treaty of Rome\n and demonstrate\n \nthe dynamism \nof \nthe \nEuropean Court \nin developing its constitutional role\n.\n In\n fact\n, the impact on the United Kingdom was \nseen \nin the \nex parte \nFactortame\n litigation in \nwhich the European Court effectively empowered the United Kingdom courts to disregard \ndomestic \nconstitutional arrangements in order to protect \nputative \nEuropean \nlaw \nrights. The experience of the Europe\na\nn Court \nperhaps suggests that the \nUnited Kingdom \ncourts may \nalso \ngradua\nl\nly develop their constit\nutional role \nover time once a new codified constitution has \nb\nedded in.    \n&#xa0;\n10. \nQuestion 4\n: T\nhere is a c\nertain \nlegal logic to enabling the courts \nto \nassess the validity of a Bill prior to it being made an Act \n(with a clear precedent be\ning \nfound in the Scotland Act 1998). \nAlthough t\nhis procedure \nwould \nhelp to ensure that \na \nBill \nwas \nwithin the parameters of the codified constitution, it could\n \nbe argued \nthat it \nwould \nrepresent a breach of the separation of powers \na\ns an\n interference with the legislative \nprocess and \nfunction. \n \nIn a\nny event, i\nf such a procedure were\n \nto\n \nbe ad\nopted, it would have to be determined\n who \nhad the responsibility \n(\nor power\n)\n to \nrefer \na \nBill\n, \nand at what stage\n in the legislative process\n.\n&#xa0;\n11. \nQuestion 5\n: \nIdeally the \nnew C\nonstitutional Court should be a separate entity \nfrom \nthe existing Supreme Court. This would entail two consequences\n:\n firstly\n,\n it would require \nthe recruitment of \nmore senior judges\n. S\necondly\n,\n the name of the Supreme Court (assu\nming that it \nis \nto \nexist under \na \nnew cod\ni\nfied constitution) would have to be renamed\n. It is submitted that the court be renamed\n:\n The F\ninal Court of Appeal \nand \nas such, \nit would process “\nnon-constitutional\n” \nlaw issues\n,\n w\nhilst \nthe\n new \nC\nonstitutional \nCourt wo\nuld\n \nconsider \npurely \n“constitutional” issues\n. \n \nIt is of course recognised that there is no clear and sharp dividing line between constitutional and non-constitutional issues\n, however, in general terms a division can be made\n and \nin any case, \nthis \nshould not \nbe considered an i\nnsuperable problem\n.\n&#xa0;\n12. \nQuestion 6\n: \nThe American Supreme Court provides a graphic example of the power of the judiciary in a codified constitution to \ndevelop and \nenhance its \nconstitutional\n role\n, as \ndemonstrated \nin \nthe famous \nMarbury \nv\n Ma\ndison\n case\n ((1803) 5 US I Cranch 137)\n.\n \n Under a codified cons\ntitution t\nhe courts will \nnecessarily \nbe the \nprotectors of the constitution and the final arbiter as to the \nmeaning of \nits provisions\n. As \nsuch\n,\n \nthis \nw\nould lead to great\ner\n \ninterest \nin, \nand \nscrutin\ny\n \nof, senior \njudicial appointments\n. This may \nnecessitate \nthat \nparliamentary affirmations of \nsenior judicial \nappoi\nn\ntments\n have to\n take place. In terms \nof\n appointment\ns,\n a specifically \nad hoc\n Commission \n(\nanalogous\n to the Suprem\ne\n Court \nS\nelect\nion\n Commission\n)\n cou\nld be created to put forward a\n suitable candidate \nin the event of a \nvacancy.\n      \n       \n     \n \n12\n October \n20\n13\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
