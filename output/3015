defaultWritten evidence from UK Major Ports Group (SRN 025)defaultSummarydefault1
default              
defaultPorts are crucial to the UK’s economic development. Connecting links to ports are international gateways and have rightly been recognised as priority areas for strategic road investment though it is disappointing that this has yet to be confirmed in the lo
defaultng awaited National Policy Statement for national networks in England. 
defaultIntroductiondefault2
default              
defaultUKMPG is one of two associations representing ports in the UK.  Our 9 member groups handle over 70 percent of the UK’s international trade by volume, and therefore play 
defaulta significant role in supporting the UK economy and promoting exports.  UK ports are privately financed and do not seek any financial help from the taxpayer.

defaultEarlier this year t
defaulthe independent economic c
defaultonsultants Oxford Economics produced a
default report on the economic impact of the UK ports sector in 2011, updating their previous studies which used 2007 and 2009 figures. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTheir data shows that the ports sector consistently outperforms most other sectors for employment and productivity - for examp
defaultle, between 2009 and 2011 direct employment in ports rose by 5% to 117,200 , while overall UK employment fell by 0.4%. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe key measure of 
defaultlabour
default productivity, GVA (Gross Value Added) per worker, averaged over £67,400 in the ports sector, nearly 40% higher
default than the UK-economy-wide average of £48,400.
default4
default              
defaultOverall this latest report shows the ports sector continuing to improve productivity and to make a significant contribution to the UK economy despite testing trading conditions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe maritime sector as a whol
defaulte supports over half a million jobs in the UK economy and contributes nearly £32 billion to UK GDP, with the ports sector accounting for well over half of this. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese figures, together with the fact that 95% of the country's international trade moves thro
defaultugh ports, show how vital ports are to the UK's economic performance.
defaultGovernment’s policy on links to ports default5
default              
defaultAccess to ports featured strongly in the previous Government’s policy on promoting infrastructure. The ports sector gave a strong welcome to the 
defaulttransport study by Sir Rod 
defaultEddington
default published in December 2006.  We were particularly pleased to see the report’s recognition that, given the international nature of the UK’s economy, good links to international gateways such as ports were crucially impor
defaulttant, offered a high rate of return and should be a priority area for future 
defaultDfT
default investment.  We were also pleased that the previous Government acted quickly to implement 
defaultEddington’s
default findings through:
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultsetting up a new streamlined planning system for major 
defaultinfrastructure projects through the provisions of the Planning Act 2008;
default

defaultputting major ports at the centre of the strategic transport corridors set out in the white paper “Delivering a Sustainable Transport System”
default (DASTS)
default, published in November 2008;
default
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultbringing forward several major road and rail projects improving links to ports under the Transport Innovation Fund, Strategic Freight Network and accelerated Highways Agency 
defaultprogrammes
default.

default              
defaultThe present Coalition Government has yet to set out a comprehensive position statement on transport infrastructure priorities. The promised national policy statement on national (road and rail) networks has been substantially delayed. UKMPG assumes therefo
defaultre that the previous Government’s policies are being rolled forward at least for the time being.

default8
default              
defaultThe strategy docu
defaultment recognized
default that the UK has been 
defaultunderspending
default on roads in comparison with its major EU competitor economies. So over 50% of the capital investment 
defaultprogramme
default is to be used to increase capacity on the motorway and trunk road network and carry out repair
defaults (also on the local road network). Several of the schemes mentioned are of particular interest to ports including 
defaultthe following schemes
defaultA1 north of Newcastle, 
defaultA19 south of Newcastle and 
defaultA14 
defaultbetween Cambridge and Huntingdon (still
default linked to a tolling sch
defaulteme
default).

default              
defaultAlso of significance is the proposal to turn the Highways Agency into a publicly owned corporation with greater long term funding certainty. The main advantage cited is the potential to achieve £600m of capital efficiency savings; equally 
defaultimportant is the opportunity this will provide for the successor HA to build up better strategic relationships with key industry customers such as ports.

defaultThis was followed o

default 16 July 
defaultby 
defaultthe Department for Transport White Paper on roads 
defaultentitled ‘Action
default for roads: A network for the 21st century'.  
defaultAction for Roads provides some more detail on how this programme is to be delivered in England. The main elements are
default11
default              
defaultThe Government’s objective is to get investment levels back up to those in continental competitor economies, with capital spending on roads effectively ring fenced as 
defaultalr
defaulteady 
defaultis rail investment. There is little additional information in Action for Roads about the actual investment programme though there is a useful summary map on page 31 showing major projects starting by 2015, pipeline projects starting after 2015 and pin
defaultch point schemes. Several of these should be of direct benefit to ports. 
defaultPorts have been participating actively in Highways Agency workshops on route based strategies designed to identify bottlenecks and develop solutions.
defaultUKMPG overall viewdefault12
default              
defaultOverall 
defaultthis is a welcome package particularly the move to increased capital investment on strategic roads
default, a longer investment planning period and 
defaultmore funding certainty. 
defaultThis is a clear improvement on the present arrangements which provides no long term certaint
defaulty or strategic coherence and is too often influenced by short-term political expediencies.
default We 
defaultdo however have several areas of concern
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecific comments on questions posed by the Committeedefault&#xa0;
defaultHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the stratdefaultegic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?default&#xa0;
defaultBy securing greater longer term funding certainty which should enable the strategic road programme to be developed without the risk of delays and postponements. The new structure
default for the Highways Agency should enable it to focus more on key delivery areas and develop stronger links with stakeholders
default&#xa0;
defaultHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?default&#xa0;defaultThis remains uncertain because of the cont
defaultinued non appearance of the National Policy Statement for road and rail. It is important that the contribution that rail and coastal shipping can make to reducing traffic by road is properly factored into to strategic road planning
default. There is also a need fo
defaultr strong co-ordination across road and rail policies and agencies.
default&#xa0;
default For example the ongoing review of track access charges for rail freight could impact on the volume of traffic using the strategic road network.
default&#xa0;
default However the review is being conducted by th
defaulte 
defaultrail 
defaultregulator in isolation and the potential impact of changes on other modes is not being taken into account. 
defaultHow reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road   network? How should the Government deal with uncertaidefaultnty in its forecast? default&#xa0;defaultNo comments
default&#xa0;defaultHow can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?defaultUKMPG supports the continued investment in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)
default&#xa0;
defaultin order to maximise capacity and efficiency and inform users of road conditions and accidents.
default&#xa0;
default The Government should continue its dialogue with the ITS industry and automotive
default industry manufacturers to confirm that road infrastructure can support technology investment but also engage with ports and their logistics partners to ensure that the benefits of ITS are utilised to their maximum benefit.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultWhat mechanisms are there for defaultGovernment to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK? defaultNetwork wide road tolling offers important opportunities to attract in private investment. 
defaultHow sdefaulthould the Highways Agency be reformeddefault&#xa0;defaultto make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?defaultThe Highways Agency needs strong management and 
defaultexpertise and would benefit from greater independence from Government and more involvement
default by private finance.
