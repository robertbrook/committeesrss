[[[chools programmes]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;i) Equality of opportunity – Reform programmes must seek to promote the development of an education system that ensures equality of opportunity in terms of admissions, provision and educational outcomes.&#xa0;ii) Democratic accountability – Reform of the education system must be consistent with democratic values and must ensure that all publicly funded institutions are democratically accountable to the communities they serve.&#xa0;iii) Value for money/transparency – Reform strategies must seek to secure effective transparency in relation to the way in which financial resources are allocated across the system and should ensure that all spending commitments are evaluated robustly and objectively against clear economic efficiency and value for money criteria.&#xa0;iv) Raises standards – Reforms of the school system must be designed to ensure that all pupils are able to access high quality, engaging and relevant leaning opportunities that secure the highest possible levels of pupil progress and achievement.&#xa0;v) Union recognition – Approaches to reform must ensure that workforce unions are properly represented to enable the perspectives of teachers, school leaders and other members of the wider school workforce to be taken into effective account in strategic planning and decision-making processes and to ensure that conditions are created that support and promote high quality teaching and learning.&#xa0;vi) National pay and conditions of service – Reform programmes must support the operation of national pay and conditions frameworks that ensure that all pupils, regardless of the school they attend, receive their common entitlement to highly skilled, motivated and well trained teachers with terms and conditions that enable them to work effectively to raise standards.&#xa0;vii) Viability – Approaches to reform must ensure that all schools and other relevant settings are viable and sustainable financially and are not funded on the basis of sectional or individual short term interests.&#xa0;viii) A supportive and collaborative approach to community education – Reform programmes must secure the adoption and enhancement of collaborative approaches within and between institutions, noting, however, that collaboration does not preclude parents from exercising their legitimate rights to make informed choices about the schools or other relevant settings their children might attend.&#xa0;ix) Rooted within the community – Any reform of the education system must ensure that schools are rooted within, not set apart from, their communities and represent the best of the values and aspirations of those communities.&#xa0;x) Evidence based – Approaches to reform must be based on a genuine, considered use of evidence of educational practice, building on consultation between all stakeholders, including workforce unions.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
