Indeed it is settled â€“ in favour of the null hypothesis. There is no dangerous 'climate change' caused by human activity, increasing C02 does not present a threat, rather a benefit - more crops and therefore more food to feed a growing population.&#xa0;The economics of 'green' energy are the economics of the madhouse.&#xa0;The old adage 'the truth is an oft repeated lie' for once has proved as untrue as the government paid climate scientists' predictions. They would be wise to heed these words in the Torah:&#xa0;You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?" If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.&#xa0;Deuteronomy 18:21-22&#xa0;April 2013&#xa0;
