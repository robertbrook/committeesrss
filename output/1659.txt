[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The ICOM Energy Association (ICOM) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee’s Inquiry into Heat.  ICOM is the trade association, representing the Industrial and Commercial sectors of the Heating Industry and is made up from members who produce/market products used in that sector of the industry.  The majority of members are industrial and commercial boiler manufacturers, producing products which operate, in the main, on gas, oil and biomass fuels, although other fuels are used in specialist applications. ICOM also has the majority of packaged burner manufacturers as members, producing burners to work with the industrial and commercial boilers and operating on gas, oil and bio-fuels.The equipment is used for the production of hot water and steam to be used in heating systems and for process installations.ICOM members also market renewable products such as Heat Pumps, Combined Heat and Power (CHP), Solar Thermal and Solar PV.Other ICOM members include manufacturers of Air and Radiant heaters, controls and water treatment products.The ICOM members have an approximate annual sales of £300 – £350Million.We would be happy to discuss any of the issues raised in this response and in the Inquiry with the Select Committee.

[[[Heat Demand]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whereas in the domestic sector, there is a similarity of use and output from one property to another, in the industrial/commercial sector this is not the case.  There are a considerable number of different heat demands from simple heating of a small office to the heating of a large manufacturing complex. There are also process applications which can vary from supplying hot water for a factory process to high grade steam for an industrial process. 

[[[1.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The variation of equipment design installed contributes to the problems of determining how to approach the need for financial support required to interest the end users in changing to a greener installation.

[[[1.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The demand for heat is reducing as buildings and installations are being built or refurbished to higher standards.  The Building Regulations are regularly up-dated to bring the standards of building fabric and internal systems to a greater efficiency, thereby reducing energy requirements.

[[[1.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is important that there is an incentive to ensure that existing building owners and operators do not take the easy route and decide not to refurbish the building and accept that energy usage and running costs are high.  The capital required to carry out the refurbishment is not always easy to obtain and this is a factor in decisions made not to improve the structure.

[[[2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Heat Generation]]]

[[[2.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The industrial/commercial sector uses large amounts of energy, mainly gas and oil to generate the forms of heat required for the various types of use. Some of these processes are using very old equipment in out of date applications. The costs of up-dating an industrial process can in some situations warrant the move to another part of the world, thereby causing a loss of UK jobs and a deficit in the balance of payments.

[[[2.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The variations in the types and grade of heat required in the industrial/commercial sector are extensive and this gives rise to great difficulty in using the renewable technologies. There are processes which will use a constant volume of hot water which could be ideal for a biomass boiler, CHP or heat pump which work more efficiently at a constant load, however, the temperature specified can also play a part in determining whether these renewable technologies will operate in the most efficient way.

[[[2.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The DECC Heat Strategy is a good basis for changing the industry perception to the way that heat is generated, however, the design concepts in the industrial/commercial sector are so varied that the basis of reducing fossil fuels usage to such a low percentage of heat generated will be extremely difficult to achieve.

[[[2.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The industrial/commercial industry accepts that renewable fuels will play a major part in reducing energy usage and GHG emissions. Manufacturers in this sector are developing products to maximise the use of renewable fuels. However, the technologies such as biomass, CHP and heat pumps, operate at their most efficient when they are delivering a steady heat load. Solar thermal products have a very intermittent supply of heat due to the vagaries of the British weather.  The working temperatures of each technology are different and trying to work outside those parameters tends to reduce efficiency.  The most energy efficient way to generate heat is to combine one or two renewable energy fuelled pieces of equipment working with a gas or oil boiler to give the top up when the demand increases. The addition of intelligent pumps and controls will ensure that the renewable fuelled equipment will operate at a constant demand and the boilers will take the peak and instantaneous heat demands.

[[[2.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Heat generation in industrial/commercial installations tends to vary over a very wide range dependent on usage and time of year and therefore the use of renewable technology to supply the base load with fossil fuelled appliances acting in support will give the most fuel efficient operation with reduced GHG emission.

[[[2.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The use of thermal storage will also benefit the use of renewable technologies, due to the fact that it allows the renewable technologies to operate longer without cycling.  This is the most energy efficient method of operation.

[[[3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Heat Waste]]]

[[[3.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Waste heat from CHP generators should be used to support the heating or process system.  There is a balance that needs to be made between the amount of electricity being generated and the amount of heat being produced. A bias towards the electrical generation could mean that there is a large amount of thermal energy being wasted and therefore a bias towards having a base thermal load and maybe generating a smaller amount of electricity can be the most energy and emission efficient answer. 

[[[3.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When a CHP installation is designed to utilise the waste heat, then a back up heat system will be required and the most versatile method is to use a high efficiency gas/oil fired condensing boiler.

[[[Committee questions]]]

[[[4.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ICOM’s view on the Government’s approach is to reduce heat energy demand is supportive as we know the need to reduce energy usage and GHG emissions. However, we believe that a more balanced approach is needed, as the reliance on renewable energy technology and the production of green electricity is reducing the Government’s options. Renewable technology will obviously play a part in the process towards the 2050 targets, however, the use of green electricity and heat pumps as the main source of heat energy is questioned. The investment needed in re-building the electricity grid to enable the number of heat pumps required to operate is surely not viable. A balanced approach to include gas and oil products, working at peak efficiency with added emphasis on building and system improvements will, we believe, enable the targets to be achieved in a more cost effective way.

[[[4.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We understand from information in the press, that the interim 2020 target will not be achieved and we would suggest that more information is provided, in some detail, to enable the manufacturers of industrial/commercial equipment to be able to determine the best way to develop their products range to assist in achieving those targets.

[[[4.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Biomass as a fuel is an important factor in achieving the energy and emission reductions required by Government. The calculations of GHG is straight forward related to each appliance, however, trying to calculate the overall GHG savings within the industry is more difficult. The installations covered by the RHI scheme obviously give a very accurate figure for emissions based on the kW hours claimed by the operator.  However, not all biomass boilers sold are being subject to a RHI application due to the perception that the process is protracted and involves added expense of calibrated heat meters and in some instances, more expensive pipe work systems to conform to the criteria. Determining accurately the total kW hours would be the best way to determine the reduction in GHG, and therefore consideration should be given to the complexity of the RHI process.

[[[4.4]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The sustainability issue with biomass fuel is covered adequately and the added criteria for RHI approval next year will ensure that the RHI approved installations will have to prove sustainability. The major wood pellet manufacturers have set up their processes to use sustainable wood sources as they were aware of the pressures being brought by Government and the industry. However, there are a considerable number of installations using locally sourced wood from estates and these will be more difficult to manage. This is mainly the wood chip and logs side of the industry and sustainability is not always of prime importance. A method of policing these areas needs to be developed to ensure that these installations are controlled in the same way as pellet manufacturers.

[[[4.5]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Environmental impact is not considered in the same way as reducing energy and GHG emissions. The renewable fuel technologies, in the main, do not operate cleanly when cycling.  When a biomass boiler is operated with short cycles, the start up and shut down processes are more difficult to keep clean, therefore a more constant demand or the use of large thermal stores are needed to ensure that the boiler operates cleanly.  In some of the major cities in the UK, extra abatement is required to ensure that the emissions of particulates are virtually zero.  This has a cost implication to achieve these levels. The previous arguments for a balanced approach by using renewable fuel products backed up by fossil fuel products to cover the peak demands, not only improves the energy efficiency, but also reduces emissions by allowing the biomass boiler to operate at a constant level. CHP engines work in a similar way, in that by allowing the engine to operate at a constant level, the start up and shut down cycles, which are the worst for emissions are reduced and therefore the emissions are kept to a minimum. Added to the direct emission reduction is the fact that constant running reduces the wear on the components in the engine which also means that the performance is maintained.

[[[4.6]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The use of gas to directly provide space heating or any other form of energy use gives flexibility to the operation of the system.  The gas fired equipment as part of an installation is independent and therefore is only used when the system has a demand. However, the demand for electricity to operate a heat pump is a much less exact science and the balanced approach of a combined heat pump and fossil fuelled boiler to give the most efficient package is proposed to even out the peak demands. The cost of up-grading the National Grid also needs to be added to the equation and  lower costs to give incentives to improving the efficiency of current installations would, we believe, be a better option.

[[[4.7]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The use of community heating systems or district heating schemes are not playing a major part in the UK at present. ICOM suggests that Government support for this type of heating scheme would improve the use of these systems, especially in multiple occupancy installations where there is a central boiler house using a biomass boiler with fossil fuel boiler back up and then using heat meters in each dwelling. This option would be more energy and emissions efficient than installing individual heat generators. This form of installation is widely used in Europe, but historically in the UK, there has been the principal of having individual heat generators and so there is the need to educate people to this different way of thinking. ICOM supports the use of district heating schemes.

[[[4.8]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The use of thermal storage, when used with renewable energy equipment should be promoted by Government to improve the operating process of that type of equipment. The addition of a thermal store has a cost implication and therefore is subject to the cost analysis of the installation and in many cases is removed from the design to save money.  ICOM believes that the use of thermal stores improves the flexibility of the system and helps reduce energy use by reducing cycling of the heat generator.

[[[Conclusions]]]

[[[5.1]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ICOM supports the Government in it’s aim to reduce energy use and GHG emissions.

[[[5.2]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ICOM promotes the balanced approach to achieving the targets on energy and GHG emission reduction by using high efficiency gas &amp; oil boilers to work in conjunction with renewable energy equipment and intelligent pumps and controls to give the most efficient system design.

[[[5.3]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The use of the RHI should be expanded to include hybrid systems of renewable and fossil fuels which will help in achieving the reduction of energy use.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
