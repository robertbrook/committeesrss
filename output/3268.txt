[[[ fairness]]]&#xa0;1.1 I write in my personal capacity as someone who has had personal dealings with the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) intermittently since 1994 and had knowledge of campaigns such as Local Government Ombudsman Watch (LGOWatch) which show that the problems that I experienced obtaining redress via the Ombudsman are widespread.  &#xa0;1.2 The Select Committee’s (CLG) report of July 2012 considered the handling of evidence and at paragraph 67 recommended that in those cases involving serious service failure the LGO's processes should be brought into line with judicial procedures such as full disclosure of all submissions.  Dr Martin saw her role as making findings and recommendations of remedy based on the evidence and facts.&#xa0;1.3 The external evaluation of the LGO by Thomas et al. 2013 at Recommendation 9 suggests that there should be an independent reviewer of the service given by the LGO.  This would presumably ensure that the investigators follow the service guidelines.  However, this would do nothing to improve the quality of the evidence supplied by Local Authorities (LA) to the LGO in response to a complaint.  &#xa0;1.4 The CLG believes that the appointment of an external reviewer will ensure that the LGO will meet the 5 key criteria of independence, fairness, effectiveness, openness and transparency and accountability.  Given that the role of the external reviewer would be solely related to service and not to the quality of the investigation, I do not believe this will improve the outcome for a significant number of complainants whose complaints fail as a result of the LGO relying on unproven misinformation supplied by LAs.&#xa0;1.5 I have always employed solicitors to assist me and supplied the LGO with background evidence, usually LA documents, to support my complaints.  I believe that the LGO has always disclosed to me all the submissions from the LA.  However, it has been my experience that the LGO accepts the evidence from the LA as being fact despite there being no evidence that the LA had investigated my complaint thoroughly (or possibly even at all) by interviewing or writing to the individual officers involved.  It does not seem fair that the LGO can dismiss a complainant’s evidence and accept that of a LA if the LA has not considered the complaint internally.  In my case, the LA mislead the LGO over a number of years and when evidence came to light which proved my point beyond any doubt, the LA was told it did not need to investigate that complaint because it had already done so in the earlier complaints.  This missed the crucial point that the previous investigations (if they took place) must have been flawed.&#xa0;1.6 I accessed the Guidance on Investigations used by the LGO investigators and the investigators had followed procedures therefore an external reviewer would not have been able to assist me had he/she been in post.  &#xa0;1.7 Dr Martin states in her letter of 1 October 2013 to Mr Betts that “we will always share our provisional view on a complaint that we investigate, and take comments from both parties, before making a final decision.”  That procedure took place with my complaint but the LGO accepted the LA’s version of events without background evidence or visiting the Council to view files/interview relevant personnel and so the course of action suggested by Dr Martin is not new in my experience and so will not make a difference when the LGO is intent on accepting the word of the LA.&#xa0;1.8 It is my belief from information that I have received from the LA, that the officers concerned were not asked to respond to my complaints and that the LA’s response to the LGO was based on what can best be described as ‘wishful thinking’.  The fact that the information provided by the Chief Executive is in conflict with the advice given by the Legal Services Manager (and acted upon by other officers to my detriment) is not denied by the LA’s Monitoring Officer.  There is no committee within the LA that has the power to require any of these senior officers to investigate the conflict and act in the public interest to prevent repeat maladministration.  Recommendations on how to prevent a recurrence and how to fill this serious gap in the Council’s procedures would have been two obvious results of the complaint having been properly investigated.&#xa0;1.9 The LGO appears unable to employ the highly specialised personnel required to unpick complex cases of maladministration in specialist areas which include planning and not just social care.&#xa0;1.10 The inability of the LGO to remedy the maladministration has caused me to ask my MP for assistance.  As yet, he has been unable to provide me with advice as to how the injustice to me can be resolved where the LGO fails in its investigation or to ask the LA to resolve the conflict in order to prevent a recurrence of the maladministration.&#xa0;

[[[fairness]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1 My complaint related to very complex matters which initially taxed my own legal advisers even though they were familiar with the issues.  I believe that the LGO should use only experienced specialist investigators for such complaints so that complainants have a fair chance of redress.&#xa0;2.3 It should be cost neutral for the LGO to require LAs to append transcripts of interviews and written responses from officers included in the LA investigation to the response sent by the LA’s Chief Executive to the LGO.  This would show whether the Chief Executive has carried out a proper investigation into the complaint or just refuted the complaint in isolation from the facts.  Time spent reading the extra documents would be time well spent because some LAs would admit their faults at an earlier stage without need for detailed investigation by the LGO and this in turn would lead to fewer dissatisfied complainants asking for reviews of their cases.  &#xa0;2.4 Consideration could be given to applying financial penalties to LAs which fail to investigate complaints properly or which provide what Dr Martin referred to as misleading information in her report on a recent case (12 003 713).&#xa0;2.5 Currently it is all too easy for LAs to avoid a full investigation by the LGO.  All incorrect LGO findings of “No maladministration” which are then considered by LA committees give false reassurance to elected members that their council is performing adequately.  If it is not possible to devise systems that ensure that accurate information is provided by LAs on which the LGO can reach correct decisions, then the process can only fail complainants and maladministration is perpetuated.  &#xa0;
