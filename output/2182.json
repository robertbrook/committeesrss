"&#xa0;\nElizabeth Kirk&#xa0;- Written evidence&#xa0;\nThe\n&#xa0;\nByways and Bridleways Trust is one of the bodies prescribed in the\n&#xa0;\nWildlife and Countryside Act \n&#xa0;\n1981 to receive notice of public path orders.\n&#xa0;\n Our interest is in the higher status public rights of way, especially in correct recording on the definitive map.\n&#xa0;\n BBT is pleased to answer questions 1 - 7 of the current Call for Written Evidence, and would like at the appropriate time to submit more detailed evidence on Clauses 12 - 18 and Schedule 6.\n&#xa0;\nAnswers to General Questions as applying to Clauses 12-18 and Schedule 6 only:-\n&#xa0;\nQ1. Not in our opinion.\n&#xa0;\nQ2. A possible advantage is that amended primary legislation is easier for the citizen to find and understand. The legislative process is more open and can be better informed.\n&#xa0;\nQ3. We have some reservations and would like to offer detailed evidence at the appropriate time.\n&#xa0;\nQ4.\n&#xa0;\nEffectively - yes.\n&#xa0;\n Fairly - again we have some reservations, especially for voluntary bodies and individuals.\n&#xa0;\nQ5. It will benefit businesses concerned with activity in the countryside, if it succeeds in achieving a comprehensive network of bridleways and byways.\n&#xa0;\nQ6. There is potential for substantial benefit to consumers \nif\n, following legislation, the will is there on all sides to speed up completion of the definitive map and achieve a comprehensive network for riders, horse drivers\n&#xa0;\nand cyclists, not just for walkers.\n&#xa0;\nQ7.iv. A fully completed definitive map provides a very useful resource for education in various skills and branches of knowledge at all levels.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n vi.\n&#xa0;\n If the Bill succeeds in getting the historic ways \nfairly\n recorded, it will be of substantial benefit\n&#xa0;\nin enabling\n&#xa0;\nindividuals to improve their health and well-being by activity in the countryside of their own choice and in their own time, as well as increasing the opportunities available for organised expeditions.\n&#xa0;\nI have to add that the definitive map process, begun in 1949, is a highly complex affair which several successive Acts have not succeeded in simplifying: the present economic climate and cut backs in Local Authority staffing do jeopardise the success of these proposals.\n&#xa0;\nElizabeth Kirk\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n( Lady Kirk, Trustee, Byways and Bridleways Trust.)\n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
