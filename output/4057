defaultIntroduction.defaultMy name is Tim Oldershaw, and I am the Technical Director of an electrical installation company based in London. I have been an electrician for 35 years and have seen the status of a “professional” been lowered and defused over the years in the UK. This ha
defaults not happened across 
defaultEurope, where a qualified electrician still has standing and legal requirements.
default I feel very 
defaultpassionate
default about safety and quality, as I believe these go hand in hand. There is nothing 
defaultsadder
default than to hear that someone has been 
defaulthurt
default or k
defaultilled by a sub
default-
defaultstandard
default electrical installation which should have been 
defaultpicked up and fixed by the correct implementation of testing and the basic good 
defaultpractise
default of the Standards (BS7671

defaultPart PdefaultWhen part P was announced I was very pleased and thought it would be as 
defaultstrong
default as the “safe gas” installers system. As it was introduced it became clear it was 
defaultnot,
default it was a 
defaultwatered
default down 
defaultlicencing
default syste
defaultm. But as it was rolled out and contractors began to join the ECA, NICEIC and other schemes 
defaultit 
defaultreally
default started to have an impact, with lots of one man bands, and small 
defaultcompany’s
default joining and 
defaultactually
default 
defaulttesting
default 
defaultinstallations
default in both the domestic and the commerc
defaultial area. We have also seen a 
defaultgreat
default improvement in the awareness of specifiers and consumers to insist on a “Part P” registered installer and a registered certificate on completion.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe small installers have been dragged to the standards, by the new Part P
default, but when the have found them, they see that if all 
defaultinstallers
default have to comply they are not put at a 
defaultfinancial
default disadvantage, and are only 
defaulttoo
default pleased to do quality, safe work.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe problem is still the rogue traders and DIY installers who love 
defaultto quote the 
default“
defaultcompetent
default person” quip, 
default“I said I am 
defaultcompetent
default there for I am a “
defaultcompetent
default person” and so I am 
defaultlegally
default 
defaultallowed
default to do electrical 
defaultinstallations
default. 
defaultI don’t
default need any 
defaultexpensive
default 
defaultqualifications;
default I have been to the school of life.”
default&#xa0;
defaultUnfortunately 
defaultlegally
default they are correct. 
defaultBut how is a 
defaultspecifier
default or
default consumers
default to tell what qualifications are relevant, or needed by an installer? 
defaultSome of the rogue traders have been saying they are Part P but not with one of the big 
defaultschemes
default, but with a small group, (which 
defaultreall
defaulty
default does not exist). This is where we come to the rescue with the ESR (Electrical Safety Reg
defaultister). This is the list of all the approved electricians, and 
defaultcompanies
default, from 
defaultmultiple
default schemes which a 
defaultconsumer
default or specifier can check to see if
default the contractor 
defaultreall
defaulty
default is qualified.
defaultWhat this needs is ESR to be promoted to specifiers and consumers with a publicity campaign, stressing that this is the safe way to have work done.
