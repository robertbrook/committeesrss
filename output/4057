[normal]Introduction.[bold]My name is Tim Oldershaw, and I am the Technical Director of an electrical installation company based in London. I have been an electrician for 35 years and have seen the status of a “professional” been lowered and defused over the years in the UK. This ha
[normal]s not happened across 
[normal]Europe, where a qualified electrician still has standing and legal requirements.
[normal] I feel very 
[normal]passionate
[normal] about safety and quality, as I believe these go hand in hand. There is nothing 
[normal]sadder
[normal] than to hear that someone has been 
[normal]hurt
[normal] or k
[normal]illed by a sub
[normal]-
[normal]standard
[normal] electrical installation which should have been 
[normal]picked up and fixed by the correct implementation of testing and the basic good 
[normal]practise
[normal] of the Standards (BS7671 
[normal]etc.
[normal]).

[normal]Part P[bold]When part P was announced I was very pleased and thought it would be as 
[normal]strong
[normal] as the “safe gas” installers system. As it was introduced it became clear it was 
[normal]not,
[normal] it was a 
[normal]watered
[normal] down 
[normal]licencing
[normal] syste
[normal]m. But as it was rolled out and contractors began to join the ECA, NICEIC and other schemes 
[normal]it 
[normal]really
[normal] started to have an impact, with lots of one man bands, and small 
[normal]company’s
[normal] joining and 
[normal]actually
[normal] 
[normal]testing
[normal] 
[normal]installations
[normal] in both the domestic and the commerc
[normal]ial area. We have also seen a 
[normal]great
[normal] improvement in the awareness of specifiers and consumers to insist on a “Part P” registered installer and a registered certificate on completion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The small installers have been dragged to the standards, by the new Part P
[normal], but when the have found them, they see that if all 
[normal]installers
[normal] have to comply they are not put at a 
[normal]financial
[normal] disadvantage, and are only 
[normal]too
[normal] pleased to do quality, safe work.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The problem is still the rogue traders and DIY installers who love 
[normal]to quote the 
[normal]“
[normal]competent
[normal] person” quip, 
[normal]“I said I am 
[normal]competent
[normal] there for I am a “
[normal]competent
[normal] person” and so I am 
[normal]legally
[normal] 
[normal]allowed
[normal] to do electrical 
[normal]installations
[normal]. 
[normal]I don’t
[normal] need any 
[normal]expensive
[normal] 
[normal]qualifications;
[normal] I have been to the school of life.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unfortunately 
[normal]legally
[normal] they are correct. 
[normal]But how is a 
[normal]specifier
[normal] or
[normal] consumers
[normal] to tell what qualifications are relevant, or needed by an installer? 
[normal]Some of the rogue traders have been saying they are Part P but not with one of the big 
[normal]schemes
[normal], but with a small group, (which 
[normal]reall
[normal]y
[normal] does not exist). This is where we come to the rescue with the ESR (Electrical Safety Reg
[normal]ister). This is the list of all the approved electricians, and 
[normal]companies
[normal], from 
[normal]multiple
[normal] schemes which a 
[normal]consumer
[normal] or specifier can check to see if
[normal] the contractor 
[normal]reall
[normal]y
[normal] is qualified.
[normal]What this needs is ESR to be promoted to specifiers and consumers with a publicity campaign, stressing that this is the safe way to have work done.
