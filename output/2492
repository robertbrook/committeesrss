[normal]L[bold]andlords (private rented sector a[bold]nd Registered Social Landlords):[bold]In t
[normal]erms of 
[normal]private sector landlords, as Local Housing Allowance (LHA) has been in place for several years the issue of direct payment is relatively well established – although there are still instances of tenants not paying their Housing Benefit (HB) over to their la
[normal]ndlords.  Local authorities are experience
[normal]d
[normal] in, and have the local knowledge to make ‘vulnerability’ decisions relating to direct payment and have done this successfully for a number of years.  Customers being paid Universal Credit (UC) monthly in arrears will cause an issue to many claimants in th
[normal]e first instance and support and financial 
[normal]advice
[normal] would need to be provided to assist, in 
[normal]particularly
[normal], vulnerable individuals and groups.  
[normal]Similar issues 
[normal]will apply for RSLs, although the added factor of direct payment would be new, and would cause issue
[normal]s for RSLs in terms of increased rent arrears, recovery costs and potential for increased evictions due to non-
[normal]payment
[normal] of rent.
[normal]In all cases, local authorities would be well placed and have the skills and local knowledge to provide the support needed.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]L[bold]oc[bold]al authorities (including availability of Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs))[bold]UC provides a number of key challenges for local authorities:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]C[bold]laimants, particularly those in vulnerable groups (such as people with disabilities and families with children)[bold], and those in supported and temporary accommodation.[bold]Over many years local authorities have established well run working relationships with local housing providers and vulnerable groups.  Named contacts in HB offices 
[normal]assist to make these run effectively. 
[normal] These relationships 
[normal]are vital
[normal] to ensure that customers receive the information, help and support they need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In summary, although wholly 
[normal]recognising
[normal] the need for the Benefits system to be simplified, inclusion of housing costs in UC is a 
[normal]significant
[normal] issue due to local variances, knowledge and expertise, established relationships with housing providers and vulnerable groups, and potential for increasing homelessness (in turn increasing the costs of housing customers in temporary accommodation).  Local
[normal] authorities are well placed to overcome such issues.
