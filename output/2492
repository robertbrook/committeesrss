defaulterms of 
defaultprivate sector landlords, as Local Housing Allowance (LHA) has been in place for several years the issue of direct payment is relatively well established – although there are still instances of tenants not paying their Housing Benefit (HB) over to their la
defaultndlords.  Local authorities are experience

default in, and have the local knowledge to make ‘vulnerability’ decisions relating to direct payment and have done this successfully for a number of years.  Customers being paid Universal Credit (UC) monthly in arrears will cause an issue to many claimants in th

defaultSimilar issues 
defaultwill apply for RSLs, although the added factor of direct payment would be new, and would cause issue
defaults for RSLs in terms of increased rent arrears, recovery costs and potential for increased evictions due to non-

defaultIn all cases, local authorities would be well placed and have the skills and local knowledge to provide the support needed.

defaultIn summary, although wholly

default issue due to local variances, knowledge and expertise, established relationships with housing providers and vulnerable groups, and potential for increasing homelessness (in turn increasing the costs of housing customers in temporary accommodation).  Local
default authorities are well placed to overcome such issues.
