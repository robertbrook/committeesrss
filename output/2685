defaultWritten evidence submitted by Secured By Designdefault&#xa0;
defaultI am writing in my capacity as The National Policing Lead for Crime Prevention, and a director of the wholly police owned, not for profit company Secured By Design (SBD),
default 
defaultregarding the Environmental Audit Committee’s inquiry on the decision to wind down the Code for Sustainable Homes (CfSH) and the Department for Communities and Local Government’s Housing Standards Review (HSR).
default&#xa0;
defaultSituational Crime Prevention has played a key role in reducing many types of crime and evidence suggests that the inclusion of effective tested security is a key ingredient in the burglary reductions over the last fifteen years. Secured by Design played a critical role in the Housing Standards Review process vocalising our position in the security working group and within the Steering Group that the CfSH should be retained, or its content appropriately incorporated elsewhere. We take the view that the proposed approach will remove the need for developers to strive to improve the sustainable quality of their developments resulting in a ‘Race to the bottom’ in security terms being highly likely. Secured by Design is currently referenced within the CfSH, required by HCA funded developments and applied to some 35,000-40,000 new homes a year; the security of homes and the environment outside those homes is a key element within any sustainable development. High crime housing estates are non-viable, often leading to an increase in void properties and ultimately the demolition of housing stock before it has reached the end of its intended lifespan. 
default&#xa0;
defaultApproximately 40% of Local Planning Authorities require the code to be followed and until the HSR, this was rising year on year and I understand from senior management at the Building Research Establishment that there are currently 800,000 CfSH homes in the planning pipeline.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EC Harries figures used in the impact assessment are incorrect and misleading. The true additional cost of SBD is approximately £170 (Davis Langdon 2010) and the number of homes built to SBD is between 35,000-45,000 (incorporating the compulsory 34,000 HCA funded homes) a year not circa 4,700 as quoted.  We have questioned these figures verbally and in writing during the closed session of the HSR and the inclusion within the published consultation documentation of such grossly misleading figures is a matter of some considerable concern.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summation, we believe the current policy approach will create a generation of new crime hot spots across the country, putting residents at risk of avoidable crime and anti-social behaviour, leading to a significant impact upon residents, their quality of life, well-being and the long term viability and this will have a resultant impact on the sustainability of those developments.

default2. Secured by Designdefault&#xa0;
default2.1 Secured by Design is a flagship initiative with a small central team, implemented locally by police staff at no cost to developers. The initiative’s only objective is to design out crime within the planning process. We believe that individuals have the right to feel safe in their communities, and benefit from the inclusion of security standards that reduce victimisation and when incorporated with good design can enhance their quality of life. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 Independent research has shown that comparable developments with low level security (equivalent to that currently seen on new build homes within the private sector) suffer 75% more burglaries and 25% more criminal damage than those with a more 
defaultrealistic level of security (Secured by Design)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 For the past two and a half decades Secured by Design has been at the forefront of product standard development and has met the needs of the public and the police service by driving up standards and responding to emerging criminal techniques. It is a respected standard and is supported by local authorities and professional bodies. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4 The scheme is self-funded by its accreditation of a range of products which meet police preferred security standards that have been proven to reduce crime i.e. there is no cost to the public purse. The presence of the SBD accreditation initiative has created a competitive market for security products which has driven up standards for new homes. Currently there are over five hundred companies within the UK that have submitted their products for testing and certification to achieve SBD recognition.  SBD is wholly owned by the police service as a not for profit company and any surplus is reinvested in research and crime prevention projects across the country. There is no obligation on builders or architects to use these particular products, we promote the standards. As such, it is evident that Secured by Design has tangible benefits to society as a whole, particularly in building sustainable and safe communities. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5 You may be aware that Secured by Design is included within the CfSH, and has been the main driver of homes built to the standard, reinforced by the Homes and Communities Agency’s (HCA) 
defaultrequirement
default (not a recommendation as suggested in the HSR) that all homes receiving grant funding must meet the SBD standards referenced within the Code.  The security element of the CfSH aims to “encourage the design of developments where people feel safe and secure; where crime and disorder, or the fear of crime, does not undermine quality of life or community cohesion”, and credits are awarded for complying with this. The success of the CfSH and HCA has been helpful in demonstrating the value of security standards in housing sustainability. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3. The Carbon Cost of Crime default&#xa0;
default3.1 The International Energy Agency estimates that 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide are released as a result of each burglary. Moreover, the carbon cost of crime in England and Wales has been found to be a minimum of 6,000,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year (Pease &amp; Farrell 2009). Combating crime means that carbon costs such as the replacement of stolen and damaged property, police mileage in response to the crime  and moving costs to new homes away from high crime areas (cited as the main reason for moving house, Pease &amp; Farrell 2009) are minimised.
default Moreover, by reducing burglary and anti-social behaviour
default there are significant benefits reaped in terms of reduced maintenance costs and fewer void properties to protect. In numerous cases, planning developments from the 1980s which stem from poor design have even required demolition due mainly to the high levels of crime. Secured by Design is committed to not only reducing crime, but its environmental implications as well. Such is our concern that we have match-funded the Home Office for a 4 year EngD placement at Surrey University to further investigate the carbon cost of crime.
default&#xa0;
default3.2 The strength of research undertaken has reinforced our view that the safety and security of homes is a critical element of sustainable housing. Despite the evidence, there has always been a blind spot with regard to security standards which are rarely accounted for in the public sector’s environmental audits or carbon plans. Moreover, the Government’s definition of a zero-carbon home fails to mention crime and the contingent costs which crime would cause at all. Removal or diminution of the Code will send a signal to researchers and private sector R&amp;D that a key route to delivery no longer exists and will lead to reduced investment in this sector.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.  Housing Standards Reviewdefault&#xa0;
default4.1 Firstly, I would put on record the Police Services recognition of the need to simplify the planning and housing system. However, this must not be at the expense of sustainability and community safety. A race to the bottom on standards will only serve to damage the sustainability and safety of communities. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2 The proposed two tier structure, and subsequent winding down of the CfSH, is deeply concerning and will in our view side-line security standards.  The base security standard has been proven to offer little or no benefit in security terms and the ‘higher’ level two proposal falls below that which is currently being provided in up to 40% of all new homes. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3 The Housing Standards Review proposals, in conjunction with the proposed new National Planning Practice Guidance (
defaulthttp://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/
default) produced following the review of the planning system by Lord Taylor of Goss, will result in fewer homes meeting the Secured by Design standards. Furthermore, as Lord Taylor has sought to restrict planning guidance references to government guidance only (SBD is police owned and therefore does not fit into this category) no reference can be made to SBD within future local authority development plans or other documentation. We believe that this seriously undermines localism by restricting the ability of local authorities to use SBD as the proven method of reducing crime and improving the quality of life for their communities. I would add that our concern is exacerbated by the proposal by the DCLG to impose the same standards to all new homes regardless of tenure, as this will undoubtedly reduce the level of security (currently incorporated as standard within all new HCA funded homes). This is particularly dangerous given that many social housing developments are in more deprived areas with higher crime rates and, according to Housing and Communities Agency figures, are occupied by those classified as vulnerable (40-45%) and/or elderly (23%).
default&#xa0;
default4.4 Moreover, the removal of the CfSH will stifle innovation and there is already evidence to suggest that its loss will stop developers from aspiring to achieve a higher level of sustainability/security. The modus operandi of offenders are constantly evolving, as are  crime hotspot areas; Secured by Design possesses vast experience and knowledge of adapting to these new challenges and are able to do this effectively within the mechanism of the Code.
default&#xa0;
default4.5 In contrast, the Housing Standards Review proposals are rigid and will, we believe, be incapable of responding to changing crime patterns. Moreover, another of the DCLG’s documents currently in consultation (possibly as a planned alternative to the Code) ‘Next Steps to Zero Carbon Homes – Allowable Solutions’, fails to recognise the carbon cost of crime and the increased benefits afforded by security. Therefore, the winding down of the CfSH and subsequent reduction of security standards in housing, will undermine the intention of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). 
default&#xa0;
default4.6 You will be aware that central to the NPPF is the matter of sustainable development, which is defined as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. The NPPF identifies five guiding principles to achieving this aim, which includes “ensuring a strong, healthy and just society”. We believe promoting good neighbourhood design, and the application of proven spatial designing features and security standards is a central facet of delivering these principles and ensuring the viability of development for years to come.
default&#xa0;
default4.7 The costing evidence used to support the Housing Standards Review proposals is inaccurate, there have been assumptions made about the requirements and subsequent costs of SBD that are simply not true, the estimate of the number of new homes built to SBD standards is grossly inaccurate and we have concerns that these misleading figures will be used by those replying to the consultation to justify a reduction of the security standards. My concerns were raised by my representative Jon Cole with E.C.Harris and the DCLG during the closed sessions on security but these concerns and an offer to discuss them have been ignored.
default&#xa0;
default4.8 Additionally the Impact Assessment fails to consider some of the most important benefits gained from security standards for the public and the police. Secured by Design was not afforded the same access as the building industry in extrapolating the figures, and despite raising this concern during the closed session of the review, our concerns have been largely ignored and the misleading figures have been published. Consequently, there are a number of discrepancies that have resulted in an overinflated cost for Secured by Design. Additionally the low ‘estimate’ of the number of homes currently meeting SBD standards suggests that a much larger proportion of the housing sector would be affected and therefore would incur an ‘extra over cost’ for additional security this  entirely distorts the true picture! 
default&#xa0;
default4.9 Crucially, a
defaultn i
defaultndependent assessment conducted in 2010 showed the additional cost of Secured by Design standards for the average home is just £170, and it is estimated that installations pay for themselves in no more than 2 years, and in some cases as little as 8 months. I hope the Committee will agree that this is a small price to pay to improve the long term sustainability and safety of housing. I would strongly urge you to recommend that DCLG engages effectively with Secured by Design to determine costs and benefits that are truly reflective of the situation in order to avoid the sustainability of housing being damaged by incorrect, weak and incomplete analysis.
default&#xa0;
default4.10 We are in touch with various charities, academics, parliamentarians and professional bodies who share our concerns regarding the Housing Standards Review. Notably, we already have a positive relationship with the UK Green Building Council (UK-GBC), and echo their view that the Housing Standards Review proposals fail to present a vision for sustainable homes.  Moreover, 
defaultJim Maddan, Chair of Neighbourhood Watch, has said “Any diminution in the minimum security standards in new developments would be seen as a retrograde step and an invitation to burglars and other criminals to revert to their old ways. Guidance should be tightened up and rules strengthened wherever possible, with the objective that domestic burglary becomes a thing of the past”.
default&#xa0;
default4.11 Whilst I understand key figures within the housebuilding sector did speak to the Challenge Panel, my representative sought permission from the DCLG to speak to the Challenge Panel but was refused. My staff officer informally discussed secuurity with the chair of the Challenge Panel following a recent meeting and despite initial agreement, it was made clear that a meeting to discuss security was not welcomed and any future discussion should be referred to the DCLG.
default&#xa0;
default4.12 Introducing effective security at the build stage costs approximatley 0.12% of the cost to the purchaser. Replacement of the relatively ineffective NHBC doors and windows would cost considerably more.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe cost of crime has formed no part of the HSR impact assessment, but my estimates are that introducing a basic standard of security as opposed to SBD could cost society £462,000,000 over 10 years, when compared to 
defaultthe value of 1,500,000 homes over 10 years (average £245,000 (Evening standard 17/9/13at 2013 prices)) totals £36,750,000,000,000.  
default&#xa0;
default4.13 At a time when Government is calling on producers to provide solutions to crime problems (metal theft, phone theft, vehicle theft), it is surprising that government is overseeing a reduction in opportunities to reduce burglary, and is taking no cognisence of the certain resultant increase in crime, incidently recent crime figures have shown an increase in crime in 21 of the 43 police force areas in England &amp; Wales
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. Other Reviews and Consultationsdefault&#xa0;
default5.1 The issues of crime prevention and sustainability cut across a number of Government Departments, including the Home Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department for Energy and Climate Change, as well as DCLG. We believe that not only has the DCLG lacked appropriate coordination with other internal workstreams, such as Lord Taylor’s Review of Planning Practice Guidance, but there has also been a worrying lack of collaboration between departments, for example, with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on its review of Architecture and the Built Environment and my previously mentioned joint EngD placement with the Home Office. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 Given the Environmental Audit Committee’s broad oversight remit and influence, we hope you will encourage all departments to work closely with DCLG to rethink the Housing Standards Review proposals in order to ensure that the sustainability and safety of housing is not put at risk.
