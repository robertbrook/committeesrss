&#xa0;&#xa0;The Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) is a public-private partnership between global energy and engineering firms and the UK Government.We carry out three key activities:Our mission is to accelerate the development, demonstration and eventual commercial deployment of a focused portfolio of energy technologies which will increase energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve energy and climate change goalsIn the last five years, the ETI has invested over £210m in 52 projects across nine technology programme areas. The technology project portfolio to 2017 totals over £400m of investment with four key aims to reduce the costs of generating energy, demand reduction, increasing investor confidence and increasing public acceptance and engagement. Our industry and government partnership means we can share risk and create affordability for the development and demonstration of emerging new technologies that have the potential to make a material impact on the future UK energy system.Although the ETI is a stand-alone organisation, through our partnership operating model we are able to bring together the collective knowledge, expertise and experience of our diverse member organisations, the project partners that we collaborate with in delivering projects, and external stakeholders. This focused partnership model between the public and private sectors provides access to money, skills and market interests.Partnership and collaboration is key to the ETI and we have worked with over 119 partner organisations to date, including 29 universities and research institutes.Our strategic techno-economic analysis of the UK energy system provides insights, policy support and investment that identifies and prioritises the UK’s future low carbon energy system development requirements.  It is also being used to identify credible, lowest-cost pathways to support policy makers as they consider major future infrastructure decisions.  In addition, our projects build knowledge and capability that will help contribute to the effective delivery of the UK’s low carbon future.Recognising the need to focus and target investments to ensure value for money and leverage from public sector investments, the ETI’s techno-economic modelling and strategic analysis of the UK energy system is a critical tool supporting effective innovation delivery.  The system is termed ‘ESME’ and is now used by DECC and the Committee on Climate Change to aid with planning and effective investment targeting.The development priorities we have identified are:These priorities are closely aligned with the Government’s balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon sources.However, it is important that the right steps are taken to ensure the cost of carbon reductions are affordable in the context of sustaining UK economic growth and industrial development.  Identifying and developing a series of options to support future energy system pathway decisions will be critical to delivering this. The ETI is a core member of the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG), which brings together the major public sector backed organisations that invest in low carbon innovation in the UK.  The LCICG’s aim is to enhance the focus, coordination and delivery of support for innovation in low carbon technologies.  Although each LCICG organisation has its own priorities for, and approach to, specific investments in low carbon innovation, there is strong alignment in terms of the desired outcomes and the emphasis on co-ordinated and targeted innovation investment across all parts of the energy innovation landscape.  This is expressed in the shared LCICG aim, which is to maximise the impact of UK public sector funding for low carbon technologies, in order to:The Technology Innovation Needs Assessment (TINA) project has provided focus for LCICG innovation funding prioritisation, whilst recognising the differing roles and remits of LCICG members. The ETI’s ESME modelling toolset was used widely in development of the various TINAs.A well-coordinated funding landscape also increases the UK’s attractiveness to inward investment.Low carbon technologies often take a long time to successfully develop, and even then significant improvements in their performance and cost can still be achieved by feeding back learning on an ongoing basis to improve component and system-level design.  It is therefore important that the support low carbon technologies receive is targeted and sustained over the long term.  LCICG members are working to improve the technology journey for developers and investors, making sure the right support is available at the right time and at the right scale to deliver a seamless progression, and to ensure that the balance of support is appropriate between the different stages of the innovation chain.December 2013&#xa0;              Page 3 of 3
