[normal]Community Ownership of Land[bold] in Scotland[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Carnegie UK Trust
[normal]’s 
[normal]experience and interest 
[normal]in Land Reform 
[normal]is 
[normal]specifically
[normal] community ownership of land. We would like to see more opportunities for communities to take on ownership of land and to derive the greatest benefits from doing so. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We welcome
[normal] this inquiry into Land Reform in Scotland
[normal] and many of the suggestions in the 
[normal]inquiry discussion paper relating to community ownership.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are 
[normal]also 
[normal]actively engaging with the Scottish Government on the proposed 
[normal]Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill and we have submitted 
[normal]evidence
[normal] to the Scottish Government Land Reform Review Group.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]We have seen how c
[normal]ommunity ownership of land or other local assets c
[normal]an have a transformative effect in 
[normal]communities. 
[normal]Half a million 
[normal]acres of land are now in 
[normal]community ownership in Scotland resulting in repopulation; new homes; new b
[normal]usinesses; and
[normal] a new sense of conf
[normal]idence, energy and opportunity. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Our own research has shown that it can be a
[normal] powerful catalyst for a wide range of social, environmental and economic improvements in local communities
[normal] with a positive impact on individual and community wellbeing
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our experience has shown that the ben
[normal]efits of community ownership and/ or management
[normal] 
[normal]can be:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is great potential for more rural and urban communities across Scotland to access the many benefits that owning and controlling local assets, including land
[normal],
[normal] can offe
[normal]r. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We 
[normal]would
[normal] 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]welcome the introduction of measures that would make ‘
[normal]it easier for communities to take ownership of land and other assets
[normal]’ and ‘
[normal]measures intended to facilitate and make easier the transfer of land and other assets in public ownership to co
[normal]mmunities and others’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Improving wellbeing through increased community ownership[bold]– 6[bold] r[bold]ecommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We
[normal] have identified a package of six
[normal] recommendations
[normal] that we believe need to be in place in order to deliver improved community and individual wellbeing for 
[normal]Scottish 
[normal]communities through ownership
[normal] and/or management
[normal] of 
[normal]land and 
[normal]local assets. While each component below is important in its own right the full be
[normal]nefits of each measure can only be derived if all are in place
[normal].
