However, research clearly demonstrates the need to approach low carbon innovation systemically (Hekkert et al. 2007, Grubler et al. 2012). A systemic perspective means that decisions about innovation funding or portfolio design should be seen as part and parcel of a broader strategy to develop effective innovation systems. Innovation systems include the many institutions, networks, and activities involved directly or indirectly with specific innovation processes like R,D&amp;D.&#xa0;2. Low carbon innovation systems have historically been strongly biased towards energy supply technologies (decarbonisation) at the expense of efficient end-use technologies or demand-side management (Wilson et al. 2012). Efficient end-use technologies such as vehicles, buildings, and appliances offer far better social returns on investment, cost-effective emissions abatement, and learning potentials (cost reductions as a function of experience). Yet evidence shows that efficient end-use technologies are insufficiently supported throughout the innovation system, not just in terms of R,D&amp;D funding but also in terms of analysis and modelling, roadmapping, technology collaborations (public-private, and trans-national), portfolio and programme design, and market formation activities. &#xa0;3. To be effective, policies and funding to support well functioning innovation systems should be: (i) aligned and consistent; (ii) stable and continuous, but adaptive to changing conditions; (iii) supportive of experimentation and diversity; (iv) portfolio-based, avoiding an over-emphasis or weighting towards particular technologies; (v) supportive of formally codifying knowledge generated; (vi) supporting of knowledge feedbacks from market deployment to earlier stage R&amp;D and testing (Gallagher et al. 2012). These guidelines provide criteria against which the government's approach towards low carbon innovation should be evaluated.&#xa0;4. Ensuring innovation systems are aligned and consistent is particularly important. Alignment means that policy signals and incentives stimulate innovation activities towards shared, desirable outcomes. Consistency means that incentives permeate the entire innovation lifecycle from R&amp;D to diffusion in a coherent way. R,D&amp;D or market support for renewables or energy efficiency should not be contradicted by policies continuing to favour incumbent technologies and industries. Innovation activities to develop low carbon or energy-efficient technologies require a complementary emphasis on market conditions. Supply-side ‘technology-push’ policies and demand-side ‘market-pull’ policies are complements not substitutes. Successful innovation outcomes are typically characterized by comprehensive and consistent ‘packages’ of policies which support many different elements of the innovation system and its effective functioning as a whole. In particular, historical evidence suggests that singular emphases on R,D&amp;D to support rapid up-scaling and commercial application without due regard to market conditions is highly risky, and likely to be unsuccessful.&#xa0;References for Submission&#xa0;Gallagher, K.

This made it impossible to demonstrate whether the Government was achieving value for money from public funds towards to the UK’s legally binding targets:1.    The EU Renewable Energy Directive (2009): to increase the share of renewable energy in the UK’s energy mix from 1.3% in 2005 to 15% by 2020; and2.    The Climate Change Act 2008: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels.&#xa0;We asked the NAO to review “Public funding for innovation in low carbon technologies in the UK” and we are publishing their report and launching our own inquiry. The NAO report highlights that that since June 2010, DECC have taken steps to improve co-ordination of innovation funding. DECC re-launched the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG) in late-2011 comprising all the bodies involved in funding low carbon innovation: BIS, DECC, DEFRA, MOD, DfT, DCLG, UKTI, the Welsh Government, the Scottish Government, the Energy Technology Institute, Crown Estate, Ofgem, Carbon Trust, Scottish Enterprise, TSB and EPSRC. The LCICG is preparing a strategy for launch in early 2014, which should include an assessment of the opportunities for funding for different low carbon technologies. The LCICG should also report on the different stages of the innovation process where public investment could be most effective.&#xa0;The UK’s performance on funding for low carbon innovation to date has been mixed. UK expenditure on energy research and development doubled between 2006-2011 and DECC allocated £185m for 2011-2015 for low carbon innovation: but it under-spent its budget between 2011-2013 because of delays in agreeing and launching its projects. Furthermore, there is no commitment beyond 2015 to a low carbon innovation budget, leaving industry uncertain on support for their investment in long-term innovation initiatives.&#xa0;Terms of Reference&#xa0;•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Will the Government’s current approach towards low carbon innovation help to achieve the UK’s legally binding targets at the lowest possible cost?•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Does the Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What outcomes, if any, are the LCICG likely to achieve?
