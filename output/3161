defaultThe Bank operates throughout the UK and is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. Its mission is to finance charities, social enterprises and community organisations (CSOs). Since its launch in 2002 it has been a leading social finance provider, having approved over £180 million in loans to more than 1,000 CSOs.

defaultCharity Bank has established itself as one of the leading social finance providers in Northern Ireland.  Operating from an office in Belfast, it has provided loan finance to organisations ranging from Omagh Community House to the Women’s Resource and Development Agency and raised £3.5 million in deposits over the past five years.

defaultand was conducted 
defaultbefore

default,
default it did consider aspects relating to the general structure of the retail banking sector in Northern Ireland. Interestingly, it concluded insofar as personal banking was 
defaultconcerned
default “that Northern Ireland forms a separate geographic market…from Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland” (paragraph 3.37). The same enquiry also concluded that “by Q4 2006, the market was concentrated” (paragraph 4.23). Since the Office of Fair Trading (Review of barriers to entry, expansion and exit in retail banking, OFT, September 2010, paragraph 3.34) 
defaultfound that levels of market concentration for certain products had intensified between 2006 and 2010, it might reasonably be concluded that levels of market concentration in Northern Ireland have not relaxed and may have intensified since 2008. This is important because the level of concentration in a market is regarded as influencing the degree of competition existing within it, which in turn is frequently reflected in the availability and range of products and services and their price.

default              
defaultA large portion of the organisations to which the Bank lends are unable to secure debt f
defaultinance
default from mainstream providers on terms that are both affordable and appropriate to the sector’s specific characteristics. For instance
default,
default the practice followed by traditional lenders of seeking personal guarantees from 
defaultcharity trustees
default is not normally followed by Charity Bank. Trustees frequently act in a voluntary, un-remunerated capacity and it would be inappropriate for the development of social lending markets to impose this type of potential personal liability. Equally, if a borrower has been successful in raising funds on the back of the Bank’s support and is in a position to repay the loan early, it can do so without penalty.

default              
defaultThe financial position of CSOs in Northern Ireland will be 
defaultaffected
default by the outlook for public spending. The Whitehall settlement to the Northern Ireland Office indicates an extended period of reductions in public spending over the period of the Comprehensive Spending Review. Experience suggests local authorities and other bodies responsible for public service delivery respond to public spending reductions by prioritising statutory services, with the result that activities which are non-statutory are disproportionately affected by funding reductions. Inevitably CSOs and especially bodies reliant on grant
default-
defaultfunding will not be immune. 
default9
default. 
default              
defaultThe data indicates CSOs in Northern Ireland play an important role in the economy. But there is evidence they tend to fragmentation and are reliant on grants distributed by public bodies for their funding. These factors contribute to a lack of scale amongst CSOs and as a consequence, can hinder
default&#xa0;
defaulttheir ability to fulfil the potential
default&#xa0;
defaultto deliver services beyond the local and across a broad geographic area. A
default recent survey by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) (Survey of Northern Ireland’s Third Sector and its Potential to become more Enterprise Driven,
default 
defaultDETI, 2013) reported 77% of social enterprises had the intention to expand. But a number of barriers to expansion were cited, including “a lack of available finance”, “not having the right people” and “a lack of awareness of the support” available.

defaultIn assessing a loan application, the Bank reviews the salience of the organisation’s business model and business strategy and the effectiveness of 
defaultits 
defaulttrustees and senior management in executing that strategy. The organisation needs to show 
defaultthat 
defaultit is capable of securing sustainable revenue streams over an extended period of time
default and that
default it can exercise control over its costs and generate free 
defaultcash 
defaultflow. The Bank’s experience in Northern Ireland suggests a significant portion of CSOs are not sufficiently developed organisationally to 
defaultuse
default loan finance with confidence. Internal data covering the 
defaulttwelve
default month period to the end of August this year 
defaultshows
default that very nearly a third of loan applications were declined 
defaultby the Bank 
defaulton the grounds they failed adequately to demonstrate an ability to satisfy repayment criteria.      
default11
default. 
default              
defaultThe Bank believes solutions must be sought to aid the growth of the social economy in Northern Ireland. Charity Bank has experience of successfully managing and delivering a range of debt and development programmes 
defaultby way of 
defaultan alternative approach
default to reliance on mainstream banking
default. Examples include;
default12
default. 
default              
defaultRegarding the question of specific service areas that might be appropriate for the development of CSO provision, those organisations that have a substantial asset base and good visibility of future revenue are particularly attractive
default 
defaultfrom a banking perspective
default. Social housing and social care are both services that fall within this category and therefore provide a 
defaultgood 
defaultbasis for further expansion.
