defaultWritten evidence by the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) (PHE 0001default9default)default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1.1.
default&#xa0; 
default BASHH and the FSRH are the two leading bodies representing the interests of those involved in sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH) and HIV in the UK. The FSRH has a membership of nearly 16,000 doctors, approximately 80% of whom work in General Practice the remainder being specialists working primarily in Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health Services, and there are currently over 1000 members of BASHH, primarily specialists and other medical practitioners and nurses working in Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) services.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe transition of public health to local authorities included transferring responsibility for commissioning clinical sexual and reproductive SRH and GUM services to local authorities. SRH services are also sometimes called contraceptive services or family planning, but in practice provide a wider range of care than just contraception. 
default&#xa0;
default1.3.
default&#xa0; 
default The last ten years have seen unprecedented improvements in sexual health services with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remaining consistent since 2008, after rising by 20% between 2001 and 2005. However, compared with many other western European countries, England has high rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies which present significant challenges for SRH. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4.
default&#xa0; 
default Open and unrestricted access to high-quality services with well-trained staff is vital to ensure these challenges are met. This means that everyone, irrespective of age or location of residence or GP registration, should have access to high quality services for STI treatment and comprehensive contraceptive provision in a timely manner, and without need for referral by a GP. Through secondary legislation, the Health and Social Care Act places a mandate on local authorities to provide ‘appropriate access’ to open access services. 
default&#xa0;
default1.5.
default&#xa0; 
default BASHH and the FSRH have concerns about the capacity of local authorities to commission clinical sexual health services, the potential for fragmentation of services, and the proposed funding mechanisms for sexual health. 
default&#xa0;
default1.6.
default&#xa0; 
default BASHH and the FSRH believe there is a high chance that access to sexual health services will be restricted, service standards and training will be compromised and the improvements seen in Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare over recent years will not be sustained.
default&#xa0;
default1.7.
default&#xa0; 
default BASHH and the FSRH therefore believe that Public Health England has a critical role to play in providing the necessary support to local authorities to commission complex clinical services.  There also need to be stronger lines of accountability between local authorities and Public Health England, to enable intervention where 
defaultsexual health services have fallen below the mandated requirement.  To 
defaultfulfil
default these responsibilities Public Health England require a team with a broad experience in both GUM and SRH. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1.
default&#xa0; 
default BASHH and the FSRH believe that Public Health England should be providing additional support to local authorities because of the complex systems and expertise that will be necessary to commission clinical sexual health services.
default  This will require a team within Public Health England with a broad experience of both GUM and SRH who are able to provide ongoing support to local authorities. 
defaultWe also believe that there should be clear lines of accountability between local authorities and Public Health England to ensure that commissioning problems can be resolved quickly to avoid any unnecessary fall in standards for patients.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.
default&#xa0; 
default In 2011, the Government concluded that commissioning responsibility for abortion, 
defaultsterilisation
default and vasectomy were not appropriate for local authorities and should be moved into the NHS, citing their 
default‘highly clinical, and in most cases surgical, nature’ (Department of Health 
default“Public Health in Local Government” factsheet) which require 
default‘
defaulta
default robust clinical, regulatory and legislative framework
default’.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government concluded that abortion, vasectomy and 
defaultsterilisation
default should remain within the NHS and be commissioned by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). 
default&#xa0;
default2.3.
default&#xa0; 
default Due to their highly clinical nature, Level 3 specialist sexual health services require the same ‘robust clinical, regulatory and legislative framework’ required by abortion, vasectomy and 
defaultsterilisation
default services. BASHH and the FSRH believe that clinical commissioning in relation to sexual health should be evaluated through the same decision-making process that abortion, vasectomy and 
defaultsterilisation
default were reviewed.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultExamples of surgical and complex non-surgical services:
default&#xa0;
default2.5.
default&#xa0; 
defaultExamples of complex medical services include:
default&#xa0;
default2.6.
default&#xa0; 
default Much of this personal medical healthcare is not primarily public healthcare. Instead it forms a continuum with current NHS clinical care delivered in primary and secondary care and there are potential risks from detaching sexual health from these other services.
default&#xa0;
default2.7.
default&#xa0; 
default We are concerned that local authorities do not fully appreciate the clinical and information governance infrastructure, systems and leadership needed to safely commission clinical sexual health services. This includes having risk registers in place, ensuring there are appropriate audit systems and other procedures that mean the right questions are being asked of the commissioning decisions. These questions should be led at board level, by people with the requisite experience and expertise of dealing with clinical risks. Without the necessary clinical and information governance systems in place clinical services staff may undertake procedures without the appropriate competencies and standards, guidance may not be followed properly, and patients will increasingly be put at risk.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
default&#xa0; 
default Public Health England should take the lead on ensuring there is joined up commissioning at a national level with NHS England, and supporting joint commissioning arrangement at a local level between CCGs and local authorities. There also needs to be clarity over accountability and the authority of PHE to ‘step in’ and address service level challenges as a result of fragmented commissioning structures.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.
default&#xa0; 
default The NHS reforms transferred responsibility for commissioning sexual health services across a number of new 
defaultorganisations
default, which have resulted in fragmentation between local authorities, CCGs, NHS England and Public Health England. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3.
default&#xa0; 
default SRH services also have clinical pathways which will overlap with NHS funded services, particularly 
defaultgynaecological
default care. A common example is that many women currently are referred to contraceptive services to have a contraceptive device fitted primarily for 
defaultgynaecological
default reasons rather than for contraceptive purposes, yet it is uncertain whether Las and CCGs are noting this or who would be responsible for paying for this provision. Without payment structures in place, there are real dangers that the fragmentation of the commissioning infrastructure will result in patients not 
defaultreceiving the care and treatment they need delivered by those most skilled to deliver that care.
default&#xa0;
default3.4.
default&#xa0; 
default The fragmentation of commissioning has already caused unintended consequences. In September 2012, David Florey and 
defaultFelicicity
default Harvey wrote to all commissioners highlighting circumstances w
defaulthere the tendering of sexual health had been awarded to new providers for GUM and SRH services, and how this had resulted in the unintended outcome of the NHS Trusts that previously provided joint GUM and HIV treatment services finding it no longer viable to continue to provide HIV treatment services independently from GUM. This had implications for HIV patients with their services needing to be transferred to new providers. Despite the letter these consequences are continuing to happen throughout England.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1.
default&#xa0; 
default It is unclear what formal powers Public Health England or the Department of Health has to address local authority commissioning decisions where they have led to a restriction in open access to sexual health services, or even decommissioning of services altogether. We believe that formal lines of accountability and the powers of national bodies to intervene should be clearly defined. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
default&#xa0; 
default There remains significant uncertainty about what ‘appropriate access’ means, as per the mandate. There are concerns that access may be restricted by age, place of residence, or that services are unable to provide care in a timely manner making service ‘open access’ in name only. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
default&#xa0; 
default This is especially pertinent in light of recent developments in Ipswich, 
defaultwhich has only very recently had its sexual health service effectively decommissioned, after its premises were reallocated for another health requirement. Unable to find alternative premises the sexual health service has now been reduced to a very limited capacity, with reduced staffing provision. We understand, Public Health England were unable to intervene, despite the 130,000 people based in Ipswich clearly not having ‘appropriate access’ as mandated.
default&#xa0;
default4.4.
default&#xa0; 
default There are concerns about restrictions on the care that can be provided. 
defaultThe term “sexually transmitted infections (STIs)” is used to cover all the conditions diagnosed and managed in GUM clinics. This is clearly a very simplified but much easier term to use. We have heard of instances where new providers intend to interpret this quite literally and restrict the diagnosis and treatment of other conditions that are not STIs but which have always been a routine part of all GUM clinics’ work as their symptoms and signs overlap with those of STIs. Similarly SRH (contraceptive) services have always provided a wider range of care than just contraception such as cervical screening and provide specialist care on the use of contraceptives to manage gynaecological and dermatological medical conditions.  
default&#xa0;
default4.5.
default&#xa0; 
default There are concerns that the ring-fenced budget designated to local authorities is not sufficient to 
defaultfulfil
default the new public health responsibilities. The Department of Health has even conceded that the spending estimates for Public Health ‘may have been an underestimation’ in many areas.
default&#xa0;
default4.6.
default&#xa0; 
default The recent Communities and Local Government Committee (CLGC) report on 
default‘the
default role of local authorities in health issues’ reiterated this point and raised concerns over the way in which public health budgets were currently allocated to local authorities. It suggested that greater clarity is needed on funding allocations, especially around sexual health funding.
default1
default&#xa0;
default4.7.
default&#xa0; 
default It is currently estimated that sexual health will constitute 25% of the total £2.2bn local authority public health budget. Critically however, it is hard to accurately forecast the cost of clinical sexual health due to the open access nature of the services, meaning like A&amp;E services, anyone can access any clinic around the country for prevention, testing and treatment. 
default&#xa0;
default4.8.
default&#xa0; 
default Local authorities are also under significant financial pressure, in particular from social care budgets, and there is a danger that sexual health services will face restrictions or decommissioning of services.
default&#xa0;
default4.9.
default&#xa0; 
default Whilst the public health budget will remain flat the financial demands for sexual health services will continue to increase as the rates of STI infection continue to rise. As the financial pressure builds it is likely to result in local authorities restricting services.
default&#xa0;
default4.10.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
default BASHH and the FSRH also have some concerns about the potential for strongly held political views on Health and Wellbeing Boards impacting on the provision of local sexual health services. The decision to remove the responsibility for commissioning abortion services from local authorities has been welcomed due to concerns that pro-life views held by some 
defaultcouncillors
default who may sit on Health and Wellbeing Boards will result in funding not being forthcoming for abortion services or indeed services being decommissioned. However, 
defaultCouncillors
default with strong political views may also have similar views on the provision of services for gay men and sex workers, the use of expensive prophylaxis following potential sexual exposure (PEPSE) to HIV, and the provision of contraceptive services to young people, including those under 16.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1.
default&#xa0; 
default Public Health England should promote the integrated sexual health and reproductive healthcare tariff to facilitate effective cross-charging, promote integration and innovation in sexual and reproductive healthcare, and to help mitigate against the risk of restriction to open-access services. 
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
default&#xa0; 
default A joint BASHH and FSRH survey of lead clinicians demonstrated significant uncertainty around future funding mechanisms. By October 2013, 15% of GUM services had already been moved from 
defaultPbR
default tariff to block contract and there are plans to move a further 13% to block contracts.  
default&#xa0;
default5.3.
default&#xa0; 
default Extensive work has gone into developing an integrated tariff for GUM and SRH by the London Sexual Health 
defaultProgramme
default on behalf of the London Primary Care Trusts. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4.
default&#xa0; 
default Sexual ill-health does not respect local authority boundaries; many men and women require sexual health services when they are away from their borough of residence.  Without a tariff such cross-charging arrangements will prove difficult.  
default&#xa0;
default5.5.
default&#xa0; 
default The open access nature of services means that SRH care is dependent on a system that allows cross-charging. For instance, we are aware that some commissioners have said that they do not intend to pay a tariff for their sexual health attendees seen in other areas. The lack of effective cross-charging will put increasing pressure on London and provincial city clinics and will certainly not encourage clinics to provide excellent and renowned services. In fact it may perversely promote poor service provision to discourage people from the surrounding areas. In turn this will lead to increased prevalence of STIs, HIV and unintended pregnancies.
default&#xa0;
default5.6.
default&#xa0; 
default To address this issue, the Communities and Local Government Committee called on the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) and the Government to work with local authorities on the issue of non-residents’ use of demand-led services and we support this recommendation.
default1
default&#xa0;
default5.7.
default&#xa0; 
default A large proportion of sexual health service delivery focuses on the prevention of sexual ill health (STI screening, Chlamydia screening 
defaultprogramme
default) and the prevention of unplanned pregnancy. Ensuring these pathways are priced accurately, via a tariff, allows for a whole range of effective health promotion and prevention activities to be delivered alongside clinical care.
default&#xa0;
default5.8.
default&#xa0; 
default National tariffs, by guaranteeing an adequate funding stream, will also help to protect the sexual health proportion of the ring-fenced budget being used for other services provided by local authorities.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1.
default&#xa0; 
default Public Health England should undertake an assessment of the indicators relating to sexual and reproductive health in the Public Health Outcomes Framework on how they are delivering the ‘life course approach’, as outlined in the Sexual Health Framework for England.
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
default&#xa0; 
default Local authorities are required to provide open-access services and a choice of contraception to all women of all ages, however they will be held accountable to public health outcomes which relate only to reducing unplanned pregnancies in teenage women, as per the Public Health Outcomes Framework indicators.
default&#xa0;
default6.3.
default&#xa0; 
default In the absence of any indicators relating to sexual and reproductive health for post-teen women, Public Health England should establish what national levers can be put in place to ensure local commissioning decisions do not have a perverse impact on a group of people in their area.
default&#xa0;
default6.4.
default&#xa0; 
defaultProvision of contraceptive care is highly cost effective, with a benefit to the NHS of £12.50 for every £1 spent.
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
default&#xa0; 
default Access for all women to the full range of contraceptive methods at a location and time that meets their needs is vital in enabling women to control their reproduction, plan their lives and avoid unplanned pregnancy. Women over 20 have particularly important needs for sexual health, including contraceptive, services:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.6.
default&#xa0; 
default Restrictions in contraception could lead to increased unwanted pregnancies, abortions, sexual transmitted diseases and lead to increased costs for the NHS and wider society.
