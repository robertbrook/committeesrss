[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Dear 
[normal]Louise
[normal],
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Winter Readiness Survey 2013/14[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Thank you for 
[normal]inviting me to give
[normal] evidence 
[normal]to the Transport 
[normal]Select 
[normal]Committee last month
[normal], i
[normal]n 
[normal]relation to 
[normal]your
[normal] 
[normal]inq
[normal]uiry into winter resilience. As promised at the session, I enclose a copy of 
[normal]the LGA’s 
[normal]2014 Winter Readiness Survey, which is also a
[normal]vailable online at 
[normal]http://www.local.gov.uk/we
[normal]b/guest/economy-and-transport-research/
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Having learnt from
[normal] the 
[normal]experience of the 
[normal]2010 
[normal]winter
[normal], local government has been working hard to ensure it is 
[normal]ready 
[normal]to keep local areas moving in the face of significantly challenging winter weather.
[normal] As you will 
[normal]see from the report, c
[normal]ouncils have m
[normal]ade sure they are well-equipped. 
[normal]On average
[normal],
[normal] ea
[normal]ch council
[normal] will be 
[normal]this winter 
[normal]using ten
[normal] full-size gritters and one mini-gritter as well as ploughs, footways gritters and snow blowers.
[normal] 95 per 
[normal]cent of councils
[normal] 
[normal]are armed wi
[normal]th
[normal] the same or increased amounts of salt
[normal] compared to last year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Local government has an impressive record in finding efficiencies and innovating through new models of working
[normal], even when it comes to winter resilience.
[normal] 
[normal]For example, a
[normal]lmost half of councils s
[normal]urveyed will be 
[normal]sharing services 
[normal]to deliver 
[normal]their winter resilience programmes.
[normal] This includes community empowerment with over 70 per cent of councils seeking to more effectively facilitate public use of grit bins
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Community engagement
[normal] will be essential
[normal] for
[normal] this winter’s preparations;
[normal] 93 per cent of councils were already making plans in 
[normal]the 
[normal]autumn for communicating their winter service plans. 
[normal]From a digital perspective, 
[normal]95 per cent of councils will be using their websites and social media to provide live 
[normal]updates about gritting
[normal],
[normal] which 
[normal]is expected to cover
[normal] nearly half of their entire road networks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, while c
[normal]ouncils
[normal] want
[normal] to do 
[normal]even 
[normal]more 
[normal]of this
[normal] sort of work
[normal],
[normal] with
[normal] cuts 
[normal]to our sector 
[normal]totalling 43
[normal] per cent this Parliament, 
[normal]they
[normal] are having to make tough d
[normal]ecisions about 
[normal]where they prioritise resources
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Current 
[normal]LGA analysis demonstrates that there will be a funding gap of £15.6 billion by 202
[normal]0
[normal] if Whitehall 
[normal]continues to 
[normal]make 
[normal]cut
[normal]s to
[normal] local government. 
[normal]This could result in councils failing their local communities as with decreasing funding and increasing demand 
[normal]there is only so much local authorities will be able to do.
