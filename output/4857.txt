[[[Letter from Richard Benson, Chief Executive, CST, to the Chair of the Committee, 14 June 2013]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]In response to your request for information concerning extremist speakers at UK universities for the Home Affairs Committee’s inquiry into international terrorism and crime, please find attached CST’s submission.As you will see, we are aware of several incidences of extremist speakers and antisemitic incidents at UK universities that affect the well being of both Jewish students and the wider student community. &#xa0;Richard Benson, Chief ExecutiveCSTJune 2013

[[[BACKGROUND TRENDS]]]&#xa0;British campuses are generally places where Jewish students feel safe to study and do not suffer antisemitism on a daily basis. However, there are occasions at some Universities and Students’ Unions when Jewish students have been exposed to hate preachers, extremist groups, radicalised individuals, disruption of Jewish Society events and even direct incidents of antisemitism. Extremist activity can leave students from a range of minorities feeling vulnerable and reluctant to express their identity openly. Antisemitism, when it occurs, often takes place in a context that includes other forms of bigotry and as such targets all minority students, and therefore the student body as a whole. &#xa0;This academic year (2012-13) has seen an increase in far right activity on campus. Some of this increase is part of a cycle of extremism between far right and Islamist extremists&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ISLAMIST SPEAKERS:]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Al-Haddad is the chairman of London’s Muslim Research and Development Foundation, a group that gives Sharia advice on financial matters. Al-Haddad has been embroiled in controversy surrounding comments allegedly made in 2001 where it is alleged that he claimed Jews “are the enemies of God and descendants of apes and pigs”. He has persistently denied making those comments. An English-language article by Al-Haddad opposes the actions of Al Qaeda but explains that regardless of what Osama bin Laden did, or did not do, “it is an established part of our Islamic creed that every Muslim, unlike the disbelievers, will eventually enter paradise”. The article also shows various perspectives on what constitutes a “martyr” in combat between Muslims and non-Muslims. Speaking in English, Al-Haddad may be seen on youtube, discussing “why marriages fail”. This includes his saying that no outsider should ask a husband why he is beating his wife, because such matters should be sorted between the couple.&#xa0;              In February 2010, Tamimi was a speaker at the Federation of Student Islamic Society (FOSIS) Palestine Conference held at Manchester University, an Islamic Society event at Cambridge and a Palestinian Society event at SOAS. During his address to SOAS students, Tamimi called for the destruction of Israel and stated,“Today Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation because that’s what the Americans and Israelis and cowardly politicians of Europe want, but what is so terrorist about it? “You shouldn’t be afraid of being labelled extreme, radical or terrorist. If fighting for your home land is terrorism, I take pride in being a terrorist. The Koran tells me if I die for my homeland, I’m a martyr and I long to be a martyr.”.In November 2004, Tamimi told the BBC’s Hardtalk: &#xa0;“If I can go to Palestine and sacrifice myself I would do it. Why not?...sacrificing myself for Palestine is a noble cause. It is the straight way to pleasing my God and I would do it if I had the opportunity”&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Uthman Lateef]]] is a preacher from the Hittin Institute. Lateef is alleged to have said, “we don’t accept homosexuality...we hate it because Allan hates it”. In January and June 2009, Lateef was an advertised speaker at events where Anwar Al-Awlaki (a senior Al-Qaeda figure, later killed by a US drone strike) gave presentations via video link. &#xa0;

[[[ACTIVITY ON CAMPUS]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Although the disruption of Israel-related events may not be antisemitic per se, it contributes to an environment of tension, hostility and discomfort for Jewish students; often resulting in Jewish students feeling intimidated and unable to express their views or identities on their own campus.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Throughout 2012, there were a total of 32 campus-related antisemitic incidents reported to the CST. Of these, 18 took place on campus and 14 affected students or academics off campus. Below are some examples:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]]&#xa0;Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamist organisation that has a record of offensive and inflammatory statements regarding Jews, non-Muslims, and gay people, amongst others.  They were added to the NUS No Platform policy in 2004, which denies them the ability to be involved with the national union. However, this policy only has an advisory capacity for individual Students’ Unions. Since then, the organisation has regained some of its presence on campus via front-groups:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Muslim Public Affairs Committee:]]]&#xa0;The Muslim Public Affairs Committee (MPAC) website includes anti-Zionist conspiracy theorising. In 2006, Asghar Bukhari, a founder of MPAC and its spokesman, was shown to have given money to Holocaust revisionist, David Irving in 2000; and urged others to do likewise. Bukhari stated this was because he had regarded Irving as “anti-Zionist”. In 2004, the National Union of Students described MPAC as antisemitic and banned the group.&#xa0;Following the presence of MPAC at Middlesex University, the Students’ Union held a referendum to reaffirm the Union’s policy of not providing a platform for individuals with racist or fascist views (26th-27th February 2013) which received 73% voting yes.  &#xa0;&#xa0;CSTJune 2013&#xa0;4&#xa0; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5b0V49VusY http://www2.lse.ac.uk/publicEvents/events/2012/02/20120207t1830vCLM502.aspx http://www.familyretreat.co.uk/speakers/shaykh-dr-haitham-al-haddad/ http://www.mrdf.co.uk/  http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/cleric-did-say-"jews-are-descendants-apes-and-pigs" http://www.alminbar.net/alkhutab/khutbaa.asp?mediaURL=4359 http://hurryupharry.org/2012/02/04/more-wisdom-of-haitham-al-haddad/ http://www.islam21c.com/politics/2644-advice-to-muslims-on-the-death-of-osama-bin-ladin See from 9:00 minutes for relevant comments http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=z37H-NuyY1c,  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jan/07/iraq.comment http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/21/israel-palestine-gaza https://www.facebook.com/events/280300288948/ http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/issue/news/university-islamic-society-accused-of-hypocrisy/ https://www.facebook.com/events/271049642285/ http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/27106/calls-destruction-israel-soas-lecture Hardtalk, BBC News 24, 2/11/04, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/3985403.stm http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR490014.aspx http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHEaL6Fs7RA http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100077810/east-london-mosque-keeps-on-lying/   http://theendoftime.eventbrite.com/  http://www.hurryupharry.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wasatiyyah.jpeg http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/7110/2012-4/Nick-Griffin-UCC-visit-%E2%80%98threat-to-safety%E2%80%99 http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/17/nick-griffin-trinity-college-dublin http://www.leedsstudent.org/2012-10-26/ls1/leeds-student-speaks-to-nick-griffin-leader-of-the-bnp http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-life/9881110/Marine-Le-Pen-sparks-Cambridge-protests.html https://twitter.com/culturisthub http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gooUZ2iD_Pw http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/students-on-pimps-and-hoes-bar-crawl-800859 See 00:12:29 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOJ8LT7DlfA,  http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=73549,  http://thebeaveronline.co.uk/2010/12/07/abdel-bari-atwan-talk-sees-students-walk-out/ http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/102638/israels-deputy-ambassador-forced-flee-essex-university-lecture http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/88068/university-students-disrupt-israeli-ambassador-talk http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/31165/israel-deputy-ambassador-shocked-manchester-attack http://www.thecst.org.uk/docs/Incidents%20Report%202012.pdf  (p.19)http://www.thecst.org.uk/docs/CST%20Incidents%20Report_Jan-June%202012.pdf, p.5. http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/62277/nazi-students-hit-protester-lse-ski-trip http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/alexander-meleagrouhitchens/the-future-of-campus-extr_b_1082401.html http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yKd8ZAymGU https://www.facebook.com/global.ideas.soc?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/143279022374652/ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUHFAXnVbWE https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/QM.Ideological.Society/ http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/47884/students-elect-two-who-back-caliphate, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCNMRgqXNQ http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/19/secondworldwar.religion  http://www.musu.mdx.ac.uk/uploads//No%20Platform%20Policy.pdf
