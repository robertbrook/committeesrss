"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n              \nRCH0021\n              \n              \n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Northern Care\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe stability of the independent residential care sector is precarious and coming under intense pressures with regard to costs \nof placements within\n children’s Homes \nwhilst maintaining the quality of care required to support the young people as they \ndeserve\n. \n \nThis is allied with \nan inspection process quite rightly, concentrating on progress and outcomes for young people\n and which has become even more intense in its scrutiny over the last few months.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n unwavering\n expectation that young people are \nw\norking towards \nmeeting aspirational objectives is something that anyone who works within a residential care setting is passionate about and highly motivated to strive towards. \n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is well recognised\n,\n that in Good and Outstanding provisions, this is integr\nal to the culture of the care provided and competent, well qualified, stable teams who are well led by a forward thinking and compassionate manager are evident in these Homes as a general rule.\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a specialist independent provide\nr we see the above as the \nbench\nmark to achieve and work hard for this through a dynamic and flexible approach. We val\nue the potential for working in\n realistic partnerships with our local authority partners and \nrecognis\ne that the way forward is to have an open and honest relationshi\np which allows for better provisions offering optimum quality care in the right locations\n.\n \nTo this end it would mean\n that issues of sufficiency and cross boundary placements can be managed according to the needs of the young people who are placed in \nour \nca\nre.\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current climate is turbulent and uneasily balanced and whilst we accept our requirements to provide good quality\n,\n aspirational care for the young people we look after\n,\n there are certain barriers whi\nch we are striving to overcome and which do \naffect the long term stability of the quality of care for many young people.\n&#xa0;\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst Residential Care is seen as a last resort for the young people\n,\n as is so often the case in the current climate, the expectations of real progress and real long term positi\nve outcomes are often completely compromised\n. I\nt is so often just too late to be able to work in a meaningful way with a young person who has been subject \nto \nmultiple placement breakdowns\n leading to \ndifficulties in maintaining\n relationships and trust. It i\ns compromised but not impossible and given stability and a chance to make good long term relationships with a competent and compassionate staff team, there is plenty of evidence of real success for the young people as they leave into independence.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe re\nality however is that until there is an acceptance that a long ter\nm approach is viable and valued, \nthe chances of positive outcomes are difficult to achieve.\n&#xa0;\n8)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe right placement offering the right level of needs led care is not a difficult concept and man\ny providers are offering this in many different types of Homes with many different competencies and spec\nialisms but until there is an acceptance that residential care is the right option for some clearly identified young people through a process of assessm\nent of need and this is acknowledged earlier on in the young person’s life, then we will always be playing catch up for some young people\n. Consequently,\n they will not develop the level of independence and life skills required for when they are out in the c\nommunity taking care of themselves.\n&#xa0;\n9)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe onset of the single inspection framework and the concurrent tracking of individual young people\n who are placed in residential \nc\na\nre is welcomed by us and \nthis \nwill ensure that responsibilities \nare maintained if the d\necision is made\n to place \nyoung people \nacross boundaries. It must be pointed out that this can be a positive action and for many well \n- \ndocumented reasons, some young people thrive away from their placing authority but only with access to the required suppo\nrt and access arrangements built \nin.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n10)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI firmly believe that the proposed reforms with regard to inspection frameworks and regulation will have a positive impact upon this\n&#xa0;\n11)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe above will ensure that young people are not placed in Homes which cannot meet t\nheir needs because\n there will be a greater requ\nirement to ensure that the care planning approach is much more robust and \naccountable. It will also ensure that the Home’s Statement of Purpose\n is adhered to and that any issues\n of i\nnformation and care planning are \nhighlighted and corrected before a young person takes up residence. Again, this means that the Home will be able to work very closely with the LA and be very comfortable that the young persons needs and outcomes can be supp\norted.\n&#xa0;\n12)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis will only work where there is a recognition that a place in residential care is not a last resort as mentioned before, but is the right place for the young person to live, grow up and develop. \n&#xa0;\n13)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLikewise, as the young person moves towards\n independence;\n it is crucial that this is planned and well thought out by the professionals concerned. Moving unsupported out into independent living can completely wipeout any positive outcomes and progress made whilst in the care of the Home’s teams and \nrelative security. If a young person is to leave the \nregulated \nresidential ca\nre provision on their 16\nth\n birthday, they must be well supported and there must be a strong belief that this is in their best interests. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n14)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current consultation on the workfor\nce is also encouraging .The ongoing long term aim is definitely to be a provider where our workforce is highly experienced, has the necessary skills and has overall stability within a culture of \npersonal and professional development. The exp\nectation is tha\nt they should \nreceive a professional wage for this skill set. However, the figures need to add up salary wise and hence ensure the quality of care is that which is required\n. T\nhis means \nan \nunderstanding that where a specific set of skills \nare required \nwith \nregard to “upbringing” tied into the young person n\needs,\n this has\n to be funded appropriately. \n&#xa0;\n15)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI fully agree that it is important that a residential care team has all of the relevant status, competency and experience to understand the intricacies of how t\no support a young person’s journey through care without constantly having to look for outside support and this means that they are going to have to have access to continuing learning and development whilst in post,\n \nas well as the motivation to access this \nand the recognition that this is a career path which has merit.\n&#xa0;\n16)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI make this point because it won’t matter what qualifications or experience a worker has if there is no stability or continuity for the young person in the care placement \nand\n the opportunity to work to affect change is very limited. Continuity and appropriateness of placement is the only answer to better outcomes and this is proved again and again where we do have young people p\nlaced for optimum\n lengths of time where relations\nhips can build and affect positive changes t\no young people’s life chances. \n&#xa0;\n17)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to this, t\nhe present \nfeeling of \nvilification of the sector \nas interpreted by the popular press \nis unhe\nlpful with regard to raising the \nstatus \nof the residential care w\norker, \nas is the unhelpful stance that all private providers are \nonly \nin it for the money\n and don’t care about the level of care they offer which is patently untrue. \n&#xa0;\n18)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis \nis particularly unhelpful when trying \nto recruit staff into positions \nwhich hold hu\nge levels of responsibility and \naccountability\n. They\n are working with some of the most \nvulnera\nble young people in our society, in one of the most heavily regulated sectors.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n19)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll of this must be swept away before there i\ns any hope that a r\nesidential \nw\norker \nwill st\nep onto this career path and \nwork towards specific vocational qualifications with an eye to their future, notwithstanding \nthe issue of appropriate wages.\n&#xa0;\n20)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn conclusion therefore, for those young people who are identified as needing the care a\nnd support from a nurturing and supportive environment within a children’s Home, this must be viewed positively by those with responsibility\n,\n \nas a means to \nhelp to \nbuild resilience and a way to move forward positively with the realities of life in the comm\nunity and wider society.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n21)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRelationships are key and where young people in our care ha\nve positively achieved\n;\n this has been \nscaffolded by strong, nurturing \nenvironments \nwith boundaries and \ncarers with \naspirational\n expectations. This can only be achieved with stability from placement length and staff teams\n and an understanding of the value that such a place to live and develop can be a positive and motivating experience not just a final attempt at making it work wit\nh all its associated barriers.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
