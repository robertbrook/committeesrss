[[[Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP]]], Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 

[[[Lord]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Freud, ]]]Minister for Welfare Reform, 

[[[Howard Shiplee CBE]]], Senior Responsible Officer for Universal Credit, and 

[[[Mike Driver]]], Director General for Finance, gave evidence.  

[[[Q1 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I welcome you all to this evidence session, which is entitled “DWP Annual Report and Accounts: Universal Credit and DWP Statistics”, which is a bit of a mouthful.  Obviously, we have not yet seen the accounts.  I understand that those are going to be published tomorrow, but I also understand, Secretary of State, that you have agreed to come back to address the Committee on the wider aspects of the accounts on 3&#xa0;February.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Indeed.&#xa0;

[[[Q2 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I ask you, first of all, to introduce yourself and your team for the record, please?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes.  Obviously, I am Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.  Howard&#xa0;Shiplee, who is with me on my right, is the person who essentially is the senior reporting officer on Universal Credit; he came in back in July when we last came to explain to you.  He has come from the private sector where one of his last jobs was to deliver the Olympic&#xa0;Park.  He came in to do that, delivered it early and under budget.  Lord&#xa0;Freud is the House of Lords Minister, but also Minister for Welfare Reform and deals a lot with Universal Credit.  Mike&#xa0;Driver is the finance officer at the Department and has been involved in all of this issue around Universal Credit finances, etc. and I thought it would be useful to have him here as well.&#xa0;

[[[Q3 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I thank you very much for coming this afternoon?  We have been trying to hold this session since September, initially on the statistics.  The importance of the Universal Credit element of today’s session has somehow grown in magnitude since the original intention, but if you do not mind, we will start with the Department’s use of statistics.  We have questions that should last about half an hour and then we will move on to the issues around Universal Credit.  The two are not disconnected in any way.  Can I begin by asking what you say when the UK Statistics Authority Chair said that Government statistics should be used as “a torch not a crutch”, to enlighten the debate rather than to prop up a position that has already been agreed and adopted?  Are you satisfied that your use of statistics is aimed at shedding light on DWP activities rather than just gaining support for policy reforms?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I am, and I think that this is borne out by the reality of the fact that we have published, over the period that I have been there, over 500&#xa0;statistical releases.  We have also started the innovation of ad hoc statistical releases, which we were congratulated for by the UKSA.  They said that the Department for Work and Pensions statisticians have established a page on the Department’s website to provide links to additional statistical analysis and the Authority expects all other Departments not currently doing so to do so likewise.  Our relationship with the UK Authority I think is pretty good.  We try to publish as regularly as possible and we try to stick to the strictures that are laid for the publication of that data.  We try to sell a positive message and I know there have been issues around some negativity with regards to sickness and disability benefits, but to try to counter that, a few months ago we started a campaign called Disability Confident.  We had a big conference in central London, brought a lot of the groups together, also a lot of employers, trying to get them to understand what the needs are of disabled people in employment, to try to counter any negative messages.  That is rolling out around the countryside at the moment, so that backs up some of the use of statistics.&#xa0;

[[[Q4 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Is it not true that the UK Statistics Authority was very critical of your Department’s use of statistics and said that they have had more complaints about your Department’s use of statistics than any other Department in this Government?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, but with respect, Chair, I have had two letters.  One was about something two years ago concerning something about the use of them on immigration, but they let that one sit.  The last one was where we had a discussion around the use of the way I referred to those going back into work on the back of the benefit cap.  They said that whilst we could not prove that they had gone in or could not prove that they had not, but I should therefore not make the link other than that I believe it to be the case that those people are going back into work is hugely to do with the fact that we introduced the cap.  That is my belief, but they said that that should remain as a flat statistic, which we have accepted.  However, as I said, there were 500&#xa0;releases and although they get complaints—and they will get a lot of complaints now because people want to assume that we are saying some of the things that are reported and we are not saying those things—the reality is, my understanding is, that they are very satisfied.  They are satisfied with the way that we run that and that we are doing this in the correct way.&#xa0;

[[[Q5 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] We have some questions coming up about specific queries around statistics, but can I just push you a wee bit more on to what extent not just the things you say, your Ministers say, but the things that come out of the Department, or, indeed, some of your Party colleagues say, which have gone into the press around the statistics or the misuse of statistics.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Can you specify “colleagues”, Chair?  Who are you referring to?&#xa0;

[[[Q6 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] I was thinking of the Chairman of the Conservative Party, who used the statistic that 900,000&#xa0;people had given up their claims to disability benefits rather than go through the test, which Ms&#xa0;Gilmore will show was a completely false statistic.  I appreciate you say that you do not control editorial policy, but there certainly have been comments to the press that have conflated statistics, have not put them into context and has led to a great deal of fear and alarm amongst the very people you say that you want to support, those people who have disabilities.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]:  Can I just, first of all, say that that was made clear at the time by the Statistics Authority that what the Central Office did with these was exactly that, conflate them, but under no assurance from us should they have done that.  We did not and have never given them that idea of those figures and we would not have done so.  That was something that they put together and released themselves.  In fact, I was not even aware that they were going out with the comment at the time.  It is not in our interest for that, because that just raises an issue about statistics and then we have to defend ourselves again.  However, as I say, these were not statistics that were published by us.  They had pulled two things together and conflated them, as you say, but it is not us.  I have had conversations with him and with others about being careful to check with the Department: if they are going to say something about the statistics that are out there, they should check with us that those are the statistics that can be correctly used.  There has been an element of that since then, so there has been less of that going on.

[[[Chair:]]] Okay.  I will bring in Sheila&#xa0;Gilmore as this was something she pursued.&#xa0;

[[[Q7 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Thank you, Secretary of State.  In April&#xa0;2013, there were statistics published about DLA claimants and you were quoted as saying, “We’ve seen a rise in the run-up to PIP.  And you know why?  They know PIP has a health check.  They want to get in early.”  Stories to that effect then appeared in various newspapers, but in fact two&#x2011;thirds of those new claims are from children and pensioners who would not be affected by PIP and there was a fall in the number of claims made by working age claimants.  Therefore, would you accept now that that description, which was your description, was misleading?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, but it is taken out of context, because of course it was in a conversation about why some people may or may not have continued with their claims.  I was not referring to absolutely everybody; I was referring to specific groups.  There are other reasons as well; I have always been very clear about that.  The reality is that we have not had any upheld complaint on that particular issue to us from the Statistics Authority, so if somebody wants to come and take it up with them then I am happy to get that in full context.  I do not have the exact context of the discussion or the interview, but I seem to recall that that was done as part of a process of explaining why some people may not have gone ahead with their claims.&#xa0;

[[[Q8 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Would you accept that you achieved headlines at that stage that made it sound as if people were rushing to claim a benefit to get some advantage?  That was the headline that was raised through that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I neither sought the headline nor did I write any headlines.  I am not aware of any headlines on this, by the way; you will have to show it to me, I am not completely aware of it.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] I think we can certainly do that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: However, the honest truth is this was part of an interview and conversation but it was in a wider context.  I have had no complaint about that before, to be fair.&#xa0;

[[[Q9 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Further to that, ESA statistics are published—and have been throughout—about the number of people who are awarded the benefit both before and after appeals.  It is these statistics that are often used to make judgments about whether the benefit is working or not.  In a letter dated 2&#xa0;November to myself from the then Disabilities Minister, it was stated that the before appeals statistics already took into account reconsideration, which is informal appeals, in fact.  Does this not give a misleading impression of how many decisions are subsequently overturned?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No.  I am trying to remember the thing you refer to.  If I recall correctly, we then did not publish data on appeals because we were out of sync with the Justice&#xa0;Department, whose responsibility it is for that appeals process and figures.&#xa0;

[[[Q10 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Secretary of State, can I just stop you there, because that is a separate point that I also wanted to ask you about.  The point was what is counted as a before and after appeal figure, and in the figures for before appeal, when contrasted with the figures of after appeal, reconsiderations are counted in the before appeal figure.  If a reconsideration overturns the WCA, then it surely should be added to the number of decisions that are subsequently overturned.  It is not right first time.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I am satisfied with the way it is done at the moment.  As I say, if you think that there is a better way to do it then I am very happy to look at that.  If you think genuinely this does not help, I am very happy to entertain that, but I have not seen any representations on that particular point come across my desk or been advised to me by our statisticians in the Department.  However, if you are concerned about that, I am always happy to look at it, but as I say, I have not seen it so far.&#xa0;

[[[Q11 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] I certainly think one of your Ministers is clearly aware of this, since I have had some correspondence about this and I am disappointed that you are not aware of it.  Are you aware that the statistics that are published for after appeals are only for new ESA claims and not for the migration, so again it is a partial picture that is being given?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: My view is that we publish all the data that is relevant on all of the appeals, but the appeals issue is, of course, the job of the Justice&#xa0;Department because they deal with all the appeals.  We extrapolate from their data.  All the data that exists on the appeals process is published through the Justice Department, so for anyone wanting the full and complete level of data, it sits on the Justice Department’s website when published.  The point I made earlier on, because I know you have raised this point before, we did not publish some data on the appeals for the very simple reason that we got out of sync with the Justice Department.  We will be back in line with them next year and will publish those figures together, but they are extrapolated from the Justice Department’s own figures and they do the work on this.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Those statistics that were missing from your October release, which I think are going to be available in January—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: They will be.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] The UK Statistics Authority did comment that your Department could have drawn public attention to that and given the reasons for it.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes.  Maybe if there is a criticism at all, we should perhaps have said it, but it just was simply on the basis that we were publishing ahead of them and we could not, therefore, refer to their data because it would have been wrong to have done so and we would have received a rebuke from the UKSA.  My sense on this is that we did the right thing.  Could we have drawn everyone’s attention to it?  Maybe, but the reality is that that data is available eventually on the Justice&#xa0;Department’s website and I think it is quite important we only extrapolate from that to put it on ours.  They publish all of the data around appeals, so anybody who wants that could have gone to the Justice Department’s website and taken that data.&#xa0;

[[[Q12 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Would that include the separate data for the migration cases?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: This is my understanding, but I will have to check back on that because I am not responsible for their data.&#xa0;

[[[Q13 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Do you think it is appropriate that the DWP do publish that separately, since you publish some of the information?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Let me have a look at that.  I will go and have another look at that again.  As I say, it all comes off their database because they are the ones publishing this data.  We publish what we think is relevant to our area, but anybody who wants to get more data can of course go to the Justice Department’s website and pick up anything they do not find on the DWP’s website.&#xa0;

[[[Q14 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Just to clarify, Minister, in terms of the statement that Sheila made before in connection with the remarks saying that there was a surge with the introduction of the new PIP and the abolition of the DLA had had a “closing-down sale” effect: that was in The Mail on Sunday and it was by your Minister for Employment.  You also made a similar statement in the Daily Mail.  However, most importantly, Minister, I am just concerned that you are suggesting that the conflation of data is a matter of conflation at Conservative Party headquarters.  Is that right?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The specific case that was being referred to was, in fact, nothing to do with the Department.  The Conservative Research Department or whoever puts that stuff together draws it from Department data.  We have made this point clear to all my colleagues and we, vice versa, accept all of this.  The reality is that what we publish is the data and it is very clear and there should be guidance in there as to what you should and should not be able to use the data for.  We have obviously discussed this matter and I have tried to get my colleagues at Central Office to make sure that they check first before they put any statements out about the area the DWP covers, because it is complex and can sometimes be misrepresented.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Okay, so the four statements in two weeks were just an error and the—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]:  I do not know.  That is something you will need to speak to the Chairman about.  My general view on this one is that if they have made mistakes on this then those mistakes have been taken up with the UKSA, but with regards to the Department, we did not have any discussion with them on this.  This is something they chose to add to their own briefing data, so they have to carry the burden of that responsibility themselves.  

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] This is just an issue then, as I say, of interpretation of data and it is occurring there.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, because the data that was published was absolutely correct and accurate by us and I have not referred to it in that way at all when I saw it.&#xa0;

[[[Q15 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Can I then move on, if that is alright?  This is related, although it may not sound as though it is to start with.  A former JCP advisor with over 18&#xa0;years experience across Manchester Jobcentres has told me that benefit claimants are being deliberately set up to fail in order to meet sanction quotas without regard to natural justice or their welfare and this is contrary to the Civil Service Code.  He says he has tried to raise this issue with managers at all levels, including with Neil&#xa0;Couling [DWP Work Services Director] and even the whistleblower helpline, but each time has been rebuffed.  He told me the ploys that are used include making appointments for claimants without telling them, so they are marked as no shows and it is times they do not attend within the five days grace period and so they are automatically sanctioned.  We know that 5% of JSA claimants are sanctioned every month and this has escalated since the end of last year when the new sanction regime was brought in, but the informant believes that this is only the start and this is distorting statistics.  We are hearing that there is distortion of statistics after they are published.  What he is saying is there is distortion of statistics as data is being collected.  First of all, were you are aware of this?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I am not aware of that and I have to say that I would like to see his evidence for that.  With respect, he is making an allegation about some of the incredibly hard work that job advisors do—

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] And he was one of them.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Maybe he was, but there are always one or two people who have a different view operating in an organisation.  I happen to believe, unless it is shown to the contrary, that people who work in Jobcentres do a very good job, they work very hard and they apply sanctions within the rules.  I have spoken to Neil&#xa0;Couling on this on a number of occasions.  He has looked at almost all the allegations that come through and on every occasion he has said he cannot find a reason to doubt the fact that people are operating in exactly the right manner.  Now, if there is an allegation that has a scintilla of truth in it, we will investigate it and if anybody is found to be doing this—&#xa0;

[[[Q16 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Would you be prepared to meet my informant?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I have no problem with meeting any informant, but Neil&#xa0;Couling is the man who should meet him first and I am very happy to talk to him if he is concerned.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] He has asked and, as I say, has been completely rebuffed at every stage of management, going against the Civil Service Code in terms of the deliberate distortion of data.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Okay, but with respect, this is a huge organisation.  It employs tens of thousands of people around the country who every day go into their jobs—

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] People are too frightened to come forward, Minister.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I do not see why anyone should be frightened to come forward, because nothing is going to happen to them if they come forward and tell us that there is an issue, if such an issue exists.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] That is not the position.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: My point is that you are giving me one individual in an organisation of many tens of thousands of people around the country.  When I visit all these organisations, what I observe most of the time is that they do an incredibly good job in very difficult circumstances.  Yes, if he has an issue to raise and if he thinks it is a problem both in the way that he was working, but maybe if it is endemic then we want to know about it.  We investigate all of this and Neil&#xa0;Couling will do that because it is his job to front up to all of that.&#xa0;

[[[Q17 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] My final question: with the debacle of Universal Credit and this, do you really feel that you are in control of your Department?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith:]]] Yes I do and there is no debacle on Universal Credit.  You give me one issue that you have raised—

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] One issue that is affecting millions of people.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, no, you have raised one individual as a case and we had this, with respect, on the statistics and I keep coming back to this.  We have had 500&#xa0;statistical releases and there have only been two occasions when the Statistics Authority has had to correct what I or my Ministers have been doing in three years.  Therefore, with respect, I disagree on both counts.&#xa0;

[[[Q18 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] There is another issue where statements have been given that appear to be based on statistics and have been given very recently.  At both the last DWP questions and at the Select Committee when the Employment Minister was here only a few weeks ago statements have been made saying that half of young people between the age of 18&#xa0;and 25 who do work experience get jobs.  Has there been any evaluation carried out since the very first pilot, which was about 1,300&#xa0;people, because I have not seen anything published and yet a statement is being made to that effect?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The real point is that around half come off benefits and then there is further work done about how many people stay in sustained work.  I do not have those figures in front of me but—&#xa0;

[[[Q19 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Has an evaluation been carried out?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, we evaluate the whole time.&#xa0;

[[[Q20 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Is that going to be published?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, we will be publishing full evaluations rolling as we do on every single area and every programme.  The reality is that the work experience programme has been remarkably successful, far more successful than any of the other programmes or schemes that were in existence under the previous Government.&#xa0;

[[[Q21 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] When a general statement of that sort is made, would you not expect the statistics to already be published and the evaluation to be published?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The figures are there available; I am very happy to ensure that you get them.&#xa0;

[[[Q22 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] The last press release that came out from the Department on benefit sanctions had the headline “Benefit sanctions—ending the ‘something for nothing’ culture”.  That was the headline put on the Departmental press release.  Is that not an example of an erroneous view of people on benefits, that somehow they do nothing for it and there is a public belief that people in receipt of benefits are not entitled to them or get too much?  Is that not a problem when those kinds of headlines are written?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The fact is that if you have sanctions, they are imposed for a reason, and they are reasons to do with people’s failure to comply with the strictures that they agreed to when they drew Jobseeker’s Allowance.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] That is—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Can I just finish on this one because, with respect, I have listened a lot to what is being said and moaning about this.  I just want to answer this question of the Chair’s—

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] We are representing people—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Ms&#xa0;Abrahams, you have had a fair crack at this.  Let me answer the Chair’s question.  If somebody is sanctioned, my view is that advisors impose those sanctions as a last resort when they think that somebody is not complying with what they are meant to do, maybe not doing enough to seek work, not turning up for appointments, not taking interviews or even making an effort to find those jobs.  For the most part, they are there to say we cannot go on letting you just take the money and not do what you were meant to do and I think that is really, in essence, the contract.  Therefore, it is a fair statement to say that this is the case, that in fact that is what the sanctions are there to do.  However, I would also remind you, Chair and the Committee, that under the last Government similar assumptions were made about the sanctions regime throughout and it was, in fact, an ex&#x2011;Labour Cabinet Minister who was the first to refer to shirkers versus workers.  Therefore, with respect, I think it is a two&#x2011;edged sword.&#xa0;

[[[Q23 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Secretary of State, do you consider that someone who on one occasion is 10&#xa0;minutes late for an appointment should be sanctioned?  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No.&#xa0;

[[[Q24 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Does it concern you that that sanction was then overturned on reconsideration?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I think that the advisors do their level best to implement a sanction as and when they think it is the last resort.  I have sat on many occasions inside Jobcentres watching and listening to them as they have to apply these sanctions.  They do not do it easily, but what they do is they recognise somebody there who is not co&#x2011;operating.  I can just simply say that when people accept a benefit like Jobseeker’s Allowance, in a sense, it is a contract.  They may not be in work, but they are in work to find work, in a sense, because the taxpayer is paying them that money to support them, but they have expectations and it is a conditional benefit, so they need to understand that.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Therefore, one late attendance—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I am not going to deal with one particular case, but what I am telling you is the vast majority of cases, I would think, that are imposed are correct and are done as a last resort.  I have a huge amount of faith in Jobcentre staff.  I think they do a brilliant job up and down the country.  They have done a huge amount to get difficult people back into work, to find work for those whose morale has been a bit lost because they have been out of work for a while.  They put in huge hours and genuinely, we can always find one or two cases, but the reality is I think they do very well.&#xa0;

[[[Q25 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] We are going to move on now to questions on Universal Credit.  We obviously will not see the detail until we see the accounts published tomorrow, but you have written the Committee a letter today, which seems to indicate that £40.1&#xa0;million of Universal Credit software assets have been impaired in total; I think that means written off in layman’s terms.  Can I just ask: is that the final write off for the existing IT or is that just the write off up to this point?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Of course, if anything goes wrong going further forward that might be different.  However, can I just say, Chair, in answer to that particular question, which is important, that we have had to sit for some time while a lot of bogus nonsense has been talked about huge levels of additional write offs.  This note in front of you absolutely finishes that and ends it.  The reality is what our estimate was earlier on when we first put it into the NAO and this total figure are very close together.  This has been one of the most complex and detailed assessments that has taken place either in the private or the public sector and it is now signed off and tomorrow will be published.  The reason we put it on the table here is because it says something else in there that is even more important, which is that the asset that we now own that will take Universal Credit forward is worth to the Government £151&#xa0;million.  It is quite important to recognise it is not just about the write off; it is that we own an asset that will deliver Universal Credit, something that has not been reported on.I wonder if I could just bring Mike Driver in to explain how that has been done, so that you can understand fully what this write off is about.&#xa0;

[[[Q26 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] That was not quite my question.  My question was “is that the final write off” for the asset.  We have detailed questions about the rollout to the different groups, but my understanding is that there is a new IT system that is being developed, so what is the position with the old IT?  It is not being written off now because it will be used—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: With respect, it is not old IT.  It is the IT that we were developing to roll out UC and it will go in and roll out UC through that, but perhaps I can ask Mike&#xa0;Driver to explain the details of how that one works.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: I will answer your question as well, Chair.  You are absolutely right our accounts will be laid in Parliament tomorrow, but importantly, Amyas&#xa0;Morse, the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG), has certified those accounts and he has given us, in terms of Universal Credit, a clean audit opinion.  Therefore, what we have is an intangible asset of £152&#xa0;million.  That is £125&#xa0;million of software code and £27&#xa0;million of licences.  If I could just break that code down for a moment, we have done a very detailed review with the Government Digital Service as well as our IT colleagues within the Department.  That has shown that £34&#xa0;million of that code will be fully used in any ongoing digital solution.  That leaves £91&#xa0;million of software code that will be used in the solution that we have until digital is implemented.

[[[Chair:]]] Therefore, that does mean that once the new digital solution comes in—

[[[Mike Driver]]]: If I could come back to that; there is a bit of a story to this.  What that means is that, as I say, we have an asset of £152&#xa0;million and we have impaired £40.1&#xa0;million.  If you cast your mind back to the Public Accounts Committee, we said at that time that we had an impairment of £34.4 million and we might impair more, we have: a further £5.7&#xa0;million.  As I say, importantly, the NAO has given us a clean audit opinion regarding the carrying value of our assets.The point that you make about the future is that we have recognised that, as we move forward and we implement the new digital solution, the assets that we have in place will be amortised or devalued in a shorter period than we originally anticipated. 

[[[Chair:]]]  Therefore, it will be written off year on year.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It will be amortised; that is the term.  We will write it down over a five&#x2011;year period as opposed to a longer period.  Now, I would argue that the way in which we had set our accounting policies previously to write down software code over a 15&#x2011;year period was almost certainly too long and one of the things that we are discussing with the NAO separately is the way in which we apply accounting policies towards software code as we go forward.  However, the important thing that I would want to stress to you is that not only have we done an impairment review to determine whether or not we have value greater than the carrying value of our assets, we have also done a value-in-use calculation.  We have looked at the asset that we have and have used the Treasury Green Book methodology to determine what net present value or what value to the taxpayer we will obtain from using that asset and it is substantially more than the value of that asset, even taking into account the write off that you describe and any further investment that we might have to make into that asset as we move to other elements of Universal Credit.&#xa0;

[[[Q27 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] As we are going to be talking about the digital solution as opposed to the present IT, I wonder if one of you four gentlemen can explain to me the difference between the existing IT that has been developed to date and what is being presently rolled out very slowly and the digital solution.  I want it in terms that a layman can understand, please.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Can I bring a layman in to talk about it, Howard? 

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: When it comes to IT I am a layman, so I can perhaps help, but we have a lot of IT experts as well.  If we just look at what we have, what we have been building is what I would call a conventional system.  It has a lot of heavy hardware, a lot of hard drives, just as your home computer does.  It has big memory banks, all of which you have to procure: you either have to rent them or you have to get licences to use them.  That is a conventional system.  It is being developed on what is called a waterfall approach and that is quite important too when we compare it with digital.  Waterfall is about establishing what it is you want to do at the very beginning, writing out a lot of very detailed specifications—

[[[Chair:]]] Of course, you did not start with waterfall; you started with agile. 

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: If I may, where we were was with a little of both, to be frank.  There was some waterfall and some agile being used.  What we now have is a situation where, as I said some time ago, there is considerable utility in what has been developed.  We are developing that further now by using a more traditional approach in terms of developing that software and we are going to expand that, as you know, first, into couples and then into children.  When you look at the digital approach, it is very different.  First of all, the digital approach relies not on large amounts of what is commonly known as “tin” in computer circles.&#xa0;

[[[Q28 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Sorry, is known as...?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Tin—boxes.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: You design the boxes, you build them and then—

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Black boxes, for want of a better word.  Instead, you use what is called “open source”, so you go onto the web and use mechanisms on the web that allow you to store and access data in that environment.  The advantage of that over time is it is much cheaper to operate, it is cheaper to build and it is cheaper because you do not have to pay large licence fees for it.  That is one of the important issues.&#xa0;

[[[Q29 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I just ask: why did you not do that right from the start?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: One of the issues here is you have to bear in mind that technology is moving very rapidly.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: It was not available when we started.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Exactly.  Two and a half years ago such things were not necessarily available in the way they are today.&#xa0;

[[[Q30 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] With respect, I am not certain it was two and half years ago, but the Secretary of State told this Committee that the system that had been set in place then was working.  It clearly was not, because it has had to be changed so often, so what is working now?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The system that was being built then and the system that was deployed in pathfinder is working.  I was in Hammersmith last week sitting with one of our agents watching her using the computer; the system works.  

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Why then are paper and pencil still being used in certain—

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]:  I did not see any paper and pencil on the table at all.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] The Committee has.&#xa0;

[[[Q31 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] The functionality that was originally promised under Universal Credit—the ability for claimants to manage their own accounts to report change of circumstances—none of that is working in the present system at all.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: That is correct.

[[[Chair:]]] It probably never will work in the present system.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: In my view, it would be inappropriate to use it.  One of the issues in the early days was that there was within UC a mantra of digital by default, which said that everything should be digital.  When I was here last time you asked about this and I explained, from a security point of view, to have everything digital is not, at this stage of development, a sensible or appropriate solution.  It will take some considerable time to get to a totally online system.  In fact, nobody is operating the types of system that we are talking about, which are effectively dispersing large sums of money.  No one is using a totally online approach.  You have to prove who you are; you have to prove what you are doing when you change circumstance.  If you want to open a new bank account, you have to go and present yourself.  I have talked to a lot of financial institutions about these things and that is exactly where they are coming from as well.

[[[Chair:]]] Therefore, when it was promised that all of this digital by default was going to happen that was a false promise.  That was never going to be delivered.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]:  It is very difficult to talk about promises.  There is nothing wrong in having aspirations.  If people do not have aspirations to achieve things then there will be no progress.  Perhaps that was an aspiration a little too far at a stage in time.&#xa0;

[[[Q32 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Will it be possible and in what timescale will it be possible under the new digital solution?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: One of the issues that is very important to me is that we do not do exactly what you are trying to get me to do, which is force a pace that is unrealistic.  From a digital development point of view—and we might want to come back and explain a little more about how that works—the first thing is to make sure that it is not put under excessive pressure.  That is why we are building on pathfinder, we are building on the existing IT, which I said some time ago had substantial utility and thus it has proved to be, so that we can roll out the system, we can start taking on more complex claimants, we can expand it geographically and we can expand in numbers.  All of that is about learning, both for our agents to learn and of course for us to learn more about how claimants behave.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] On the issue of digital by default, when did the Secretary of State accept your assessment, because up until the point of change—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I think I can answer this.

[[[Q33 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] I will finish the question, if I may.  On the issue that you have raised, up until quite recently the Secretary of State had lauded digital by default, not only for the system delivering the benefits, but also as a way of teaching people who had no computer skills to become computer literate.  That has been the mantra right up until now, so when did he accept your information that the existing system was not going to work and it had to change?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That is not what he has recommended to me.  If I can explain to you—

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] The question is directed to Mr&#xa0;Shiplee.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: He can answer this question, but I need to answer when.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] No, I would like his answer first.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: You asked a question about when did I know.  The answer is the reason I put the red team report in back in 2011/12 was because I had concerns that they were attempting to do too much on the digital front.  However, notwithstanding that—and do not confuse this, because you are again conflating something here—the fact is that we have a system that is online.  It will be rolled out online, they will access it online and it will do the thing that you are talking about, which is to help people who then seek work to find jobs where they have some kind of computer requirement, because they will come into this system online and make their application online and then further changes in due course will come through development.  The point is, back in 2011/12, this is the reason why I said I feel that this needs to stop and pause when I put the red team in and they said this is being overly ambitious in its attempt to be completely digital by default.  There need to be some changes, because the security aspects of this would not work in line with what they were trying to do.  That is when, first of all, the late Philip&#xa0;Langsdale and then Howard has come in to look at this and Howard can explain to you how his recommendations were driven, but the system, the equipment that we are talking about is equipment that works.  The question is how far you allow people to access it online.  That is the question.&#xa0;

[[[Q34 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Just before you answer me, Mr&#xa0;Shiplee, could I just point out to the Secretary of State that in September of this year you informed the House that you had taken over almost exclusive control of this system that you were bringing it in on time and on budget and it was still digital by default.  We are now three months away from September and apparently the whole system has changed and now Mr&#xa0;Shiplee is telling us that digital by default is not going to deliver.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: It has not changed; Ms&#xa0;Jackson, I am sorry, no, it has not changed.  The point I was making was within the timescales and within budget we are delivering a Universal Credit solution and that is exactly what Howard&#xa0;Shiplee has proposed.  We could not do it if the equipment that we were building was not capable and working.  The point was made—you might have missed it—we had an asset of £152&#xa0;million.  That asset is the very equipment that works and that is what he is building this system on.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] No, Secretary of State, it is not what we missed.  It is apparently what you missed.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, with respect, Ms&#xa0;Jackson, I do not think you understand what was being said.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] You told us in September that the system was working.  We are now told that it is not working—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, it is working.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] —and the number of people who are going to go through the pathfinder is minimal.  Perhaps you would like to answer my question, Mr&#xa0;Shiplee, if you can remember it.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: You are conflating so many issues here it is almost becoming risible.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I think I can.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Fire away.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The first thing is that digital by default, as far as I am concerned and my direction that I was given, went away a long, long time ago, as the Secretary of State has mentioned.  

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] He did not say that.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: From the red team review.  I am sorry, but that is my understanding very clearly.  The second issue is it is working.  There is this constant suggestion it is not working.  The system works.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Now, it works for a limited population at this time.  It has the capability—

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] The easiest one.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes, indeed.  With the greatest respect, would you start with the most difficult in pathfinding?  I do not think so.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Maybe Glenda Jackson might, I do not know, but we think this is common sense.&#xa0;

[[[Q35 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Why?  We have constantly warned about those being the most difficult cases.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: That is a very different point.  Indeed, the very fact that we are saying let us learn and move forward and not disturb the most difficult cases until further down the process is a much more sensible approach to take.&#xa0;

[[[Q36 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] However, it has taken a long time to come, has it not?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I am not going to comment on that, I am sorry.

[[[Chair:]]] I am going to interrupt now, because we do have detailed questions on the rollout and the detailed cases.&#xa0;

[[[Q37 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Kwasi Kwarteng:]]] Could I start with a question about timing?  To me, it is clear that something can work but take time rolling it out more fully, which seems to be your position.  However, I wanted to ask a question on this.  What timeframe are you looking at in terms of being able to present your revised business case for the IT to the Treasury, when you get approval for any new IT?  What timeframe are you looking at to get the thing done, as it were?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]:  We intend to place a business case before the Treasury in the early new year.  That is our intention.  In terms of what we are currently doing, as I was explaining earlier, we will start to roll out in the new year, first of all, some improvements to pathfinder.  We know there are some issues that can be improved and we want to implement those.  We already have approval from the Ministerial Oversight Group to implement those.  We will then move immediately to start work on couples to develop and finalise a set of software, which is already highly developed and, in fact, was in test at the time everything was stopped at the earlier part of this year.  We can almost take this off the shelf, do some more testing and we will then implement that in the early part of summer.  Later, towards the autumn, we will then have been working on children, which means we can take in families.  What we want to do—to lead through to your total question—is to assess how well that goes in terms of our conventional system and then we will assess what the next steps are in terms of where we go next.  The next steps are likely to be in volume terms as we start building up volume to better test the system.  In parallel with that, it is right to say we are also working on the digital solution, which you might want to come back to.&#xa0;

[[[Q38 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] You are moving seamlessly into this set of questions.  Can you just run us through that comment about the software was nearly written for couples?  I assumed it would be the same software as for single individuals and you just unlock a few more boxes on it.  It sounds like it is a completely different piece of code.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: It is exactly the point that was made before.  The potential for claimants to change circumstances, for things to change: the more that occurs the more complicated it becomes and therefore the next stage is to work on couples.  That will be a complicated issue.  Couples come together, they divide, they then have children, things happen.  This sort of software is not something that just gets done on the back of a cigarette packet.  It is complicated work in writing a lot of code.  It is also interpreting many hundreds of pages of policy detail: that is what happens in certain circumstances.  This is by no means a five&#x2011;minute exercise.  It is fortunate that that piece of work had reached a level of maturity.  Now, it is right to say that the level of maturity of similar work for children was not that far advanced and it will take longer for us to prepare that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I wonder if could just bring Lord&#xa0;Freud in, because it is something that he was working on originally.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: I just want to make the point there is a lot of jargon around using this word “digital by default”.  We are building a digital system.  We are building a system where people interrelate with it initially on computers and will continue to do so.  In practice, we are building the second generation system for smartphones, because the use of that technology is taking off at extraordinary speed.  Indeed, even on pathfinder technology we are finding a lot of people interacting with it on handheld devices, including phones.  Therefore, when people say, “Oh, it is not digital by default” that is a very minor issue that there are some things we cannot afford to do digitally because of security reasons.  As Howard said, that is something that we are doing in common with banking services, for instance, which would always test whether you have someone at the other end or whether you have someone trying to defraud the system.&#xa0;

[[[Q39 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] I am sure we will come back to that, but Mr&#xa0;Shiplee, can we just pursue that stuff about couples you were on about?  My understanding was that the individual was a relatively simple situation currently with Universal Credit.  Once they are in—I think the awful phrase “lobster potting” was used or something—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Couples are also in at the moment.  There may be some confusion about this: individuals that come and form couples stay in Universal Credit, so already they are being dealt with within Universal Credit and other changes as well.  Therefore, it is not as though it cannot deal with couples—it can—but what Howard is talking about on this is that for the expansion through the volume, the developing of what was pretty nearly completely developed for couples is finalising that and then rolling that out so you can start bringing couples in as couples rather than because they became couples when they were originally singles.&#xa0;

[[[Q40 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] I am just trying to equate the last two answers on that.  It sounds like the software for couples was not yet fully tested and yet the current system is able to cope with couple situations now.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: There is a very limited number of couples and therefore we are dealing with that manually at the moment.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] That is being done manually, okay.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Then, for the volumes, you need to bring the IT in.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Okay, but you have not had to bounce anybody out of Universal Credit because they got too complicated.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: No.&#xa0;

[[[Q41 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Do you know roughly how many of those 2,000&#xa0;people who have claimed have formed couples?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I do not have any figures on that.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We do have some figures, but we are not releasing those figures at this stage.  However, we do have examples of people who have gone through health and disability issues, have had children and childcare issues.  We have had some moving to partners caring.  We have gone through all of those in relatively small numbers, but we have been able to track through how it works in terms of Universal Credit.  Just to take an example of one of the more complicated cases we have had, we had a claimant who met a partner who had a son; they wanted to move in together and they therefore needed to move house and he had his own son moving in with them over the weekends.  The new partner was in receipt of income support.  What we got out of that rather complicated example was a partner claim, a child, a termination of tax credit, a termination of income support and a change of address.  We were able to work that through, in policy terms, on a manual basis to find out how all those systems work in live.  It is vital that we do that by example, because then when you build up the IT you have seen how it works in practice with a small number before you go into the maximum.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The IT is, as you know, automation.  That is what we are dealing with here, so you take what would otherwise be manual and it becomes automatic through the system that Howard is talking about.  There is no mystery to that.  Therefore, the lessons learning how they interrelate hugely helps with the final finishing off of those elements of IT that take the next couple.&#xa0;

[[[Q42 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] If somebody acquires housing costs that they did not have before, what happens?  Is that paid as part of the Universal Credit?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: There is a misapprehension that I notice some people have.  Housing costs are incorporated in the pathfinder.  The only element that we would not let people in on is if you have a mortgage, but if you have rental costs those people are in on the pathfinder.

[[[Chair:]]] Unless they are in temporary accommodation.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: Not in temporary accommodation, absolutely right, although we now have people in temporary accommodation.&#xa0;

[[[Q43 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]]  Can I just clarify what you mean when you use the word “manual”?  You said that you work through these in policy terms manually.  In other words, it is not being done by the computer.  The final payment might be done by a computer, but all the working out is not done by a computer.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We have elements that we work out.  We can read the RTI feed, for instance, but we just make sure when we run it that it is being done correctly through the computer. 

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: This is the point that Howard Shiplee is talking about, that the next phase, couples, is to get the automation on couples out and then, as we are doing that, the further development for automation of couples with children and then you start to look at bringing in the tax credit elements as well.  That process is what the plan that we have laid in front of the House does, testing at each stage that what we set out to get is evaluated so that it does deliver that and then you move on to the next phase before you roll that out.  Each one is tested in turn.  That is the new process and certainly how it should be.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: This is why the accounting is important here, because what we have said is that we have an asset that works, it is working in a live environment.  What we are talking about though—and I think it is important to get this across— is that we are talking about a pathfinder; it was designed to flush out these issues.  Therefore, the process that Howard is taking forward is to test and then to learn and then to implement and continue through that cycle.  If we need to update our software as a result to add to that, we will fix that, which is a normal way of doing IT business.&#xa0;

[[[Q44 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] When you are talking, next summer about bringing couples in, will that be in a big bang to all the pathfinders, or will you just start with one and slowly pick them off around the country?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The big issue with all this is safe and secure, as has been said many times.  Therefore, we will start progressively and move through the various locations of pathfinder, setting the pace on the basis of a safe and secure way to go forward.  If things are going well, then we will speed the pace up.  If we are hitting some hiccups, then we can just slow the pace down.  There is no question of any big bang approach.&#xa0;

[[[Q45 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] When you say move to more of the North West of England, what does that mean in that context?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]:  It means ultimately we would go to a region.  We have about 90&#xa0;offices in the North West.  That will provide a basis for rolling out to a larger number of offices.  That will massively increase the number of claimants being dealt with and it is also starting to test the system at substantial scale.&#xa0;

[[[Q46 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Are you visiting that when you have got happy with couples and happy with children?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Then you will go to the whole region.  That is the phased approach.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Then you look to bring in—providing that works—the tax credit stuff into the North West, so you set up a sub&#x2011;country, as it were, in the North West so that they eventually become Universal Credit.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: There is one more element that we need to test very carefully, which is what we are calling the JSA tail, the people that we have excluded because they are quite complicated—in many cases vulnerable people.  We need to make absolutely sure that we have carefully gone through each of those types in small scale before we go into a region.&#xa0;

[[[Q47 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] When do you think you will have the region?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Our intention, subject to the safe and secure, step-by-step approach, would be towards the autumn and the early part of 2015, but that is absolutely dependent on the progress we make during next year.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] That is the autumn of 2015.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: No, 2014.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] A year’s time.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: If we believe that is working well, then we start that process to other regions moving out, so that we complete the process on a regional basis.&#xa0;

[[[Q48 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] That is quite an acceleration, is it not, from starting this year with individuals, taking until next summer to get couples, to then children and a whole region by the end of next year?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I do not think so.  After all, we are also building a system.  One thing is rollout, another is building the system.&#xa0;

[[[Q49 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] How many people do you think will be on UC by the time we get to that first region coming on in a year?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]:  At the moment, I do not prefer to give any numbers.  We have to go step by step in the way we have said.  Our statisticians will establish what the numbers are and as we go forward we will be able to explain in more detail what that is going to look like.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] You must have a view surely, by the time you have couples and children on in a year’s time.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The furthest I would go is that it will be into tens of thousands and, importantly, because of the volumes it will start to give us a greater level of accuracy on the statistics that are being produced, which is quite important coming back to a previous question.&#xa0;

[[[Q50 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Just one last question from me.  The Statement last week suggested a bit of slippage on the full implementation date.  However, for full implementation—but for those very difficult few hundred thousand—are you still thinking, in your own words last time, the opening ceremony is still 2017?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes, I think that that is the case.  You mentioned that we have already said that certain groups will flow past that date and that is sensible, but the intention is that the old system will be closed to new claimants by that time.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: By 2016, in fact.  The Universal Credit, as it were, on that plan, as Howard says tested and evaluated, but Universal Credit as an entity and the other benefits shut down by 2016.  However, the group that you are talking about is the support and WRAG groups of ESA; that is the recommendation that he made, because they are going through quite a lot of change at the moment anyway.  The reality is that they have the least amount of work requirement placed on them.  There is no conditionality in that group and the view was that they are going to take a little longer to get used to this process and so, frankly, the others are all work related but this group is less so and is likely, therefore, to have to be handled with some care.  However, ESA, as it were, as a benefit will have closed down and new entrants will be on Universal Credit as they come in, not those who have been there for a while.  Some of those have been on for a long time, as you know.&#xa0;

[[[Q51 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] What is your assessment of the likelihood of hitting that as your opening ceremony date?  Is that a best case of the range or is that mid-case now?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]:  It is what we believe is the practical point of the range.

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] It is not the most optimistic scenario; it is realistic.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: No, I think it is realistic.&#xa0;

[[[Q52 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Dame Angela Watkinson]]]

[[[:]]] This is clearly an extremely complex and ambitious process and as it rolls forward it will capture more and more groups of claimants.  As it moves towards completion, you will be then having the most challenging cases to deal with, people with constantly changing circumstances and so on, which will probably be its biggest challenge.  Can you estimate a figure as a percentage of the whole of the body of claimants of those who are extremely complex?

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We are embarking on what is almost a parallel UC exercise in the Local Support Services Framework currently with local authorities and housing associations and other key—particularly third-sector—groups exactly to start flushing that kind of thing out.  What we are doing is creating a series of partnerships in the various local areas to make sure that the vulnerable people are supported in the way that they need to be.  That is going to be a major exercise.  We are embarking on a series of trials of the Local Support Services Framework and we are combining that with a major testing process for UC itself, so those two will come together.  This is a lot of work going into that particular area for that particular reason.&#xa0;

[[[Q53 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Can you confirm, Secretary of State, based on what Sheila was saying before that the Office for Budgetary Responsibility’s Economic and Fiscal Outlook Report indicates that you will not be able to deliver the full quota of claimants that was indicated on time?  It indicates that 700,000&#xa0;claimants are not projected to join the programme by the end of 2017.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I will just reiterate what we were saying earlier on, which is the group that you are referring to—and this may shrink as a group, because there is a natural change in circumstances particularly from the work&#x2011;related activity group, which is part of ESA.  There has been a decision made—in fact this was a recommendation that Howard and his team made to me—that this is a group that, if you wanted, you could accelerate them in, but that would be too difficult because they are a complex group.  In fact, the Committee itself has made—

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] It says 700,000&#xa0;will not be joining.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: They will be on the benefit that they are on at the moment.  They key thing is it is this Committee that has made this recommendation.  In fact I think, Ms&#xa0;Abrahams, you made that recommendation to us that we should be very careful to ensure that those vulnerable people are dealt with not against any artificial timescales.  In fact, I think I have a quote from you on that.  It is only fair to say that due recognition is being given to that, so we accept that.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] It is the reason why the delay, Minister.  It is not a question that you are considering now, at this late stage, this vulnerable group.  It is now because of the delays with the programme and we need to be very honest about that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Let us be very honest about it.  This is a very vulnerable group and, as I have said, they need careful attention and I would not want to rush them through.  We have to look carefully at how we do it, because this is a group, particularly the support group, which is going to have no work expectation placed on them at all.  Some of them are obviously very sick people.  Some of them have been on this benefit for a long time and will not be expected at any stage to change their circumstances—highly unlikely.  It is only fair to say this is a group that is going to take a little while to get through into this programme, but ESA will exist.  Those claimants who would otherwise be claiming ESA will not be claiming ESA.  They will be claiming Universal Credit, so there will be people who would have been IB to ESA will now be on Universal Credit long before that point, because they will be coming on sometime around about 2016.&#xa0;

[[[Q54 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can I just be clear?  People who are already on UC, because of the way the lobster pot works, could turn out to be ESA claimants, but they will not pop out of UC.  Once they are in they are in.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That is right, which will include some of this group, which is why we do not know what that exact final number may be, because they may be swept up in households that include people like that as well.  My point is that this is a recommendation quite rightly made; I have no objection to that at all.  I think it is reasonable to say that of all the groups this is the one that most of all probably needs serious great care and attention when we are doing this.  Universal Credit is aimed at getting people back to work and to get that whole process of back to work established and in work support and reward.  This is the group that is not going to be conditioned by that at all, so they are the group that will be slowest to come in.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: One of the things that we have learned from the two major sets of trials that we have done—

[[[Chair:]]] Sorry, there is a division in the Lords.  Therefore, Lord&#xa0;Freud, I understand you have to leave mid flow.  I am sorry to interrupt you, but if you do not go now you might miss it.  You can tell us when you come back.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: I shall come back.  I will be lucky to get there.&#xa0;

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] On the 700,000&#xa0;who may not go into Universal Credit, the most complex, the most vulnerable—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The plan is that they will, but they will take longer.

[[[Q55 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] How will they get their housing benefit?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We will deliver their housing benefit separately for them on the basis of their being outside the Universal Credit.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Therefore, local authorities will have to maintain a housing benefit—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: There is a budget for that, but it depends on how fast we bring them in.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] However, local authorities, instead of winding down their housing benefit section, which is what they are planning to do, will have to keep a small housing benefit section to pay the housing benefit of the people—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We will support that for the process of the time that it takes to move them over.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] You will fund that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We will support that, yes.  That is the plan.  We already have a budget allocation for that.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Okay, because local authorities are very worried about the slippage on this.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: They are and we are in discussions with them right now on the basis of the plans.  They have been fully discussed with them.  &#xa0;

[[[Q56 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Secretary of State, I appreciate you, Lord Freud, others, and Mr Driver and Mr Shiplee have been talking about doing things step by step.  Secretary of State, would you share my slight exasperation that—if memory serves me right—we were recommending a more step-by-step thing two and a half years ago.  At the time, I think it is fair to say that the Department did not feel it was necessary to take that on board.  Would you appreciate that, certainly me, the Chair and the then members of the Select Committee were advising or cautioning against going at it fast?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes.  The truth is that in 2011, the more that I looked at it, the more that I was concerned that we probably needed to be much closer to that approach.  It was why I put the red team report in, because I was concerned about the nature of the trade-off between security and the online ask.  That is why we then took the decision once I had that report.  I stepped in to do that for that very same reason that I was concerned about that nature of the rollout.  Since then, the rollout that both Philip Langsdale before he sadly died and Howard, who has now come on, were talking about is along those lines.  Remember, we introduced the pathfinder back in 2012.  It was not in the original system.  That came off the back of the red team report, which was that we needed to do more testing on the way in.  The pathfinder was introduced in 2012 on the back of my decision to reset.  Then the rest of course now you are hearing about is the plan to take that constant testing, evaluation and then implementation forward through the expansion of the pathfinder and then eventually the full rollout of Universal Credit.&#xa0;

[[[Q57 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Mr Shiplee, prior to this you had a very important delivery role at the London Olympics, which was an enormous success but must have been very complicated.  How are you enjoying yourself at the DWP?  

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I am enjoying this afternoon, if that answers the question.  Thank you for your concern.  The answer is this is very challenging.  On a personal basis, this is an area that is very new to me.  I think I might have mentioned when I was here last time that, when I was asked to do this, one of the things I was very conscious of was the work that we did on the Olympic programme in the socioeconomic areas to help people into work.  I just think this is just an extension of that, but on a much greater scale.  It was very challenging on a small scale; it is very challenging on a scale of this size as well.  After all, when was there last such a fundamental change in the welfare programme in this country?  &#xa0;

[[[Q58 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] My mother used to use a phrase that, “Too many cooks…”  One of the stories that the media has been reporting a fair amount is that even someone with your considerable project management experience sometimes has been getting a bit exasperated when perhaps other Government Departments have been interfering in trying to do things.  How do you cope with that?  How much of a barrier has that been in delivering?  I share the Secretary of State’s view on the importance of this; I think it still can be a game-changer if it works.  However, is there any truth in the fact that there has even been a stage where, in the not too distant future, you have said that to the Cabinet Office or possibly another “if you do not stop interfering I am off”?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I cannot comment on tittle-tattle that I have not heard.  What I can comment on is that occasionally one has disagreements with people and one has to get on with things.  I am charged with having a sense of urgency about these things and I make no excuse for that, but there are no other issues that are holding me up.  Indeed, I was talking to Cabinet Office colleagues only a week ago about assisting us to move some issues forward.  Treasury, equally, has been extremely helpful in helping to move things along quickly and expeditiously, if that helps.  &#xa0;

[[[Q59 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Thank you for that.  You obviously share the view of the Secretary of State and many others of the importance of this.  I am absolutely certain that you would have had your back to the fire in learning the complexity of the DWP and the whole benefits area.  My question was slightly tongue-in-cheek, but there was serious intent underneath it.  You are the delivery guy.  The Secretary of State’s head is on the block if it does not work, but so is yours as someone who is a very experienced delivery individual.  How confident are you, on a scale of one to 10, that Universal Credit will be delivered and delivered on scale—even if it is step-by-step, which I actually always supported, so I do not have too much of a problem that you have step-by-step because it is such a complex area—to the huge volume that the Secretary of State has always said it would and has wanted it to be? 

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I have never been very keen on one-to-10s, so I will just give it to you straight.  I believe that Universal Credit can be delivered in the way that has been suggested.  What we are talking about is automating a system.  We are talking about automating a system in terms of technology, but what is in many ways much more important is the cultural change, the change in the way our business operates and all of these things that tend to get completely ignored in these sorts of discussions.  The technology is the enabler that will enable the systems to work in a more effective way.  In my view we have not fully faced many of the challenges yet.  We will face them as the business is reconfigured and as tens of thousands of our staff are retrained.  We are already retraining people; 25,000 people are being trained at the moment in terms of claimant commitment alone.  There is a whole series of challenges, but can it be delivered?  The answer is there is no doubt in my mind. &#xa0;

[[[Q60 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Will it be delivered?  

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I believe it will be.  I think it has to be delivered.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] For it to work, and the key underpinning philosophy behind it that I have supported from the beginning is to make work pay.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Exactly.  

[[[Q61 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Absolutely.  On that basis you and I know—and I was in business for many years before I went into politics—that for this to succeed it needs scale.  It needs the very scale that the Secretary of State has been talking about ever since the beginning.  It needs to be those hundreds and hundreds and millions of people.  Are you confident that will happen?  Over a period of even a slightly extended timetable, with your considerable project management experience, are you confident that that will happen?  

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The answer to your question remains the same.  I believe it can be delivered and I believe it has to be delivered.  I believe it has to be delivered.  As you have rightly said, it is very challenging and it is very difficult.  No one is arguing with that, but I think the answer is that the Department considers itself up to the challenge and they are going to make it work.  &#xa0;

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] If we appear somewhat sceptical about promises it will all be fine.  

[[[Graham Evans:]]] We are not; you are.  

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Justifiably so.

[[[Q62 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] If some of us are sceptical—you are not sceptical—it is because of the way these numbers have moved all the time.  At the moment the OBR report is suggesting that the caseload in 2015/16 will only be 400,000 and then it is predicting a big jump up in the following year.  On each occasion when we have had Universal Credit on our agenda these numbers have slipped very significantly.  It is not just the people off the back-end, post 2017: it was 4.5 million in March that were expected to be in Universal Credit by 2015/16.  The OBR report is now suggesting it is only 400,000.  Is that not really a very substantial slippage?  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: My view on this is first of all, as I have said before, the way we are doing it is different in the sense that one of the big concerns that I originally had—which is the point I made earlier on about the way it is being planned—was that we were doing a lot more front-ending of numbers so that we were rolling out to large numbers much earlier on in the original plan.  One of the things that alarmed me at the time was this déjà vu about the tax credit problem, which was they did pretty much that.  They did large numbers very early on and then the system did not cope.  

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Why in March of this year—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Can I just finish?  

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Secretary of State, you have talked about what you did two years ago before.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: You have asked me a question, with respect, Ms Gilmore; can I just answer it, and then if you want you can come in—

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] It is a very specific question about the difference between March and now.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I am trying to explain the reason why.  When we went for the reset, part of the reason for that was to do it in a different way, which is what Philip Langsdale and now Howard have been recommending.  We have the system set up, we bring in enough volume and all the complexity to test so that we understand how the system operates and works, and then you start putting the larger numbers through towards the latter stages because you understand how the system will work under stress with those numbers.  Back as we said at the time, when I reset, we were waiting for that final deliberation to take place, which is what I brought Howard Shiplee in to do and complete.  That is why we have only just put out the note about how we will roll this out.  That was the reason why.  

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Since March—that is because of the reset.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: This report has been—

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] It does put a lot into 2016/17.  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: Effectively, you cannot do new numbers until you have new numbers.  Basically, we were looking at an old set of numbers until we could revise them, almost by definition.  One of the things that we have tested well in the organisation is how you start a big programme—and we have more than 50 change programmes going on—and how you get them to work.  We do that by going very carefully and slowly with small numbers and testing the system.  Then you do your volume, as the Secretary of State has said.  We have learnt that lesson, whether it is the benefit cap, child maintenance or the introduction of PIP—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: All of them we have been working on in a similar way.  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We have done that in that way and that is a change.  It is a change that was initiated with the red team review process over the last couple of years.  &#xa0;

[[[Q63 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Are you concerned that the OBR says that, given the delays and the scale of migration required in 2016/17, there is clearly a risk that the eventual profile will differ significantly from the one that you are giving now?  That is what it says in the report.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: With respect, the OBR is making a statement of the obvious, which is that there is always a risk in every single plan that you put forward.  &#xa0;

[[[Q64 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] It is hardly supportive, is it Minister? 

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Unless you live in a different world than I do, all IT programmes always carry an element of risk.  All change programmes carry an element of risk.  We are rolling out five separate programmes of a very similar scale.  They are not exactly the same, but on every one of the programmes that involves IT—the PIP and DLA changes, the CMEC changes, the introduction of the cap—of course there is risk.  We are rolling them out in exactly the same way, which is we pathfinder them first, then we check with new entrants and then we start loading those that were on originally.  Throughout the process we find—with tweaks, changes and alterations, sometimes a little bit of a delay and sometimes a change—that that is the way to do it.  In a sense, what Howard Shiplee has recommended is nothing more than common sense is the right way to do it.Honestly, this is what we believe.  You have just heard the SRO say categorically he believes this is doable, but again, as we test, evaluate and then we implement we will be much clearer as we roll further.  In a year’s time when we come back to you we will be in a much clearer position to be able to tell you how we are getting on with the next phases of that.  We will be very open about it; there will not be any change to that.  There is always an element of risk in these programmes—

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] But you have always been surprised by this risk.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Can I just say?  Interestingly enough, in the private sector when they run IT programmes, I was looking back at this—there is always a sense, by the way, that only governments fail on IT.  That is not exactly the case—the reality is that in many of them write off almost 30% to 40% of their IT developments because there are changes inherent with these risks.  In actual fact, what we are doing here is not separate from that.  It is a process that imbibes the same principles, but I believe the process that Howard&#xa0;Shiplee has brought forward is the right one.  The numbers I think you are extrapolating from a bar graph are in fact a sense of where that position will be at that time.  We may accelerate it or it may slightly delay, but that is the real nature of what we are doing.  

[[[Mike Driver]]]: What is on page 134 of the OBR’s report is an expression of Howard’s plan for delivery at the moment.  There is risk, as the Secretary of State has said, but as we go through each fiscal event we will update those workload forecasts accordingly, as we do for all of our workload forecasts.  &#xa0;

[[[Q65 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Can you just remind us how many times it has been revised?  

[[[Mike Driver]]]: I do not know how many times it has been revised.  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We had an initial plan, which was announced out in 2011 and to the best of my memory this is the next look at how it is revised.  We always said that the original plan was indicative; it was our best estimates.  We have learnt a lot and this is now the plan at the end of that process.  &#xa0;

[[[Q66 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] You have also always said how confident you are.  Every time we have raised with you the difficulties of introducing this system and potential risks, the answer has come back from the Department, the Secretary of State and you, essentially, that everything is AOK.  How many times has this system had to be changed?  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: This is it.  This is the programme that Howard Shiplee has brought forward.  

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] You told us in September it was on-time and on&#x2011;budget.  It is now being changed and it has been changed before that.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I was referring to the 2017 date, which I was quite clear about, that in essence it will be delivered by 2017.  This is what Howard Shiplee is saying.  With one exception, for reasons that I think I have made obvious, in essence that is what the plan delivers.  The different way we are delivering it is instead of loading those numbers up front we want to ensure, by testing, evaluation and then implementing, that the systems work for the complex groups before we then start rolling the numbers into it.  That is nothing less and nothing more than common sense, and it think this is the point by the SRO.  &#xa0;

[[[Q67 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Why did you not think that before?  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I did.  

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Well, you clearly did not.  &#xa0;

[[[Q68 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] You can understand why there is a degree of scepticism, Secretary of State, because a year ago you said that in a year’s time you would have a much clearer idea of the detailed rollout.  It is now a year on and you are saying in another year you will have—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, Madam Chair, I am not.  What I am saying here is we have a plan, which the SRO—Howard Shiplee, who has come in from the private sector to do—has worked through.  We have a new specialist IT individual who has come in from the private sector who has signed off on this process.  As far as they are concerned this is the plan.  It is the plan that has been given to me and I adopt that.  That plan is the one that is in front of you.  It is worth reminding ourselves we already have the pathfinder.  We will build on that pathfinder and the way we are doing it does address that single biggest problem, which is that we have to learn from past mistakes.  The past mistakes on this are highlighted by what happened under tax credits in the last Government when it crashed and lots of people were damaged by that.  

[[[Chair:]]] There is slowdown and there is a snail’s pace.  This is much more than any anticipated slowdown. &#xa0;

[[[Q69 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] I have a tactical question, which is important; I know a lot of people will be interested.  When do you anticipate that tax credits, housing benefits and ESA will be brought in to UC?  When is your broad timetable?  

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: We will start some of those in the North West, clearly, and then if you are talking about tax credits it is 2016.  We are in discussion with HMRC at the moment as to what an appropriate timing would be and just what it will look like in terms of the most effective way to start transiting tax credits in.  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: Clearly we will have samples of all those people in quite reasonable scale as we go into a full region in the North West.  That is tax credits, ESA, vulnerable people, people with complicated housing situations and so on.  What we are doing is a major exercise of testing and learning from what we do in that period right the way through next year.  That is looking at three areas.  The first is: how does UC policy actually work in practice?  You find that already we have learnt an enormous amount from just the pathfinder and all the things we have had to change to make the pathfinder work.  We need to look at what actually happens in labour market terms as a result of the introduction of UC and test some of that rather thoroughly.  Thirdly, we need to do an elaborate exercise to get the local support services working, particularly for the vulnerable claimants.  That is a collaborative exercise to set up a series of partnerships in a way that the people are getting the financial inclusion support, the digital inclusion support and the much more holistic support from the districts than we have seen in the past.  There is a real change in how we are going to be producing those services from today, when usually those services have been produced on a service line basis, not on supporting the person as an individual, which is what we are hoping to achieve with the Local Support Services Framework.  &#xa0;

[[[Q70 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] If you take something like housing benefit—which the Secretary of State and my colleague Teresa was just covering off while you were voting—because of the changes, obviously local authorities of all the different persuasions are clearly anxious but recognising they are having to wind down their housing benefit offices, of course, because that is going to be wrapped into UC.  Picking up on my colleague’s question that that set of 100,000 or so—the people in the support group or what have you—are going to be coming in later, clearly housing benefit is going to be really important.  The Secretary of State recognised that, obviously, and said there is going to be a budget allocated.  That is a really important point in the sense that what I would be very concerned about would be, as you got closer, if the Government were to say, “No, we will pass that back to the local authority and you find a discretionary budget to provide that”.  It is really important that local authorities across the UK—certainly England and Wales—can be confident on their housing benefit side in the longer term that that money will be there separately from the local authority budget.  I just want absolute clarification on that.  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We will be having a detailed, longer term migration to discuss with local authorities because it is quite clear they do need to know how to handle their housing benefit departments.  Clearly, one of the things we are testing with the Local Support Services Framework is how that will work in real detail.  As you move from the service lines that we see at the moment to administer housing benefit to the kind of support for people who really find it very difficult, for instance, to manage on direct payments, you are looking at a much more rounded service for those individuals who support them.  To the extent to which local authorities and housing associations are part of that picture of support, that is exactly what we need to get really well-tested-through in the next period so that as we get volumes of those more vulnerable people we know exactly how to look after them best.  &#xa0;

[[[Q71 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] And finance whatever that service may be.  The point I am getting at is for austerity reasons, which I understand, local authorities obviously have had their budgets cut and restricted for reasons that we all understand.  I just want to be really clear, as we go into that particular process that you are discussing there, that if necessary the budget or the money will be provided by the DWP and you will not expect local authorities to have to muck in.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We do have a budget line on that.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We will bring Mike Driver on this, because I think you can feel assured on that.  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: Mike, do you want to just take us through it.  

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It will pick up local authority costs under the new burdens regime.  If the Department is causing local authorities to expend money we would pick up those costs.  

[[[Stephen Lloyd:]]] Or to retain its housing benefit officer.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Exactly.  We would have to do that through a blend of resetting the business case or resetting our own budgets in order to support that.  &#xa0;

[[[Q72 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] I keep in touch with the Jobcentre Pluses in my area on a regular basis.  I have to say that the staff that I meet are very enthusiastic about Universal Credit and they were telling me last week that that they are really quite impatient to get their teeth into this.  In addition to the claimant commitment, it is changing the culture and they are keen to help their clients into work on a permanent basis.  I have a couple of questions on the IT because when we went into Greater Manchester to look at some of the pilot schemes they appeared to be working well, but there is concern that the pathfinders will not be able to accommodate 1.9 million changes in circumstances on a monthly basis.  I wondered if Howard could just—

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: What you are talking about is the total number of changes when the system is totally operationally nationally, as I understand it.  It would be unreasonable at this stage of development to be able to say that would be the case, but that is the objective that the digital solution will ultimately address.  I see no reason why that will not be the case.  &#xa0;

[[[Q73 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] You are confident that the system is robust enough to be able to take those volumes.  

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: It has to be, because that is how the business case is predicated.  &#xa0;

[[[Q74 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] Since we embarked on this project, smartphones and the technology that has come out has changed a lot of working lives.  Indeed, the Jobcentre staff were keen for the apps to be on their phones because a lot of their clients are on those.  Is it possible for the work you are doing now to seamlessly go into an online app on smartphones?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: About 85% of claimants currently are using those types of devices.  They are not using conventional computers in their homes.  However, one also has to bear in mind that the claimant group we are talking about would be much more conversant with those sorts of devices.  There is an issue going forward.  It is very easy to jump to conclusions and make the assumption that everyone will therefore use their mobile phone.  I do not think one should jump to conclusions.  I was in a Jobcentre last week sitting in on a claimant interview with a 50-year-old who was not computer literate.  One of the powerful things I thought about that was that, through the digital Jobcentre initiative, where there are 6,000 terminals being rolled out across the country, he was immediately offered within a matter of days to come in and spend a number of hours where he would be helped to understand how to use a computer and how to get online.  That is quite helpful, not just because it is a means for him to access Universal Credit, but because there are sometimes opportunities to buy things online that are cheaper than one would buy in the normal course of events.  One has to be very careful one does not make an assumption that everyone is going to be using those devices because there will be people who will not be capable, so there is a balance.  The point you make also reinforces a previous point, which is that technology is moving on all the time as well, and very quickly. &#xa0;

[[[Q75 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Graham Evans:]]] Just on that point, I accept totally that not everybody is going to be on smartphones—and a 50-year-old is a good example, as a 50&#x2011;year&#x2011;old.  In my constituency the local authority works very closely with Jobcentre Plus and we have something called the work zone, which accommodates exactly that sort of age group to help them apply for jobs.  I have a wonderful example of a Waitrose store that opened in the constituency and enabled exactly that sort of age group to apply, successfully in many cases, for those outstanding jobs.  Have you analysed the growth of the smartphone and the groups that will be using that in the next few years between now and 2016/17?  

[[[Lord Freud]]]: The standard figures that the Government Digital Service is now working on say that the use generally has gone up: 30% of access on the internet is now through smartphones.  It is growing like that, which is the reason why we are now designing the enhanced solution, the digital solution, for the smartphone.  That is the design base.  The secondary issue there is about the digital inclusion agenda—the 50-year-olds—and we are putting a lot of effort into that, not just in the local authority pilots, but in the digital deal that we are supporting.  Again, there are a lot of very interesting developments that are being trialled through.  I went to one a couple of weeks ago at Queen’s Park where A2Dominion is trialling a system whereby they get youngsters, students—the cut-off age is 45, so older people at 45&#x2011;plus are paired up with students and get that help onto the internet.  It is all of those areas, with tenant blocks looking to put wi-fi in; we are putting wi-fi into the Jobcentres now.  It is not just internet access devices: it is actually a wi-fi process.  With all of those things now we are really beginning to get something rolling on digital inclusion.  

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I have two other points very quickly.  One is that the Committee can come and see the development that is already in existence in Victoria Street.  We are very happy to show them that to see how that will now easily transfer into apps and things like that.  The second thing is that we have brought Kevin Cunnington [as Director for Digital Transformation] in, who is an IT expert who was with Vodafone before.  He is really smart on this area, if I can possibly use that.  This is part of what he is also doing, which is to drive this on to a new level of ability to be able to transfer to these areas so that people can use them.  &#xa0;

[[[Q76 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Dame Angela Watkinson]]]

[[[:]]] There is an excellent partnership working going on between the London Borough of Havering and Jobcentre Plus.  I had a letter just today about the reduction in JSA unemployment in east London.  This is from the east London district office and it reports that, in particular, in Havering the 18-24 JSA claimant count has decreased by 7.8% between September and October this year, with a 29.8% reduction from October 2012 to October 2013, which is very good news.  It is, however, at variance with the Department’s statistics, which report “The majority of new claims are for unemployed people aged under 25” in the pathfinder areas.  How do you interpret that difference in statistics?

[[[Lord Freud]]]: The way we have designed the pathfinder is to get single people and, almost by definition, with relatively straightforward circumstances, so the bulk of people are in the 18-24 group for the pathfinder.  The most interesting point that we are establishing in the pathfinder in that way is the attraction of Universal Credit for this group is, clearly, because it is an in-work and out-of-work benefit, they get the equivalent of tax credits when they are in work, so they get something that they do not do under JSA.  It is a very attractive benefit for people under 25, for that reason.  It is a huge encouragement for getting them into work.&#xa0;

[[[Q77 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] We have had two big reports this year from the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee.  The Secretary of State, certainly, has described these as “entirely historical”.  Why do you think the National Audit Office felt the need to be so critical, if you were, in fact, already acting on all of these issues?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Because, as I said at the time, I fully accepted what they said.  I have not made any effort to change that at all, and I fully accept that.  My only assumption is that the information that we gave them—the reports were mostly based, first of all, on my red team report.  In fact, there are direct quotes from that as regards what can be done, so that was very clear to them.  The second part of it was further work to be done to look at—and this is isolated, really, with Universal Credit—some issues surrounding control of suppliers and some of the accounts flow.  That was all made available to them as well.These were issues that I had set the whole process in train back in 2011-12 to look at, because I was concerned, specifically, about the nature of the way that UC—it is peculiar to say—has become standalone and isolated within the Department and, therefore, was not utilising some of the knowledge and strength that existed within the Department.  There were elements about that, and that is why their report was critical, but, as I said at the time, every one of their recommendations in the NAO report had already been implemented, because they were recommendations hugely taken from those reviews that were already made.  There was very little, I felt, that was new there, but I fully agreed with what they had laid out in that particular report.  Most of that evidence came, I felt, from our internal reports.&#xa0;

[[[Q78 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Did you accept the description of a “fortress mentality”?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That came from the red team report.  That was a direct quote and I did accept it.&#xa0;

[[[Q79 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Do you think that officials are now able to be completely frank if there are problems?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, but they always have been able to be frank.  I think what happens sometimes is that, if something is not quite going according to the way you anticipated it, sometimes there is a tendency to say, “I need to do more work to correct it.”  Then you do more work and it is not quite right, so you throw a little bit more work, and you do not want to say, sometimes, “We have a problem here”, because you think that you are going to resolve it, but sometimes there is a big policy issue locked in there.  That was what the red team report was referring to: that some of the issues and problems around that balance between security and the online ask needed to have been discussed again and again, much more than perhaps was the case, and that is where the “fortress mentality” came from.  In all the other programmes, however—PIP and the others—that has not been the case and, as a result, problems have been flushed right up to the top very early on, so that we can deal with them and we can put whatever resources are necessary behind them.&#xa0;

[[[Q80 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] I just want to clarify: in terms of the red team that is constantly being referred to here, what date did that start its work?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I asked that to go in back in 2011.&#xa0;

[[[Q81 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] When did it report to you?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I am happy to send a note on that one, but I think it went in right at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012.&#xa0;

[[[Q82 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Are you saying, therefore, that, when the NAO reported earlier this year, it was reporting on something that was nearly two years behind?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That we had already started the reset on, which is why all the recommendations had already been adopted under—&#xa0;

[[[Q83 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] What happened, then, between early 2012 and 2013?

[[[Lord Freud]]]: My memory, I think, is that we had the report in around mid-2012.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, the report actually came to us about July, I think it was—finalised in July—which reported back to me, if that is what you are asking.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: Then we made changes through the autumn, with Philip Langsdale taking control.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That is when we introduced the pathfinder process, for example, which is part of the recommendations made by the red team.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: But there is an elaborate history that the NAO report does go through, so you can see the exact dates and you do not have to depend on our memories of the exact dates here.&#xa0;

[[[Q84 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Are you suggesting that the NAO report is of no use to us because it was so out-of-date?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, quite the contrary.  All I was referring to was it is a historic report, because we had realised, because of that red team process and the PricewaterhouseCoopers process, which we then initiated, already we had been aware there was a problem, which is why I put the team in.  Their report directed me to where that problem was.  Philip Langsdale—a highly experienced, brilliant IT man, but also an experienced programme manager; he had delivered Terminal 2 at Heathrow, for example—immediately, when he came in, took that and said, “I know what we have to do to make the changes and we will do more work next year”, which is what Howard Shiplee has done.To do the rest of the rollout, we will need to look at that as to the way we change it, and that was what was set, except that he died in December and I had to spend two to three months finding a replacement for him.  In the meantime, we were then working with David Pitchford from the Cabinet Office and the programme side from the MPA.  What he was doing was saying, “Alongside that, we need to look at a new digital process and see how that can bed in”, so we did a proof of concept on that while the team and Howard Shiplee were looking at whether we can roll this out in a better way as well, at the same time.&#xa0;

[[[Q85 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Do you feel that that should have been made more public, even at times when you were, for example, coming to this Committee?  I do not think it was as obvious, as it is now being suggested, as it should have been that many of these issues were already being tackled as early as 2012, which is what you are saying to us today.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I accept the observation.  Maybe we should have been a little bit more obvious about it, but I was bound on setting to go and get this sorted out in a response to the Committee report—not the Committee, but the report of the team.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: We gave a very clear picture of what was happening to this Committee in July, when we were talking about—

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] In July.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: In July this year, yes.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] That was in July this year, but what you are telling this Committee is that you were already working on that long before the NAO reported and, therefore, had discovered these problems, which was a long time before July.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: It was.  My view was we had a responsibility to ensure that we reset this and got it right.  It has always been my impression that we would turn to the Committee to be able to explain what we are doing and why, which is what I believe we did do.  To be fair, following the sad death of Philip threw a few months out on that programme, because he already had a plan, we then had to review it and that is where Howard Shiplee came in to complete that.&#xa0;

[[[Q86 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] Are any of the recommendations that the NAO made proving challenging?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The recommendations that they made are the ones that we had, fundamentally, agreed with, and had implemented pretty much all of them.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] So none of them were challenging.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Everything is challenging at the end of the day.  This is a complex programme.

[[[Sheila Gilmore:]]] If you were already implementing them—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Implementing them is not the same as saying they are not challenging.  The whole reset programme is, of course, like everything else, a challenging process, which is why, in the case of Howard, I went out to find somebody from outside, like Philip Langsdale, who had the experience of these complex programmes and delivering them.  That is the key.  That is why I went outside, so that was part of the recommendation, really.&#xa0;

[[[Q87 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] I have a few queries, if I may, Minister.  It does not quite tally with the NAO report in terms of what you are saying.  They are saying that the NAO was asked to come in in February 2013 by the Major Projects Authority, because they did not have confidence.  Even though you said that you—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: February?

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] 2013.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That is right.&#xa0;

[[[Q88 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] But you are saying that, at the end of 2012, you were starting to get things under wraps, but they were not convinced.  They said they had serious concerns that you had no detailed blueprint and transition plan for Universal Credit.  That was in 2013.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: They were the recommendations that we were trying to address at the time.  When the MPA came in—

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] But they did not have any confidence in you and they asked—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Let me just finish this answer.  The MPA came in.  I specifically asked at the time for David Pitchford from the MPA to come and take charge of the programme, because of the death of Philip Langsdale, and it was in that interregnum that I said that we needed somebody else to come in whilst we searched for that other person, and the MPA report was linked to that request, and that is what I asked him to do.  At that stage, the MPA would normally come in anyway at the beginning of the year, but, as they came in, I said to the Cabinet Office Minister, “I do need somebody to be able to help reset this programme and complete that process of a new blueprint”, which is exactly what they did.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] That is not quite what it says here, Minister.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That is what happened, let me tell you.&#xa0;

[[[Q89 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Before he so tragically died, had he alerted you to problems in the system?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: The whole point was the red team report, first of all, was the process of alerting us to what I had been concerned about back in 2011.  I was concerned about what we were asking and what the original plan was: whether it was deliverable in quite the frame that it was and whether they were dealing with some of the issues and problems that were arising.  I come back to the point of the difficulty being between the online solution and the security elements.  This is a very important area, because this is the first time that Government will be doing and putting such a lot accessible online.  Security was a very big issue at that stage and I think they got bogged down on that, which is why I then asked the red team report to look at it.They came back with recommendations about what to do.  Philip Langsdale then took that report and did more work on the programme, and he was the one that made the decision and said, “We need to start the pathfinder.”  The reset had begun with the pathfinder decision, and then he said, “The next phase is to look at the equipment in detail and figure out how, then, we can roll out using the equipment as it is and whatever we do not need to use”, in essence, which is what Howard Shiplee has been doing since March.  That, however, in the meantime, was taken forward by David Pitchford, but he was looking specifically at that stage also at the digital solution, which was a new idea brought to us at that time by Digital Services.&#xa0;

[[[Q90 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Thanks, Minister.  Can I just follow that on, then?  One of the key issues that they found was around ineffective Departmental oversight, as we have just heard, so that the governance arrangements within the Department were seen to be ineffective.  Would you say that that has been resolved now?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, I believe it has.  It is something that you might want to have Howard on, but if I can just clarify one point on this—it is just a note that was given to me, because I was trying to remember the date.  The MPA, back in November 2012, acknowledged that Philip Langsdale was absolutely on the right track in what he was doing.  The reset that I am talking about, which ended up being looked at by the NAO, was critical on the internal structures.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: One of the things that we were challenged on by the NAO and then at the Public Accounts Committee—and we shared a report with the Public Accounts Committee that we asked for from PwC, looking at financial, IT, commercial and programme controls—we acknowledged at the time that some of those controls and some of that governance was not working as effectively as it should.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] “Totally ineffective”, it says here.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: We have been working through those processes.  If you take commercial controls, for example, we now have a dedicated commercial director and team supporting Howard and the programme board.  We have in-sourced some of the work that had previously been outsourced to our IT suppliers, to make sure that we are effectively defining everything that we are requesting.  We have strengthened our three-lines-of-defence model to ensure that, at every level of the organisation and outside of the organisation, we have the controls in place.  We have reflected on the collective and personal responsibilities, for example, of everyone on the Universal Credit board.  As the Finance Director General, I am responsible for not only supporting Howard in the delivery of Universal Credit but also challenging him and the rest of the board, if I do not believe that the control environment is working as effectively as it should.This has been audited recently and the audit is showing improvement.  There is still more that we need to do but we are applying the lessons that we are learning on a constant basis, not only on Universal Credit but also applying that learning across the whole Department, where we think there are weaknesses in other areas too.&#xa0;

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] You mentioned there is still a lot to do.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: “More to do”, I said.

[[[Q91 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] “More to do”—apologies.  Governance and the importance around risk assessment and so on is a cultural issue—cultural issues down to leadership.  Has that been addressed?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: I was going to say that but I think it is for Howard to determine, as the SRO, whether he feels that the governance of the programme is better.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: You might want to say something about how your board structure works.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Forgive me for the short answer.

[[[Chair:]]] We are quite happy with short answers.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Thank you.  Just to add that, in terms of governance, the chairman of the programme board is now completely independent.  He is from outside the Department, although he has worked in Government and Ministries.  That has reinforced the independence of that board in terms of governance.  In terms of risk, one of the issues raised in some of the reports was the need for risk assessment, and we are working our way through that at the moment: the whole issue of how to manage risk and, more importantly, how to identify it in terms of top-down and bottom-up types of risks.  Very importantly for me, we also have an arrangement now where I meet with a number of DG colleagues outside the board on a weekly basis.  The point of Universal Credit may have been seen to be slightly outside the Department in a previous life; it is now very much at the very centre of the Department’s activity.  I am finding a lot of support and help from the Permanent Secretary in that regard as well.&#xa0;

[[[Q92 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] Can I just ask you, then, as part of that, the whistle-blowing procedures are very important.  It does allow risk that has not been identified to be flagged up.  That does seem to have been missed, or certainly, as I mentioned before, the JCP advisor was absolutely told to go away.  What are you doing in terms of whistle-blowing policies to ensure that risk from those sources can be identified?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I think the question was answered, to some extent, before.  I have had no indications of anyone whistle-blowing in the operation at this time that has come to my attention.  Please rest assured, if they do, then they will get a fair hearing.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] I will put them in contact with you, because it has not—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Very happy to do it—

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes, please do.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] He has evidence to show that he has been in contact, but something has happened.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: It genuinely has not got to me.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We would want to see it.  If someone has evidence about wrongdoing, we want to see it.

[[[Debbie Abrahams:]]] I will set that up for you.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Thank you.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Happy to take it.&#xa0;

[[[Q93 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] £34 million in IT costs will have to be written off, but what is the final write-off figure?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I think we have answered that.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: We have impaired £40.1 million, so the £34 million—&#xa0;

[[[Q94 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Sorry, I do not understand what you mean by “impaired” when it comes to money.  What does that mean?  “Down the drain”, one of my colleagues said.  Is it put in a box and only called on when something desperate happens, or what is it?

[[[Mike Driver]]]:  “Impairment” is an accounting term—

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Yes, but I do not understand it.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Which means that what we have said is that there is no use for the code that has been written and, on that basis, it has no value.

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] The code being part of the UC programme.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Yes, exactly.  In financial terms, you have two different types of asset that you can build: you can have a tangible asset, so something like this, or you can have an intangible asset, which is, basically, the IT code that is built to run on the computer systems.  What we have is £40.1 million of code that was built that has no use within the system.  Rather than keep it as an asset, then, we identify that as something that we are impairing, or writing off, because it has no future value.  It is not going to generate an economic return for the Department.  That is something that is standard in pretty much any organisation.&#xa0;

[[[Q95 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] I am really intrigued to know how you could spend £40 million on a code for a programme that you now you decide you are never going to use.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Because one of the things that happens—and Howard may want to add to this—is that, as we develop solutions, sometimes you have to work and rework elements of software development.  This is something that happens pretty much across the industry.  There has been research in the USA from Forrester, for example, that shows that, in terms of the reworking of code, it is fairly normal to have to rework about 30% of that code.  Other colleagues in the US have identified the potential for 40% rework.  In that sort of range, what we are doing I do not believe is unusual in a project of this size.&#xa0;

[[[Q96 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] Were these external contracts or were these codes being devised by people within the Department?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Maybe I need to explain the answer to your question.&#xa0;

[[[Q97 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] If 40% is a write-off, whoever is negotiating the contract is an idiot.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, we are not saying 40% is being written off in this.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Q98 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Glenda Jackson:]]] That is what he said.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No, he said the general industry view is that, when you are dealing with software and you are writing coded solutions for issues and policy problems, it is not an exact science, in the sense that you try to resolve something through a series of code changes.  You go down the road towards that and it does not completely resolve the issues; in other words, what you were trying to do becomes a dead end.  It does not work and you have to go back to square one and say, “We are going to have to look at another way to do that”.  There are a lot of man hours of work that go in to resolving something, which, sometimes, simply does not come to the conclusion you were hoping for when you set out on it.  By the way, that went on long before IT was around.  In building all sorts of things, people reach a point where this process does not work.This is simply costing that: that area, therefore, because it is not going to be used, because it did not work quite the way that they were anticipating, will be written off, because it is not usable on this programme.  Then you come back and say, “There is another way.  We have to try that other way to do it.”  Science is littered with this; industry is littered with this.  The nature of it is that, sometimes, some solutions in areas do not quite work as you had anticipated.  You have to rethink that process.&#xa0;

[[[Q99 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Mr Driver, you mentioned earlier the £40 million being written off, and you mentioned the £91 million that is going to be written down over five years.  Does that not mean that £130 million will be written off by the time the policy is implemented?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: There is a difference between those two amounts.  The £40 million which is written—

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] The £40 million is unusable.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: The £40 million is not usable.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] The rest is just a capital write-down.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: The remaining £90 million will be written down over a five-year period but, through that period, we will also gain a benefit from using that as well.&#xa0;

[[[Q100 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] That is the software cost, but we have heard mention of new appointments and reports written by PwC.  Where in the accounts will those costs be?  They will not be in the software-writing costs, will they?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: No.  If you take the work that we have used PwC for as an example, that will be within our administration costs, because PwC are our audit partner, so we brought them in as our external audit partner.&#xa0;

[[[Q101 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] When we are looking at the costs of this Universal Credit, there are costs other than software costs.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Yes, there are.&#xa0;

[[[Q102 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Will we be able to identify those in the accounts?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q103 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Because you can understand that this session is meant to be DWP accounts, Universal Credit and statistics, but we do not have the accounts.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: I think you are having a session with us on 3 February on the accounts in detail.&#xa0;

[[[Q104 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] The accounts will nearly be ready for the next set of accounts.  31 March is your year end, is it not?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: We would, in most instances, like to lay our accounts before the summer recess each year.&#xa0;

[[[Q105 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] As the finance man, can you tell us why the accounts are so late?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Because we had an issue with the impairment of Universal Credit, which we have been talking about and—

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] So, it was down to write-off.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: There was an issue of significant, we believe, public interest in getting that right before we published our accounts.  But when we sat with the Public Accounts Committee in September, we had identified that we felt that the impairment was going to be £34.4 million and, beyond that, we felt there was some uncertainty about the accounts and we might have to impair something like an additional £12.5 million.&#xa0;

[[[Q106 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] This figure that we are talking about—the write-off—is as at the end of March 2013.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It is.&#xa0;

[[[Q107 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Is there a further write-off from then to now?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: No.&#xa0;

[[[Q108 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Your management accounts, then, show no further—

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Our management accounts will show an impairment of £40.1 million for Universal Credit.  We have not written down or amortised our asset beyond that, because it only went into live running on 29 April, so, in our accounts for 2013-14, we will show how much of that asset is written down in those accounts.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: As you would with any capital programme.&#xa0;

[[[Q109 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Thank you.  And the accounts will be published tomorrow.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: They will.  They will be laid with Parliament tomorrow, so both the Permanent Secretary and the C&amp;AG have signed the accounts.&#xa0;

[[[Q110 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Minister, there has been a lot of debate about the timetable for Universal Credit.  There has been concern that maybe it was going too fast, and then it was going too slow.  Have you, at any time, issued a ministerial direction to the Department?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: On what?

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] On the timetabling.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: I have actually issued no ministerial directions to the Department on anything, but certainly not on timing.&#xa0;

[[[Q111 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Did the Permanent Secretary ever request a ministerial direction?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: No.&#xa0;

[[[Q112 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] There will be no ministerial directions published along with the accounts tomorrow.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: None whatsoever.  At the PAC hearing, it was made quite clear that Ministers were completely sanguine about timings on this.  We agreed with the original proposals put forward and laid out, but at no stage have we ever sought to accelerate or change those timings arbitrarily, at any stage.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It would be an accounting requirement for us to declare any directions, and there are none.&#xa0;

[[[Q113 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] We have waited so long for these accounts; I just wondered if we were going to get any more surprises.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Do not worry.  There are no surprises; nothing like that.&#xa0;

[[[Q114 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Mr Shiplee, you are in charge now, as I see it.  There are two different types of IT project: there is agile and waterfall.  Could you explain the difference?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: I thought I had done that before, but certainly.  waterfall, as I have said, is something whereby we would start off with a very clear specification.  You write down exactly what you want and what you believe is going to work, and then you develop it and you test it.  The agile system, for software development, is different.  What it says is that you learn as you go, you make mistakes as you go and you do it all in a very iterative process.&#xa0;

[[[Q115 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] So this project is an agile project.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The work that we are doing now in terms of the digital part of the work is very much agile.&#xa0;

[[[Q116 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Only that part of the work.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q117 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] One of the criticisms of Government Departments and local authorities as well is that they find it hard to be an intelligent client, because, often, the people you are buying IT from or who are selling you solutions are more savvy than, maybe, civil servants.  Do you think that the DWP is now an intelligent client?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Yes, I do, first of all because, in terms of the digital work, we are doing that in-house.  I am very grateful to Government Digital Services, who came in after the David Pitchford reviews and commenced the process of the digital design processes.  The plan there was that we would, ultimately, as a Department, take that over.  They helped to get us started and that is now happening.  With the arrival of our DG for Digital Change, he is now taking a very clear lead in that work, and we are actively bringing in our own people, who will start to replace the GDS people, so we are doing it ourselves.  That is exactly the right thing to do, because of the way the iterative process works, testing it on claimants in small numbers and in focus groups, and that has proved to be very effective in terms of the proof of concept.  Everyone who has seen the proof of concept—and I think your Committee has seen some of it—has agreed that this looks like the way to go.  Of course, the proof of concept is the start and there is a lot more work to do thereafter.&#xa0;

[[[Q118 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] This is a question you may have answered earlier on, but just to clarify for me, has the new migration timetable not yet been subjected to a formal business review.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: The business case is due for presentation to HMT in the early part of next year.&#xa0;

[[[Q119 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Do you know when?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: From memory, March.  Mike, you might be able to help.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It is earlier than that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: It is earlier than that, I think.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: I think we had had some discussions with the Treasury about trying to share the business case with them before Christmas, but I am not sure whether January is the case.  We are talking about very shortly.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, January or February.&#xa0;

[[[Q120 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Minister, when I mentioned housing benefit and local authorities, you said you were in discussion.  Who are you in discussion with?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: This is the first time that the process has been announced, so the first thing that Lord Freud mentioned again is that we are constantly in discussion right now with local authorities about new asks, and this is simply going to be part of that process.  As I made the undertaking at the time, and I discussed this previously here—not here at the Committee but with my team—if there is a group of people who do not enter into the UC realm by the deadline of the others, whatever requirements are required of local government, we will sort out and help and assist them with financially.&#xa0;

[[[Q121 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Does the Department now have a single departmental plan?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: For Universal Credit?

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Yes.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes.&#xa0;

[[[Q122 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Who is in charge of that?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Howard Shiplee is.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Good luck.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: It might just be useful to go back to the local authorities: I meet with the local authorities and the devolved nations every month, and have been doing so for the last nearly five months.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Local authorities are also represented on the UC programme board.&#xa0;

[[[Q123 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] It is just that there has been a lot of concern with local authorities, because, when there is any slippage, they are trying to plan ahead for budgets, and it is a problem for them.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We have picked that up a lot.

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Particularly ones that have outsourced contracts with other suppliers for housing benefit, and they are in an awkward situation.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: We are dealing with that right now through him.&#xa0;

[[[Q124 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] The Permanent Secretary told the Public Accounts Committee that the DWP had implemented many successful IT projects in the past.  I am not saying it is not successful but I am saying that it has turned out differently than you expected, hence the write-off.  What was the difference between this one and other projects?  Was it personnel or was it the change of senior people in the Department?  Is there a single reason or is it multiple?

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: There are lots of issues around this.  I think Howard Shiplee made a point earlier on when he was describing the difference between waterfall and agile.  At the early stages of this process, this was described by the team as going to be an agile process.  In actual fact, the more we proceeded down that road—hence my concerns about it in 2011—the more it began to look like a kind of hybrid.  For agile, to describe what you do, you cut up the programme development into standalone sections.  There are short bursts of work that take place.  You complete a process.  It is standalone and ready to work, and you move on to the next level.  With waterfall, you are working on everything, all the way through, until you reach the endpoint.  This had become a little bit of both by the latter stages.I think what was different about this was the nature of just trying to bring these benefits together and also do an online ask and, as Howard Shiplee said, perhaps over-elaboration in terms of the “digital by default” message that was going in.  The key thing is to simplify and tidy that up, so that we are clear about what they are accessing and how they are accessing it.  What then led to problems was the complexity of the security got worse and worse, for that very simple reason, and that was the concern that we had.  I do not think there was a difference in terms of intent from the Department but I think there was a concern about the nature of the overall vision about how that was going to take place at the practical level in terms of those administrating it.

[[[Lord Freud]]]: It is worth just going on from the point that the Secretary of State just made.  The difference between Universal Credit and other programmes is that other programmes have been rather narrow and focused on delivering one thing, one payment stream.  Universal Credit is a combination and there is a great deal of complexity in how different elements of them interact.  That is where it is difficult.  We are taking what was 1,000 pages of regulations in the old system, boiling them down to 300 pages of regulation, in practice, under UC, and then trying to deliver that in one programme.  That is something which, in organisational terms, is quite tough to do.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It is also, I think, worth saying that there have been some aspects of Universal Credit that have been very successful.  During some phases of the programme, there was quite a bit of anxiety about the way in which the real-time information links would occur between HMRC data and the Universal Credit system.  RTI has been a particularly successful part of the programme, to such an extent that we are also looking to learn about how we can apply RTI into other parts of our business ahead of Universal Credit going live.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Chair, I am sorry to do this but this was the release from RTI, just in case you have not seen it.  There are some astonishing figures about how many people are now on the system, ahead of where we anticipated, so that bit of it, plus the feed across to Universal Credit, has been a remarkable success, and so much so that we are keen to accelerate that process.&#xa0;

[[[Q125 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] Mr Driver, we have talked about the £40 million write-off and the £91 million write-down.  That is £40 million of software that is not going to be usable and £91 million of software that will be usable but will be written down over five years.  That is not the total cost, is it?  What is the cost of Universal Credit?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Up to the end of March 2013, we spent £425 million on Universal Credit.  £17 million of that was with HMRC and 408 million was with DWP.  Of the money that we spent, we invested £398 million and we used £10 million for live running of the systems themselves.  Most of what we spent was on IT—in actual fact, IT development: £303 million.  Of that £303 million, £196 million was capitalised under international accounting standards to form the asset, some of which we are now impairing.  We also spent money on, for example, people, project teams, all of the issues that are associated with a project of this case.&#xa0;

[[[Q126 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] On the cost of the software-writing, which was done by external companies, was there anything in the contracts with them where there was any claw-back if the software did not deliver what you asked, or have you taken the full hit?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It is not normal in contracts to—

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] It is normal to have penalty clauses.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It is normal to have penalty clauses for failure to deliver.  Importantly, here—and Howard may want to say something—we had two reviews looking at the quality of what had been produced, because it is important to us to make sure that we are getting what we have paid for, in actual fact.  What those reviews showed is that the quality of what had been built was of a high standard and had utility.  I do not know if you want to say more on that.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: You probably want to, Howard, because you did the review.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Exactly that.  I think, first of all, it would be very difficult.  I can understand at the time why you talk about claw-back clauses.  With development work of this type, at this scale, you would find it very difficult in the marketplace to find anyone who would do this work at total risk.  That would be my view.  Therefore, the Department picked up that risk as part of the contracting strategy.&#xa0;

[[[Q127 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Teresa Pearce:]]] What you are saying is that what was developed for you was of high quality and fit for the specification that had been set, but the specification changed and then it was not usable.

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Things may have changed.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: For example, something that we originally specified around security.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Security would be one of the big areas where what was being tried to be done simply was not—

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: Realistic.&#xa0;

[[[Q128 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] I think we have probably done most of this area.  I guess the real question is: do you think you are working with the right IT suppliers or do you think, on reflection, you perhaps should have picked somebody different?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: We have been working with a number of large suppliers who have worked with the Department for a long time.  This is not the first work they have done.  They have proven, over the years, to have done a great deal of work.  It has been very effectively deployed.  When I first started, one of the questions I asked was not a dissimilar one; that is why I set up the reviews to look at the utility and the quality of what had been produced.  The reports came back, as has already been stated here, that the quality of the code that had been written was of good quality and it had been well engineered.  We have had colleagues in Government Digital Services also look at the coding as well.  One also has to be realistic—and we have not mentioned scale—that, to be able to get systems analysts and the sort of technical people needed, it would be, in my view, very difficult to find, at the time, smaller suppliers.  There were a number of very large suppliers with the people, the capacity and the capability to do the work at that time.&#xa0;

[[[Q129 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Do you think the contracts you have with these suppliers are still appropriate?  Do you wish you could change them or do something different?

[[[Howard Shiplee]]]: There is no perfect contract.  We are using the same contractors to do the further work on the development thus far in pathfinder.  At the moment, we are doing some early definition work, which we are doing on the same contract, on a time-and-material basis, while we all agree exactly what it is we want them to do.  I believe that, once we have established that in the early new year, we will move to either a fixed-price or a target-cost arrangement, which gives us the potential to transfer a reasonable amount of risk to the suppliers.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: What we are also doing is looking at the resource deployment of those suppliers on a weekly basis to ensure that we have consistency in deployment from them with what we think is reasonable.  We have also introduced quarterly independent IT assurance for Howard and for the Chief Information Officer within the Department, to look at the quality of build too.&#xa0;

[[[Q130 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] Is that the IT advisory board?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: It is not an IT advisory board but we have brought in independent assurance mechanisms.&#xa0;

[[[Q131 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Nigel Mills:]]] How do you get independent and assurance?  Presumably, you need some kind of experts who are not people you are already employing to do something else.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: We had this when we were looking at child-maintenance reform.  We brought in Atkins to do some reviews of the quality and the benchmarking of products that were being built for us, to make sure that we get not only that internal assurance but also that external assurance.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Can I just add one other thing, just so that we are not unclear about this?  There is a tendency to look at the digital system and then the more legacy system that we are talking about rolling out as completely separate.  They are not at all, because even the digital system will require strong and important elements of the legacy that is already being built for the present legacy system, so there is interoperability even by the time they come together.  What work is done on one is also work that will be done relevant to the other at the same time.&#xa0;

[[[Q132 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] There must be some implications for the £2.4 billion overall budget to bring in Universal Credit with the fact that things are coming on stream much more slowly, and some is having to be done administratively rather than electronically or digitally.  Are there implications for the other big part of the budget that we have not talked about, because you do not yet have the volumes?  That is transitional protection, which was included originally in the £2.4 billion figure.  Will the transitional protection still be there and will it still be at the same level?  There must be somewhere, if you are going to keep the overall spending envelope for the budget, where the extra money that it must be costing for bits that you did not expect is going to come from.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Transitional protection remains in place and remains part of the budget and set against the new rollout.&#xa0;

[[[Q133 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] Can you say how much of the £2.4 billion is likely to be—

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Off the top of my head, I can’t remember.  Mike, do you have a figure on that?

[[[Mike Driver]]]: Yes.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: Yes, that is a good point, actually, as a reminder.  I see what is happening.  The amount, over £2 billion, is set, but that, of course, is the cost of implementation.  A lot of the transitional protection is in the annual managed expenditure, not in the departmental set.&#xa0;

[[[Q134 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] There must, however, be implications, because you would have expected a number of those people to have transferred into UC but they will not have now until anything up to two years later.

[[[Mr Duncan Smith]]]: That means the earlier costs are, therefore, lower; thus, there are savings.  Those then mount up later in the system, as you migrate more, but the allowance is in the system for that transitional protection.  We are not getting rid of any of the transitional protection, so, as people fall eligible for transitional protection, they will receive it.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: In the OBR’s report, on page 135, it shows some of the key changes and the way in which costings will adjust over time.  What that is showing is that, over the period from 2013-14 to 2017-18—there was also a column for 2018-19 but I will leave that for a moment—the overall costs are £700 million lower.&#xa0;

[[[Q135 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Chair:]]] One of the reasons you got it past Treasury was that the whole point was that Universal Credit would ultimately be much cheaper to run for Government and would reduce the benefits bill.  As you have slowed it down so much, however, those savings will not come until much longer, and a lot more years into the future, than you were originally anticipating.  That must have implications.

[[[Mike Driver]]]: I do think that is an issue for the business case, though, because that is what we will revise.  As the National Audit Office reminded everybody in their report, at the time that it was written the business case delivers £38 billion of broader benefits.  One of the things that we will be doing with the business case is reflecting on the adjustments that we are making and, over time, seeing what happens to that net present value.&#xa0;

[[[Chair:]]] We have exhausted you, if not ourselves.  When Mr Shiplee says that he has enjoyed himself today, I did not know whether that was meant to be tongue-in-cheek but, if he has, we have not done our job properly.  Our job is to put you under some pressure.  Can I thank you very much for coming along this afternoon and for giving us your time?  We will see you again on 3 February about the other aspects of the annual report.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Oral evidence: DWP Annual Report and Accounts 2012 13: Universal Credit and DWP statistics, HC 867                            3
