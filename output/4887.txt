[[[to Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed ('CC')]]]&#xa0;We regret that we did not have immediate sight of the transcript of the above evidence given to the Committee. We hope nevertheless as the issues are of continuing importance in public debate it may still be of assistance for us to provide clarification of a number of points on which the factual evidence presented to the Committee has, we believe, been incorrect or is deserving of further supporting material for a full explanation.&#xa0;We represented Mr Mohamed as his solicitors following his arrival in the UK on 14 March 2011, after he had been removed against his will from Somaliland to the UK (as opposed to Somalia where he lived with his wife and child) and was upon arrival placed under a Control Order and required to live in Ipswich.&#xa0;A number of legal challenges came to be made on Mr Mohamed's behalf. All of these have far wider significance than for his case alone. &#xa0;The central issues on which the courts had to decide were:&#xa0;1. The legality of the Control Order imposed on 'CC' at the airport when he arrived in the UK on 14 March 2011.2. The subsequent legality of the TPIM (Control Orders having given way to TPIMs in January 2012). (The challenges to these two orders were conjoined in proceedings in the High Court.)3. The lawfulness of the Schedule 7 examination of CC at Heathrow Airport.4. The evidence that supported an allegation of "tampering" with the G4S/GPS tag worn by him between 19th April and 16th May 2013.5. The sequence of the allegations of breaches of the Control Order and the TPIM and their treatment by the courts.&#xa0;We start with the period of time in which Mr Mohamed was imprisoned for breaches of obligations placed upon him by first the Control Order and then the TPIM.&#xa0;The sequence of the allegations of breaches of the Control Order and the TPIM and their treatment by the courts.&#xa0;Mr Mohamed was arrested, as the evidence given to your Committee by Charles Farr correctly stated, for breaches of the Control Order between August and October 2011. (Thereafter he was charged with breaches of the TPIM.) The evidence on this issue given to the Committee, came in answer to questions from Michael Ellis MP:&#xa0;Q. "Despite 14 allegations of a breach of a Control Order and 6 allegations of a breach of TPIMs, he keeps on being re-admitted to bail from custody by the courts ... ?" [Further evidence related to a third accusation, concerning alleged tamper with his tag in relation to which he was released in August 2013. We comment on this separately.]&#xa0;Q. "If cases of these breaches had not been stayed (pending the High Court's consideration of the legality of the Control Order and TPIM), would he have been in prison?" "Almost certainly serving a sentence of more than a year in prison?"&#xa0;A. (Charles Farr) ''That is correct.&#xa0;Q. "He played the legal system?"&#xa0;A. "I can't comment on that".&#xa0;Q. "No I can".&#xa0;The comments we would make are these;&#xa0;a) Mr Mohamed, remanded in custody for the 14 and 6 breaches, had at the time of his respective releases on bail, already served over 8 months on remand in prison. It had already been acknowledged by the prosecution by the time of his release on 6th August 2013 for the third "tamper" allegation, that even if he had been convicted of the previous breaches at a subsequent trial, he would have already served more than his sentence for those breaches by reason of the time he had already spent in prison.&#xa0;b) The context of the 14 and 6 breaches was this; Mr Mohamed had been seized in what later emerged as a joint "operation" with UK agencies by forces in Somaliland. The description he subsequently gave was of severe ill treatment for two months by Somaliland officers including treatment categorised as constituting torture for two months – the questions put to him while detained focussed on information relevant to the UK. At the conclusion of his detention in Somaliland, instead of being returned as he had asked to Somalia where he had resided for many years with his wife and child, he was forcibly removed to the UK. Immediately on arrival he was placed under a Control Order and required to live in Ipswich where he knew nobody. He was not only traumatised from his experience beginning on 14th January 2011 (of which medical evidence was available to the courts) but was entirely isolated in Ipswich. For that reason and others, a number of the severe regulations upon him, imposed by the Control Order were breached by him. At the time of his arrest, for a second set of breaches, he commented that he preferred to be in prison, as at least he would be with other people.&#xa0;c) We feel it necessary to bring to your attention two earlier and not dissimilar cases of breach of Control Orders, both cases involving absconsion (of Ceri Bullivant and 'AN') which ended in both cases with their acquittal - in the case of Ceri Bullivant by a jury who accepted that he had reasonable excuse because of his despair at the crushing of any normality of existence for him (the Control Order was subsequently revoked by the High Court in any event). Mr Bullivant had absconded from the address at which he was required to live, but subsequently returned and handed himself in to the police, was arrested, charged and tried. In the second case 'AN', a Londoner, who was a victim of torture when a student in Syria, was placed on his return to the UK under a Control Order in Leicester (into a similarly isolated existence). He also absconded, was arrested, and spent a lengthy time on remand in Belmarsh prison. The criminal prosecution against him for breach was ultimately dropped and he was formally acquitted when the Control Order was quashed (following a decision in the House of Lords and subsequent decision by the High Court that the Control Order was void ab initio).&#xa0;The evidence that supported an allegation of "tampering" with the G4S/GPS tag worn by him between 19th April 2013 until 16th May 2013.&#xa0;d) The third allegation against Mr Mohamed, made on 25th July 2013, was as Mr Farr correctly stated in evidence based on claims by G4S that he had "tampered" with a GPS tag (on the 16th May 2013). The circumstances of his being granted bail on that allegation (almost immediately) deserve separate attention.&#xa0;e) By the date that he was charged with the alleged tag tamper (as we set out above) he had served any potential sentence for the outstanding breach allegations. Moreover when Mr Mohamed was charged with this offence, there were separately before the Central Criminal Court identical allegations made by G4S in relation to two other unconnected TPIM wearers of GPS tags, 'TP' and 'CE'. All were granted bail by very experienced Old Bailey judges on the basis that the growing statistical improbability of tampering by a significant number of TPIM subjects all wearers of the GPS tag was exceptional.&#xa0;f) On 22nd October 2013 the prosecution communicated formally with this firm that it would no longer pursue this tampering case against Mr Mohamed. Simultaneously the prosecution communicated the same decision in relation to the other two cases ('CE' and 'TP'). Police at the same time indicated to a fourth individual under a TPIM, bailed to return to the police station on the same allegation, that no further action was to be taken in relation to him. A similar approach, to our knowledge, is currently being taken in relation to other cases where the tags are cracking or malfunctioning in very similar ways. This extraordinary situation has we believe been brought about by the following accidental sequence of events.&#xa0;(i) By accident of historical representation, this firm was already representing a number of individuals on TPIMs who were wearing the new (introduced in or around April 2012) GPS satellite tag. A growing number of arrests took place of separate individuals, not known to each other all of whom expressed astonishment at the allegation by the monitoring company G4S, that they had deliberately interfered with their tags. (Solicitors representing a further individual reported that a similar allegation had been made in his case.)Two reports of "tampering" for two separate individuals came when they had on separate occasions, in separate cities, been praying in a mosque.&#xa0;(ii) Over a period of a year, this firm had already expressed clearly in writing to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service our belief that there was a malfunction of the tags, and that individuals were being arrested and prosecuted when the failure emanated instead from G4S's faulty equipment and/or inadequate research. In this regard we attach a note for your consideration summarising the position of the evidence within CC's prosecution and others for the same offence.&#xa0;(iii) The Committee's attention is drawn to the opinion of Ross Anderson of Cambridge University (Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University) who raised a very real concern that the damage to the tag could be caused by recurrent stress fractures (of the kind that for example caused Comet aircraft to be grounded in the past). It appeared to the independent experts consulted by the defence that G4S had placed the large GPS tag introduced in April 2012 on the same strap tested for use only on the much smaller previous tag, with additional strain inevitable. It should be noted that no testing, despite repeated requests that this issue be considered, to our knowledge, was done of a further likely cause of strain inevitably caused by praying five times a day. Requests by defence experts to conduct tests and to have access to test results to establish (or refute) these clearly stated propositions had not been met when the cases were all suddenly discontinued by the CPS.&#xa0;g) On 1st November 2013 this prosecution against Mr Mohamed was formally discontinued (the prosecution against TP and CE had been discontinued at an earlier hearing on 30th October 2013). We requested from the Prosecution both in writing and orally at the Court the forensic reasons behind the prosecution's decision to discontinue the cases. The Court had expressed itself as sympathetic to the defence request, but as yet the prosecution have provided only a general answer that there was "insufficient evidence to proceed". The same explanation was given by the Home Secretary in her reply to your raising of the same question in the debate on 4th November 2013;&#xa0;"I urge her to look at the role of the G4S and the tags that have been provided".&#xa0;The adequacy of the Secretary of State's answer is one with which we are bound to take issue;&#xa0;"the police believe that in this case the tag functioned exactly as it should have done ..... he referred to the court case. The issue was not about the effectiveness of the tags, but about weakening the evidence threshold for taking a criminal prosecution in relation to the operation of the tags".&#xa0;h) No answer given to date has provided any satisfactory explanation as to how three entirely separate individuals came to be arrested and prosecuted on the basis of claimed "scientific evidence" and how it was that all three prosecutions came to be discontinued following a direct challenge in advance of any trial by the defence to the reliability of the G4S tags. &#xa0;i) Our concern regarding the issue of tags remains, following the evidence of David Anderson QC at your Committee's hearing on 12th November 2013. The impression may have been left that no one now accused of tampering with their tag can be prosecuted. This is very far from the case. There have been many prosecutions in the past and no doubt ongoing for tampering allegations relating to the smaller tag. No doubt also there can and will be in the future prosecutions for damage or interference with the larger GPS tags. What is the issue here in these particular cases is very specific, that without evidence that the individuals had actually tried to remove their tags evidence of strain on the tag strap was repeatedly interpreted as deliberate "tampering". The claimed scientific opinion on which each prosecution relied can be summarised thus: that there was no innocent explanation for the strain.&#xa0;j) We note that the Committee received private evidence from G4S about the tags. We do not know the reasons for this. Clearly we have a concern that at present no one, including the Committee knows why Mr Mohamed's case, and others, were discontinued. This is not intended to constitute an abstract quest for information. Not only did the individuals in question spend time in prison before bail (unusually) was granted by judges at the Old Bailey in each case, on the basis of these allegations, but the G4S GPS tags are still being used. The question relates of course furthermore to matters concerning the public purse. (In the accompanying note we refer to the report by NAPO of June 2012, identifying concern as to "technical failures" of electronic tags generally, not limited to the larger GPS model.)&#xa0;k) We would welcome making available any further material that might assist to the Committee should it wish to conduct further examination of this issue.&#xa0;The lawfulness of the Schedule 7 stop.&#xa0;On his arrival at Heathrow airport on 14 March 2011 Mr Mohamed was detained and questioned for 6 hours under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. Approximately 118 questions were prepared and submitted by the Security Service to the Counterterrorism Unit of the Metropolitan Police Service for this examination. Furthermore before the Schedule 7 interview the interviewing officers were instructed by email in the following terms:&#xa0;"We would be grateful if you would NOT be drawn into any discussion with MOHAMED regarding HMG [Her Majesty's Government] involvement in his arrest. You should be aware that any such write up is likely to be disclosable in any future civil proceedings."&#xa0;The above evidence was given in the court proceedings that followed the imposition of a control order on Mr Mohamed at Heathrow airport. In separate judicial review proceedings brought on behalf of Mr Mohamed to examine the legality of the stop, Collins J found his detention and questioning under Schedule 7 to be unlawful. The questioning was not being conducted for the purpose of the Act, namely to establish whether or not he was involved in acts of terrorism, as the SSHD already was claiming he was, and had made a Control Order on that basis even before he had been detained in Somaliland (explained below)). Instead it was argued, the stop was being conducted for an unlawful purpose, of getting information from Mr Mohamed that was not tainted by torture in Somaliland. We provide the decision of Mr Justice Collins dated 20 December 2011. This judgment is of importance, beyond Mr Mohamed's case, defining the breadth of Schedule 7 powers. The fact of the Schedule 7 stop links with the further issue canvassed below as to the British authorities' knowledge of Mr Mohamed's detention in Somaliland and his treatment there, and in turn to the wider issue of the UK's alleged complicity in unlawful acts outside the UK.&#xa0;The Legality of the Control Order/TPIM&#xa0;The legality of the Control Order/TPIM itself was in question throughout after Mr Mohamed was notified of its existence at Heathrow Airport on 14th March 2011. That issue is at present listed to be considered by the Court of Appeal on 23rd January 2014. The appeal, due to be heard together with a second linked case CF, will consider very serious allegations regarding the potential complicity of the UK Government (and its agents) in unlawful acts including the arrest, detention, torture in Somaliland and subsequent unlawful deportation of both CC and CF. It has been argued, that but for the unlawful actions of the UK, Mr Mohamed would not have been within the jurisdiction to be the subject of a Control Order.&#xa0;We are aware that you already identified the fundamental question; i.e. why was Mr Mohamed in the UK at all? He at no time, we confirm, wished to be. We observe that the Committee was not provided with a considerable amount of evidence available to the Home Office, on the record within previous court hearings, that could have provided the answer to your question.&#xa0;The sequence of the events leading up to Mr Mohamed's arrival in the UK on 14 March 2011 was as follows:&#xa0;Up until his arrival Mr Mohamed had lived in Somalia since 2007, with his wife with whom he had a child. His wife was pregnant with their second child. Mr Mohamed had no intention of returning to the UK. Nevertheless on 13th January 2011, whilst he was outside of the jurisdiction in Somaliland, the Secretary of State for the Home Department sought and was granted permission from the High Court to make a non-derogating Control Order, i.e. a UK executive measure that can be applied only to persons who are within the UK. On 14th January 2011, the day after the Control Order was made, Mr Mohamed was arrested and detained in Somaliland in what was described by the local media as a “Joint security operation of Somaliland and British intelligence". Mr Mohamed subsequently reported that during the two months of his detention in Somaliland that followed he had been tortured and subjected to inhumane treatment without any recourse to legal due process. On 13th March 2011, he was removed from Somaliland, despite requesting that he be returned to Somalia to his wife and child, on a one-way travel document provided by British officials in the British Embassy in Addis Ababa. On his arrival at Heathrow airport, he was detained and questioned unlawfully, as the High Court held, under Schedule 7 TA 2000. The questions mirrored those asked when he was interrogated in Somaliland, including under torture.&#xa0;Serious questions concerning the UK's complicity in Mr Mohamed's treatment in Somaliland were directly raised within Mr Mohamed's Control Order/TPIM challenge. Whilst part of the proceedings were conducted in secret session, nevertheless evidence was disclosed in open session that supported Mr Mohamed's contentions (and those of "CF"). That open evidence we suggest must cast considerable doubt on the evidence given to the Committee on 12th November 2013 in which the Home Office witness Mr Farr stated (in response to your question as to why Mr Mohamed was in the UK) that the British Government had, "an obligation .... to arrange his removal back to the UK'.&#xa0;The full background necessarily underscores very serious questions; the degree of knowledge and involvement of the British authorities in Mr Mohamed's arrest, treatment and forcible return back to this country, with the intention of placing him on a Control Order (at cost not only to him but to the public purse), that Control Order having been made some two months before his arrival on UK soil. The impression the Committee may have at present is that Somaliland had instigated the request for his return to the UK after lawful detention there, and on their own volition, without the involvement of the UK hitherto.&#xa0;We hope that this letter may serve to demonstrate the complex and serious issues that were raised during the passage of the cases concerning Mr Mohamed.&#xa0;Encl:1) Explanatory note re G4S GPS tag cases2) Judgment of Collins J, CC v CPM and SSHD [2011] EWHC 3316 (Admin)3) Guardian article (lan Cobain, The real question about the terror suspect who fled in a burqa: did M/5 bring him here illegally? 14/11/2013).
