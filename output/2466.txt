[[[Aigas]]]

[[[ Community Forest]]]&#xa0;Background: &#xa0;Since 2009 Aigas Community Forest has been in negotiations with Forestry Commission Scotland to purchase/ lease Aigas Forest through the National Forest Land Scheme. FCS deems Aigas Forest to be ‘surplus land’ and is therefore looking to sell the forest as part of its ‘repositioning programme’. A full summary of what this has involved over the last 4 and a half years is provided in Annex 1 attached. There are a wide range of issues that require to be resolved around State Aids (please refer to our experience at the bottom of Page 3) and interpretation of the Treasury Finance Manual amongst other things but we would like to raise a number of specific issues around the Treasury rules and the valuation of the land and the forest as this may be an area where the Scottish Affairs Committee can contribute.&#xa0;Key Points:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
