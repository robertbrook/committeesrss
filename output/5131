Written evidence from the Association of Convenience Stores [TOB06]

default              
defaultACS welcomes the opportunity to respond to this important inquiry into tobacco smuggling. ACS is a trade association, which represents over 33,500 stores across the UK, including Spar UK, Nisa Retail, Costcutter and thousands of independent stores. Tobacco represents an important category for the convenience market, and ACS advocates the responsible sale of tobacco products through vigorous age verification policies within our members’ stores.

defaultI
defaultllicit sales of tobacco products create significant burdens to both convenience store retailers and the 
defaultGovernment .
defaultThe availability of cheap, illicit tobacco within communities harms legitimate retailers who sell products legally and in a responsible manner
default through implementing age restriction policies within their stores
default. Businesses not only 
defaultlose
default direct sales of tobacco to illicit traders, but also sales of other products by customers who stop coming into their shop. 
defaultFor this reason, ACS is eager to play a part in helping the Government towards its objectives in reducing the prevalen
defaultce of the illicit tobacco trade, particularly in tackli
defaultng value (small-scale inland activity
default) crime. 
default3. 
default              
defaultIt is also important to note the unintended consequences that the introduction of additional regulation of tobacco products, such as the tobacco display ban,
default or an increase in tobacco duty,
default 
defaultmight 
defaulthave on the
default growing
default prevalence of the illicit tobacco trade. 
defaultFor instance, the most price-sensitive consumers living in lower-income areas might be deterred from purchasing legal tobacco products from legitimate retailers if they feel out-priced by increased prices, or a customer could experience longer queues and transaction times when the tobacco display ban is introduced in small stores in 2015, which could also discourage them from purchasing tobacco from legitimate sources. 
default4. 
default              
defaultAs operational targets for tobacco seizure have been missed in 2012-13, priority should instead be given to growing activity and regul
defaultation against the illicit trade to avoid undermining the progress already made by the Government and legitimate retailers to lower the number 
defaultof smokers and to ensure that underage children cannot
default access these products
default.
default Illicit traders target those living in lower-income areas, particularly children, who are not only attracted by the lower price of illicit products, but also by the
default ease of access to them, owing to a
default lack of age restriction enforced by this market. 
default  
default5
default.
default              
defaultACS welcomed the National Audit Office’s recent report into HMRC’s progress in implementing its tobacco smuggling strategy, which highlighted HMRC and UK Border Force’s failings in meeting their operational targets. In reaction to this report, ACS has called on the Government to make more resources available to police, Trading Standards and health officials working in local authorities to be able to identify and prosecute tobacco smugglers. When these targets are missed, tens and thousands of legitimate retailers will suffer from being undercut by unregulated smugglers.

default.
default              
defaultACS also welcomed the Public Accounts Committee’s evidence 
defaultsessions into tobacco smuggling, which again indicated that further work is needed in tackling inland volume
default (lower level)
default crime.

defaultOur submission to this inquiry will focus on the 
defaultfollowing terms of reference
default:
default 
defaultWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13
defaultWhether the current sanctions and penalties 
defaultfor tobacco smuggling are appropriate
default8

defaultACS would be willing to provide oral evidence to the Committee’s inquiry.
defaultDeclaration of Links to the Tobacco Industrydefault&#xa0;default9
default. 
default              
defaultACS is open and transparent about the commercial relationship between our organisation and tobacco manufacturers. As part of our efforts to ensure this, ACS has notified the Department of Health detailing the nature of our commercial relationship. A copy of our letter is attached in Annex A and is available on our website. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultAs stated in the attached letter, tobacco companies
default and other tobacco manufacturers
default have no influence over ACS policy positions. These are decided by members through the ACS Management Board and policy committees upon which no tobacco companies are represented.
defaultWhy Border Force failed to meet its operational targets for tobacco seizure in 2012–13default11
default. 
default              
defaultAlthough HMRC has made significant progress in tackling the illicit trade at UK borders, the lack of focus on the growth of
default volume crime
default on the ground in communities has meant that inland illicit activity has been able to thrive 
defaultin our most vulnerable communities, and has contributed to the failure of HMRC t
defaulto reach its operational targets in 2012-13. 
default 
default12
default. 
default              
defaultThis is evident from HMRC’s own statistics on prosecutions. 
defaultThe proportion of prosecutions for inland seizures compared with those on the border and overseas is extremely low, and targets have also been missed in this area. 
default For instance, o
defaultnly 5% of cigarettes seized in 2010-2011 and 14% of Hand Rolling Tobacco were seized inland
default.
default13
default.
default              
defaultGovernment-led responsibility for ta
defaultckling smuggling lies with HMRC; however
default local agencies have the network and the people to identify illegal tobacco sales in the community
default, particularly in the case of low-level volume crime
default. There are currently limite
defaultd links between these agencies, and
default there is a pressing need for a more 
defaultco-ordinated
default approach between local and national enforcement. Clear responsibilities should be outlined for Trading Standards and local police in this area; they should not serve as merely a supporting partner of HMRC. 
default14
default.
default              
defaultIn addition to a defined remit of enforcement to local bodies, funds need to be made available to dedicate sufficient resource on the ground. ACS believes that a 3 year budget allocation should be given to Trading Standards and the police specifically for enforcement activity against the illegal sale and supply of illicit tobacco in communities.
default15
default.
default              
defaultOne example of where such partnership working has yielded success is 
defaultthe ‘North of England Tackling Illicit Tobacco for Better Health Programme’, which combined greater 
defaultpartnerships between health and enforcement officers
default and HMRC
default with consumer campaigns to achieve a greater awareness and ability to tackle the prevalent i
defaultllicit trade within the region.
default In its evaluation of the programme, the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies said that it had led to a reduction of demand for illicit tobacco and that it had led to a “greater coordination of activities” to reduce the supply of illicit tobacco in the region
default.
default 
default16
default. 
default              
defaultAlthough
default the ‘North of England Tackling Illicit Tobacco for Better Health Programme’
default and other
default existing partnerships have shown promising results, it is disappointing that 
defaultsuch programmes have
default not yet reached other parts of the country because of funding constraints
default.

default&#xa0;
defaultWhether the current sanctions and penalties for tobacco smuggling are appropriatedefault17
default.
default              
defaultACS believes that current sanctions against tobacco smugglers, particularly those who operate on the ground within communities, are not strong enough and do not target the correct people. 
defaultCurrent activities, such as the use of UK Duty ‘fiscal mark’ 
defaultdetector and banning orders do no
defaultt target
default illicit traders who trade in locations such as
default vans and tab houses
default, but instead 
defaultimpose further regulatory burdens on legitimate retailers.
default18
default. 
default              
defaultIn addition to 
defaultadditional resources for Trading Standards and local police to be able to bring action against illicit tobacco traders, new and harsher penalties to deter these sellers should also be introduced. 
defaultACS believes that the current structure of sanctions is counter-pro
defaultductive and needs to be tackled.
default 
defaultCurrent
default sanctions
default are also 
defaulttoo complicated and time-consuming for HMRC to pursue. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default19
default.
default              
defaultA suite of new and easy to administer penalties targeted at sellers of smuggled tobacc
defaulto products should be introduced, including:
default20
default.
default              
defaultAlthough prosecutions for volume crime have been gradually increasing, HMRC has not set targets for the number of prosecutions for tobacco
default fraud in cases of volume crime in tobacco smuggling
default; there are targets for volume crime across all regimes, but this is not 
defaultspecific to the 
defaultsale of tobacco
default. 
defaultA clear target for the number of volume crimes for tobacco smuggling should be set in order for HMRC to be able to further increase the number of prosecutions for volume tobacco crimes and to track progress.
default 
defaultThe National Audit Office’s report also highlights that the application of civil penalties against volume crime offenders was delayed because of recruitment delays and legal considerations
default, which again hampers the progress that can be made to tackle illicit traders who operate at the heart of our communities.
