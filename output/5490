defaultChair:default W
defaultelcome back to the Committee
default,
default to discuss a subject you have spent a fair amount of time on in the last few months and years
default.
default Could I ask you to briefly introduce your two colleagues?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultCertainly. 
defaultThis is
default Professor Keith Willett, previously professor of trauma and orthopaedics in 
defaultOxford
default and now full time in NHS England as director of acute care, and Emma O
default’
defaultDonnell, an NHS manager
default,
default who is Keith
default’
defaults deputy
default.
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very 
defaultmuch
default. You are all welcome. I would like to begin, if I may, with yesterday
default’
defaults announcements on tariff changes. The Committee would like to understand where the thinking is about changes in the tariff. There is clearly 
defaulta 
defaultrecognition that the previous structure was impeding efficient use of resources, response to demand and so forth. Should we see the changes announced yesterday as a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm change or are they a fix to get us through the short term?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultCan I 
defaultjust 
defaultgive you some background to the thinking, Chair, because I was part of the NHS management board th
defaultat considered these originally? 
defaultAdmissions had been rising at 4% to 4.4% per year for about eight consecutive years
default,
default and we felt that acute trusts had no real incentive to h
defaultelp keep people at home who didn’
defaultt need to be in hospital. So we agreed to split the tariff in such a way that anything over the 2008
default&#x2011;
default2009 baseline in terms of activity would only be paid for at 30% of the tariff rate
default;
default the remaining 70% would be put into a pot and the trust would engage in discussion with commissioners on how that 70% could be used. That became effective in the operating framework for the NHS in 2010
default&#x2011;
default2011.
default 
defaultMonitor subsequently reviewed that strategy to see whether it had any impact
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulthat we 
defaultsaw
default almost immediately was a very rapid reduction to less than 1% in the growth of admissions.
default 
defaultWhat has been a bit more tricky
default, frankly, over the last three years during the transition has been to really work out whether that money has been actually used for that purpose. We are embarking on new measures to radiolabel that in a way that makes it absolutely identifiable. 
defaultIn May last year Barbara 
defaultHakin
default, as director of operations, wrote out to the urgent 
defaultcare 
defaultworking groups saying that they should have responsibility for ensuring how that money is used. You will recall from discussions last time that the urgent care working groups are, if you like, groups of people who have a vested interest in ensuring that local urgent care works properly
default—
defaultlocal authorities, commissioners, providers
default,
default NHS England, Monitor and the TDA.
default 
defaultor 2014 we have clearly identified this money in the CCG budgets. We have determined that it should be used by the urgent care working groups
default,
default and that will be assured by NHS England. 
defaultOne of the misconceptions that 
defaultare
default around is that all emergency admissions are being paid at only 30% of the rate. What it 
defaultreally 
defaultamounts to in real terms is only 3% of the urgent admission activity. 
defaultSo, f
defaultor the average trust
default,
default we estimate that that would work out broadly 
defaultin
default the order of about £1.5 million. This is not something new and we will be looking at it over the course of the coming months.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultLet me 
defaultjust
default be clear. What is the scope, therefore, of this tariff if it is only 3% of admissions
default? This is
default not a tariff around emergency admissions
default.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe idea was to try and reduce growth. Hospitals were already fully funded for activity at the 2008
default&#x2011;
default2009 level
default,
default and the idea was to try and stunt that growth so that it would not grow any further.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI understand that. Your point was that only a comparatively small proportion of the revenue of an individual acute unit was affected by this split
default&#x2011;
defaultrate
default tariff. I was looking for clarity about which admissions were affe
defaultcted by that split
default&#x2011;
defaultlevel tariff
default if it is only 3% of admissions. I thought it was actually related to accident and emergency activity.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo. Do you want to come in?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes. When we talk about activity in hospitals
default—
defaultthere is clearly somewhat of a confusion here
default,
default and it always exists
default,
default particularly in the media
default—
defaultwhen we talk about A and E, we are talking about people attending, many of whom, 80%, will go home. When we are talking about acute admissions
default,
default we are talking about all the unscheduled patients who come in through the A and E department or through other routes as urgent cases. That is the cohort of patients we are talking about to which the tariff is attached. They took the baseline at 2008
default&#x2011;
default2009. That is still paid at the full level, or 
defaultthe 
defaulttariff level, for this year. It is just the increase on that which is affected by the marginal rate, so it is a re
defaultlatively small amount of money; 
defaultbut, as Sir Bruce says, it is the 70% which is the bit that has caused concern. One of the changes that have been indicated going forward is that the CCGs, working with providers
default,
default where they agree the baseline is now inappropriate
default—
defaultand that may be because service configurations have changed or individual services have changed
default—in those circumstances 
defaultcan reset the baseline to make it more appropriate. So
default,
default for some of those trusts that were perhaps unreasonably penalised
default,
default that can now be corrected.
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultGoing back to my original 
defaultquestion
default, is this simply a relatively minor change of an existing process
default—
default 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: default—defaultor is it a 
defaultrethink
default?
default 
defaultIt is not the rethink that the urgent care review was promising.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNo.
default 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, certainly not. We will come on to that, I hope.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultThank you very much for coming. The public are understandably concerned that our A and E system needs to be resilient to meet a winter crisis. Can you give reassurance to the public that the system is more resilient than it was last winter?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI think we can. The first thing that I think was different was that this year we started planning for winter much earlier than we had done for previous years. We started planning in May. The second thing that we have done as part of this is put urgent care working groups into place, and I have already alluded to that. The next thing that we have done is put national oversight on to those urgent care working groups
default,
default so that we have Monitor, the TDA, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and so forth, who will tackle problems that have been identified by the urgent care working groups. They also provide oversight of local plans for those groups. 
defaultWhat we have also done differently is 
defaultthat we have 
defaultgiven the winter moneys somewhat earlier this year. Normally they are given out towards the tail end of the year. This time we have given two lots. The first lot we gave in September, which was £250 million
default,
default and 
defaultthen 
defaultthat was subsequently supplemented in November by another £150 million. What is different with the moneys this time is that they have been given to those communities where we think the patients are most at risk of problems in winter. That money is not being given just to the hospitals
default; i
defaultt is being given to the communities 
defaultthat
default are served by those hospitals
default. So 
default£371 million of that £400 million has been given to communities; £15 million has been given to help beef up 111 in anticipation of additional calls; £14 million has been given to ambulance services; and £7 million has been given to specialised services because there are some specialised services which come under particular pressure over winter. Obvious examples would be adult intensive care
default unit
default, neonatal intensive care and ECMO
default,
default which is a pretty complicated process for putting oxygen into people
default’s blood when they can’
defaultt breathe on their own. 
defaultThe other thing 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are doing which I think is different this year is being utterly transparent about the data. We are putting it out on a weekly basis in a way that we have not done before
default,
default so that the public, the media and, most importantly I think, local communities can scrutinise it. We have also started to look at how the private sector might be engaged in the event of a surge through hospitals coming in through A and E. One of the issues under consideration is that
default,
default when the going gets rough in winter
default,
default often one of the big impacts is on elective care
default, so
default waiting lists start to drift out
default; could 
defaultelective care be shifted more into the private sector
default?
default Also
default,
default Barbara 
defaultHakin
default has had meetings not only with the private sector but also 
defaultwith 
defaultthe voluntary sector to see what they can do to help. 
defaultI think w
defaulte are certainly better prepared than any winter that I have been involved with before, but I think it would be foolish to be complacent because there are always things that can pop up like outbreaks of flu or 
defaultnorovirus
default or something.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default Let’
defaults 
defaultjust 
defaulthope the sun keeps shining. Often
default, to be honest,
default in most emergency departments during winter they consistently miss the four
default&#x2011;
defaultho
defaultur target. Do you think that that
default four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour target becomes meaningless, in a sense, in that you cannot expect departments to meet it during 
defaulta 
defaultwinter crisis? Has it lost its purpose?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultAs medical director, I can never say a target is meaningless because the moment you say that people stop aiming for it. There has to be an ambition and people have to try and meet it. I am glad to say that we tend t
defaulto regard the target on a longer-term basis.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis year we are at week 41 into the year and we are at 95.8%, so we are doing pretty well. Th
defaulte target has become a source of 
defaultpejorative discussion at times, but we have the most exacting targets, both for our A and Es and for our ambulances, of anywhere in the world. It is something we should be proud of and I think we should strive to meet that target
default,
default because when patients have to wait
default,
default either to be dealt with or admitted, it is not fair on them. But we should 
defaultalso 
defaultnot forget that the average waiting time in A and E is only 50 minutes.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultWe have seen previously that some problems arose because of people hitting the target and missing the point. What penalties are applied to those units that consistently fail to meet the target
default,
default and are you concerned that the penalties may be tackling the wrong things? You may be beating a horse with a stick when actually you need to look at the underlying causes 
defaultof
default them not meeting those targets
default, and, p
defaultarticularly if there are financial penalties
default,
default 
defaultthey
default can make a difficult situation worse and lead people to try and hit targets and incentivise them to miss the point.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultTo answer the latter part of your question, there has been quite a bit of controversy about the distribution of the winter moneys this year. There are those who feel that the winter moneys have been directed to those who have apparently failed in delivering the targets, which is why I said a few moments ago that we have tried to direct that money to the places where the patients are most at risk. That is something that we have done differently. There is a debate around the four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour target
default,
default but you may be interested to know, for example, that most states in 
defaultAmerica
default and many places in 
defaultEurope
default have no idea what is going on in terms of these targets. 
defaultAustralia
default, which has 
defaultgot 
defaultsome grip on it, 
defaultis
default only meeting, I think, 64% for their four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour target and only 29% for four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour admissions
default,
default and their ambition is to hit 90% by the end of 2016. 
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultCharlotte Leslie:default 
defaultI have one final question which I have been asked to ask
default by some concerned constituents; i
defaultt is to do with patient 
defaultsafety
default.
default My constituency borders 
defaultWales
default and there are obviously differences in the healthcare system there. Was the Keogh mortality review helpful in finding out where there were big gaps in care and
default—
defaultobviously it is difficult for you to give an opinion
default—
defaultwould something like that be h
defaultelpful in Wales, do you think? 
defaultI have been asked to ask 
defaultthis by a concerned constituent
default. 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Yes.
default I know that is a source of discussion in 
defaultWales
default at the moment and I know there are differing views among colleagues in 
defaultWales
default 
defaultabout 
defaultwhether this would be helpful or not. My view is that the process of review itself stimulates improvement. I tried to conduct those reviews in a different way
default—
defaultand I 
defaultwon’t
default go into it in detail
default—
defaultbut one of the things that had bothered me about so many of the other reviews that 
defaulthad 
defaultgone on was that people went into somewhere and said, 
default“
defaultYou
default’ve got
default a problem,
default”
default and somebody else came in and said, 
default“
defaultYou
default’ve got
default a problem,
default”
default and of course the trusts knew they had a problem
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulthat they needed was help. 
defaultA
defaultny review process of organisations that are struggling
default—
defaultand there are 
defaultsome issues with access times in 
defaultWales
default—
defaultthat offers a significant chance of improvement is worth pursuing.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultI did not want to leave the point that you made, Sir Bruce, about allocation 
defaultof 
defaultfunding because, 
defaultbroadly
default, you have allocated this extra funding to areas which have failed in the past.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultMy local authority, 
defaultmy
default local hospital, did not get any of that funding, but the point is there is a 
defaultkind of 
defaultfuture thing as well. The LGA in their evidence to us said 
defaultthat 
defaultonly 7% of the initial £250 million was earmarked for adult social care. What is happening while you sit there with the allocations that you have made is that
default,
default across the country
default,
default local authorities are changing the position
default by changing their eligibility—
defaulta lot of them because of the central Government cuts. My local authority is just about to remove social care funding from 1,400 vulnerable or disabled people. What will that do to the position in our local authority, 
defaultSalford
default, when those 1,400 people suddenly do not have social care? It seems to the LGA and to me grossly inequitable to go on the past. It is constantly fighting the last battle, is
defaultn’t
default it? 
default“
defaultLook back. Where have we failed in the past? Give them the money.
default”
default You need to look forward as well. Somebody somewhere needs to be keeping an eye on what local authorities are being pushed into doing by central Government budget cuts and say, 
default“
defaultWhat happens there?
default”
default What happens when 1,400 people in one area suddenly lose a care package? You can put two and two together
default,
default the same as I can.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultCan I just
default say thank you for that? I can’
defaultt answer it, but I can certainly take it away.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default Can I ask what happens if you don’
defaultt put that money into A and E? Do people just die?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: I am sorry
default 
defaultbut 
defaultI do not quite understand the question.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIf you do not 
defaultallocate
default the money to failing A and Es or to A and Es that are not coping, 
defaultwhat 
defaultare we saying
default—that we don’
defaultt allocate the money and people should therefore suffer harm? 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: I don’
defaultt think I said that.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultNo, 
defaultno, no, 
defaultbut
default,
default if you take Barbara
default’
defaults question and your question, there is not enough money in the system. I am saying 
defaultthat, 
defaultif you are going to allocate it to local authorities
default, then 
defaultwhat is going to happen is that the crisis in A and E will be even worse.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThank you.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultjust 
defaultwant to pick up on some of the comments you made 
defaultabout this additional funding. I don’
defaultt know if you have had an opportunity to have a look at some of the written evidence. The Royal College of Physicians of 
defaultEdinburgh
default say
defaults
default that the money that you are allocating needs to be looked at for the long term 
default“
defaultrather than the current reactive response.
default”
default The Royal College of Nursing is talking about it as a sticking plaster
default,
default and I think the NHS Confederation also is concerned about 
default“s
defaultticking plaster solutions for emergency care.
default”
default I know that you are very excited about giving this money and it sounds very good, but this 
defaultactually isn’
defaultt 
defaultnew money, is it? It is an 
defaultunderspend
default from the savings that many of these providers have had to make
default.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultIn addition to that
default,
default the winter moneys became so routine that people wrote them into their baseline budgets and used them for whatever they felt was most appropriate according to their priorities at the time. So I think your points are absolutely c
defaultorrect, which is why one of the 
defaultwork streams as part of the urgent and emergency care review
default—
defaultand I will ask Keith to say a couple of words about this in a minute
default—
defaultis to try and introduce a more secure footing for funding. Another area is to think about how we can alter the way hospitals handle different work streams during different seasonal demands
default,
default and how we can alter the tariff in such a way that hospitals actually get the money to deal with what they need. 
defaultAnd a
default point 
defaultthat
default is really important is that A and E is where the problem is manifest
default,
default but the problem
defaults lie
default, I think, as Barbara 
defaultKeeley
default has said, in social care, primary care and community services. 
defaultW
defaulte need to look at smart ways of providing funding that enables us to link all of those up. I think Keith has some early thoughts on those.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultI think Sir Bruce is absolutely right in saying that this is temporary money
default,
default based on what has been done in the past
default,
default to deal with an issue. The issue is not around people dying, I would say. A and E departments, the emergency services, are all about managing risk; that is what they do. If they are insufficiently funded, 
defaultthen what happens is 
defaultthe quality goes down. Risk does go up
default, but they will protect that. 
defaultWe want to look to the future. We have to have a system that will work going forward. 
defaultT
defaulthis is very much a holding position. That is what we are in
default.
default I think 
defaultthe evidence we gave last time was 
defaultthat the system was unsustainable
default;
default we do what we can
default,
default using the efficiencies in the current system
default,
default to make it last. 
defaultGoing forward, we have inherited a commissioning structure which is very fragmented. Not only is the clinical care fragmented, which is what your constituents will tell you
default—
defaultthe GP does not know what the hospital is doing and the ou
defaultt
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default hospital services don’
defaultt know what the paramedics are doing
default—
defaultbut we have inheri
defaultted a fragmented system as well. G
defaulteneral practitioners are com
defaultmissioned on a capitation basis and
default the number of people they look after; ambulance services 
defaultare 
defaultcommissioned in a different way; the hospitals are commissioned on a tariff basis by activity; 
defaultand then 
defaultcommunity care is a block contract. 
defaultW
defaulte are in a position where
default,
default even if we try to bring everybody together
default to share outcomes for patients
default so that we can commission a whole pathway of care that our patients and your constituents would understand, when we try to do that and come to allocate the money
default,
default again we are still stuck with those methods. 
defaultOne of the large pieces of work stream that we are doing within th
defaulte review will be to look at that
default whole funding structure
default,
default and there are different ways we could fund such that we could plan to support what we have asked for in the review, which is to support more activity out in the community. The ideal place to treat most people is as close to their home as possible with the support they want. 
defaultI
defaultf we are going to need to move money in that way, we have to be able to have incentives in one place with an activity change that fits that.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWith the 
defaultgreatest
default of respect
default—and I know there are lots of m
defaultembers who want to come in
default—
defaultI want to focus on this particular thing, and we will come on to the review. Could I point you to a graph fro
defaultm the House of Commons Library? 
defaultThey are saying that the non
default&#x2011;
defaultwinter
default A and E attendances have gone up rather than th
defaulte winter ones—
defaultand everyone seems 
defaultto think that this is a mild winter so the probl
defaultems really haven’t hit us yet—so is
default there going to be more money available?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe decision as to whether money is available is a decision made by the Department of Health, not by NHS England.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut
default you are aware of this graph, are you?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultPerhaps I can answer that. 
defaultI think t
defaulthere is a misconception. 
defaultThe two quietest months for A and E attendances are 
defaultJanuary and February every year. 
defaultJanuary and February are the quietest months every year for A and E attendances. 
defaultThe problem is not A and E attendances.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default I don’
defaultt 
defaultknow
default what you are saying. Are you saying that the House of Commons 
defaultgraph 
defaultis wrong? 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: I have not seen the graph. What I am saying is that, every year since we have had records,
default 
defaultA and E attendances—
defaultthe number of people turning u
defaultp at A and E—
defaultis lower in January and February than at any other time of the year. The issue in the winter is not the numbers of people attending; it is that in the summer, because of daylight hours and everybody is active, a lot of people will turn up who are younger with minor injuries or minor ailments. The majority of those are seen in A and E and then sent home. In the winter, the activity in the general 
defaultpopulation goes down. People don’
defaultt fall over in the ice and snow
default; t
defaulthat is a misnomer. What we see in the winter is a doubling in the number of people, usually with long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions, who are frail elderly, particularly with respiratory problems such as asthma or bronchitis. That number of patients doubles. All of those patients, unlike the summer people, are people who are elderly, who need a stretcher, a trolley or a bed
default,
default and that is what logjams the A and E departments.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWho 
defaultis
default 
defaultattending
default now? What is the cause of these massive attendances? Do you say it is a majority of elderly people
default?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: It is the same; t
defaulthe pattern is identical year on year.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultMoving on to 
defaultdischarge
default—
defaultand certainly this is something that has been raised by the hospital 
defaultin my area, Manor hospital—d
defaulto you see that there is a problem with delayed discharge? 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: Yes; c
defaultategorically, there is. The numbers that are measured are, I think, unrepresentative. That is because the marker that was put down was really designed
default,
default when it was thought about in the Department of Health originally
default,
default to be something that might be a marker of social care function. It has never 
defaultactually 
defaultgone as far as that, but it has been retained. 
defaultBut t
defaulthere is little benefit for the hospitals to record it
default,
default and actually it does not me
defaultan very much, because if you have
default a community that 
defaultcan
default support patients with quite high care needs we could move a lot of patients out very quickly. If you 
defaulthave
default a community that 
defaultcan
default support only low needs, then obviously patients have to get 
defaulta 
defaultlot better.
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAre you saying that they are not being supported now?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNo. 
defaultWhat 
defaultI am saying 
defaultis that
default the opportunity is now to
default move—
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIs there a problem 
defaultwith
default delayed discharge?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: I
defaultf the community services were better
default—
default 
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYes,
default 
defaultso my next question is, rather than a lecture
default—
default 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: —
defaultwe could move more patients out.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou have said there is a problem with delayed discharge, so is the problem related to a lack of social care and cuts in social care budgets?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNot on the current figures. In fact, the delayed discharges appear to be as important in terms of moving patients across any
default—
default 
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultYou seem to be 
defaultdisagreeing
default with the House of Commons Library a lot because
default,
default apparently
default,
default there are cuts of £1.8 billion in adult social care. Are they wrong?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNo, but they have been managing them very well. The published figures would suggest that the bigger problem has been moving patients into other environments, including within the NHS. 
defaultT
defaulthe social care delayed discharge numbers have come down. That would show that they have been
default—
default 
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo you say the 
defaultnumbers
default have come down, like Sir David Nicholson has said
default.
default 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: Yes;
default those are the published figures. 
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut the Secretary o
defaultf State says they haven’
defaultt.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: I don’
defaultt know what
default—
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThe Secretary of 
defaultS
defaultt
defaultate
default told us in evidence that the problem is he has been talking to chief executives and they have approximately two wards full of people who could be discharged but they are not able to discharge.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultI agree, but what I am saying is the social care element does not seem to be the biggest problem.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultCan I try and help? 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultPlease, thank you.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: I think t
defaulthere i
defaults an element of this that we don’
defaultt quite understand. If you speak to most people 
defaultwho 
defaultwork in a hospital, they will say that somewhere between 20% and 25% of people should not be there. As part of a national medical director
default’
defaults clinical fellow scheme, I have junior doctors who have gone in and looked. It seems as though there 
defaultis
default that sort 
defaultof proportion of people that don’
defaultt need to be there. What we have not dissected out
default—
defaultand this is something that we are working on
default—
defaultis whether those people are there because of social care
default or inadequacies of social care
default, 
defaultwhether they are there because we can’
defaultt get them into other parts of the NHS, 
defaultwhether they are 
defaultthere out of convenience or whether they are there for some other reason. 
defaultSo w
defaulte need to work on that. But, in any event, there are delayed transfers of care out of hospital.
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou say that you need 
defaultto
default work on it, but should you not be doing that now and what are you actually working on?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe are doing it now.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCould you tell us what 
defaultyou 
defaultare working on?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: But w
defaulte perhaps should have done it a long time ago.
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThat
default doesn’
defaultt matter
default; 
defaultyou are working on it now
default,
default but what are you actually doing?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Well, w
defaulte have started some work in the operations department to try 
defaultto
default identify exactly what the delayed
default—
defaulti
defaultt has only just started so I don’
defaultt
default—
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default You can’
defaultt give us a 
defaulttaster
default of what the problems are
default?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, not yet, I am sorry.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDo you know 
defaultwhen
default you are likely to?
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultCan I interrupt you for a second? It is 
defaultan 
defaultextraordinary 
defaultthing 
defaultto say 
defaultthat 
defaultserious work into the causes of delayed discharges has only just started, is
default it not?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Well, there has been some work which— 
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultIt is hardly a n
defaulte
defaultw theme.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, but I think whenever you start it will be too late. 
defaultI mean, w
defaulte have started.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultAre you inviting the 
defaultCommittee
default to believe that none of your predecessors ever did any serious work on the causes of delayed discharges
default, because
default I 
defaultreally do
default find that quite hard to believe
default?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, we know about the causes of delayed discharges that Keith has referred to. What we are not clear about is some of the other causes of delayed discharges. That is what I am telling you.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultWould Professor Willett like 
defaultto
default comment?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: I was just going to say that t
defaulthe work that is going forward is on the money that has been allocated from the healthcare 
defaultbudget over the next two years—
defaultthe integration transformation fund
default; it is 
defaultthat £3.8 billion. We wil
defaultl be looking at that interface. That is
default about how we move patients out of the hospital environment
default 
defaultin particular 
defaultand 
defaultback into the community. That is money that will be used in that way. There is a lot of work going on now around the process by which the CCGs, the local authorities and the provider trusts work together to ensure that that money is spent in an appropriate way to move those patients out, to support the social care sector or the community sector. That is the big piece of work that is going on.
default As to the analysis of who can’
defaultt go where, to some extent we need to solve the problem rather than just go back and look at that analysis.
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI have one other 
defaultthing
default.
default 
defaultI know that Gus O
default’
defaultDonnell, when he was head of the civil service, was suggesting it to civil servants all the time
default,
default and 
defaultI know
default Jeremy Hunt
default,
default the Secretary of State does it
default: 
defaultit is fine if you are sitting in Richmond House, but you need to go 
defaultdown to the coalface and actually talk to the chief 
defaultexecutives and front
default&#x2011;
defaultline staff,
default 
defaultso c
defaultan I please suggest
default you do that?
default The 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultEmergency Medicine
default know the reality of it. Can I suggest you do that rather than move paper around
default?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultWe do.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThis 
defaultis around the same issue really. I just think we need to say, in terms of the work of this Committee
default, with regard to the anecdotal evidence we heard—
defaultand it does tie in with what the Secretary of State told us
default—as
default to the causes 
defaultand impact 
defaultof delayed discharges
default, that 
defaultthe official statistics contradict what we heard anecdotally. We heard again and again
default and again—
defaultand it is here in the LGA evidence
default—
defaultthat 
defaultsocial care, lack of social care, lack of assessments and
default not being able to move forward on t
defaulthose were the issues. It wasn’
defaultt just one person; we heard it repeatedly
default,
default and we heard it from the Secretary of State. There is a problem with the statistics, I have to say, and it is interesting that you say that you are just embarking on work on this
default,
default because the official position that you put to us is that that cause for delayed discharges is declining. It appears it is not. In fact it would be counterintuitive if it did because £2.68 billion has come out of adult social care. It contradicts what you have just said. How on earth can you be speeding up changing and improving the situation when all that is happening is money is coming out of adult social care? I have described to you what is happening in my local authority
default,
default which has lost more than £100 million in three years and is to lose another £75 million over three years. Adult social care is 40% of their budget. What do you think is going to happen? I 
defaultjust can’
defaultt get my head round how you think this is going to improve unless you put in money of a similar order. In fact, that is not happening. What is happening is that money is going out of social care 
defaultthis year, in the coming months and
default even in the tail end of this winter. Is that not something that keeps you all awake at night
default,
default because, to be honest, it would keep me awake at night?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, it does bother us and I think it bothers everybody. We are trying to maintain a stable and improving service in the NHS at a time that our colleagues in social care are taking a massive hit to their baseline. Of course, the provision of services in the NHS is utterly dependent on having a joined
default&#x2011;
defaultup
default health and social care system
default,
default and I think your points are very well taken.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultMy local 
defaultauthority
default and lots of other places are faced with this yawning gap that is going to open up and there is nothing to be done about it
default,
default because the LGA told us that
default,
default of your extra funding that you put in
default,
default only 7% went to social care. When we discussed this with 
defaultthe Minister at this Committee—when 
defaultyou were talking about urgent care boards and 
defaultyour planning for winter pressures—
defaultI raised this question then. There was no answer and there is still no answer. Now you are months down the road
default and
default 
defaultyou say you have plans, and the position isn’t better—it’
defaults worse. The position is actually worse.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultAs to the winter pressures money and the 7%, what you are talking about 
defaultthere 
defaultis the £400 million that was put in for the winter pressure. The money I was talking about was the £3.8 billion, which is the integration transformation fund.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThat is not 
defaultnew
default money either. That covers things like carers
default’ breaks 
defaultand adaptations. Only half of that is not previously
default&#x2011;
defaultannounced
default money. You are taking money that 
defaultlocal authorities already have—
defaultthe carers
default’
default respite br
defaulteaks and the adaptations money—
defaultout of the money you have already announced. That is not new money. Also, I un
defaultderstand from the Care Minister
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthat is going to cover the new responsibilities 
defaultfor
default local authorities 
defaultfrom
default the Care 
defaultBill. You are spending that money again and again
default and again, and
default half of it was spent anyway. 
defaultSo I don’
defaultt think we can be in a situation where we keep on pointing to that one fund 
defaultand 
defaultsaying
default,
default 
default“That’s
default going to cover everything.
default”
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI think these issues might be better addressed by someone from the Department of Health.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultYou should be raising it with them.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultI 
defaultjust 
defaultwant to 
defaultbottom
default this because we hear a lot about social care. I have two local authorities affecting my area, one of which changed its criteria a number of years ago
default—six, seven or maybe eight
default years ago now. There was not quite the outrage 
defaultwhen that happened
default that we
default hear now from certain quarters.
default The other one has made a decision not to change its criteria. They are served by different hospital trusts, different acute trusts, but the 
defaultde
defaultmand for A and E services in both trusts has gone up the same
default,
default so can we just bottom
default?
default 
defaultI
defaults there any evidence that the changes in social care tariffs on the ground have made any difference at all to A and E admissions? 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: I don’
defaultt know of any, but we can send you a note on that.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultOkay. It would be 
defaultinteresting
default to know because we hear it a lot
default—
defaultthe link is made
default—
defaultbut I would suggest, from my own area, that we have seen similar pressures in both hospital trusts despite the different social care criteria. My local council discussed changing the criteria and they decided to get rid of people earning over £100,000 instead and used that to provide the care. So there are solutions available to local authorities if they have the leadership to take them. 
defaultMoving on, when we had the LGA here
default,
default they made quite a bold statement 
defaultin which they stated 
defaultthat 
defaultactually delayed discharge wasn’
defaultt an issue. I 
defaultreally 
defaultwant to echo what we have heard from other colleagues that there does not seem to be any clarity here. The LGA
default,
default who came before us, if you remember
default—
defaultand I have always found it a little unbelievable
default—stated
default that there was not an issue with delayed discharge and actually the situation had been improving in recent years. I would make the appeal that we 
defaultdo 
defaultneed to get some clarity on the data around us
default,
default because we are completely at a loss as a Committee as to who to believe, I think, as we do hear things
default 
defaultanecdotally, and
default,
default similarly anecdotally
default,
default there are good things happening on the ground as well. 
defaultT
defaulthere is this inability for us to really know
default—
defaultand it concern
defaults me that you as NHS England don’
defaultt seem to 
defaultreally 
defaultknow
default—
defaultwhat the pressure is in terms of delayed discharge and the impact it is having. Tha
defaultt work needs to take place post-
defaulthaste, I would suggest. 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, I agree.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhere are 
defaultyou
default getting the data from
default then
default?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI will have to give you a note on that because it is not being done in my directorate.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultOkay
default.defaultQ43 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultCan
default I take a point that Andrew has made, and you may not be in a position to answer this but it is 
defaultjust an interesting thing? I don’
defaultt know of any local authority that does not almost charge/means
default&#x2011;
defaulttest
default people who take up the services they provide in a social care 
defaultsetting. Do you know of any local authority that just gives free social care willy
default&#x2011;
defaultnilly to anybody without doing a means test?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo.
default              
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: No.
defaultQ44 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper: defaultSo this £100,000 is just not relevant then.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultLike I say, we are from NHS England. The way that social care operates is a matter for the Department of Health.
defaultQ45 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultI have a couple of questions to follow up. One is a supplementary on the issue of the four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour waiting time and the other is on the measurement of readmission. On the matter of the four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour target, it was quite clear that you 
defaultare
default suggesting or implying that 
defaultobviously 
defaultthis is going to be here to stay. You are also implying that it is there as a guide, not as a straitjacket in terms of
default—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, I am not implying that. We have a target and we have to use it.
defaultQ46 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIt is a straitjacket then. In that case, to what extent are you able to measure or receive advice from clinicians on the ground that the target distorts clinical priorities and has an impact on patient outcomes and patient safety? It is quite clear that the anecdotal evidence suggests that it does have a consequence for patients in A and E because of the obsession with the four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour target to the detriment of patient care. Would you accept that that might be a possibility?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI will ask Keith to say a few words on this in a moment, but 
defaultI think 
defaultit certainly introduces an element of stress for people who are wo
defaultrking in accident and emergency 
defaultdepartments
default, and, w
defaulthereas that stress was primarily focused on managers previously
default,
default it has now become increasingly felt by medical and nursing staff. But Keith has worked in a trauma service and A and E for the whole of his career
default, so he 
defaultis probably better equipped to answer. 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThe bit of history that is important is this. If you talk to the 
defaultCollege
default of 
defaultEmergency Medicine
default and to emergency medicine clinicians
default, they would not get rid of it because i
defaultt was the one thing that really changed their lives. As to this cycle of A and Es 
defaultcoming
default into difficult places, we have been there before and that was the thing that undid the problem in very short order. It is a very valuable way to focus the whole of the hospital
default—
defaultthat is, the in
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient services, 
defaultthe 
defaultmanagers and everybody
default—
defaulton making sure that A and E is given a priority. 
defaultThe difficulty we have, and this will be 
defaultpart of the review
default, is that
default we will look at all of these elements, but the A and E standard that we look to is four hours
default. Now, that is
default four hours to complete your treatment and be out of the door, 
defaultto 
defaultbe transferred to another hospital if that is what you need, or to be admitted to an in
default&#x2011;
defaultpatient bed if you are one of the 20% or 25% that needs admitting. It is not a four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour wait to be treated but four hours to have completed the whole of that episode. That is quite an achievement
default,
default and, as Sir Bruce has said, it is the highest level of requirement internationally. The difficulty is that it is 95% of attendances. 
defaultAcross the country, if you go to A and E for an injury or an illness and you are then discharged straight home again, most patients complete that in under two hours. If you are 
defaultadmitted to hospital, the average is three and a half hours to be got into a bed. The difficulty is
default,
default 
defaultbecause 
defaultwe use attendance as the denominator
default, and 
defaultI talked about that seasonal variation where there is a lot of activity in the summer, which is a single il
defaultlness or injury that goes home, 
defaultit is relatively easy to hit the 95%. In the winter, when that activity melts away because people have stopped being so active and the number of elderly and frail patients and those with respiratory disorders climbs, the denominator has gone down but the numerator has climbed a lot, so it is very difficult to hit the 95%. 
defaultThat means that, going forward, we will have to look at things that are much more important to patients and clinicians other than a single target, which is what we have at the moment. Part of the review is that we will be working to look across the whole healthcare system to come up with measures that are far more meaningful and important to patients, to take away what can be some almost perverse incentives to perhaps deal w
defaultith patients in a way that doesn’
defaultt feel right. Clinicians will always do what feels right for patients, but it does create pressures and I would fully accept that. So, going forward, as part of the review
default,
default we have to change the standards we set so that they are broader and more patient and medically sensible.
defaultQ47 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultIn 
defaultanswer
default to my earlier question, you are suggesting there is an extremely useful and rather rigid guide, but not a straitjacket, which might have a consequence.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNo, I think it is really important because it does drive the sy
defaults
defaulttem at the moment, but we need to replace it with things which are better than we have now.
defaultQ48 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou know 
defaultthat
default there are a lot of hospitals which have this sort of netherworld 
defaultwhere you are 
defaultnot quite admitted
default; you are
default on an admissions ward where the staffing levels are often threadbare
default and t
defaulthe patients will be in a much more dangerous position in order to meet the four
default&#x2011;
defaulthour target, effectively on trolley wards.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault:
default No, I agree, and, if we look around, all the developed countries are in the same place
default—
defaultCanada
default and 
defaultAustralia
default. Everybody is trying to do the same thing and looking to come up with a suite of 
defaultmeasures—metrics—
defaultthat 
defaultthey 
defaultcan 
defaultreally 
defaultmeasure accurately, that do reflect patient and clinical importance, but, more importantly, taken as a whole, do reflect the whole patient pathway. You take away some of those elements that could be distorting which you do not want to be present.
defaultQ49 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou are primarily looking at outputs 
defaultrather
default than inputs, so you have no view on staffing levels and safe staffing.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultWe want to look at outcomes rather than outputs and inputs. It is outcomes that really matter. There will be different ways to achieve those. There will be guidance going forward. That is what we are doing with the review. We will be looking at the clinical standards that patients should expect to be able to receive. We should be looking at the sort of skills that should be available to address that. So there will be some things around inputs and process, but it is outcomes we need to get to.
defaultQ50 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou 
defaultwon’t
default address the issue which has been raised by the RCN and others in the evidence to us to sa
defaulty that there is a serious issue
default of understaffing in many of these settings and that clearly has a consequence for patient care and safety. 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultI would agree that we have to look at the skills that are available and the amount of people. But
default,
default again
default,
default in the 
defaultreview what we have to do is 
defaultdecompress the A and E 
defaultdepartments to give us the headroom to do the proper assessment. That is about supporting patients out in the community
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulthen you read the phase 1 review
default, 
defaultthat is what we have got consensus on from all the patient groups and from the clinicians. When we went out to public engagement we had enormous support for those. In fact there was a 97% mandate that the system had to change in that direction to support people out in the community.
defaultQ51 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYet you have no view as to whether a lot of the A and E settings
default—
defaultthe emergency department settings
default—
defaultare unsafe in 
defaultrelation to the staffing levels.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThere is local incident reporting on all the safe
defaultty issues, so that is in place. 
defaultThey are reported and addressed locally. 
defaultClearly, w
defaulthen you are in a
defaultn environment that is a
default high
default&#x2011;
defaultrisk environment, the safety elements become apparent very quickly. 
defaultWhat c
defaultlinicians will always 
defaultdo is to 
defaultprioritise those patients at greatest risk, 
defaultand 
defaultthe result of that 
defaultis that 
defaultthe exper
defaultience of care for some patients who perhaps are not at risk
default goes down. That is something we have to improve.
defaultQ52 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultSo you are going 
defaultto
default side
default&#x2011;
defaultstep the issue of safe staffing levels.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultIt is not about staffing levels. It is about the skills that are available. You can have as many peo
defaultple as you like, but if they don’
defaultt have the right skills you 
defaultwon’t
default have a safe environment. We can put care
default&#x2011;
defaultsupport
default teams in and whatever, but we need the right skills
default—
defaultskills that matter.
defaultQ53 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultThat sounds like 
defaultmanagement
default babble to me.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNo, I am a doctor; I am not a manager. I am a clinician and I have worked there for 30 years. I know exactly who I would want. I would know which nurse
default—
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultMaybe you have drifted into management. 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: —
defaultand which doctor I would want to treat me.
defaultChair:default 
defaultLet us get back to staffing levels.
defaultQ54 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultOn the issue of readmissions, I understand that tariffs are set to penalise hospitals which experience patient readmissions within, is it, 30 days? Is that also used as a good measure by which you can assess the extent to which there are readmissions
default,
default and what is that telling you in recent years in terms of readmission levels?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThe concept
default behind the readmission is that, 
defaultif you are assessing your patients properly
default, 
defaultyou are doing a full discharge and you judge all those things right
default, 
defaultyour readmission rate should be low. In other words, you have supported patients correctly in the community. It is a judgment about that interface. As medicines move forward again, although that is something that is important as a marker, it
default, again,
default is a process point
default,
default and as we move into a situation where we do a lot more of what we call rapid assessme
defaultnt, treatment and discharge, for a lot of older patients—
defaultparticularly the frail and particularly now that 40% of ou
defaultr older patients have dementia—
defaultthe hospital environment 
defaultis not the ideal place for them. S
defaulto a lot of those patients we would like to very quickly assess and move back into the community with the support they need. 
defaultTha
defaultt is much better for them
default if we can provide the support
default. That is where we would be looking to go with the review and that is the sort of thing we are working on. But, as you do that, some of those patients
default—
defaultand there is a lot of art in 
defaulthere as much as science
default—
defaultwill require readmission. If you h
defaultave a very dynamic relationship
default in that you are trying to hold as many patients out in the community, a readmission may be quite an important part of that process because you would expect to have a certain number. So, going forward, we will be looking 
defaultat that 
defaultas well as to whether that is a proper indicator of good care.
defaultQ55 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default But m
defaulty 
defaultquestion
default was about the pattern in recent years of readmissions. On a factual basis, what is the penalty level, in terms of a readmission
default within 30 days? 
defaultWhat is the penalty?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYou don’t get paid for it.default              defaultProfessor Willettdefault: You are not
default paid. 
default              defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe went through a process
default—
default 
defaultQ56 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYou
default are not paid, so it is a zero tariff.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThis is a separate issue to the emergency admissions put through A and E. We went through a process when this was being discussed
default,
default which was quite widely shared with the clinical community about what is 
defaultand is not 
defaultreasonable to expect
default. 
defaultFor example, people who have to come back for chemotherapy who would clock in as admissions on
default the administrative database don’
defaultt count. So we have a significant series of inclusions. The other area 
defaultthat
default was debated is 
defaultthat, 
defaultif you are making a drive to have day
default&#x2011;
defaultcase
default surgery, for example, the more day
default&#x2011;
defaultcase
default surgery you do
default,
default then the greater the proportion of r
defaulteadmission, as you might expect; and w
defaulte are starting to see that.
defaultQ57 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultSo 
defaultreadmissions
default have increased in proportion and number in recent years.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI think we are at about the same level that we were, yes.
defaultQ58 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI want to bring in David 
defaultTredinnick
default 
defaultand move on to
default ambulance services, but
default,
default before I do
default,
default can I take you back, Sir Bruce, to some answers you gave earlier on about the responsibility that you have in NHS England for the delivery of NHS services? To several questions you answered, 
default“
defaultWell, that is a matter for the Department of Health,
default”
default implying that there was a very sharp divide between NHS services delivered by NHS England and social care services deliv
defaultered by social care authorities
default responsible, through a different line, to the Department of Health. 
defaultY
defaultour report on urgent care stressed, as this Committee has done as well, the importance of breaking down that distinction
default—first point. The second point is that
default through the better care fund, whether or not it is new money, that certainly gives 
defaultto 
defaultthe NHS an instrument to engage across that divide so that the issues that Barbara and Valerie were raising are no longer entirely matters for the Department of Health because they are matters within which NHS England should mix it, are they not?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultBut NHS England does not set the budget for social care. 
defaultWhat w
defaulte are trying 
defaultto do in 
defaultNHS England 
defaultis 
defaultto bring parties around the table. We accept that there are very serious problems with funding in social care, so we take that as read. The place that we try and do that is through the urgent care working groups where we have people from providers
default—
defaultfrom NHS England, Monitor, the TDA, social services, local government and so 
defaultforth
default. T
defaulthe aim of those groups is to identify where the problems lie for local delivery of, in particular, urgent care services, and in some cases it may be that things are stacking up at 
defaultthe front door because you can’
defaultt get people out of the back door of the hospital
default,
default and there are complex mixes that create different scenarios. The idea is that those groups will identify where the challenges lie and use, in particular, some of the 70% of the tariff that is held back for those readmissions to try and address those issues. Of course, some of the issues can simply be addressed by having the right people around the table.
defaultQ59 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am going to have one more go. What you describe I accept as far as it goes, but the implication then is that a spending decision by a social care authority in the local government context is something which th
defaulte NHS has to accept 
defaultas a given. Surely the whole point about the better care fund is that that is not the case and that it ought to be a negotiation and not limited to £3.8 billion either.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThose are two important points. The first is that the better care fund is not up and running yet. So the better care fund, I think
default—
defaultQ60 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe principle 
defaultis
default, is it not?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe principle is, but there are several issues. First
default of all
default, we need to understand that the £3.8 billion 
defaultthat
default is going to be put into the better care fund is not sitting in a bank vault somewhere unused. It is already being
default used for delivering services. 
defaultThat is the first point. 
defaultThe second point is that there has been a lot of discussion about the rules that have to be put around the application or the use of the better care fund. In particular, as medical director, I am int
defaulterested in two particular areas. O
defaultne is the provision of social services seven days a week to help us to get people out of hospital; I have forgotten the second one
default—
default 
defaultQ61 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default Can I stop you there? 
defaultThat is really fantasy. I do
defaultn’t
default know what I have to say to impress upon you, but we are talking about £2.68 billion being taken out of it. We have had this in debates with the Secretary of State in health questions downstairs in the Chamber. As to the notion of applying a seven
default&#x2011;
defaultday
default working week to social services when it is being cut left
default,
default right and centre
default, 
defaultand my colleague has said some local authorities do not have to cut
default, 
defaultI am afraid my local authority had to cut because £100 million cannot be found out
default of the non
default&#x2011;
defaultsocial care budget—it cannot—
defaultparticularly not when there is £75 million more to come. As to the notion of any extension of social care across the weekend, my local authority is just about to cut 300 posts from its staffing. All that we are having is fewer care packages and less staff to do assessments and 
defaultless staff 
defaultto work
default on this.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI rest my case
default—
defaultQ62 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWe 
defaulthave
default 
defaulteven 
defaultgot
default less director time.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI rest my case about why that should be addressed to the Department of Health, Chair. I think Barbara 
defaultKeeley
default has made 
defaultthe case
default extremely well.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultBut it is your issue, though. You cannot deal with the issues that you need to deal with and 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are talking about here unless we can bottom this issue. Ministers are just in denial about it all the time.
defaultQ63 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultYou are 
defaultbasically
default saying that integrated care and the whole package that you are the front door of 
defaultis
default a joke and a charade because integrated care means it has to work right across the piece. You are accepting, 
default“
defaultThis is the bit we can do and everything else is over there. We actually believe it should be delivered,
default” but when they can’
defaultt deliver it you say, 
default“
defaultOh, well, oh, dear
default, w
defaulte have this small amount of money in integrated care.
default”
default I do accept you are going to grow that phenomenally to £50 billion, but that is just going to cause other parts of
default the health service to collapse; y
defaultou know it as well as I do. How can you sit there and not 
defaultin your heads 
defaultjoin it all up? Can I just ask you a question about urgent care boards?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultCan I come back to you, please? The second thing is that this will be used to try and reduce the demand on accident and emergency care, but we need to be absolutely clear because there is a great scepticism in the NHS that this money will be used for those purposes. There is a fear that the labels will be taken off the money and that it will be used for filling in potholes and other significant things.
defaultChair:default 
defaultRosie, can I
default—
default 
defaultQ64 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultChair
default, what I don’
defaultt get is 
defaultthis. W
defaulthen you 
defaultcame
default 
defaultand we had a 
defaultSelect Committee on urgent care boards, 
defaultthat
default was one of the most unsatisfactory meetings we have had. We did not get any answers. It was all woolly
default,
default and today 
defaultit 
defaultis still woolly. I would like to pose you a really simple question: are those board meetings public, are the minutes public, and can everyone else see what woolly nonsense is going on?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI
default don’
defaultt know 
defaultwhether the meetings are public, but
default I can let you know.
defaultQ65 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default But 
defaultwhy
default can
default’
defaultt they be?
defaultChair:default 
defaultSir Bruce says he does not know so 
defaultperhaps 
defaultwe can find out. It is a question of fact about which we should be able to get an answer relatively easily.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe will make sure you get an answer.
defaultChair:default W
defaulte are at risk of spending all afternoon talking about this and I think we might make a passing reference to this part of the conversation in our report.
defaultQ66 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWe are ready to move on to the performance of ambulance services and
default,
default in particular
default,
default handover delays. By coincidence, I am going out with 
defaultHinckley
default ambulance service on Friday in my constituency. Is it right that the handover delays between ambulance crews and emergency departments have been reduced but
default,
default unfortunately
default,
default trolley waits have gone up? 
defaultI
defaults it the case that addressing delays in one part of the emergency system simply pushed the pressure on to another part of the system so we actually do not have an improvement?
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: 
defaultThe first thing is yes, it is true that, from the published statistics, ambulance handover delays have decreased. From the latest figures that were published, they are down about a 1
default,
default000 overall on the same week last year. 
defaultYou have made a very good point as well 
defaultabout the urgent and emergency care system as a whole
default. S
defaulto
default,
default when we look at part of the system in isolation
default,
default we can measure a certain part of it, but
default,
default inevitably
default,
default patients are on 
defaulta 
defaultpathway in that system and there are a variety of services that they pass through. 
defaultO
defaultne of the things we have tried to say as part of the urgent care review
default—
defaultand Keith may want to come in after I have spoken
default—
defaultis that we need t
defaulto look at the system as a whole and
default not just look at one 
defaultcomponent part of it, in terms of how we make improvements across that whole system to make it better for patients.
defaultQ67 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultProfessor 
defaultWillett
default, earlier on you were talk
defaulting about a ward with trolleys—
defaulta huge waiting area
default,
default in other words. Is this the reality then, that
default,
default overall
default,
default there is not an improvement? I am not clear from the answer whether things are better or not.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: I think w
defaulte are broadly where we were last year. If we look across the piece, some of the figures are slightly up and some are slightly down
default,
default but, in general, we are where we were last year. Having said that, there has been a 6.7% increase in admissions, so we are where we were despite the annual climb that we have seen for the last three years in work
default 
defaultload. So we are in a holding position. I think last time we were here we were saying the system is unsustainable and we will do what we can within the current constraints. But, going forward, we have to change the system more radically.
defaultQ68 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Just s
defaulto I am 
defaultabsolutely
default clear, are you saying that it is much the same
default—
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ69 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default —
defaultbut 
defaultyou
default have taken care of the increase in demand
default,
default or it is much the same and you have not taken care of the increase in demand?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultWe are at week 41 and I would be foolish to say in January that we have done it
default,
default because this is not the end of the winter season, for sure. I would say at the moment
default—
defaultQ70 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultYou have 
defaultalready
default told us that January and February are the slackest months.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultFor attendances but not admissions. They are the busiest month
defaults
default for admissions
default,
default and that is the problem. A and E has to shift from seeing lots of patients who can go home to one that has to hold and admit a large number of patients. That is the issue at this time of the year. So I would say we are broadly where we were last year
default,
default and we have accommodated the slight increase in activity that there has been to date.
defaultQ71 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you. Moving on to the fines that are
default levied against acute trusts that
default delay handover, are you intending to reinvest those in ambulance services? Is that the plan?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThe fines system that is there is used by some commissioning CCGs and they commission ambulance services. The idea of the fines is not to make the fines. The idea of the fines 
defaultreally 
defaultis a way to make people aware and to concent
defaultrate on looking at the pathway, and t
defaulthat is something that I would imagine 
defaultfor
default most urgent care working groups
default. W
defaulthere we have attended those, 
defaultI think those 
defaultare really impressive groups
default.
default 
defaultIt is 
defaultwhere the CCG chair
defaulting
default the group sit
defaults
default down with the local GPs, 
defaultthe 
defaultpatient representatives, the local authority, community
default health, the ambulance service and 
defaultthe acute trust providers
default.
default 
defaultE
defaultverybody is in that room. I have to say, from a clinician
default’
defaults point of view, that this is the first time that has ever really happened in health
default 
defaultcare in my career. 
defaultI
defaultt is a big step forward
default,
default and that is where people are now not talking so
default much about penalties and money, 
defaultbecause, to be honest, there is
defaultn’t
default any 
defaultnew money that is moving around. What they are 
defaulttalking about 
defaultis 
defaulthow they defragment the system
default and
default how, as mutually 
defaultaccountable 
defaultorganisations, they can help patients 
defaultmove through the system. They were put in to address the winter pressures
default,
default but I have to say I think they have been a very impressive organisational structure 
defaultthat has come in and sets
default in good stead what we will want them to do for the urgent emergency care review going forward
default,
default because 
defaultthey are
default new discussions. 
defaultQ72 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI accept and quite understand that getting people round 
defaultthe
default table improves things
default—“
defaultTo jaw
default&#x2011;
defaultjaw
default is always better 
defaultthan
default to war
default&#x2011;
defaultwar
default”—
defaultbut I am still not clear from your answer as to whether you as a clinician want the fines money to be reinvested in ambulance services.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYou can invest it where you think the problem is locally
default,
default and that is what the Health and Social Care Act has given the opportunity to do. Local commissioners will be able to decide where the blocks are in the local services and best spend the money allocated. 
defaultQ73 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultLast 
defaultyear
default the clinical commissioning groups that commission ambulance services were given an extra £14 million in December. Why was that given to them at such a late stage in the year
default, please
default? 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultWinter pressure moneys in general have been given late and that is why this year it was done very differently; 
defaultit was done early, and 
defaultthe moneys were allocated much earlier. This year there was £15 million allocated much earlier in the year.
defaultQ74 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI 
defaultk
defaultnow perhaps, 
defaultthrough you, 
defaultChair, that colleagues want to come in on this, but earlier on the Chair, I think it is fair to say, expressed some astonishment at the lack of monitoring that had been going on in the Department in respect of something else, but can you tell me what monitoring does NHS England undertake to try and understand how its funding is being used and what has proved effective in alleviating pressure on the ambulance services? How do you keep a track of all this is the simple question?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYou asked about the monitoring.
defaultQ75 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThere are 
defaulttwo
default questions. How do you monitor what is going on? Have you got effective systems in place? I suspect that they are not very effective, as we have already heard from Sir Bruce that he is putting in systems that I think many of us 
defaulta
defaultround this table would have expected to have been in place already. I share the shock of the Chairman. 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultSome data metrics are reported nationally from the ambulance service performance and some are reported locally, so we know the ambulance response times are nationally reported and those are published. Locally
default,
default there are care quality standards as well that are requirements of the ambulance service and they are reported locally to the commissioners. 
defaultT
defaulthe CCGs
default—
defaultthe local commissioners
default—
defaultas I have said, are commissioning just about all the elements
default now of the urgent care pathway. S
defaulto they do commission ambulance services, 111, 
defaultout-of-
defaulthours services, A and E services and the acute hospital services. 
defaultT
defaulthe reporting is 
defaultdone 
defaultlocally and they have the statutory responsibility for commissioning ambulance services. There are national figures that are published, which are available to everybody, and there are local standards that are reported to the CCGs and they will be performanc
defaulte-
defaultmanaging the contracts they have with the ambulance services.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultThank you very much.
defaultChair: defaultAndrew Percy, I think I am right in saying, is the Committee
default’
defaults only first responder.
defaultQ76 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultYes
default—
default20 
defaulthours
default of duty every weekend with 
defaultYorkshire
default ambulance service, including this last one
default—a
default part
default&#x2011;
defaulttime MP
default, yes
default. What concerns me when
defaultever
default we talk about ambulance services is 
defaultthat I don’
defaultt really think we value them in the way that we should
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe conversation always tends to be as to how quickly 
defaultthey are getting somebody
default to hospital and how quickly they are handing somebody over. We still see it very much as a scoop
default&#x2011;
defaultand
default&#x2011;
defaultcarry
default service. We have been running a
defaultn advanced paramedic
default trial in Goole, which I was quite vocal in trying to get for the town because we had terrible response times, and in the first six weeks of that trial
default—
defaultwe 
defaultactually 
defaulthad the Secretary of State in Goole this last week to hear about 
defaultit—
defaultthey saved 56 double
default&#x2011;
defaultcrew
default man hours
default,
default and 23 people who would have had to have been conveyed some 25 miles to Scunthorpe A and E were instead treated in their own homes. 
defaultI have been looking at models around the world and I was in communication with the Paramedic Academy of British Columbia
default, which has
default been looking at this
default,
default and 
defaultI know 
defaulta lot of work has been done in the States on community 
defaultparamedicine
default, as they call
default it. We don’
defaultt value it enough. What is the actual agenda
default,
default and who is going to drive that for a proper community 
defaultparamedicine
default role? Whenever I talk to anybody, everybody kind of says, 
default“
defaultWe need to make better use of it,
default”
default but at the end of the day
default,
default for the CCG
default,
default it still comes down to the targets because that is what they are paying the ambulance service for
default,
default and
default,
default 
defaultfor the 
defaultacute trust
default,
default it is how quickly t
defaulthey can get them back out. I don’
defaultt see anything about 
defaultdealing with 
defaultthat. Particularly in rural areas, the Joint Committee on Rural Emergency Care in the 
defaultUS
default has looked at this, and in a rural setting in particular, where we 
defaultnever had walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres and we don’
defaultt really know who our out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default GP provider is, we need to do more about this. But the money that came this year came very late to ambulance t
defaultrusts and went to acute trusts—
defaultagain
default, CCGs and
default all the rest of it. When is somebody going 
defaultto 
defaultgrab this issue and really develop community 
defaultparamedicine
default?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultWe are grabbing it now. We have had no end of chances to talk about the review
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultou will have read the review and seen
default that 
defaultthe paramedic profile was very high in the review and 
defaultin 
defaultwhat we planned. One 
defaultof 
defaultthe eight work programmes we have is around ambulance service and paramedics. We have talked exactly about that, about moving 
defaultparamedics away from the public perception of their role, which has been around
default predomi
defaultnantly assessing and conveying—the scoop and run—
defaultto one in which we wish to turn paramedics, or a portion of the paramedic service, into a mobi
defaultle community treatment service. So
default they will be part of the treatment response 
defaultin maintaining patients at home, and we don’
defaultt have to go to 
defaultBritish Columbia
default: actually, one of the best examples is in the south.
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultI
default’
defaultm quite happy to, though.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes, I am sure. One of the best examples is in the south
default&#x2011;
defaulteast coast ambulance service
default,
default where they now have enhanced paramedics who are working with GPs in primary care. When a call comes in that sounds like it is a frail elderly patient or 
defaulta
default patient 
defaultwith
default a long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm condition, they have a priority dispatch to one of those trained paramedics
default,
default who will assess that patient, which is not something the paramedics traditionally have included in their curriculum
default. T
defaultheir curriculum has been much more around resuscitation and injury
default&#x2011;
defaulttype
default response
default;
default this is a different expertise for them
default. The paramedic will then contact the GP and work with the GP practice
default to initiate treatment in the home, bring in whatever support is needed from 
defaultthe 
defaultcommunity or from the GP practice in order to manage that patient at home. That is the model we want to go to
default.
default 
defaultIt
default is one of the things we have specifically put in the report and the working group is now into the delivery phase of working up.
defaultQ77 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultJust to follow 
defaultup
default on that, the tariff system was often criticised in the past for incentivising agai
defaultnst that kind of model. Has that
default been addressed adequately yet
default,
default and do you think the targets which we have, which are obviously still the main focus, 
defaultare 
defaultpotentially damaged developing that model too?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultMy view on that is that
default,
default as we go through the review, we are build
defaulting the review around what we wa
defaultnt as the best patient cli
defaultnical model for the new service.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat includes paramedics, how ambulances respond, the medical support and the paramedic support when they are at the scene so that they are not there in isolation. One of the things we have said about the review is that no patient or clinical consult should occur in isolation; there should always
default be somebody else to support you
default so 
defaultthat, 
defaultif you have a concern 
defaultthat 
defaultyou think you are going to have to move the patient to a higher level of care, you can get advice. 
defaultH
defaultaving built the clinical model
default—
defaultwe have the clinical standards in place
default and
default are workin
defaultg with Monitor closely on this—what we will do is 
defaultlook at all the tariffs, 
defaultthe incentives and
default the qua
defaultlity metrics that go with that 
defaultthat the patients and the clinicians believe best portray the service that they want to see. To our mind, in terms of the review, over the next 12 months we will be looking at all of those things and I would expect many of them to change to something that fits what we need in the new system. 
defaultChair:default 
defaultBarbara, do you want to come in on winter pressures?
defaultQ78 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default I can do, yes. 
defaultWe have been round the £400 million funding and the further £250 million extra that is being made available. Is it not the case now, in terms of all the points you have discussed, that
default,
default without short
default&#x2011;
defaultterm additional funding now being made available every year
default,
default urgent and emergency care systems will not actually meet demand? 
defaultA
defaultre we now in a situation wher
defaulte we need this additional money 
defaultand more 
defaultthan this money 
defaultto cope? If you take it away, how will we get through?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe are working within a constrained envelope
default,
default and one of the things that we want to tackle 
defaultand address 
defaultas part of this review
default—
defaultand Keith will say a couple of words about this in a moment
default—
defaultis 
defaultreally to address 
defaultthe funding system of the way we deliver urgent and emergency care
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat has to be coupled with how we deliver urgent and emergency care. If you look at the review that we have conducted, there is a spectrum of things that we have to do
default,
default which starts with encouraging people to do more self
default&#x2011;
defaultcare, ensuring that we get appropriate advice to people at the time that they need it
default.
default 
defaultP
defaultart of that is beefing up 111, ensuring that people get to the right place when they need care, ensuring that 
defaultthat
default right place for conditions which are not serious is as close to home as
default possible.
default 
defaultW
defaulte think that there is more that we can provide close to home
default. U
defaultsing paramedics to deliver care in the home is an example
default of that
default, rather than simply using them as transport agents
default. F
defaultinally, we need to link all of these u
defaultrgent care centres—for want of a better word—
defaulttogether in a network. 
defaultA
defaultt the moment we have quite a confusing system. 
defaultF
defaultor people who are interested in these kinds of things, 
defaultthere are 
default22 different names for walk
default&#x2011;
defaultin centres
default—
defaultminor injuries units, urgent care centres, GP
default&#x2011;
defaultled
default this
default—
defaultso we need to standardise that. We need to ensure that they are linked into
default—
default 
defaultQ79 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default Could I stop you at that point? 
defaultThere was a heart
default&#x2011;
defaultrending report of a baby who died because h
defaultis
default parents did not know the 
defaultdifference
default between the differently named centres. They turned up at a hospital and lost the time that they needed. With tragic cases like tha
defaultt, surely you look at this mish
defaultmash
default—
defaultyou find it confusing
default—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. I think every
default—
default 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIf we are having deaths attributable to people just not understanding the different statuses, clearly you have a problem.
defaultQ80 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultOr you could 
defaultkeep
default A and Es open. That would be a revolutionary thing, wouldn
default’
defaultt it?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultOne of the things we need to be clear about is that not all A and Es are the same.
defaultQ81 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThe public are not clear about that.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, and it is interesting how we have got there. If you go back to when DGHs were set up in the early 1970s, at that time most DGHs could treat most patients with most conditions to a reasonable or good standard of the day and it was something that the NHS was very proud of. But then medical science advanced in a way which meant that not all places would either have the expertise or the expensive kit for dealing with complicated things. We have now 
defaultgot to
default a position where, for example, major trauma can only be dealt with effectively in certain centres; heart attacks, similarly, can only get the best care if there is the best expertise and the best facilities available; and similarly with strokes.
defaultQ82 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default But don’t 
defaultyou 
defaultworry
default that the public doesn’
defaultt understand this?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultIndeed. One of the things that we propose in this review is categorising A and Es. 
defaultW
defaulte see a scenario where there are major centres which can t
defaultreat particularly complex things.
default Keith was involved, for example, in reorganising trauma services for this country when he was a national clinical director in the Department of Health. Within the first year of implementing that
default,
default there was a 20% increase in survival for people with major trauma. We have also seen that the reorganisation of stroke services in 
defaultLondon
default, from 31 centres down to eight, has resulted in a much lower mortality rate, 
defaultwith 
defaultmore people returning to independent living, 
defaulta 
defaultshorter length of stay and considerable savings in terms of tens of millions of pounds. So we know that we need to reorganise our A and E services for serious conditions, but we also need to provide a much better offer, I think, than currently exists locally. By that
default,
default I mean we need to provide a good kind of portal of entry into the urgent care system, and you are quite right to point out the confusion that people have. 
defaultW
defaulte also need to provide a service which takes demand, if you like, off A and Es. I do not know whether, Keith, you want to run through the kind of steps that 
defaultwe 
defaultwill
default—
default 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultWe m
defaultay have to stop soon for a vote.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Oh, I’m sorry.
defaultQ83 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault: defaultI just think there are issues with what you said. I noted tha
defaultt the BMA chair said in his new-
defaultyear message that in the post
default&#x2011;
defaultHealth
default and Social Care Act nobody was in charge
default,
default and the difficulty about these reconfigurations you are talking about is 
defaultthat 
defaultit feels impossible to get to where you wa
defaultnt to go to. 
defaultCan I also touch on this
default?
default You have mentioned NHS 111 in passing because that is said to be part of the solution for alleviating pressure on emergency departments, but I note that
default,
default even 
defaultwith 
defaulta small thing like getting the new
default&#x2011;
defaultlook
default question summaries out to GPs, GPs have said that they 
defaultare still
default useless
default. T
defaulthat is something I read over the weekend
default; 
defaultyou change information that you send out to GPs after NHS 111 has been used and GPs are still unhappy with it. It does not seem to be improving; it does not seem to be getting to where you need it to be
default, which is part of the solution and
default not part of the problem.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI think most people are signed up to the concept of 
default111 as being a good thing, 
defaultthe fact that you can
default—
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultNot all.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultNot at all, I am afraid.
default              
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Okay.
defaultRosie Cooper:default It is n
defaultearly as bad as the ambulance service, 
default“
defaultAre you sure you are dead?
default”
defaultQ84 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default N
defaultot in this 
defaultHouse
default. There 
defaultare
default very bad experiences across the p
defaultie
defaultce.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe concept, I think
default—
defaultQ85 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultIt is the clinical 
defaultback
default&#x2011;
defaultup behind it.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
default111 got off to a rocky start
default,
default but we are in a much better place now
default, after a number of ventures—
defaultand I will ask Emma to say a few words
default—
defaultwhere c
defaultalls are being answered quickly,
default 
defaultand 
default88% of people are satisfied or very satisfied with the service, which
default,
default coincidentally
default,
default is exactly the same percentage number of people who are happy or very happy with their GPs.
defaultQ86 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThere
default is a different purpose here. This has to guide people to A and E or not, does it not?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultIndeed. The original idea of 
default111 was
default that it would guide you to wherever you needed to be
default. It would guide you
default to A and E if that was the appropriate place, to your GP if
default that was the appropriate place, or
default to mental health or dental services if those were the right places. Consequently
default—
default 
defaultQ87 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default You 
defaultdon’t
default need to tell us. We know how it works. We used to have something called NHS Direct that did the job quite well before you replaced it with something which does it less well. What evidence is there that it is now moving in the right direction?
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: I think w
defaulthat we are seeing from the latest figures is that 98% of calls are answered within 60 second
defaults
default. The abandonment rate is under 1%. It is sending approximately 11% of patients to 999. It is actually sending only around 7% of patients to A and E. If you compare that, when patients are asked what they would have done if they had not phoned 111, 24% said that they would have gone to A and E. So the fact it is only actually directing 7% to A and E shows that it is influencing patient flow.
defaultQ88 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultHow
default does that compare to NHS Direct?
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: 
defaultI do not have the figures with me in terms of NHS Direct
default,
default but what we know from 111 is that approximately 25% of patients do in the 111 call speak to a clinician 
defaultand they do that within the actual call as it occurs. They are not called back. NHS Direct used to work on 
defaulta 
defaultcall
default&#x2011;
defaultback model whereby a patient would wait to be phoned back by a nurse. 
defaultW
defaulte know that
default,
default if patients suffer from delays, if they are 
defaultsat
default there waiting to be called back, they will often make 
defaultanother
default decision 
defaultand
default attend another service because they are anxious and 
defaultthey don’t
default know what to do. 
defaultI
defaultf they are offered the opportunity within the actual 111 call to speak to a clinician, there is more chance that they will get to the right service or get an appointment within that call and not go elsewhere. 
defaultQ89 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default Quickly on this, I 
defaulthave just had a letter from a constituent who was very happy with 111, which is not what you
default expect. I know it is only one, but it is a start considering where we were. I have three quick points on them. When we did our review of urgent care services we talked about the sense in possibly bringing together the commissioning of ambulance services, 111 and out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default GP services. In my patch, 
defaultYorkshire
default ambulance service provides the 111, which is great because they also provide the ambulance service in part of the constituency, but not in the rest. Has any progress been made on that because it would seem that there is some value to that?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultAs you know, we have gone out to some interim providers and 111 was given
default,
default under those circumstances
default,
default to a number of ambulance services. Those ambulance services that are doing that feel that there is a synergy because they use the same software, they are under the same management system and they are under the same governance, which is an important point
default. F
defaulturthermore, the times that 111 is busy tend to be the times
default that 999 is not and vice versa, s
defaulto there are some economies that can be 
defaulthad
default through that. 
defaultW
defaulte will be going out to re
default&#x2011;
defaulttendering
default services in 2015. Do you want to add anything to that? 
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: 
defaultYes. The point I was going to make is that
default, as Bruce says, the NHS P
defaultathways clinical algorithms
default,
default which are used in all 111 services
default, are used
default by the majority of ambulance services nationally as well to triage their calls. 
defaultI
defaultn terms of the 
defaultway we set out in the review
default a vision for 111 in the future, 
defaultit is 
defaultthe ability to book into more services so that patients have the opportunity to have an appointment at the end of the 
defaultcall, access to the care record and
default the ability to speak to
default a wider range of professionals.
default 
defaultI think, 
defaultas NHS 
defaultEngland 
defaultworks to develop that specification, that will be 
defaultput 
defaultout there and it will be for commissioners to take a view in their local economy
default,
default looking at their services
default,
default to procure against that specification and see what model fits appropriately in their area in terms of who would best provide that service.
defaultChair:default 
defaultMay I interrupt for a second? I am told there is going to be a vote sometime in the next five or so minutes. I am in the hands of the Committee 
defaultas to 
defaultwhether we want to go at a gabble rate through the key questions or whether we want to come back. I would suggest we would, in truth, come back. 
defaultThat is f
defaultine. 
defaultW
defaulthen the bell goes, we shall depart and come back 10 minutes later.
defaultQ90 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default I won’t be able to; 
defaultI have a meeting 
defaultabout
default flood insurance
default, s
defaulto I 
defaultwon’t
default be back
default, but it is nothing personal. 
defaultAre we convinced, though
default—it is the same question on this as
default one of the issues that
default,
default when we did our review
default,
default we looked at
default and 
defaultw
defaultere concerned about—as to 
defaultthe clinical back
default&#x2011;
defaultup to this use of algorithms
default?
default I will give you an example. On Friday night I went to a job. I happened to be 
defaultoutside when I was called to it; it was a 111 job. S
defaulto I was there in 30 seconds, but the individual I went 
defaultto had a chest infection. 
defaultThe call
default came through and obviously it went all the way through 111 as c
defaulthest pain, difficulty breathing and
default all the rest of it, so it immediatel
defaulty became
default a red 1, red 2, or whatever
default. We got there, and in the end it was
default three ambulance assets
default there
default. Actually, the paramedic in that case did do a discharge from the home and all the rest of it, so that side of it worked well. But this got all the way through 111 and required a paramedic in an RRV and a double
default&#x2011;
defaultcrewed
default ambulance to appear. Are we really convinced that these algorithms work properly and that there is the clinical back
default&#x2011;
defaultup there? Who made that assessment
default,
default when actually the first question should have been, 
default“
defaultHave you been coughing up phlegm recently?
default”
default 
default“
defaultOh, yes, for the last two days
default.”
default 
default“
defaultWell, guess what?
default”
default 
defaultO
defaultne of the big criticisms we have been getting or we have heard and talked about in our re
defaultview is about the clinical back-
defaultup.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe alg
defaultorithms which are used are those of NHS P
defaultathways, which is a set of algorithms which are approved by a group chaired by the Royal College of Physicians
default. They 
defaulthave 
defaultquite significant—not “quite”; they’ve got 
defaultincredible
default 
defaultclinical support, but they are subject to continuous review. Do you want to add any more about the process?
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: 
defaultYes. They are subject to review
default,
default and, as Bruce says, that committee looks at them. The thing to bear in mind, as you will appreciate working as a first responder, is that when a patient makes a call the algorithms 
defaultobviously 
defaultdo have to err on the side of caution in terms of sending a patient to a service which appears appropriate. As you will accept, when the crew get there, 
defaultwhat
default may transpire 
defaultmight 
defaultbe different from what
default has been the case on the phone.
default 
defaultBut I think t
defaulthere has to be that degree of caution there. 
defaultQ91 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew Percy:default 
defaultIt 
defaultis less 
defaultof
default an issue if we have
default proper community 
defaultparamedicine
default, of course.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultIn terms of reviewing
default,
default what we are recommending going forward is around the conc
defaultept of supporting everybody. 
default111 would, we believe, benefit from having more clinic
defaultal support, the sort of support
default I 
defaultsaw when I
default visited the 
defaultYorkshire
default ambulance 111 service
default—
defaultvery impressive
default. What they have already done is to bring
default in quite a lot of clinical support
default. So they have got medical support and nursing support. T
defaulthey desperately need mental health support because that is a big requirement for 111 services
default,
default and dental, particularly over weekends, so the ability for someone phoning up who has jaw pain or toothache to be able to speak t
defaulto a dental nurse, to get advice and
default to be booked into an emergency NHS de
defaultntal slot the following morning. F
defaultor most people
default,
default that would satisfy them so that they would not then subsequently seek A and E because they have 
defaultgot
default the definitive care they need in 
defaulta
default package. 
defaultW
defaulthat we are proposing in the review and working on in the groups now is to come up with those recommendations. Clearly
default,
default all of those have to have a cost impact assessment 
defaultand 
defaultwhether or not they would deflect it, but certainly the analysis we have of 111 activity would certainly support that as being exactly what we need to do. There is a logic then in that that support could come from out of hours
default—
defaultthe GP service as well could be part of that
default—
defaultand many of the CCG
defaults have commissioned 111 and out of 
defaulthours together because it makes sense to combine the two
default,
default and also the medical support and the 999 ambulance service dispatch desks
default,
default because they could do with mental health, dental and maternity support. 
defaultT
defaulthis all has to come together and this is what we were talking about with 
default“
defaultdefragmenting the system.
default”
default 
defaultR
defaultather than having these bits working and being commissioned in isolation, we want them seen as a whole and in a way that manages the patient as close to home as possible with the right level of resource. Clearly
default,
default what you describe with three ambulance assets turning up is over the top.
defaultQ92 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default Emma, 
defaultydefaultou 
defaultmentioned
default that at 
defaultthe 
defaultend of the call you might get an appointment
default—
defaultan appointment with whom? What have you got available?
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: I am s
defaultorry, do you mean in terms of what we are proposing in the review? 
defaultQ93 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultNo. I am 
defaultasking
default you a
defaultbout what you just said before—
defaultthat that call may actually end with getting an appointment
default. A
defaultn app
defaultointment with who, what, where and 
defaultwhy?
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault:
default At the moment with 111 it depends what has been commissioned locally in terms of the availability of appointments and what sort of services are in the
default—
defaultQ94 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultYes
default, but what kind of
default—
default 
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: 
defaultYou could get an appointment with the GP out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default service. Some urgent care centres run appointments. What we are talking about in terms of the review in the future is opening up a much wider range of appointments for 111 to book into. That 
defaultactually 
defaultmay be an appointment at your own GP practice.
defaultQ95 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultWhy can
default’
defaultt I 
defaultphone
default up my own GP
default?
default Why do I need you? 
defaultEmma O’defaultDonnelldefault: 
defaultYou could phone up your own general practice
default, b
defaultut 
defaultsome patients may not—111 is about access in to
default urgent care services and it is around
default,
default 
default“P
defaulthone 111 if you are not sure.
default”
default It may be
default that a
default patient know
defaults
default that they are ill
default 
defaultbut not 
defaultwhat service they need, so 111
default guides them through that to take them to the service that best meets their needs.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultSo this could be a shortcut to getting a GP appointment when everybody else is hanging on the phone. Is that what is going to happen?
defaultChair:default 
defaultThat is a partially rhetorical question and we are invited to go and vote, so we will be back in either 10 or 20 minutes, or rather more than 2
default0 minutes if it is two votes.
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House.
defaultOn resuming— 
default&#xa0;
defaultChair:default 
defaultOur next question is in the hands of Mr George.
defaultQ96 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default Thank you very much. 
defaultI will certainly be taking the word 
default“
defaultdefragmentation
default”
default away wit
defaulth me; no, that’s fine. It is very helpful and it is a very helpful 
defaultimage 
defaultas well, and a very agreeable 
defaultimage
default too
default. 
defaultT
defaulthe 
default£250 million
default fun
defaultding which has been put forward with 
defaultthe intention 
defaultof alleviating or allegedly to alleviate
default winte
defaultr pressures, 
defaultaccording to the theme of the questions that have been raised
default, 
defaultmight be described as rewarding failure
default. 
defaultI know that, of course, one of the intentions of that funding is 
defaultalso 
defaultto assist with the additional resources going into primary care and the mana
defaultgement of long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions. 
defaultI 
defaultwant
default to draw our inquiry into the other side of the early discharge and then avoidable 
defaultadmissions—avoidable urgent episodes—
defaultcoming into the acute sector in the first place by putting investment in to primary care. 
defaultA
defaultpart from lots of warm words
default—and everyone
default seems to be repeating them, that we want to avoid unnecessary admissions and avoid unnecessary emergency episodes coming through the front door of the emergency departments
default—
defaultI cannot see any actual actions going on. I want
default 
defaultto get an impression from you as to what is going on to achieve this avoidance of emergency 
defaultepisodes in the first place
default,
default and whether there are very good examples or blueprints of
default this type of activity going on.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: The longer-
defaultterm ga
defaultme
default, of course, in all of this is that CCGs commission services, which
default—
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultCan you speak up slightly, please? We will shut the door.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: The longer-
defaultterm game is that we start to implement the changes which we have put in the urgent and emergency care review. In the meantime a lot of CCGs are doing really good things in terms of developing much more
default local services close to home. O
defaultne example might be the Corby urgent care centre
default, which is very well-equipped: i
defaultt is adjacent to a general practice
default; t
defaulthey have the facilities for doing blood tests and x
default&#x2011;
defaultrays
default; t
defaulthey see their patients within, broadly speaking, about 15 minutes
default,
default and by doing that they have been able to reduce the number
default of overnight stays for adults—
defaultin other words
default,
default unnecessary admissions to 
defaultthe local 
defaultKettering hospital. When I was there last
default,
default it was 
defaultreduced 
defaultby about 30% and I know they had aimed to get to 50%, which they thought was entirely feasible.
defaultQ97 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultSo
default, sorry,
default they 
defaultstill
default come through the front
default door of the urgent care centre;
default it is 
defaultjust that they do not stay over
defaultnight.
default There is avoidable admission—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultAnd the
defaulty don’
defaultt have to go to 
defaultKettering
default A and E, which is further away. Similarly, they have done the same with children
default.
default 
defaultO
defaultften
default,
default children get admitted simply for observation
default,
default but they provide an observation facility within their urgent care centre. 
defaultT
defaulthere are numerous examples like that around the country where new and innovative ways of delivering local urgent care closer to people
default’
defaults homes are being implemented.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultDo you want me to add 
defaultsomething 
defaultin terms of what we are doing?
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultYes.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: T
defaulthe review 
defaultis going forward, h
defaultaving
default put out the report in November. I
defaultf you go to that report
default,
default y
defaultou will see that we 
defaulttalked about how we could improv
defaulte self
default&#x2011;
defaultcare. A lot of people don’
defaultt want to bother the NHS but 
defaultthey often don’t
default have a route to get informat
defaultion otherwise;
default so we have put 
defaultexamples 
defaultin there. The way we have gone 
defaultabout describing the self
default&#x2011;
defaultcare,
default the ability to get a rapid contact with someone for advice, 
defaulthow to better use a pharmacist and all of these things,
default ha
defaults
default come from the groups. 
defaultW
defaulte have pull
defaulted together over the
default last year all the groups that live and breathe these problems
default. They are 
defaultthe patients, the 
defaultclinicians, the nurses, the GPs and
default the paramedics. We have had them all there saying, 
default“Look, w
defaulthat is it that works? Where were the blocks in the system?
default”
default Just about everything that we have described in the report as things we want to do exist already somewhere in the NHS and are working
default,
default and many of them have an evidence base behind them. What happens 
defaultalmost 
defaultnowhere is 
defaultanybody has put 
defaultall of them together. If you defragment the system and put them in a place in a whole community, then we will start to
default get what we want to do, 
defaultwhich is 
defaultto 
defaultavoid patients migrating to the A and E department
default,
default which in essence is currently the victim of its own success because it is always there and the lights are on. 
defaultT
defaulthe sorts of things we talk about 
defaultare
default improving very much, particularly in the digital age, how people can get advice in terms of using the internet or by telephone
default advice.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe campaign we have started at the moment publicly, which 
defaultyou 
defaultmay have already seen
default,
default 
defaultis 
defaultaround getting earlier access to advice and the role of the pharmacist. 
defaultT
defaulthe biggest interaction in the NHS 
defaultaround urgent care is with community pharmacists
default—
defaultover 400 million. That compares 
defaultwith
default only 20 million A and E attendances. There are 300 million GP attendances compared 
defaultwith
default only 20 million A and E attendances. 
defaultW
defaulthat we are describing all the way through the review is how 
defaultdo we 
defaultsupport the patient to get what they need at the earliest opportunity
default,
default without defaulting through a system
default? W
defaulte 
defaulthave 
defaulttalked 
defaultalready the paramedics and how 
defaultwe can use the
defaultm better.
default 
defaultA
defaultlso
default,
default we have some real anomalies in the system. For instance, you go to your GP on a Thursday morning and you have a 
defaultproblem—a 
defaultlong
default&#x2011;
defaultterm c
defaultondition, as you have suggested—
defaultyou and the GP have been struggling to sort it out for a few weeks and it is still not working well. The GP makes a decision. 
defaultOn 
defaultFriday evening you are unwell again and the out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default doctor is called in. Ver
defaulty often the out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default doctors have
default no relationship with the GP surgery so they d
defaulton’t know your records. You immediately don’
defaultt have so much confidence
default,
default but also 
defaultthey are 
defaultdisadvantaged in the decision making
default,
default so it is much more likely 
defaultfor you to be
default moved to hospital. Perhaps they do sort you out on the Friday evening, but by Sunday you are really unwell and then an ambulance is called, but the paramedic does not know what the out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default doctor did or what the GP did. It is almost impossible for them not to take you to A and E. 
defaultIt is 
defaultlinking those together and the information base, but also, importantly, what we have said in the review
default is—
defaultand
default,
default again
default,
default there are good examples of this
default—that 
defaultwe want the hospital specialists to be available to support the GPs
default,
default the paramedics and the out
default&#x2011;
defaultof
default&#x2011;
defaulthours
default teams in the community. 
defaultT
defaulthat is, as I said earlier, about there being no patient or specialist consultation going on without support. 
defaultIt
default is 
defaulta
default diabetic patient 
defaultwho
default had the p
defaultroblem on the Thursday morning and 
defaultit is a diabetic issue on the Friday evening. 
defaultW
defaulthat 
defaultthe situation
default really needs is for the GP to be able to phone the 
defaultdiabetologist
default at the hospital and have a one-to-
defaultone and say, 
default“
defaultWhat do I do?
default”
default 
defaultH
defaulte will say, 
default“
defaultI suggest we do this for the weekend and I will see them urgently in my clinic on Monday morning,
default”
default or whatever is appropriate. 
defaultWe 
defaultneed to get that definitive point of response to satisfy the patient
default’
defaults medical needs but also to give them confidence in the decision making. That would alleviate one or two more elements of the pathway being used and the patient arriving in A and E for what is something that really could have been sorted out in a better environment were the system not fragmented.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI am 
defaultjust 
defaultstaggered by some of your responses.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIt is just
default—
default 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAn urgent diabetic response would be
default—
defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultBefore you ask, can I finish on my questioning just so that we can stress these issues? In terms of understanding what is going on, clearly, as you have heard from Andrew Percy, we can, of course, in retrospect, in a number of cases interpret the chest pain as a common cold or something
default,
default rather than 
defaultas 
defaultsomething 
defaultcardiac
default, but 
defaultI guess there are certain 
defaultsymptoms
default that 
defaultone has to treat with great seriousness and it is only in retrospect 
defaultthat 
defaulty
defaultou discover it is a relatively—pardon the expression—
defaulttrivial and less significant issue. However, in looking at long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions such as diabetes
default,
default 
defaultasthma
default and other respiratory conditions, once again
default—
defaultand this is how the theory at least goes
default—surely 
defaultthe better management of the long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions avoids acute episodes happening.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndrew George:default 
defaultWe keep hearing the mantra that that is obviously what the system is intending to do
default,
default and we have heard that for years during the previous Government and the pres
defaultent. B
defaultut to what extent is that now happening with some of those long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm conditions
default,
default and is there good practice which provides a blueprint
default,
default which is then being disseminated effectively to primary care and commissioners around the country? So there are those two questions
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe final one is that of the resources necessary to do this. At a time of financial stringency when the whole system is continuing to seek to make efficiency gains, still the mantra is that we need to be concentrating on better resourcing the primary care sector to avoid pressures on secondary acute care. To what extent can that still happen? Can we frontload primary care when every time there is a political crisis politicians tend to throw money at A and E rather than at primary care? The last question may indeed be a political question that you cannot answer, but certainly in terms of addressing these issues I think you understand where I am coming from.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultIt is a really good point. The first part of your question was about what is happening in terms of dissemination. Much of that dissemination will happen through professional channels. That will be probably more important than any other channel. To give you an example of how things progress, diabetes used to have to be admitted to hospital to have the diagnosis and to initiate 
defaultyour 
defaulttreatment and you had to see a consultant. Then it moved out into primary care, into the GP arena. Then it moved into an arena where specialist nurses could take control, and eventually it is a combination of patients and support from their primary care services. This is starting to happen in other areas. 
defaultThe treatment of patients in hospital is much more expensive: 50% of our budget is in secondary care. 
defaultP
defaultrimary care commissioners will have a vested interest in improving their services in a way that they can treat people out of hospital. We hope that a combination of those two will
default be quite a strong driver. I don’
defaultt know if anyone else wants to comment.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: Also,
default the clinical world recognises that what we have is unsustainable at the moment. Nobody can do their job properly because it is 
defaultreally 
defaultvery difficult in the current environment. 
defaultW
defaulte are in 
defaulta
default position now, which we have not been before, to bring all the clinicians together to agree that. So
default,
default when the GPs are expressing their frustration about not being able to get a hospital specialist
default’
defaults advice, we can 
defaultnow 
defaultwork in that environment and look to commission across the whole pathway so that those specialists do ma
defaultke themselves available to GPs. I
defaultn the same way, the GP practices are available to support
default the paramedics or the hospital. A
default patient
default, let’s say, with a mental health disorder is very difficult to assess, and 
defaultan elderly patient with dementia who 
defaultdoes not have a 
defaultcarer
default with them is very difficult to assess
default. 
defaultW
defaulte need to put all those things back together again
default,
default because, inevitably, the less informat
defaultion you have about the patient, the less knowledge you have, 
defaultthe more likely you are to default to a higher level of care setting
default,
default which can be inappropriate for the patient as well because hospitals are not the best places 
defaultto be for patients who don’
defaultt need to be there.
defaultAndrew George: defaultThank you very much
default.defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWe have a bet on the 
defaultCommittee
default about how long it takes to mention 
defaultTorbay
default and you have something there that
default 
defaultexists
default,
default where they are doing exactly what you think is just
default being invented at the minute, b
defaultut I want to come back to what you were saying earlier. You talked about a diabetic event. A diabetic event which leads to an emergency admission is 
defaultprobably because the person has passed out
default,
default not because they have just got diabetes and they think, 
default“Oh, 
defaultI must go to accident and emergency
default because I want someone to”—
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultI was not suggesting that. Most of the diabetic problems are around managing diabetes
default to 
defaultkeep your blood sugar at a stable level. 
defaultT
defaulthey a
defaultre getting recurrent infections;
default they may be having other problems
default,
default which, because their diabetes is not managed well
default—
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWith the greatest respect, we 
defaultneed to ask the questions. I don’t know where we are. I don’
defaultt know if we are talking about urgent care
default—
defaultChair:default 
defaultYou were asking a question to your choice.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: And perhaps Keith could have a chance to answer.
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultCan I just go back to the winter funding
default? M
defaultaybe, Sir Bruce, you are the person to ask about the winter funding
default allowance. There are two sets, aren’t there? There is 
default£250 million for the hospitals and £150 million for the CCGs. Is that right? Is that where it has gone?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo. Both tranches have gone into communities and they have been sub
default&#x2011;
defaultdivided
default, so som
defaulte are given to CCGs
default 
defaultand 
defaultsome of the money has gone
default—
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default You said
default 
default“
defaultcommunities
default,”
default but could you be a bit more specific?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, I was earlier on. I will just reiterate that it has gone to 371 areas. That £15 million has gone to 111. The urgent care working groups decide among themselves how the money is divided
default.
default 
defaultSo
default they are the people with the be
defaultst local knowledge. I am sorry, but 
defaultI had not answered that specifically earlier
default—
defaultmy apologies. 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultNo, that’s okay
default.defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe idea is that they will determine how that money is shared out because they know where the problems are.
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo £
default15
default million is going to NHS 111 and the rest 
defaultis 
defaultall going to the urgent care working groups.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, £371 million. 
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIn terms of accountability for that money, how are you satisfied that that money is actually going to, say, for example, primary 
defaultcare 
defaultor community care
default,
default rather than just paying locums to sort out the problems
default,
default which is what some of the written evidence has said? 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI am sure there is an element of that.
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultDo they have to be accountable to you?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo. They are accountable to a tripartite group, which is TDA, Monitor and NHS England. They submit plans that are reviewed by the tripartite group. That gets to the heart of some of the difficulties of the accountability because some parts of the system are accountable directly to NHS England and
default—
default 
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhich 
defaultbits
default?
default Tell us.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultCCGs would have their plans assured by NHS England, but
default,
default in terms of the delivery of urgent and emergency care services, some of those services are delivered in a hospital and NHS England has no jurisdiction within hospitals. 
defaultT
defaulthat 
defaulthas to be dealt with by the TDA
default 
defaultif it is not a foundation trust
default and Monitor if it is a foundation trust. To try and get around that, we have this so
default&#x2011;
defaultcalled tripartite oversight to try and join things together.
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default You just give the money. Y
defaultou would give the money but you would not be sure that that was not being 
defaultspent
default on locums, for example, rather than, say, for example, community care
default—
defaultlong
default&#x2011;
defaultterm sustainable solutions.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI think we can only be sure on how it is being spent now. The long
default&#x2011;
defaultterm sustainable solutions need to come out of those urgent care working groups in the longer term. They have
default only recently been established, 
defaultand Keith mentioned earlier that they are starting to prove their value. 
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut they
default 
defaultwere the urgent care boards previously, were they not?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe have just changed the name. I think in the light of the discussion
default—
defaultQ109 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default So t
defaulthey were the urgent care boards before. Is that right?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, because the urgent care boards gave a sort of grandiose impression.
defaultQ110 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultBut the urgent care 
defaultboards
default had to be set up because there was a gap under the Health and Social Care Act
default—
defaultis that right
default—
defaultbecause of the reorganisation?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYou can describe it as a gap, or 
defaultyou can describe it 
defaultas
default—
defaultQ111 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou would not have 
defaultinstigated
default them if there was not a gap.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThey were done directly really to respond to the winter pressures. 
defaultQ112 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI am sorry, can I 
defaultask
default Sir Bruce
default?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThey were set up to deal specifically with winter pressures, but the key thing about them is that there are different parties responsible for different parts of this system
default,
default and the urgent care working groups are a really important tool in joining those up, both financially and clinically.
defaultQ113 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultYou mentioned this tripartite group of people with lots of different roles. Is there one person who is the accountable officer who will report back for this use of public money
default,
default or do they just talk among themselves and give out the money to whoever they want?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThere
default are different levels of groups.
default 
defaultW
defaulte have a tripartite group at a regional level and that would report back through the regional director of NHS England. 
defaultQ114 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default U
defaultltimately it 
defaultwill
default come back to you.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultThank you.
defaultChair:default Rosie, you wanted to come in on this.
defaultQ115 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default Thank you. Would w
defaulthat you call the regional director of NHS England be what I would formally understand 
defaultto be
default 
defaultthe
default local area team?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo. We have 27 local area teams and then we have four regions. 
defaultT
defaulthe local area teams are nested within a region
default,
default and then we have a regional director for the region.
defaultQ116 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultDo you know who the regional director for 
defaultLancashire
default is
default, and the north-
defaultwest, I suppose?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultRichard Barker.
defaultQ117 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default Richard Barker—
defaultnever
default heard of him, which is really cool. Did any urgent care working group fail to produce an assurance plan to the satisfaction of the tripartite grouping?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI do
defaultn’
defaultt know the answer to that. We will have to go back and ask our operations directorate.
defaultQ118 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default Okay. Let’
defaults say that happened. Who at local level would lead developing the plan that would have to follow to deal with winter pressures?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThat would be co
default&#x2011;
defaultordinated through NHS England.
defaultQ119 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultSo that 
defaultwould
default be the
default—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe regional directors. 
defaultQ120 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default —
defaultinvisible
default regional director who we have never seen or heard of. Can I 
defaultjust ask you how LATs fit into your structure—the local area teams—
defaultand the people you have running those?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe have 27 local area teams
default,
default and, broadly speaking, they have a director, a medical director, a director of nursing and
default—
default 
defaultQ121 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultWhere do 
defaultthey
default fit in? 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThey are part of NHS England.
defaultQ122 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultDo they report to the 
defaultregional
default director?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, they do. They report to the regional director and then the regional directors are part of the senior team.
defaultQ123 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIf there are only four regional directors, would it be fair to say that, at a local level, if the urgent care working group did not have a functional plan
default, 
defaultthe director of the LAT would probably be the person closest?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes, absolutely, because he would sit on the urgent care working group. 
defaultQ124 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultIn that case, I
default have to say to you, Sir Bruce, 
defaultthe answer terrifies me because I have never met Richard Barker
default—
defaulthe is Mr Invisible
default—
defaultand I am hopefully quite close to what is going on. In 
defaultLancashire
default we have a director of the LAT who is from local government
default,
default and, frankly, 
defaulthe hasn’t got a clue; he’
defaults hopeless. I have asked him questions about the future of Southport and 
defaultOrmskirk
default hospital
default—
defaultwe had a meeting
default—
defaultand in terms of emergency care, which is what we are talking about today
default,
default and the future and the robustness of the plans to do with that, he said, 
default“
defaultOh, well, Southport and 
defaultOrmskirk
default,
default”
default he assure
defaultd
default me, 
default“
defaultwould have an A and E or something close to it.
default”
default He did not understand that that response sent me into orbit. I asked him, 
default“
defaultWould 
default‘
defaultclose to it
default’
default mean the hospital wo
defaultuld have intensive care or high-
defaultdependency?
default” He hadn’t got a clue, and t
defaulthis is the man who 
defaultis developing or 
defaultwould be responsible for the local plan. He also told me that, for example, Southport and 
defaultOrmskirk
default, 
defaultwhile it deals with my
default constituents in
default west 
defaultLancashire
default,
default would be looked after by the director of the Mersey LAT
default.
default I 
defaultdo 
defaultaccept that she has 
defaultgot 
defaulta much better handle on things and I have far more confidence in her
default.
default 
defaultBut we are back to this. Y
defaultou are talking about fragmentation all the time today
default, and now we have a hospital
default which the director of Merseyside is in theory going to look after because he
default has defaulted, and yet the CCG—i.e. the primary care—
defaultwill be dealt with by Lancashire and him. How does that fit in with your, 
default“
defaultWe are going to defragment all this nonsense 
defaultand make it all tie in together”
default? He 
defaultobviously doesn’t understand. 
defaultPerhaps I can put a question to you. Define the difference between a major emergency centre
default—
defaultfor me, a trauma centre
default—
defaultand an emergency centre? Does an emergency centre
default have an intensive care or high-
defaultdependency? Does this guy have a clue? 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe way our thoughts are merging in terms of the difference between an emergency cent
defaultre and a major emergency centre is that
default an emergency centre will be very similar to what most people consider an ordinary A and E at the moment. There are three things that 
defaultreally 
defaultare important to deal with as an emergency because they cure people: one is trauma, and that particularly kills young people; the second is heart attacks; and the third is strokes. I have already alluded earlier that not all hospitals are fully equipped to provide the most modern treatment for that. We want to be absolutely transparent abo
defaultut that because I don’
defaultt think every member of the public knows
default that
default. They think all their A and Es are the same. 
defaultWhat we want to do is to 
defaulttry and understand which of those hospital
defaults
default can provide those services
default—
defaultit does not have to be all three of them
default—
defaultand we will regard those in a public and transparent fashion as 
defaultthe 
defaultmajor emergency centres. We will link them through a network to the remaining emergency centres.
defaultQ125 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultAbsolutely
default great. I have been involved in the health service for thousands 
defaultof 
defaultyears. They are
default,
default to me
default,
default trauma centres, exactly what people have been planning for 20 or 30 years. I get that. Tell me about emergency centres. 
defaultI
defaults my local hospital going to have an A and E
default,
default or is your emergency centre
default,
default ergo
default,
default not going to be an A and E of any real description because it is not going to have intensive care or high
default-
defaultdependency beds? That is the real question. Is that what this fool was telling me?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultFirst, I cannot speak
default for your hospital because I don’
defaultt know 
defaultthe
default details
default of your hospital
default.
defaultQ126 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default But it’s got
default 
defaultan
default A and E.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: What we will do is w
defaulte will run through the principles of what we need to underpin what would be a necessary set of supporting services for an urgent care centre. Would you like to do that, Keith?
defaultQ127 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultHang on. So you have a major emergency centre, which is my trauma centre. 
defaultA
defaultre you now saying that 
defaultanything
default that is not a major em
defaultergency centre, as you call it—a trauma centre, as I call it—
defaultis no
default longer going to be an A and E?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI did not say that at all.
defaultQ128 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultNo, but that 
defaultis
default what I am asking.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultPerhaps if you could let us finish and 
defaultlet 
defaultKeith explain some of the principles that are underpinning our thinking, it will help.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultPart of the reason for this, as Sir Bruce has said, is that currently what is called an A and E is very different around the country. One in seven do
defaultes
default not have on
default 
defaultsite one of the essential services that would be recognised to be part of an emergency hospital
default,
default and one in five do
defaultes
default not have children
default’
defaults services on site. 
defaultThe definition
default is that an emergency centre
default—
defaultand we use 
default“
defaultemergency centre
default,” but it is not a term we have fixed on and
default we are coming to a decision about what the names are
default—
defaultlooks very much like what you are calling an A and E at the moment. 
defaultA
defaultn emergency centre is an acute hospital that is set up to receive all types of patient. A major emergency centre is one
default,
default similarly
default,
default that receives all types of patients but also takes specialist referrals from other centres that do not have the specialist capacity. Those will be things, as Sir Bruce has said, like major trauma, stroke, primary coronary intervention for 
defaultheart attacks, vascular surgery and plastic surgery, etc
default. 
defaultI
defaultt will be more than the major trauma centres because some of those are not related to trauma. That is why we have envisaged at the moment that there will be a number of
default hospitals—
defaultprobably somewhere between 40 and 70
default—
defaultthat will have those specialist services on site
default, which
default are taking those specialist cases which make up less than 5% of activ
defaultity from the other hospitals. 
defaultIt 
defaultis also important to clarify the difference between receiving and treating. If you go to a very rural area of the country, it will be important, because of the geography, to have a facility that is capable of receiving all patients. Whitehaven is 47 miles from 
defaultCarlisle
default. We have no choice, if you like, in a situation like that
default. A
default rural community has to have 
defaultan emergency
default&#x2011;
defaultreceiving
default facility, b
defaultut the number of people in that area will be too small to justify, or even make safe,
default having critical care services or 
defaultsurgical s
defaultervices,
default because there will not be an activity to make that safe or to keep staff there. So we would describe 
defaultit as 
defaulta hospital that has to be able to receive everything
default,
default but for those patients who require the more specialist care
default,
default over and above what the critical mass of the population can support
default 
defaultas a hospital
default. T
defaulthose patients will be moved on and that is part of the emergency network. It is not just receiving; it is the very rapid and safe identification and transfer of those patients. 
defaultAs you move towards a more urban area, your critical mass of population
default increases and
default the number of services that will be in the hospital will also increase, so the number of patients w
defaultho will need to be transferred—
defaultrather
default,
default they will be a
defaultssessed and treated on the site—
defaultwill 
defaultreduce for two reasons. One is because the service may now be on site because the hospital is big enough to support it
default,
default or, secondl
defaulty, because you are now in a run 
defaulttime
default,
default in terms of the ambulance travel distance
default,
default to enable the paramedics to do the assessment and convey that patient very appropriately to the specialist centre, be that a major trauma centre or a stroke centre. 
defaultT
defaulthat is the configuration that we are describing. So there is one thing around receiving, assessing and initiating treatment and either transferring
default,
default or receiving, initiating treatment and actually taking them to hospital.
defaultQ129 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultThe 
defaultquestion
default is will ever
defaulty
default emergency centre, however described
default—
defaultemergency centre or major emergency centre
default—have intensive care and high-
defaultdependency facilities?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: W
defaulte will have to have a facility that will be able to manage those patients. What we are now doing in the delivery phase, having agreed where the review is going and having the consensus achieved from the clinician
defaults and from the patients in phase 1—we are now into phase 2—is 
defaultdefining the clinical standards
default,
default defining exactly what that means for each of the c
defaultentres and what the options are.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere will need to be options because what happens in a rural setting will be different
default,
default necessarily
default,
default from an urban setting.
default At this stage—
defaultQ130 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default I’ll tell you 
defaultwhat
default. Yes or no? W
defaultill every emergency centre have intensive care and high
default&#x2011;
defaultdependency
default—
defaultyes or no?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: It will have the—t
defaulthat is the work we are doing now. How that is delivered
default—
defaultQ131 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI think the 
defaultcountry
default needs to stand up and listen to what you are doing and saying. 
defaultThere was
default the young boy in the 
defaultSunday Mail
default, or whatever it was
default yesterday, 
defaultdying
default,
default and what this fool has alerted me to is that you are up to closing a lot more A and Es
default,
default and we will have the Secretary of State and Tory MPs campaigning to save their A an
defaultd E, while you are sitting there saying,
default 
default“
defaultThe closure has nothing to do with us.
default”
default It is absolutely outrageous.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo
default. C
defaultan I ask, have you read our review?
defaultQ132 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultI have 
defaultnot
default read your review.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: The
defaultn I do not think you are in a position to make those kind
defaults
default of remarks.
defaultQ133 default&#xa0; 
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultOkay
default. Let me say this, Sir Bruce
default—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultChairman
default—
default 
defaultRosie Cooper:default —
defaultI will make sure I go and read that review. 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThank you.
defaultRosie Cooper:default 
defaultBut the bottom line is 
defaultthat, if 
defaultyou cannot say whether 
defaultan emergency centre
default is going
default to have intensive care or high-
defaultdependency, it is not going to be an A and E of any description.
defaultChair:default Okay, 
defaultRosie, I have given you time. This is Parliament
default. This is
default where the people
default’
defaults views should be heard. Quickly, because we are running out of time, I think, Barbara wants to ask questions about staffing.
defaultQ134 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default Yes, because 
defaultstaffing
default is such an important issue. W
defaulte have touc
defaulthed on it, and 
defaultobviously there is a chronic shortage of both consultants and higher trainees in emergency medicine
default,
default and we have talked about the use of locums. You said, Sir Bruce, I think, that consultants will be required to work at weekends to ensure that care quality does not dip outside the working week. 
defaultBut w
defaulthat is being done to address the problem that the majority of emergency departments, as we reported earlier following an inquiry we did, cannot provide 16
default&#x2011;
defaulthour consultant coverage during the working week
default,
default let alone at weekends? It seems a peculiar thing that you have tried to stretch the existing consultant cover to weekends when we are not even covering the vast majority, 
defaultdoes it
default not? I think it was only 16% or 17% that were reaching
default the desired levels of staffing.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThere are two components to that. The first is the issue of emergency medicine doctors. The second is the issue of trying to provide safe comprehensive services for the citizens of this country seven days a week. They are related in some ways but not completely. When David 
defaultSowden
default was director of medical education at the 
defaultDH
default in 2010
default,
default he alerted me to the issues of training of emergency medicine doctors. So we established a group to try and look at those problems. Since then
default,
default we have increased the number of consultants by 300 and we have doubled the number of trainees. 
defaultThat task force reported and t
defaulthe work to try and address those issues has been taken up by Health Education England. I think we are getting into a much better position in terms of recruiting doctors to emergency medicine.
default We have—
defaultQ135 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default Can
default 
defaultI stop you 
defaultthere
default because I do not believe that is true?
default I asked Ministers a written question about this, about the fill rate for higher trainee posts
default,
default and it has tailed right off. In the last round of recruitment with 193 higher trainee po
defaultsts at ST4, 
defaultyou filled 37 out of 193. The fill rate has been low anyway, but the latest round of recruitment was worse. We have been told
default—
defaultI think we have talked quite extensively about this in earlier inquiries
default—
defaultthat people are voting with their feet. I know cases of people who are now GPs
default,
default who have left emergency medicine because they cannot stand the stress of it. It is confusing me if you say that we have solved the trainee problem because the figures I got from Ministers suggest that is not the case.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI am sorry if I gave the im
defaultpression that we have solved it. 
defaultI think that is wrong.
defaultQ136 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIt is actually getting worse, is it not?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: What I said was—well, t
defaulthe projections from Health Education England imply that it is getting better.
defaultQ137 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultNot at 
defaultthe
default higher trainee levels, which is what you need. You can fill trainee posts, but it is a long training, and if they get put off at the point of
default—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Shall I explain? 
defaultThere are two points of entry into training for emergency medicine doctors. One is really junior and the other is at about year 4
default,
default as you alluded to. For those that come in 
defaultat a 
defaultvery junior
default level
default, the recruitment rate is very good
default,
default but 
defaultwe have about a 25% attrition rate for those. For those that come in at a more senior level, we have not been able to fill the posts 
defaultthat
default well and there is still an attrition level.
defaultQ138 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault: defaultThat 
defaultis
default where the problem is, is
defaultn’t
default it?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: It is; it is.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere will be a delay before we get to a really good position on this. What Health Education England 
defaultis 
defaulttrying to do is to increase the number of trainees that enter at a lower level in order to mitigate the attrition rate 
defaultthat
default occurs higher up.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default I have to tell you
default from 
defaultthe
default f
defaultigures I have in front of me,
default 
defaultwhich I got from Ministers, 
defaultthat 
defaultit 
defaultdoes not seem to be working
default,
default because the vacancies number goes up but the number entering at that level does not seem to increase in proportion at all. So, as I said
default—
default 
defaultQ139 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultRather than having a contest at short notice about figures that most of us have not seen, could we ask for the 
defaultDepartment
default—
defaultSir Bruce has said he thinks this is trending in a better direction
default—
defaultto substantiate that with its own figures?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultWe could ask Health Education England as they 
defaulthave just 
defaultproduced a paper to their board a few weeks ago that addresses this.
defaultQ140 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIt is probably timely to say after this meeting today that
default,
default when you come to talk to us about this important topic, which is one of the most important issues facing the country at the mom
defaultent, it is important that we don’
defaultt have a series of things which you cannot answer or
default—
default 
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI am trying to answer.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultYes, 
defaultI understand that, but
default—
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: And 
defaultI have the details, but it is just that you have a different set of figures 
defaultfrom
default me.
defaultQ141 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default I got 
defaultthose
default by asking a p
defaultarliamentary qu
defaultestion of the Health Minister. If the Health Minister can’
defaultt tell me what the situation is
default—i
defaultn fact
default,
default other people have made clear to us that they were losing trainees at that point. I have brought that into it, but my question overall was
default,
default how can you stretch a situation which is full of vacancies and has a very high attrition rate
default—
defaultactually, is it going to make things worse
default—
defaultby asking those consultants to work weekends
default,
default when we 
defaulthaven’t got the coverage now? I don’
defaultt think we have solved the trainee problem. How can you move forward on this when it is such an issue now?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI think that 
default“
defaultweekends
default”
default conflates two issues
default. T
defaulthe emergency medicine doctors are already providing seven
default&#x2011;
defaultday
default services. Where we are asking for additional input at the weekend is from other consultant colleagues. 
defaultW
defaulte have a set of 10 clinical standards
default,
default which have been drawn up by colleagues in London
default,
default that define what good practice looks like in terms of assessing a person who is newly admitted to hospital
default;
default it defines the 
defaulttime to assessment for both—or it defines the 
defaultaccess to diagnostics, which is imp
defaultortant for making the diagnosis;
default and then it defines the time to a senior decision maker seeing those
default—
default 
defaultQ142 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultSo 
defaultyou
default are using non
default&#x2011;
defaultemergency
default medicine
default-
default trained people.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ143 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultThat 
defaultdoes 
defaultlead us to the next question, which is my final question. The Royal College of Physicians has warned that hospital trusts are using nurse practitioners and physician associates to deliver emergency care. Clearly
default,
default 
defaultwith
default the position of the shortfall of senior staff and the financial pressures, 
defaultit
default is understandable, but the feeling from the evidence they gave us is that 
defaultthat 
defaultis actually using those junior staff in an inappropriate way. Could you comment on that aspect of what they told us?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI am really sorry, but I did not get that.
defaultQ144 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultClearly
default,
default it is understandable that hospital trusts would start using nurse practitioners and physician associates
default,
default because they were so short of staff and because they were under such pressure, but the view expressed to us is that that is 
defaultan 
defaultinappropriate way to use junior staff
default—that 
defaultit is not appropriate to do that.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultLast Saturday I was in 
defaultIpswich
default where they have 
defaultnurse practitioners;
default 30% of all the patients that come in through their A and E are seen only by the nurse practitioner. 85% of those patients a
defaultre sent home and they have been—
defaultQ145 default&#xa0; 
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultSo you think that is fine. You think it is fine to use the staff in
default that way.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultI will just finish. They are trained up to treat quite significant co
defaultnditions, such as broken wrists and
default dislocated shoulders. They do significant suturing, they catheterise patients and, yes, this is appropriate. It is all down to the level of training that people get. It is the direction of travel in
default other parts of the world. I don’
defaultt know if you would like to add anything to that.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes. Emergency nurse practitioners are highly qualified. They have gone through extensive training and there are groups of patients who come to A and E that fall certainly within that skill mix and
default,
default in fact, if anything, arguably get a better response than they would because the doctors find that 
defaultthose doctors are
default tending to migrate to the more complex patients. Emergency nurse practitioners have been in the NHS now for over 20 years. They are very advanced in their training. It is a core part of the service and usi
defaultng that multidisciplinary team. S
defaulto there would be nurses 
defaultwho
default have mental health expertise, nurses 
defaultwho
default have physical injury expertise
default, and
default 
defaultthere will be 
defaultchildren
default’s nurses. That 
defaultmakes up part of the normal complement. It is an important part of addressing the gaps that there are in the medical work
default 
defaultforce.
defaultBarbara defaultKeeleydefault:default 
defaultIt sounds as if you need to convince the Royal College of Physicians of that
default because they have given—
defaultChair:default 
defaultWe will have one question from David 
defaultTredinnick
default and then I think we will probably have exhausted our time.
defaultQ146 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default Actually 
defaultI have 
defaulttwo
default questions, but I have been quite quiet 
defaulthere, Chair
default. I want to ask you, historically, whether there ever was a greater involvement of consultants at the weekend, and you have explained that A a
defaultnd E consultants are on standby.
default Is it something that has drifted over the years? Was it 
defaultsuch that when the national health s
defaultervice 
defaultwas set up 
defaultthere were still levels of consultants serving at weekends and that has just disappeared?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultIt is quite interesting. Most people will perhaps not realise that emergency medicine did not even exist as a specialty 30 years ago. So the front door of the hospital was always served by the inner
default&#x2011;
defaulthospital
default specialties coming forward. The whole of the emergency work
default 
defaultforce was junior staff, and it was appropriate because the cases that were presented on the whole were relatively straightforward; they were not as complex and elderly as they are now
default,
default and medicine was not advanced. 
defaultF
defaultor a heart attack 30 years ago
default,
default basically
default,
default the patient had morphine, they were admitted to hospital, put on a mo
defaultnitor and you took your chances. T
defaulthe mortality rate reflected that. Things have changed now. 
defaultW
defaultith the advances in medical care and the complexity of the patients
default,
default we now have a very di
defaultfferent need. We also had the Working Time Directives
default come in
default,
default which have reduced the experience overall that the junior doctors have. 
defaultW
defaulte have a different demand
default and 
defaulta different asset available
default, so there is 
defaultthis inevitable drive to requiring more consultants. I do not think the consultants have drifted away. 
defaultW
defaulthat has happened is that the requirements 
defaultthat now are needed in
default urgent care are very dif
defaultferent from the health care—
defaultwhat medicine can do and what the patients need.
defaultQ147 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultMy last 
defaultquestion
default is something slightly different. We live in an information technology age where we are all carrying electronic kit and we have video used in court rooms
default. I
defaultn the health service we have advice services down the li
defaultne using 121 and other services and 999,
default where people can categorise and make decisions. 
defaultHave you looked or a
defaultre you looking at the possibility of having consultants on duty at weekends 
defaultwho
default are available by video link from a centre to a range of hospitals? There must be many times where a junior doctor is faced with a decision that does not require the consultant to be present
default,
default where there is some issue about the relationship of one drug to another or something that just needs a feel. Are you looking at that?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThat is
default very much part of the review. 
defaultMaking the hospital specialist available to whoever in the network needs 
defaultto support them 
defaultis what we are doing. Some of that already goes on. A lot of the on
default&#x2011;
defaultcall
default consultants will now take th
defaulte urgent phone, so the calls don’
defaultt come through from another hospital to junior staff. A lot of the reporting of scans and x
default&#x2011;
defaultrays is done remotely now rather than having everybody in a hospital
default,
default and the technology will certainly allow it. That is part of one of the information work programmes that we have going forward in the next stage of the review.
defaultQ148 default&#xa0; 
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultWhy 
defaultn
defaultot have a room of senior consultants on duty and a red button in accident and emergencies where
default,
default if they really get stuck
default,
default they can at least talk to somebody who is experienced? Surely
default,
default that is a good use of IT? I read no IT in this briefing. Surely there must be some connection between the health service and what is going on in data, 
defaultin cyber
defaultspace. I sit on the Science and Technology Commi
defaultttee as well and we are doing Big D
defaultata in a couple of weeks
default’ time—
defaultthis extraordinary phenomenon of everybody being informe
defaultd about everything all the time—and yet I don’
defaultt see it in my notes here.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: It is in the review; so we have put it in.
defaultDavid defaultTredinnickdefault:default 
defaultI apologise.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultIt is in the review and we had one of the eight work packages entirely around information and knowledge transfer and that su
defaultpport
default. 
defaultW
defaulte have talked about how the 
defaultnetwork will support each other and that will be one of the mechanisms
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultou are right 
defaultthat 
defaultin remote 
defaultAmerica
default, in Dakota, they have exactly what you have described. So we are aware of all these things. What we need to do is to bring them in. In Dakota
default,
default they run their peripheral hospitals with one doctor and a team of consultants
default,
default who are a paediatrician, a surgeon and a radiologist all in a remote setting.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultThe precedent exists and has done for some
default time, for example, in neuro
defaultsurgery
default,
default where CT scans are transmitted down the line 
defaultin 
defaultbetween hospitals so that an expert neurosurgeon and 
defaultneuroradiologist
default can inspect them. So we agree with you entirely.
defaultChair:default 
defaultValerie has 
defaulta 
defaultfinal question.
defaultQ149 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI have 
defaultjust 
defaulta few quick ones, Sir Bruce, about the review. This is completed
default,
default and I 
defaultjust wanted
default to know what the time
default 
defaultframe 
defaulti
defaults. Is it now decided that there 
defaultare 
defaultgoing to be emergency centres and major emergency centres? Is that still up for grabs or is it just the review that has decided that?
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: Well, I think o
defaultne of the reasons we are here is 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are still listening. 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault: defaultOkay
default. defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultSo we have put this out. 
defaultW
defaulte have tried to conduct everything that we have done here absolutely in public so that people can feed into it. 
defaultIt is published. Everything that we have done as we have done it we have published 
defaulton NHS Choices and on the NHS England website, so thoughts that the Committee have would be 
defaultreally 
defaultgratefully received. 
defaultQ150 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIn addition to the ones you have 
defaultheard
default already.
defaultChair:default 
defaultIn a slightly more refined form possibly.
defaultProfessor Sir Bruce Keoghdefault: 
defaultNo, absolutely. Keith is leading on the sort of delivery s
defaultide of things and has several 
defaultwork
default 
defaultstreams. Do you want to talk about that?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultAll those work
default 
defaultstreams are happening there. Some of the things will happen very quickly because the urgent care working groups are out there wanting them. Some of the things around the tariff and how we change the funding will come in over the next year or two.
defaultQ151 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default It 
defaultwould
default be helpful—
defaultI know you say some of the things and y
defaultou know it, it is in your head, etc.—and it would be nice 
defaultif you could 
defaultjust 
defaultwrite to us and tell us what the work
default 
defaultstreams are.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThe last part of the report is about the timetable to implementation; it is in there.
defaultQ152 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default Okay; so that is fine. T
defaulthat is under way. I am quite keen to know what time frame you are working towards.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultThe overall ti
defaultme frame is three to five years
default because this is a whole
default&#x2011;
defaultsystem
default change. But some of the things
default will be—
defaultQ153 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultFor 
defaultwhat
default?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: For the whole-
defaultsystem change. This is the whole network construct, all the changes. Some of the things like paramedics changing their curriculum and learning how to manage patients is a curriculum change
default, so that will take the longest—
defaultsomewhere around five years. Some of the things about teams working together, sharing information, can happen now. 
defaultThirty-two
default million patients have a summary care record and we just have to link that up now. Some of the things can happen very quickly. The 111 service c
defaulthanges—the specification—
defaultcomes in for April 2015. 
defaultA
defaultll of those are laid out in a timetable.
defaultQ154 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultIs the
defaultre a danger that people won’t
default do anything
default—local 
defaultcommissioners 
defaultwon’t
default do anything
default—
defaultwhile they are waiting for this review?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: No; it is o
defaultn the contrary. We have been working wit
defaulth all of them. We have the CCGs
default 
defaultand 
defaultwe 
defaulthave a working group with the 
defaultNHS Commissioning Assembly and with clinical commissioners. We are working with them, with the area team directors
default,
default so they are fully informed. We have told people to keep going. That is why we are feeding them as much as we can because they are doing this at the same time as us.
defaultQ155 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultWhat are they doing? I am getting confused. Are they working towards major emergency centres and emergency centres? They are working towards that.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultAt this stage we are coming up with the specifications and the standards that those centres should be capable of delivering.
defaultQ156 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultI just 
defaultwant
default a yes o
defaultr no. You are dragging this out—y
defaultes or no
default.
default 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes.
defaultQ157 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAre they working towards major emergency centres? 
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultYes
default, t
defaulthey are working towards organising their networks at this stage.
defaultChair:default Valerie, o
defaultne more question.
defaultQ158 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultAre all the reconfigurations that are currently 
defaulton
defaultgoing going to 
defaults
defaulttop while this review is going
default on
default?
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultNo.
defaultQ159 default&#xa0; 
defaultValerie defaultVazdefault:default 
defaultSo there are 
defaultstill
default going to be reconfigurations and you are still working towards major
default emergency centres.
defaultProfessor Willettdefault: 
defaultIn the review
default,
default we have indicated that reconfigur
defaultations will proceed,
default 
defaultand 
defaultthey will take on
default board the advice, the guidance and
default the commissioning structure
default,
default as we produce it.
defaultChair:default 
defaultI am sorry, but I now have an 
defaultinquorate
default Committee. Before my colleague departs, I want to say thank you to you for your patience with us. We shall take account of what you have said in our report.
