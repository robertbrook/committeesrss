[normal]Appendix 1[bold]Case Study 1: Housing and independent living [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Andy, aged 32, was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and Bi-Polar affective disorder when he was 18 and has a long history of acute in-patient admissions and safeguarding concerns. A rehabilitation service, provided by the housing association Look Ahead, has helped him to live independently in a relatively short period of time and at less cost than residential care – the more common approach. It is estimated that this service has saved the NHS and local authority £241,670 by enabling Andy’s quick transition from in-patient service to living with only minimal need for care and support.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Look Ahead’s service provides intensive support for up to 11 individuals in self-contained accommodation and is staffed 24 hours a day. Residents have usually come from residential care and long-term in-patient stays prior to moving in and the service supports them to become fully independent. The service is a product of integrated working at its best as it was originally commissioned as part of a joint commissioning strategy by the local NHS and local authority following the closure of an in-patient rehabilitation ward. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]One year after moving to the rehabilitation service, Andy successfully applied to do a nursing diploma at City University, and volunteers for Tower Hamlets Centre for Mental Health. Six months later, Andy moved to his own flat with continued support from Look Ahead’s floating mental health service. Once Look Ahead is happy that he is well settled and can live independently, he will be discharged from the service.

[normal]Case study 2: Living in the community[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Anna, aged 30, has autistic spectrum disorder and a learning disability. She does not use words to communicate. After a year in an assessment and treatment hospital, Anna is now happily living in her own home, developed by Dolphin Square Foundation and managed by Yarrow in London, with round the clock support from a small well-trained team. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Close partnership working between three main agencies – Westminster Social Services, Kingswood NHS Assessment and Treatment Unit and Yarrow – meant that there was a shared awareness of Anna’s very complex needs and a joint willingness to seek solutions. Throughout the planning process, Yarrow Housing and the Dolphin Square Foundation frequently met with Westminster social services and Kingswood NHS Assessment and Treatment Unit to identify ways of improving the living environment for Anna.
[normal] 
[normal]Triple glazing and sound proofed walls ensure that neighbours are not disturbed by Anna’s vocalisations or loud music. A 
[normal]chromotherapy
[normal] bath, which provides a body massage with a whirlpool with coloured jets, was fitted to help Anna relax, be calm and have fun. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If Anna had not moved to her new home, she is highly likely to have remained in an assessment and treatment service, which would not have benefited her overall wellbeing. Not only are the fees for this type of service £3,500 per week, but the review of Winterbourne View highlighted the importance of reducing long-term stays in assessment and treatment centres. After the initial service to support Anna’s transition to her new home tapers off, this services shows an annual saving to health and social care budgets of £17,992, as compared with

[normal]Case study 3: Importance of housing in well-being[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Following a motorbike accident, Bruce needed multiple operations - including the amputation of a leg – and was left 
[normal]tetraplegic
[normal]. After his discharge from hospital, he was unable to walk or take care of himself and after 3 months, he attempted suicide. Bruce was referred to 
[normal]Papworth
[normal] Trust by the senior rehabilitation consultant at 
[normal]Addenbrooke's
[normal] Hospital. Through the support of the housing association 
[normal]Papworth
[normal] Trust, he is now living independently and is recovering from his severe depression in his own purpose designed home. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The specialist design of Bruce’s flat has been fundamental in enabling Bruce to live independently. 
[normal]The kitchen work surfaces and oven are at a height that he can use and the flat’s sinks and hob are height adjustable. Light switches are at elbow height, heating controls are accessible to him and doorways are wider than normal to allow access for his wheelchair. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Case study 4: Living independently in extra care housing[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Grace, aged 74, has dementia and until recently was neglecting her health and having difficulty managing at home on her own. Moving to an Accord Housing extra care scheme has meant that she can continue to have a home of her own, with access to care and support when she needs it.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A local authority social worker reviewed Grace’s care needs and she was referred to Accord Group’s 
[normal]Moxley
[normal] Court extra care scheme by a joint housing and social care allocation panel. If she had been moved to a residential care home under an ‘Elderly Mentally Ill’ placement, would have cost up to £600 per week – whereas residence in a scheme like 
[normal]Moxley
[normal] Court only costs £300 per week
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Even with her dementia, Grace can live independently in her own self-contained flat with care and support staff available at all times. She also has access to a range of communal facilities, including a hairdressing salon and assisted bathing service. Grace says that she is much happier at 
[normal]Moxley
[normal] Court and staff have helped her to mix with other residents in the scheme.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Living in an extra care scheme means that Grace’s care providers are able to be responsive rather than reactive. Ensuring Grace is in the most appropriate housing, with the care and support she needs, has prevented hospital admissions which may have occurred if she was left in her own flat.
