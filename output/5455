[normal]About the BVCA[bold]This response is submitted on behalf of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association ("BVCA").  
[normal]The BVCA is the industry body and 
[normal]public body advocate for the private equity and venture capital industry in the UK.  More than 500 firms make up the BVCA members, including over 2
[normal]0
[normal]0 private equity, mid
[normal]-
[normal]market and venture capital firms, together with over 2
[normal]0
[normal]0 professional advisory firms, 
[normal]including legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisers, corporate financiers, due diligence professionals, environmental advisers, transaction services providers, and placement agents. Additional members include international investors and funds-of-funds
[normal], secondary purchasers, university teams and academics and fellow national private equity and venture capital associations globally.
[normal] 
[normal]The House of Lords is interested in the context in which the proposed changes would be applied and the evidence should co
[normal]nsider whether the approach of the legislation is appropriate or whether the provisions such as those in the draft Finance Bill 2014 are a symptom of underlying problems with that approach. 
[normal]Introduction[bold]The draft Finance Bill 2014 covers four areas of par
[normal]tnership taxation.  
[normal]Of 
[normal]most 
[normal]concern 
[normal]for the private equity
[normal] and venture capital
[normal] industry are the provisions relating to
[normal] the taxation of limited liability partnership
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]“
[normal]LLP
[normal]s”
[normal])
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in particular the
[normal] introduction of the concept of a “salaried member”
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The LLP is now the industry standard entity through which investment management and advisory businesses 
[normal](“Manager
[normal]s
[normal]”)
[normal] 
[normal]operate in the UK
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]In a private equity 
[normal]and venture capital 
[normal]context, 
[normal]Manager
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]typically
[normal] 
[normal]comprise 
[normal]experienced 
[normal]senior
[normal] executives 
[normal]with 
[normal]an esta
[normal]blished investment track record
[normal]relevant industry experience
[normal] (
[normal]the 
[normal]“LLP Partners”
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]   
[normal]Although the BVCA is supportive of the aims of the anti-avoidance legislation, our members 
[normal]are
[normal] concerned that the draft Bill and the accompanying guidance results in 
[normal]valid 
[normal]genuine 
[normal]LLP Partners being reclassified as employees for tax purposes.
[normal] 
[normal]HMRC Consultation May 2013[bold]T
[normal]he 
[normal]HMRC consultation document published in May 2013 ‘Partnerships: A review of two aspects of the tax rules’ 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]two tests, a case law test and an econ
[normal]omic test
[normal], for establishing the tax status of 
[normal]partners
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Our preference was and remains a case law test. 
[normal] An approach limited to a purely economic test will not capture the ‘partner’ status of members of the LLP.  In a private equity and venture capital co
[normal]ntext, LLP Partners have responsibility for sourcing
[normal] and arranging investments
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]managing and realising growth from 
[normal]the companies that comprise the investment fund
[normal].  
[normal]Investors
[normal] in the funds
[normal] 
[normal]commit to 
[normal]make 
[normal]a
[normal] long term 
[normal]commitment 
[normal]to
[normal]relationship with
[normal] the
[normal] 
[normal]LL
[normal]P Partners
[normal], who are entrusted
[normal] to utilise 
[normal]investors’
[normal] money over the life of the fund in order to create growth
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]As far as the investors are concerned, the ‘partner’ status of the LLP Partners is generally best determined by a wide range of factors which m
[normal]ight be described as ‘human capital
[normal].
[normal]’ 
[normal]This will 
[normal]includ
[normal]e factors such as
[normal] the involvement of the individual in the management of the 
[normal]firm
[normal] and the importance of the individual to long-term 
[normal]fund 
[normal]performance
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]These facts are in addition to the basis of the LLP Partners’ profit allocation and exposure to risk. 
[normal]Furthermore
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]self-employed members 
[normal]within an LLP structure 
[normal]do not have the benefit of employment law rights. 
[normal] 
[normal]Yet if they were re-classified as a salarie
[normal]d member, they could be liable to income tax and primary NICs as an employee, 
[normal]while 
[normal]not benefiting 
[normal]from employment 
[normal]protection
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Under current tax rules LLP 
[normal]Partner
[normal]s 
[normal]are treated as partners and taxed as self
[normal]-
[normal]employed 
[normal]rather than as
[normal] employees.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Draft Financ[bold]e Bill 201[bold]4[bold] [bold]D
[normal]raft legislation 
[normal]was 
[normal]published on 
[normal]10
[normal] December 
[normal]2013, 
[normal]to be implemented in Finance 
[normal]Bill 2014
[normal], setting out new provisions
[normal] to prevent the avoidance of employment taxes through the disguising of employment relationships using an LLP structure
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]It
[normal] is important to note
[normal] 
[normal]that we can see the beginnings of our concerns reflected in the legislation because consideration is given to 
[normal]a range of
[normal] factors
[normal] in the
[normal] determination of ‘partner’ status. 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is helpful that an LLP 
[normal]Partner 
[normal]has to meet all three 
[normal]condit
[normal]ions (outlined below) 
[normal]to be reclassified
[normal] as an employee
[normal], 
[normal]but there remains scope 
[normal]for genuine partners to be reclassified incorrectly. 
[normal]- 
[normal]Condition A
[normal] is that the 
[normal]rewards
[normal] 
[normal]received are 
[normal]not varied 
[normal]by reference to the profits or losses of the partnership.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] key question here is whether the relatively predictable income flow and profits of a private equity and venture capital Manager means that 
[normal]individual 
[normal]LLP Partners’ shares of profits are “fixed” or “not in practice affected by the overall amount of those p
[normal]rofits or losses”.  
[normal]Over a
[normal] number of years the 
[normal]profit
[normal] 
[normal]of a Manager will
[normal] rise or fall depending on
[normal] a number of factors -
[normal] for example, 
[normal]the
[normal] investment period
[normal] of a fund coming to an end
[normal] – but on an annual basis
[normal],
[normal] w
[normal]ith fee income largely dependent on investor 
[normal]commitments
[normal], 
[normal]profits can be reasonably predictable.  
[normal]Most partnership agreements effectively provide some discretion to vary profits between partners
[normal] so i
[normal]n this context 
[normal]some 
[normal]Managers are concerned that their remuneration arrangements 
[normal]fall into the category
[normal] of “disguised salary” as set out in the draft legislation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]- 
[normal]Condition B
[normal] is that the individual 
[normal]does not have
[normal] 
[normal]‘significant influence’ over the affairs of the partnership.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This 
[normal]area is causing most concern among 
[normal]Managers at
[normal] 
[normal]large
[normal]r
[normal] private equity and vent
[normal]ure capital 
[normal]houses
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]here are 
[normal]various governance groups within a typical firm
[normal] that
[normal] approve 
[normal]o
[normal]perational 
[normal]and 
[normal]s
[normal]trateg
[normal]ic
[normal] matters of the LLP and also 
[normal]i
[normal]nvestment 
[normal]c
[normal]ommittees which decide on investment matters. 
[normal] 
[normal]It is clear that individuals 
[normal]in these groups 
[normal]do 
[normal]exert significant influence over the partnership but if the legislation is insufficient
[normal]ly
[normal] tailored or overly restrictive, the contribution of these individuals could be missed. 
[normal]There is a further issue that even the term ‘
[normal]significant
[normal] influence’ cannot cap
[normal]ture all of what ‘partner level’ contributions amount to.
[normal] 
[normal] This is because individuals can provide essential services without which the firm 
[normal]could not 
[normal]function
[normal], that are not necessarily ‘board level’ functions
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]For example the 
[normal]C
[normal]ompliance 
[normal]O
[normal]fficer makes a c
[normal]ontribution without which the partnership 
[normal]could not operate effectively 
[normal](UK Managers are regulated by the 
[normal]Financial Conduct Authority
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Other individuals 
[normal]c
[normal]ould be considered 
[normal]to be
[normal] exercising significant 
[normal]influence
[normal] by virtue of their investment track recor
[normal]d
[normal]: senior investment professionals
[normal] 
[normal]are often identified as
[normal] ‘Keymen’
[normal] in the partne
[normal]rship agreements that set out the terms of private equity and venture capital funds
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Within our industry, s
[normal]imply defining ‘significant influence’ using a corporate governance framework could easily miss such individuals and incorrectly reclassify 
[normal]these LLP partners 
[normal]as salaried members. 
[normal]- 
[normal]Condition C
[normal] is that the individual 
[normal]has
[normal] contributed 
[normal]less than
[normal] 25% of any f
[normal]ixed profit share from the partnership in the form of a capital contribution. 
[normal]P
[normal]rivate equity and venture capital
[normal] is a people business and therefore, regulato
[normal]ry requirements aside, there is
[normal] not a large amount of working capital required to be invested by th
[normal]e 
[normal]LLP P
[normal]artners
[normal] in the 
[normal]LLP 
[normal]itself
[normal]. 
[normal] Very few firms will have asked LLP partners to contribute this level of capital.  It is also worth noting that LLP partners in our industry bear the risk of not raising successor funds and in this sense have significant p
[normal]ersonal 
[normal](
[normal]rather than financial
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]capital tied up in the business.
[normal]The nature of this 
[normal]draft 
[normal]legislation 
[normal]means that
[normal] 
[normal]individual firms 
[normal]need 
[normal]to make their own determinations of who should remain a partner before seeking approval of their arrang
[normal]e
[normal]ments from HMRC. 
[normal] 
[normal]If this is to be feasible in practice, the accompanying guidance and sector specific examples must be thorough. 
[normal] 
[normal]As currently drafted there is not enough certainty 
[normal]for our industry and w
[normal]e would 
[normal]ideally seek 
[normal]specific examples on each of the conditions that
[normal] take a nuanced approach to how LLPs in th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]private equity and venture capital 
[normal]sector work in practice.
[normal]Conclusions[bold]With
[normal] the Alternative Investment Fund
[normal] Managers
[normal] Directive now in force, the 
[normal]continued promotion of the competitive of the UK as a financial centre, 
[normal]is all the more important and we should not deter businesses from using the LLP structure
[normal], with its inherent flexibility and commercial advantages, 
[normal]as a result of any 
[normal]new
[normal] 
[normal]tax
[normal] legislati
[normal]on. 
[normal] 
[normal]Indeed as announced in the 2013 Budget, the Government is 
[normal]taking forward a new 
[normal]A
[normal]sset 
[normal]M
[normal]anagement 
[normal]S
[normal]trategy designed
[normal] to bolster 
[normal]existing competitive strengths.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This is to encourage all fund managers, whether domestic or 
[normal]international
[normal],
[normal] to keep raising th
[normal]eir funds in the UK
[normal].
[normal] To be compatible with this approach, 
[normal]the 
[normal]Finance Bill 2014 cannot be seen to be adding uncertainty as to how 
[normal]fund managers 
[normal]may be taxed. 
[normal]Next steps[bold]The BVCA 
[normal]is working 
[normal]constructively 
[normal]with HMRC
[normal], 
[normal]as these changes have a potentially wide
[normal]-ranging impact on the private equity 
[normal]and venture capital 
[normal]industry
[normal]. 
[normal]W
[normal]e have responded to the
[normal] 
[normal]earlier 
[normal]consultation
[normal] and are following up with 
[normal]HMRC 
[normal]officials 
[normal]to see if we can provide support in drawing up 
[normal]industry-
[normal]specific 
[normal]guidance
[normal] that address
[normal]es
[normal] our concerns.
