[normal]Our recommendat[bold]ions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Our first recommendation is that the implementation of the proposals should be delayed until 2015.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our second recommendation is that the detail of the proposals be reviewed as their current scope exceeds that of the published policy and so does not give proper effect to it.

[normal]If individuals come together to try
[normal] and maximise their collective profit in order to divide that profit amongst themselves, they have the economic character of partners rather than employees.  It should not matter how that profit is divided up.  A business is no less a partnership if it div
[normal]ides up its profits based on the recommendations of a remuneration committee considering individual performance than if it does so by reference to a pre-set formula based on set partnership shares.  As drawn the legislation (certainly as interpreted by HMR
[normal]C based on their Technical Note and Guidance) does not deliver this result.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Similarly HMRC contend that an individual may be a salaried member if he is remunerated by reference to the performance of part of a business rather than all of it (for example, i
[normal]n a multi-office firm, if they get a share of their office's profits rather than the profits of the entire firm).  This cannot be right: if such an individual is not "really" a partner in the entire firm, then surely their position is far more akin to that
[normal] of a partner in a smaller firm than that of an employee?
[normal]  On the flipside, especially in the context of overseas firms with UK offices, members of UK LLPs are often remunerated by reference to the profits of both the UK LLP and an overseas LLP.  HMRC are 
[normal]contending that such an arrangement should be caught, whereas again the analogy should not be to an employment but to partnership in a different (in this case bigger) 
[normal]firm
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our view is that the legislation should not apply to any individual whose arrangem
[normal]ents are such that what they get is a slice of the firm's total profits.  It should not matter whether that slice is fixed or variable or, if variable, the basis of any variation.  It also should not matter if some members' call on profits is senior to tha
[normal]t of others.  The defining feature of salaried member status should be whether an individual gets paid anyway even if profits are insufficient.  An employee of a business has a contractual right to be paid.  If the business has insufficient cash to do this
[normal] it must raise that cash somehow or declare 
[normal]itself
[normal] insolvent.  An equity holder of a business knows that they only get paid if profits are sufficient, and has no right to claim payment if they are not.  This is the economic distinction between an employee 
[normal]and a partner.  Put in those terms it is easily drawn.  The much more extensive terms of Condition A, as interpreted by HMRC, will catch many individuals who are in fact clearly equity holders in economic terms and not employees.  The draft legislation doe
[normal]s not deliver the policy objective.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It follows from our reasoning above that we would accept that where a member of an LLP is entitled to a minimum (or fixed) guaranteed payment, such that other members will fund the payment in the event profits are insuf
[normal]ficient, 
[normal]then that minimum or fixed amount should be treated as disguised salary within the current draft legislation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The targeted anti-avoidance rule is also drafted far too widely.  In seeking to ignore for tax purposes all arrangements whose main 
[normal]purpose is to ensure that the new provisions do not apply, it calls into question whether HMRC would seek to disregard a genuine restructuring of arrangements in response to the new rules with the real commercial effect of turning members into what HMRC wo
[normal]uld accept were "true" partners.  It cannot be correct for this to be the effect of the provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
