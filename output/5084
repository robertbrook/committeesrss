[normal]Written Evidence Submitted by the Alliance for Middle East Peace[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]To the International Development Committee
[normal]:
[normal]1) 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]Thank you for the opportunity to present evidence regarding Britain’s spending in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  This is an important inquiry at a pivotal moment in the quest for a final status agreement, hopefully resolving decades of confl
[normal]ict in the region.  The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) lauds the Committee for its effort; seeks to encourage the Committee to recommend dramatically enhanced funding for people-to-people (P2P) projects in the region that demonstrably lay the grou
[normal]ndwork for any sustainable peace; and encourages visits of high-level officials to those projects at the earliest 
[normal]possible 
[normal]time. 
[normal]2) 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]It is our understanding that the goal of the British government is a “prosperous Middle East with a sovereign and viable 
[normal]Palestinian State living in peace alongside a secure 
[normal]Israel
[normal]…” and that “
[normal]r
[normal]esolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a 
[normal]UK
[normal] priority.”  To this end, the 
[normal]UK
[normal] expends approximately 
[normal]£
[normal]90 million annually (approximately 
[normal]US
[normal] 
[normal]$
[normal]54.6 million) in 
[normal]Israel
[normal] and the Palesti
[normal]nian territories, with the vast majority (
[normal]£
[normal]86 million) dedicated to 
[normal]Palestine
[normal] economic development through the Department for International Development (DfID)
[normal].  N
[normal]one 
[normal]of these funds support
[normal] 
[normal]people-to-people
[normal] 
[normal]activities
[normal], 
[normal]and o
[normal]nly 
[normal]£
[normal]4 million (US $6 million) 
[normal]goes
[normal] to both Israel and the Palestinian territories through the 
[normal]interdepartmental 
[normal]Conflict Pool.  Although the majority of the Conflict Pool
[normal] funds
[normal] go to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs, only one of the thirteen projects currently
[normal] being
[normal] funded (
[normal]ALLMEP member 
[normal]P
[normal]eres Center/Palestinian Red Crescent) brings Israelis and Palestinians together in cooperative activities.
[normal] It is this disparity that ALLMEP seeks to address.

[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Alliance
[normal] for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP), a 
[normal]United States
[normal] charitable organization, is a grassroots consortium of some 80 NGOs conducting 
[normal]people-to-people (
[normal]P2P
[normal])
[normal] coexistence, reconciliation, and cooperative activities among Israelis and Palestinians, Arab
[normal]s and Jews in the region.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Serving thousands of Israelis and Palestinians, these organizations daily lay the foundation for 
[normal]any 
[normal]sustainable peace in the region, striving through their programs both to solve intractable problems and to produce the behaviora
[normal]l shifts essential to attitudinal change.  Their work is critical, 
[normal]yet
[normal] 
[normal]dramatically under-resourced.  ALLMEP's mission is to foster its members' efforts and efficacy by working, primarily in the United States, to increase funding and support for these proj
[normal]ects from the public and private sectors and to raise the successful profile of peacebuilding activities both as an essential ingredient of the peace process and as a counterpoint to violence and conflict.
[normal] 
[normal] T
[normal]oday, this robust, growing coalition is connecti
[normal]ng true peacebuilders to the policymakers, to the public, and to the press. 
[normal]5
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]Through an annual 
[normal]US
[normal] Congressional appropriation – ALLMEP's signature accomplishment to date – 
[normal]more than $60 million in United States Agency for International Development (US[bold]AID) funding expressly for [bold]people-to-people[bold] [bold]peacebuilding programs has flowed to the region[bold]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Not only is ALLMEP the 
[normal]only
[normal] advocate for this crucial US funding, but we have become the acknowledged “go-to” resource for both USAID and our members regarding this critical “track II diplomacy.”  
[normal]6
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]ALLMEP is currently seeking to initiat
[normal]e
[normal] an even more potent mechanism for dramat
[normal]ically enhanced funding for 
[normal]people-to-people
[normal] 
[normal]activities: an 
[normal]International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace.  [bold]Building on the enormous success of the annual 
[normal]US
[normal] Congressional appropriation, ALLMEP has, for some time, been in negotiation
[normal] 
[normal]with the Israeli go
[normal]vernment and Palestinian Authority, the US Administration and Congress, the United Nations, the European Union, and numerous Arab governments as well as potential private donors
[normal] for the creation of the International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace
[normal].  
[normal]The
[normal] proposed International Fund would be modeled on the
[normal] 
[normal]hugely-successful 
[normal]International Fund for Ireland
[normal], founded in 1986, which
[normal] provided billions
[normal] of dollars
[normal] to people-to-people 
[normal]peacebuilding efforts in 
[normal]Northern Ireland.  W
[normal]ith the resumption of peace talks 
[normal]last summer, the proposed Fund has garnered significant traction:  we expect introduction of a bipartisan authorizing bill in the US Congress within weeks.  T
[normal]he Fund i
[normal]s integral to and intertwined with the success of 
[normal]“
[normal]track I
[normal]”
[normal] diplomatic efforts, permittin
[normal]g a dramatic scaling up of successful P2P programs/efforts.  
[normal]US 
[normal]$200 million is the Year I target
[normal], with 
[normal]$50 million to come from the 
[normal]US
[normal].  To the extent that the 
[normal]Commons Select 
[normal]Committee is investigating whether the modest influx of British Conflict Pool Fu
[normal]nds (only minimally committe
[normal]d to P2P work) is sufficient, ALLMEP
[normal] respectfully submit
[normal]s
[normal] that the Committee consider 
[normal]Britain’s 
[normal]active participation in this proposed International Fund.

[normal] 
[normal]projects

[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]S
[normal]ince 2004, with
[normal] ALLMEP’s energetic advocacy
[normal], the US Congress has provided funding through its foreign assistance program
[normal] for worldwide “people-to-people reconciliation programs which bring together individuals of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds from
[normal] areas of strife and war…
[normal] 
[normal][including] such programs in the Middle East.”
[normal]  
[normal]To date, these USAID Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) 
[normal]f
[normal]unds have
[normal] provided direct support through competitive grants for innovative people-to-people conflict mitigation and re
[normal]conciliation programs in at least 36 countries, including those in the 
[normal]Middle 
[normal]East
[normal].  So su
[normal]ccessful have these grants been
[normal] that
[normal],
[normal] since 
[normal]FY 
[normal]2008
[normal],
[normal] a dedicated component of the global fund has been reserved for programs in Israel and the Palestinian 
[normal]territories
[normal],
[normal] thus ensuring key funding for Middle East projects vital to stabilizing the region, while preserving funding for other conflict areas.  
[normal]Since FY 2010, Congress has provided 
[normal]US 
[normal]$10 million annually 
[normal](
[normal]£
[normal]6 million) to this end.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]USAID manages the Middle East 
[normal]reconciliation grant program through its Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM). 
[normal] 
[normal]NGOs apply directly to USAID for grants and USAID distributes the funds through a competitive process.  These grants
[normal] “
[normal]provide opportunities for adversaries to com
[normal]e together to address issues, reconcile differences, and gain understanding and mutual trust by working toward common goals.”
[normal] 
[normal]8

[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]ALLMEP m
[normal]ember organizations
[normal], competitors for and recipients of the USAID CMM grants
[normal], 
[normal]are on the front lines of the 
[normal]Middle
[normal] East
[normal] conflict.  
[normal]These organizations turn the challenges of daily life into opportunities for cooperation and
[normal],
[normal] in so doing
[normal],
[normal] lay the groundwork for 
[normal]any
[normal] sustainable peace
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Every day, they 
[normal]tackle the spectrum of challenges and opportunities inherent in the r
[normal]egion, 
[normal]engaging thousands of people on the ground in cooperative projects, breaking down barriers and stereotypes, 
[normal]and 
[normal]changing attitudes, while at the same time building trust and laying a foundation for lasting peace. 
[normal] 
[normal]These
[normal] 
[normal]programs provide respect and 
[normal]dignity, hope and understanding, cooperation and reconciliation – elements often missing in conflict situations, but without which, resolution is impossible. 
[normal] 
[normal]In the ebb and flow of diplomacy, the ups and downs of the peace pro
[normal]cess, these NGOs are a consta
[normal]nt: 
[normal] they are on the ground modeling what Israeli and Palestinian politicians in the area have failed to achieve – tangible, concrete examples of what peace can look like. 
[normal] 
[normal]9
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]As examples:  These groups help Jewish settlers and their Palestinian neighbo
[normal]rs open constructive interfaith dialogue; they engage Israelis and Palestinians who have lost loved ones in the conflict to talk about non-violence; they create soccer and basketball leagues 
[normal]engaging
[normal] 
[normal]tens of thousands of kids, who learn teamwork and cooper
[normal]ation with new friends from the “other side
[normal]”
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]they pair Israeli and Palestinian villages to share environmental resou
[normal]r
[normal]ces, since water knows no borders; 
[normal]they bring together Israelis and Palestinians to cooperate in medicine, business, and education; they expose Israelis and Arabs to positive and human images of one another through TV shows and films; and they mobilize hundreds of thousands to call on their
[normal] leaders to work toward a two-state solution. 
[normal]10
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]These actions confirm that peace is no mirage, but an achievable reality. 
[normal] When the peace process reaches closure – and it must
[normal] 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]it will be these programs that have laid the groundwork and planted the se
[normal]eds necessary to support a successful outcome.  
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Evidence of Success

[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]In fact:  these programs work.  Rigorous analyses and evaluation by USAID conclusively demo
[normal]nstrate greater trust; enhanced coo
[normal]peration; increased “conflict resolution values”; 
[normal]decreased aggression and loneliness; and mitigation of hazardous environmental and health conditions between project participants from opposing sides of the conflict.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]An in-progress, comprehensive evaluation of the Reconciliation Program by USAID is expec
[normal]ted to provide even more data upon completion later this year.

[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]Not only is there empirical data to validate the success of people-to-people programs, but participants themselves are acutely aware of the tremendous benefits that are realized through funding of 
[normal]people-to-people 
[normal]NGOs:

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]These personalized accounts – and there are countless more – of successful people-to-people reconciliation efforts made possible through CMM grants underscore the critical need for funding to ensure that
[normal] the progress of peace continues, including through the British Conflict Pool.

[normal]3
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]This “track 
[normal]II 
[normal]diplomacy” is a critical foreign policy tool in addressing the 
[normal]Middle East
[normal] conflict.  Without building grassroots support for peace, as these projects do, political peace agreements in the 
[normal]Middle East
[normal] may never arrive and cannot endure.  Thus, bolstering nascent peace agreements through people-to-people efforts is critical to lo
[normal]ng-term stability, democracy and growth in the region.  It will be these programs that will enable the success of any diplomatic solution. 
[normal] 
[normal]1
[normal]4
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]these P2P projects give the often-silent two-thirds majorities on both sides
[normal],
[normal] who support a two-s
[normal]tate solution in poll after poll
[normal],
[normal] tangible ways to work toward that better tomorrow.  T
[normal]hey prove “there is a partner.” 
[normal]These 
[normal]people-to-people
[normal] programs
[normal] bolster diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establ
[normal]ishing grounds for cooperation and existence and building grassroots constituencies for peace on both sides
[normal]. [bold]&#xa0;[bold]That groundwork must be laid 
[normal]first
[normal], to hasten an agreement and to give it the best possible chance of success.  
[normal]Projects underway at this very mom
[normal]ent confirm that these people can successfully work together across borders and conflict lines, developing true professional and personal relationships. Ultimately, the programs provide a mechanism for people on both sides to overcome stereotypes and accep
[normal]t each other’s right to live in peace.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal]) 
[normal]              
[normal]There can be little doubt that 
[normal]people-to-people
[normal] 
[normal]programs have 
[normal]broad, 
[normal]positive
[normal] 
[normal]implications for long
[normal]-
[normal]term stability and a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.  The United States investment, although substantial, is not sufficient; 
[normal]a similar
[normal] commitment to such programs through the British Conflict Pool – and ultimately through an Intern
[normal]ational Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace – is essential.   
[normal]Additionally, NGOs like those supported by USAID – those engaged in P2P programming – should be supported by the 
[normal]entirety of funds in the 
[normal]Conflict Pool.  
[normal]ALLMEP urges British officials to visit t
[normal]hese hopeful and inspiring programs, and stands ready to assist the Committee in any way possible.  Thank you for this opportunity.
