defaultWritten Evidence Submitted by the Alliance for Middle East Peacedefault&#xa0;
defaultTo the International Development Committee
default:
default1) 
default              
default              
defaultThank you for the opportunity to present evidence regarding Britain’s spending in Israel and the Palestinian territories.  This is an important inquiry at a pivotal moment in the quest for a final status agreement, hopefully resolving decades of confl
defaultict in the region.  The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) lauds the Committee for its effort; seeks to encourage the Committee to recommend dramatically enhanced funding for people-to-people (P2P) projects in the region that demonstrably lay the grou
defaultndwork for any sustainable peace; and encourages visits of high-level officials to those projects at the earliest 
defaultpossible 
defaulttime. 
default2) 
default              
default              
defaultIt is our understanding that the goal of the British government is a “prosperous Middle East with a sovereign and viable 
defaultPalestinian State living in peace alongside a secure 
defaultIsrael
default…” and that “
defaultr
defaultesolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a 
defaultUK
default priority.”  To this end, the 
defaultUK
default expends approximately 
default£
default90 million annually (approximately 
defaultUS
default 
default$
default54.6 million) in 
defaultIsrael
default and the Palesti
defaultnian territories, with the vast majority (
default£
default86 million) dedicated to 
defaultPalestine
default economic development through the Department for International Development (DfID)
default.  N

default, 
defaultand o
defaultnly 
default£
default4 million (US $6 million) 
defaultgoes
default to both Israel and the Palestinian territories through the 
defaultinterdepartmental 
defaultConflict Pool.  Although the majority of the Conflict Pool
default funds
default go to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs, only one of the thirteen projects currently
default being
default funded (
defaultALLMEP member 
defaultP
defaulteres Center/Palestinian Red Crescent) brings Israelis and Palestinians together in cooperative activities.
default It is this disparity that ALLMEP seeks to address.

defaultThe 
defaultAlliance
default for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP), a 
defaultUnited States
default charitable organization, is a grassroots consortium of some 80 NGOs conducting 
defaultpeople-to-people (
defaultP2P
default)
default coexistence, reconciliation, and cooperative activities among Israelis and Palestinians, Arab
defaults and Jews in the region.
default 
default 
defaultServing thousands of Israelis and Palestinians, these organizations daily lay the foundation for 
defaultany 
defaultsustainable peace in the region, striving through their programs both to solve intractable problems and to produce the behaviora
defaultl shifts essential to attitudinal change.  Their work is critical, 
defaultyet
default 
defaultdramatically under-resourced.  ALLMEP's mission is to foster its members' efforts and efficacy by working, primarily in the United States, to increase funding and support for these proj
defaultects from the public and private sectors and to raise the successful profile of peacebuilding activities both as an essential ingredient of the peace process and as a counterpoint to violence and conflict.
default 
default T
defaultoday, this robust, growing coalition is connecti
defaultng true peacebuilders to the policymakers, to the public, and to the press.

defaultUS
default Congressional appropriation – ALLMEP's signature accomplishment to date – 
defaultmore than $60 million in United States Agency for International Development (USdefaultAID) funding expressly for defaultpeople-to-peopledefault defaultpeacebuilding programs has flowed to the regiondefault. 
default 
defaultNot only is ALLMEP the 
defaultonly
default advocate for this crucial US funding, but we have become the acknowledged “go-to” resource for both USAID and our members regarding this critical “track II diplomacy.”

default              
default              
defaultALLMEP is currently seeking to initiat
defaulte
default an even more potent mechanism for dramat
defaultically enhanced funding for 
defaultpeople-to-people
default 
defaultactivities: an 
defaultInternational Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace.  defaultBuilding on the enormous success of the annual 
defaultUS
default Congressional appropriation, ALLMEP has, for some time, been in negotiation
default 
defaultwith the Israeli go
defaultvernment and Palestinian Authority, the US Administration and Congress, the United Nations, the European Union, and numerous Arab governments as well as potential private donors
default for the creation of the International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace
default.  
defaultThe
default proposed International Fund would be modeled on the
default 
defaulthugely-successful 
defaultInternational Fund for Ireland
default, founded in 1986, which
default provided billions
default of dollars
default to people-to-people 
defaultpeacebuilding efforts in 
defaultNorthern Ireland.  W
defaultith the resumption of peace talks 
defaultlast summer, the proposed Fund has garnered significant traction:  we expect introduction of a bipartisan authorizing bill in the US Congress within weeks.  T
defaulthe Fund i
defaults integral to and intertwined with the success of 
default“

default diplomatic efforts, permittin
defaultg a dramatic scaling up of successful P2P programs/efforts.  
defaultUS 
default$200 million is the Year I target
default, with 
default$50 million to come from the 
defaultUS
default.  To the extent that the 
defaultCommons Select 
defaultCommittee is investigating whether the modest influx of British Conflict Pool Fu
defaultnds (only minimally committe
defaultd to P2P work) is sufficient, ALLMEP
default respectfully submit
defaults
default that the Committee consider

defaultS
defaultince 2004, with
default ALLMEP’s energetic advocacy
default, the US Congress has provided funding through its foreign assistance program
default for worldwide “people-to-people reconciliation programs which bring together individuals of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds from
default areas of strife and war…
default 
default[including] such programs in the Middle East.”
default  
defaultTo date, these USAID Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) 
defaultf
defaultunds have
default provided direct support through competitive grants for innovative people-to-people conflict mitigation and re
defaultconciliation programs in at least 36 countries, including those in the 
defaultMiddle 
defaultEast
default.  So su
defaultccessful have these grants been
default that
default,
default since 
defaultFY 
default2008
default,
default a dedicated component of the global fund has been reserved for programs in Israel and the Palestinian 
defaultterritories
default,
default thus ensuring key funding for Middle East projects vital to stabilizing the region, while preserving funding for other conflict areas.  
defaultSince FY 2010, Congress has provided 
defaultUS 
default$10 million annually 
default(
default£
default6 million) to this end.
default 
default 
defaultUSAID manages the Middle East 
defaultreconciliation grant program through its Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM). 
default 
defaultNGOs apply directly to USAID for grants and USAID distributes the funds through a competitive process.  These grants
default “
defaultprovide opportunities for adversaries to com

defaultThese organizations turn the challenges of daily life into opportunities for cooperation and

default lay the groundwork for

default sustainable peace
default. 
default 
defaultEvery day, they 
defaulttackle the spectrum of challenges and opportunities inherent in the r
defaultegion, 
defaultengaging thousands of people on the ground in cooperative projects, breaking down barriers and stereotypes, 
defaultand 
defaultchanging attitudes, while at the same time building trust and laying a foundation for lasting peace. 
default 
defaultThese
default 
defaultprograms provide respect and 
defaultdignity, hope and understanding, cooperation and reconciliation – elements often missing in conflict situations, but without which, resolution is impossible. 
default 
defaultIn the ebb and flow of diplomacy, the ups and downs of the peace pro
defaultcess, these NGOs are a consta
defaultnt: 
default they are on the ground modeling what Israeli and Palestinian politicians in the area have failed to achieve – tangible, concrete examples of what peace can look like.

default              
defaultAs examples:  These groups help Jewish settlers and their Palestinian neighbo
defaultrs open constructive interfaith dialogue; they engage Israelis and Palestinians who have lost loved ones in the conflict to talk about non-violence; they create soccer and basketball leagues 
defaultengaging
default 
defaulttens of thousands of kids, who learn teamwork and cooper

default;
default 
defaultthey pair Israeli and Palestinian villages to share environmental resou

defaultces, since water knows no borders; 
defaultthey bring together Israelis and Palestinians to cooperate in medicine, business, and education; they expose Israelis and Arabs to positive and human images of one another through TV shows and films; and they mobilize hundreds of thousands to call on their
default leaders to work toward a two-state solution.

default              
defaultThese actions confirm that peace is no mirage, but an achievable reality. 
default When the peace process reaches closure – and it must

default) 
default              
defaultIn fact:  these programs work.  Rigorous analyses and evaluation by USAID conclusively demo
defaultnstrate greater trust; enhanced coo
defaultperation; increased “conflict resolution values”; 
defaultdecreased aggression and loneliness; and mitigation of hazardous environmental and health conditions between project participants from opposing sides of the conflict.
default 
default 
defaultAn in-progress, comprehensive evaluation of the Reconciliation Program by USAID is expec
defaultted to provide even more data upon completion later this year.

default              
defaultNot only is there empirical data to validate the success of people-to-people programs, but participants themselves are acutely aware of the tremendous benefits that are realized through funding of 
defaultpeople-to-people 
defaultNGOs:

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultThese personalized accounts – and there are countless more – of successful people-to-people reconciliation efforts made possible through CMM grants underscore the critical need for funding to ensure that
default the progress of peace continues, including through the British Conflict Pool.

default) 
default              
defaultThis “track 
defaultII 
defaultdiplomacy” is a critical foreign policy tool in addressing the 
defaultMiddle East
default conflict.  Without building grassroots support for peace, as these projects do, political peace agreements in the 
defaultMiddle East
default may never arrive and cannot endure.  Thus, bolstering nascent peace agreements through people-to-people efforts is critical to lo
defaultng-term stability, democracy and growth in the region.  It will be these programs that will enable the success of any diplomatic solution.

default              
defaultIn addition, 
defaultthese P2P projects give the often-silent two-thirds majorities on both sides
default,
default who support a two-s
defaulttate solution in poll after poll
default,
default tangible ways to work toward that better tomorrow.  T
defaulthey prove “there is a partner.” 
defaultThese 
defaultpeople-to-people
default programs
default bolster diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establ
defaultishing grounds for cooperation and existence and building grassroots constituencies for peace on both sides
default. default&#xa0;defaultThat groundwork must be laid 
defaultfirst
default, to hasten an agreement and to give it the best possible chance of success.  
defaultProjects underway at this very mom
defaultent confirm that these people can successfully work together across borders and conflict lines, developing true professional and personal relationships. Ultimately, the programs provide a mechanism for people on both sides to overcome stereotypes and accep
defaultt each other’s right to live in peace.

defaultConclusion

default5
default) 
default              
defaultThere can be little doubt that 
defaultpeople-to-people
default 
defaultprograms have 
defaultbroad, 
defaultpositive
default 
defaultimplications for long
default-
defaultterm stability and a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.  The United States investment, although substantial, is not sufficient; 
defaulta similar
default commitment to such programs through the British Conflict Pool – and ultimately through an Intern
defaultational Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace – is essential.   
defaultAdditionally, NGOs like those supported by USAID – those engaged in P2P programming – should be supported by the 
defaultentirety of funds in the 
defaultConflict Pool.  
defaultALLMEP urges British officials to visit t
defaulthese hopeful and inspiring programs, and stands ready to assist the Committee in any way possible.  Thank you for this opportunity.
