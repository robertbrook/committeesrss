defaultThe policy objective behind this proposal is to deliver Professor Lofstedt's recommendation by exempting those self-employed who pose no potential risk of harm to others.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the proposal is accepted, Section 3(2) of Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (1974 Act)
default&#xa0;
defaultwill
default&#xa0;
defaultread:
default&#xa0;
default(2) It shall be the duty of every self-employed person who conducts a relevant undertaking to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that he and other persons (not being his employees) who may be affected thereby are not thereby exposed to risks to their health and safety.
default(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2), an undertaking is a relevant undertaking if -
default(a) it is of a prescribed description, or
default(b) persons who may be affected by the way it is conducted, other than the person conducting it (or his employees), could thereby be exposed to risks to their health and safety.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultconsultation received responses from the following self-employed persons who classed themselves as businesses:
default&#xa0;
defaultFarmer
defaultLighting cameraman
defaultNurseryman
defaultTree Surgeon
defaultDirector of an explosive company
default&#xa0;
defaultAll the above have the potential to cause harm to others so, even if they are not undertakings of a prescribed description, they would not be exempt from the law because of the provision indefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaults3(2A)(b) above. In otherdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultwords the duty can still apply if not on the prescribed listdefault. For clarity purposes the Government

default&#xa0;
defaultfor those self-employed who conduct their work in high hazard or high risk activities eg construction.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThis will be achieved through Regulations.
default&#xa0;
default The Government intend to consult further on the prescribed list but
default&#xa0;
defaultagriculture and explosives are currently proposed
default&#xa0;
defaultand consequently
default&#xa0;
defaultself-employed persons working in those sectors would not be exempt .
default&#xa0;
defaultFor those occupations who don't fall into the prescribed list and
default&#xa0;
defaultshould

defaultnot be
default&#xa0;
defaultexempt we will provide guidance. (eg the lighting cameraman's work could affect others by trailing cables creating trip hazards or unsecured lights falling on others).
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is recognised that workers in some occupations pose a risk of harm to others only at certain times.
default&#xa0;
default On practical grounds
default&#xa0;
defaultit was decided that only those self-employed persons whose work activities would not be expected to put others at risk at any point in the normal course of their work would be exempt, except, if they work in prescribed high hazard

defaultor

defaulthigh risk activities where all workers irrespective of their activity will not be exempt.
