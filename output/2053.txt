[[[Rights of way legislation and the Bill: an opportunity to deal with off-roadng]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Attached is a case study of a lane in the Peak District National Park which I have written for the Committee. It illustrates the failure of current rights of way legislation to protect the environment, local communities or non-vehicle users from the extensive damage and danger being caused by the use of green lanes by off-road vehicles.&#xa0;The draft Bill already has in it clauses on rights of way designed to reduce red tape and bureaucracy. It is thus an opportunity for other rights of way clauses to be added, provided that these also have the effect of reducing red tape and saving public money.  I therefore urge you to advise the government to include in the Bill the proposal to reclassify all unsealed highways as Restricted Byways. This measure will do much to resolve the offroading problem and do away at a stroke with the vast amounts of bureaucracy involved in processing BOAT (byway open to all traffic) claims on unsealed unclassified highways. It will also stop the waste of public money now being spent on unsustainable repairs to these highways. &#xa0;I also urge you to use the opportunity of the Bill to introduce legislation giving local communities the right to appeal against a highway authority’s persistent refusal to use a Traffic Regulation Order to exclude motor vehicles from a byway open to all traffic where there is clear evidence that such an Order is necessary on safety or other grounds under Section 1 of the 1984 Road Traffic Act. &#xa0;The case study shows how the current legislation framework as it relates to use of unsurfaced lanes by motor vehicles is simply not working. It illustrates in particular how local communities adversely affected by the use of their local green lanes by 4x4s and motor bikes are powerless to do anything about it.&#xa0;I apologize for the length of the Annexes to the case study, but I felt it necessary to demonstrate that everything in the study is based on sound evidence.&#xa0;Yours faithfully&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Patricia Stubbs&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Not published here.
