[[[)]]]I have been a registered midwife for 26 years. I have practised clinically throughout that time both within the NHS and independently, in hospitals and the community environments. I have followed with close interest how the midwifery profession has been regulated both with the NMC and its predecessor, the UKCC, as I am passionate as a midwife that mothers and babies receive the best care possible. I offer this submission to the Committee as an observant registrant who has never been referred to the regulator. With public protection a fundamental corner stone of any healthcare system, the NMC’s role is regulator of two separate professions, nursing and midwifery. As I am a midwife this submission relates to midwifery.Midwifery regulation is unique amongst the healthcare professions as it has an additional layer known as ‘statuary supervision’. This has historical roots from when regulation was first introduced over a century ago.Statutory Supervision can work well and be very positive. Unfortunately it can also be used as a punitive means to bully midwives and is a powerful means of control, including on those who speak out for women, raise concerns or are seen as challenging the status quo. Statutory Supervision’s success is dependent on individual Supervisors of Midwives and Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officers rather than the robustness of the system, therefore it cannot be relied on to be fit for purpose.Unfortunately the NMC Fitness to Practise system depends on Supervisors of Midwives or Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officers opinion as evidence in its investigations and hearings accepting it as authoritive and failing to exercise due diligence it checking its robustness. This has lead to unsafe outcomes of the Fitness to Practise system which has undermined the confidence of the profession and the public in ‘protecting the public’.For the public to be truly protected the regulator must have both a safe means of removing rogue dishonest and dangerous registrants from the register AND create a culture in which midwives are supported to provide truly women centred care. Currently midwives feel torn by what the NMC Code says they must do and the employers require of them. Statutory supervision serves to add confusion to this situation due to the inherent conflict of interest in that most Supervisors of Midwives are also employees of the healthcare providers.Despite the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the NMC and the Care Quality Commission, http://www.nmc-uk.org/Documents/Regulators/CQC-and-NMC-MoU.pdf I am not convinced that the NMC reports to the CQC areas of concern in maternity provider environments raised in Fitness to Practise cases perhaps because an assumption that the Midwifery Supervision system would do this. I trust this is helpful for the Health Committee and I am happy to be questioned further if required.October 2013&#xa0;
