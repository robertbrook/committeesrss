[normal]I am a parent, a teacher and a former long-time resident of Westminster; I also run a community blog.  Though I am no longer a resident of Westminster, I am still active in my community in Pimlico and am obliged to raise questions regarding the changes in education in Pimlico and south Westminster.  This is no small undertaking, I stand to gain nothing other than the clean conscience that I did not simply ignore a potential problem.
