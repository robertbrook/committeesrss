"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Members of Parliament (PH24)&#xa0;Graham Allen MP (response from office staff/caseworker)We generally allow a calendar month before chasing up any letter to a minister. My estimate is that about 80% are responded to in six weeks and 20% need a chase up. The chase ups are usually effective with responses then coming within a week. However, there are a few exceptions which need continual chase up; the Home Office – immigration matters being a particular example. The UKBA is extremely unhelpful and ignores almost all correspondence.\nThe content of the response is generally quite good and to the point with advice given for the constituent should they wish to pursue the matter further. Of course the political content is often not to our liking but that is hardly a fault of the Civil Service.\nOne point and the \nDfT\n are particularly remiss; could they please include the constituent’s name on the reply for our easy reference? \n&#xa0;Dame Anne Begg MP1. Do current complaints systems deliver fairness, redress, and justice?\nIt very much depends on individual departments and ministers, which would suggest that the system itself is fit for purpose. Some responses provide detailed information for the constituent, answer any specific questions asked and will even add some helpful information.  \nOn the other hand, some responses merely reiterate policy and avoid answering all, or even any, of the questions which have been asked. It is difficult to pass such replies to constituents, although I always offer constituents the opportunity to get back to discuss further and I will write to the Minister again.\nMy staff make use of the parliamentary \nhelplines\n as often as possible. Government agencies such as the Child Support Agency (CSA), UK Border Agency (UKBA) and HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) for example, have become very good at dealing with specific constituent cases. If the issue is one of policy and the Agencies hands are tied, then I will go to the Minister. \nThe frustration comes when the reply from the Minister merely repeats the mantra of government aims rather than addressing the points raised which show that the policy intent is not being achieved. I would have thought that these inquiries would have provided useful feedback to Ministers when a policy is not working as intended. \nIn discussing Ministerial replies with my staff we agreed that we would try and ask much more specific points– perhaps even bullet pointing each separate question. My staff describe \nthemselves as ‘jack of all trades’ who are not specialists in any field, although I am not sure that further in depth knowledge would elicit different Ministerial replies.\n2. How do departments and agencies use complaints as a source of information and challenge, to improve the delivery of public services?\nIn more recent years there has been a change of culture in that agencies in particular will start their response with an apology about the level of service provided. Agencies appear to be much more responsive to complaints, but they are in general easier scapegoats. Ultimately, responsibility lies with the ministers and senior officials, as very often the root of the concerns lie with policy.\nI understand that the UKBA for example pass on statistical information as way of feedback. I do not believe this provides a clear picture of how policy is working on the ground. This form of feedback does not allow for those implementing policy to provide an accurate picture of their experiences and the impact – positive or negative – of changes. In fact this does not even allow for Ministers to be really aware if their aims are reaping the hoped for benefits/targets.  Statistics may be easier to achieve.\nThere is a wealth of experience on the ‘shop floor’ but much of this is not conveyed or sought by the decision makers.\n&#xa0;\nHilary Benn MP (response from office staff/caseworker)I have noticed an improvement and it seems to me that we are now receiving departmental replies more promptly. This has been a recent improvement. However, I still have a number of emails that appear never to have been replied to: 5 letters with constituents’ policy queries attached between January and April in 2013, and 18 written during 2012.\nI’m afraid that the demands of the job, I don’t have the time to re-write on behalf of these constituents although I do follow up when time allows and constituents prompt me.  Basically, I’d like an assurance that all letters will be replied to and, if they are to be passed over for any reason, I’d like to be informed as to the reason why.\n&#xa0;\nNaomi Long MPThank you for your recent email regarding the Public Administration Select Committee‘s examination of how well ministers deal with constituency and case work. As requested I am writing to provide feedback on my experience representing Belfast East. \nIn many instances I receive timely and often helpful replies in response to my letters raising specific issues. FCO, DWP, DEFRA and NIO generally respond fairly promptly which helpfully allows me, in turn, to update the constituents concerned; however, I have found in \nwriting to the Home Office and DCMS, receiving timely answers appear to be particularly problematic. \nHome Office\nWhen my office contacted the Minister for Immigration’s private office earlier in July to follow up on an email regarding a pressing case, the private office indicated that the Minister was currently signing off replies to letters from February.\n&#xa0;\n Such a delay in responding is extremely concerning, especially as I would only write to the Minister to raise an immigration issue when all other avenues have been exhausted and when there is a degree of urgency to the case in question, as more routine enquiries would be directed to UKBA in the usual manner.\n&#xa0;\n \nDCMS\nA\ndditionally, over the past year I have waited what I feel to be an inordinate amount of time for replies from the Minister for Culture, Media and Sport.\n&#xa0;\n For example, in March 2013 I wrote requesting clarification on some elements of the legislation related to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, but only received a reply in July, after the Bill had completed its passage through Parliament.\n&#xa0;\nIn April 2013, I wrote to DCMS regarding a specific issue in relation to the designated days for the flying of the Union Flag on public buildings, an issue which was both time-sensitive (the key date being the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme on 1\nst\n July) and also engaged wider sensitivities.\n&#xa0;\nI have not yet received a response.\n&#xa0;\nAs a final example, in October 2012 I wrote regarding digital TV and the Minister replied to me in May 2013.\nI do understand the pressures which Departments are under, both with respect to contentious legislation passing through Parliament and the volume of correspondence which would be received regarding those and other matters; however, even allowing for such circumstances, my experience would be that the Home Office and DCMS perform much more poorly in this regard than most of the other departments with whom I have cause to correspond. \n&#xa0;\nLucy Powell MPThere is a lot of variation with how Ministers deal with individual complaints. In particular there are\n&#xa0;\nproblems with departments which see a high volume of complaints such as the Home Office (immigration) or the DWP. In both of these instances a local service exists for raising constituent complaints and the vast majority of our cases are directed here. However there are times when I as an MP feel that a case needs to be looked at by a Minister for specific reasons but when I do raise these with the Minister they are often redirected back to local teams or generic complaints bodies. This is particularly difficult with DWP cases where often the complaints team struggle to deal with complaints with the level of over view I think is required and it therefore becomes very difficult to highlight systemic problems or problems with wider implications or to challenge existing decisions. I do think that there does need to \nbe more clarity in being able to refer situations to Ministers and I also think that this could prevent the need for submitting questions and requesting meetings about individual cases. \n&#xa0;\nCathy Jamieson MP (response from office staff/caseworker)Foreign and Commonwealth Office:\n&#xa0;\nInitial email on 20/03/13. Chased 4 times (14/05,17/06,18/06 and 03/07) – received reply on 03/07 – FCO \nForeign and Commonwealth Office:\n&#xa0;\n initial email sent on \n&#xa0;\n30/04/13 – phoned on 03/07/13 – told it could not be located had to be re-sent \n&#xa0;\nre-sent \nDCMS \n- initial email \n&#xa0;\nsent on 06/03/13. Chased 3 times ( 13/05, 11/06 and 19/06) – received reply \n&#xa0;\non 19/06 – DCMS \n&#xa0;\n( these examples are not isolated\n&#xa0;\n ) \nMy staff have made the point that excessive delays in response times, loss of correspondence, and requirement to chase up do not encourage constituents to have confidence in the system, meaning that they are less likely to accept the substance of the response. \n&#xa0;John Robertson MP (response from office staff/caseworker)Having looked at the various questions, I don’t remember having received correspondence from constituents where the constituent is complaining about a Government Department as such.\n&#xa0;\n They normally complain about a decision made by a Department, i.e., HMRC and DWP, but we can normally rectify the complaints by writing to the appropriate Departments to investigate or the person may have an option to Appeal against a decision.\n&#xa0;\nIf we raise issues with the CSA, they will normally respond by giving the next stage of the comp\nlaints \nprocedure, if required.\n&#xa0;\nW\ne have only used the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman on a couple of occasions, but because we are in Scotland I have not used the Local Government or the Housing Ombudsman, nor the Health Service section of the Parliamentary Ombudsman.\nIf memory serves me right (Q12), on the few occasions we used the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, they dealt in detail with the complaints. \n(Q13) I do think people should have direct access to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\nIt should not, only in my view though, be up to the individual MP to decide whether a person has a genuine grievance against a Government Department.\n&#xa0;\nIf a person had direct access to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, the Ombudsman’s office could still keep the MP attachment by sending a copy of the grievance and then the response to the MP, or if the constituent had not exhausted the normal complaints procedure of the Department the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman could refer the matter to the MP for follow-up.\nI had occasion to ‘phone the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’s office recently for advice in relation to a constituency case and I found the information I received extremely helpful.\nHowever, in relation to the “Background” note attached to the questionnaire, I would agree with the previous Ombudsman, Ann Abraham’s comments (Assessing complaints handling by government).\n&#xa0;\nIt might be wise to think in terms of, perhaps, a three stage complaints procedure whereby the initial complaint is received, investigated and a statement of decision sent to the person by the Department. If the person is still unsatisfied with the decision it could then be taken to a second stage review within the Department at a higher rank and if the review upholds the original decision then the person could have the option to appeal or have the case transferred to the Ombudsman.\n&#xa0;\nLaurence Robertson MPI think that Ministers should be available to answer written questions during recesses. After all, the officials research the points and write the answers, and the Ministers just need to sign them off.\nMinisters are very slow at responding to letters from Members’. This really should be speeded up.\nI’ve had a few Ministers cancel and change appointments which I’ve arranged with them at short notice. Diaries do change, of course, but this should be avoided where possible, as it can inconvenience people who have travelled considerable distances to see them.\nSome Ministers are good at offering surgeries/lunches/other opportunities to see them – this should be the norm. \nMinisters should be easier to reach on the phone, so that some meetings become unnecessary.\n&#xa0;Alison Seabeck MP (response from office staff/caseworker)Unfortunately, time constraints are making it difficult to furnish you with examples but the re-occurring problems are that correspondence is not being passed on between departments when it says that it has. For example, we write to DH and get a holding reply saying this is a matter for the DWP and that they have passed it on. I am finding myself having to chase these. Sometimes they appear to be lost for good and we’re having to re-send. \nWe have also noticed quite a few replies take in excess of 3 months to be responded to by Ministers. We think that a reply should take no longer than 2 months\n \n \nOther MPs’---\nThe thing I hate most is email replies to letters to ministers. You ought to be able to ask for written replies if you prefer.  If you write a letter then they ought to write a letter back.\n--\n-\nMy office finds that the quality of responses to enquiries varies from department to department, from Ministers within each department and by case to case. However, there is a perceivable trend of good replies and an efficient service from particular Ministers and equally responses which requires improvement from others. To achieve as efficient a reply as possible it may be helpful to have more direct contact with departmental correspondence teams to discuss individual complaints and response times. \nResponse times\nContent \n&#xa0;\nHowever, particular examples of unhelpful content include: \n--\n-\nI would like to mention that the replies from the Rt. Hon. Iain Duncan Smith MP and Lord Freud are excellent, very detailed and they usually answer the questions put to them.\n&#xa0;\n However, a lot of the other departments do not answer the questions, probably the worst being Philip Hammond and Chris Grayling’s offices.\n&#xa0;\n \nThe other thing that happens is that when Oliver’s constituents come to him with an excellent idea and he sends it to the Minister, it is pretty much ignored.\n&#xa0;\n The constituent is then obviously very disillusioned and not happy, the same as when the Minister has not answered the questions that the constituent has asked.\n&#xa0;\n \nAlso, Oliver sent the dissertation of one of his interns, on the advice of her lecturer, to the Rt. Hon. Theresa May MP and she did write and say thank you.\n&#xa0;\n A few weeks later in a speech Mrs. May made, it was almost the interns dissertation.\n&#xa0;\n It would have been nice for the intern to have been given some information that this was going to happen.\n&#xa0;\n The same thing happened with a constituent who came to see Oliver to discuss some ideas he had for the DWP, and later on that information appeared to have been used but without any acknowledgment to the constituent.\nDealing with this every day, I feel the departments in general need to have better replies and I would strongly disagree with the two statements below.\n&#xa0;\n \nI also think that with all the cases Oliver has dealt with to do with the Ombudsman, the replies have been a disappointment.\n&#xa0;\n Personally I would never contact the Ombudsman as I believe it to be a waste of time\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
