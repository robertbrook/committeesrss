[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]], Head of the Palestinian Mission in London, gave evidence.&#xa0;              

[[[Chair:]]] May I welcome members of the public to this sitting of the Foreign Affairs Committee? This is the second of a series of one-off evidence sessions on Middle East issues. The first was held in December on Syria, and we have other plans. This session will examine the current state of relations between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the efforts of the international community to bring about an agreement, and the prospect for the Middle East peace process in 2014.               May I give a very warm welcome to Professor Manuel Hassassian, the head of the Palestinian Mission in London? Professor, it is very good to see you again. You have been a generous host to us in the past when we have had meetings, so we are particularly delighted that you have accepted the invitation.               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] It is my pleasure, sir. &#xa0;              

[[[Q1]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] Would you like to say a few words by way of an opening statement?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] As members of the Committee know, the year 2014 is declared by the UN as the international year of solidarity with the Palestinian people. We hope that this year will not simply be in support of maintaining the status quo; we would like to see positive action in the Palestinians having their own independent Palestinian state. As far as the Palestinians are concerned, we have been committed to the peace process for the past 20 years. As a matter of fact, we have accepted so many concessions, starting with the acceptance of the state of Israel over 78% of the Palestinian historic territory, and so far there has been no acknowledgement of our nationhood or our statehood from the Israeli side. We want this peace process to succeed because we gain much, as Palestinians, from its success, for the simple fact that we could fulfil our national aspirations of having our independent state over 22% of historic Palestine. Yet we are the ones who could really set a precedent for security, not only in our part of the world but in the entire Middle East region.              We still do not know what Israel’s agenda is as long as it does not recognise Palestinian nationhood, and we are not really clear about Israel’s position in the peace process. We have seen preconditions coming into the actual, real negotiations, sponsored by the United States. Secretary of State John Kerry is putting his whole heart into making this a success story. The Palestinian side has been very co-operative with Mr Kerry in making it a success story. However, we have not seen the Israelis after almost 20 rounds of talks; we are still just vacillating between borders and security and trying more or less to agree on semantics—what kind of security and borders we are talking about.               We do not have the maps that Israel wants really to share with us. We went there with the idea that the 1967 borders are the borders for a two-state solution in which two democracies could live side by side. So far I can say that the peace process is being stalled by the impediments being put by Israel and by the continuing Israeli settlements—the building of settlements. The latest was a couple of days ago. Prime Minister Netanyahu has daringly announced that they will build another 1,400 units. Since 30 July last year, when we embarked on this new peace process, Israel has pledged to build more than 6,400 units on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Those are signs of a lack of commitment to the peace process as far as Israel is concerned. They are negative signs to our side that Israel is not serious about peace.              

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you. I should have added at the beginning, professor, that we have just half an hour and a lot of questions, so please stay focused on the precise point being put to you.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] You called me “professor”; as you know, professors tend to speak. If I were an ambassador, I would change my style. &#xa0;              

[[[Q2]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] I am the son of a professor and I know exactly what you mean.              Do you have the same feeling of urgency about the negotiations as Secretary of State Kerry had as he launched them? Is this the last chance for the two-state solution?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] I think it is the last chance for the two-state solution. That is why the Palestinians are taking these negotiations very seriously. We have been very co-operative with Mr Kerry. It is not only that the President is in direct contact with Mr Kerry, let alone the negotiating team, but I have managed to attend a couple of meetings with Mr Kerry. We have portrayed to him the total commitment of the Palestinians to non-violence with diplomatic efforts. We want the peace process to succeed and to have an independent Palestinian state. We have to finish with this occupation once and for all. We do not need crisis management. We want an end of conflict and an end of claims.&#xa0;              

[[[Q3]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] What are the implications if the talks do not succeed?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] The implications are many. First of all, the strategy of the Palestinians has always been a commitment to non-violence, so we are going to pursue our aims through non-violent means. It has been reiterated many times by President Mahmoud Abbas that the path towards a solution is through negotiations, diplomatic efforts and non-violent means. But saying that does not mean that the President, myself or any authority could crush the tendencies of the frustrated—almost four and a half million Palestinians—so that they do not go to the street and start a new wave of a third intifada.&#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q4]]] 

[[[Sir John Stanley:]]] Could you tell us how satisfied or not the Palestinian Authority is with the role and policies of the British Government towards getting meaningful negotiations under way between the Palestinians and the Israelis?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] In my opening remarks, I should have thanked the British Government for their total support to the Palestinians, not only politically, but economically, and their serious concerns about making this peace process a success story. We know through our private channels that the British Government have been working closely with Secretary of State Kerry and the American Administration in trying to push for a resolution to the conflict through peaceful efforts. Time and again we have heard Foreign Secretary William Hague saying that this is the last chance for a two-state solution. If we go to the West Bank today, we see that it is divided into four major cantons with no geographical continuity. With the building of the apartheid wall, with Gaza being totally separated and Jerusalem being isolated, there is no way that we could have our politically independent Palestinian state with this non-contiguous geographic entity, let alone with the building of settlements. It is not an encouragement to resolve this deal once and for all.               Going back to the question of the British Government, I think the British Government has been very committed to the peace process, and it has been very committed to helping Palestinian infrastructure development as well as promoting business with the Palestinians. It has always been committed in paying its contributions to peace efforts. &#xa0;              

[[[Q5]]] 

[[[Rory Stewart:]]] Thank you very much for coming. Given what you have said, it seems surprising that you still have confidence in a two-state solution. Why is that you came back to the negotiating table in July 2013? What gave you that optimism?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] The PLO since 1988 has committed itself to the recognition of the state of Israel and to a two-state solution. In 1993, we reiterated our commitment to de jure recognition of the state of Israel, believing that the only way out of the conflict was through negotiation. However, Israel did not really comply with all the agreements that were signed, and it kept on building settlements and trying more or less to create settlement blocs with what they call natural expansion in those settlements. The continuation of that will be an impediment to striking a peace with Israel. As I mentioned earlier, if that process continues, the Palestinians will not be able to accept a two-state solution.               The principle stands that our commitment has been to a two-state solution. That has been the position of the PLO, as the interlocutor with the state of Israel. If you ask simple lay people and academics, looking at what is happening on the ground, it will be impossible to have a two-state solution with the current status quo. That is why we are still committed, as a Government, to a two-state solution, but we do not know what the future holds if Israel continues with the same expansionist policies. &#xa0;              

[[[Q6]]] 

[[[Rory Stewart:]]] Just looking at the repeated threats by negotiators on your side to leave the table, why have those repeated threats been made and what do you think their impact has been?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] When you sit in a room and you keep talking about the same principles—Israel came to the negotiations not discussing the substantive issues that were outstanding in the final status agreements. Israel continued to talk about two issues: security and borders. They have never shown the maps of what their borders should be.               We went to the peace process believing that there would be a Palestinian state eventually, through negotiations, on the 1967 borders, which were part of the international legitimacy and part of the UN resolutions. The frustration of the Palestinian negotiating team is that time and again, Israel talks about borders and tries to impose new ideas like, for example, having total security of the Jordan Valley and talking about a lease of 40 years, after which they would rethink sitting with the Palestinians for a joint security over the Jordan Valley. Such initiatives, at a time when we know exactly what the endgame is, and when we know exactly what Israel should have and what we have—injecting the idea of a Jewish state at this time when the negotiations are about permanent status issues is an attempt, more or less, to deflect the entire peace process into something else. That is where the frustration of the Palestinian negotiators is coming from. Nothing is moving forward with the Israeli side. &#xa0;              

[[[Q7]]] 

[[[Andrew ]]]

[[[Rosindell]]]

[[[:]]] Professor, can you explain why the Palestinian Authority opposes the idea of accepting Israel as a nation state of the Jewish people? If the wording explicitly included equal rights for minorities, would that be acceptable?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] First of all, we have accepted the state of Israel, not the Jewish state of Israel. When you talk about a Jewish state, it implies two things for us immediately. One is the idea of negating the right of return for refugees, because by UN stipulations, they cannot go back to their original home, which today is in so-called Israel. Secondly, when you talk about a Jewish state, you are talking about an exclusive Jewish state, from which 1.5 million Palestinians holding Israeli citizenship are going to be banned. They will have to either be shifted into the West Bank or go to a third country. That is why the question of a Jewish state has a lot of implications for us. That is the first thing.              Secondly, why are we discussing a Jewish state at a time when we are still struggling to have our own borders set with Israel? Thirdly, I would say, let Israel start by changing its name by going to the United Nations. Why is Israel today not asking Jordan, with whom it has a kind of peace treaty, to recognise it as a Jewish state? Why not Egypt, for example? Why is it mandatory that the Palestinians should give them that recognition? At the same time, how can we recognise an entity when we are not recognised by the contending party as an entity ourselves? They did not recognise us as the Palestinian nation state; why should we give them recognition of a Jewish state? After the end of these negotiations, when we come to a final agreement, I do not see any reason why we should not accept a Jewish state. &#xa0;              

[[[Q8]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] Professor, what progress has been made to bring about greater unity between Gaza and the West Bank?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] We have never stopped the meetings between the Fatah faction and Gaza, but first I would like to make some general remarks. There is no division among Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank. Gaza and the West Bank has been recognised internationally by the United Nations. It has been considered an occupied territory. We are one and the same. The Palestinian Authority has never stopped funding Gaza, even under the control of Hamas. Thirdly, Hamas is part and parcel of the Palestinian people. We are part of the same social fabric. If they have certain ideologies that we do not agree with, it does not mean that they are on the wrong side of the equation.               What I am trying to say is that reconciliation is going to take place one of these days. Hamas has accepted giving the PLO the mandate to continue negotiations, and the result of those negotiations will be bound for a national referendum. In that respect, Hamas has not been an impediment to the peace process, and neither has it stopped the Palestinian Authority from meeting the Israelis and negotiating for peace, for that matter. &#xa0;              

[[[Q9]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] When will elections take place?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] Elections will take place as soon as we have reconciliation. Three kinds of elections are going to take place. One is legislative elections, because the Parliament has been dead for the last five years. Secondly, we will have presidential elections, and third, we will have Palestinian national council elections for the PLO. We hope that Hamas will participate in the three elections, representing the entire Palestinian social fabric. &#xa0;              

[[[Q10]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] What work, exactly, has been done on agreeing these elections?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] There are some concerns from Hamas about going back to the quota system. They want, as in the national council of the PLO, which is our organisation in exile, 40% of the seats. That is not really acceptable, for the simple fact that elections need representatives of all kinds equally. There is no quota system. If there is a quota system, then there is no democracy or electoral process to start with. Of course, Hamas was in a situation where it was in total control of Gaza; it is still controlling it militarily. But as you know, with the developments in Egypt and Syria, Hamas’s political position is becoming very weak in Gaza. Hamas would not like to see elections held now, because they know that they would lose elections in Gaza. &#xa0;              

[[[Q11]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] Professor, Fathi Hamad, Hamas’s Interior Minister, claimed in a speech the other day that Israel would cease to exist by 2022. Do you distance yourself from those remarks?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] I not only distance myself from those remarks, I categorically reject them.              

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you. That is very helpful.&#xa0;              

[[[Q12]]] 

[[[Mr Baron:]]] Professor, we all know how important sound economics and economic prosperity are to any process—peace process or otherwise. As you are aware, there are proposals on the table from Secretary of State Kerry and the Quartet representative Tony Blair to secure something like $4 billion in investment for the Palestinians. Is it possible to make economic progress before a political breakthrough? If so, how important is it? Where does this fit into the big scheme of things?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] This is a philosophical question: which comes first, the chicken or the egg? We have many differences over the issues of whether economic stability will bring political resolution to any kind of conflict. Or vice versa—if we have a political resolution then the economic development will basically pave the way towards more settlement, security and stability in the area.               It is important in our case that we should continually have economic development and try to secure that. The major problem today facing the Palestinian Authority is unemployment, as you know. I just came back from the West Bank three days ago and—my goodness gracious—the consumer goods in the West Bank are more expensive than in London. Would you believe that? We talk about a per capita income ratio of one to almost 20, and we buy our goods basically from Israel. If you talk about the basic necessities, the Palestinians cannot really afford to pay for their basic necessities.               I believe that economic development, yes, will try to create the ambience for stability and for the negotiations to succeed. But I would not say that it will be enough basically to maintain the status quo. We need to change the realities on the ground. Any kind of economic help would really give the momentum for the people to have hopes that they will cash very soon the dividends of the peace process.              If we start with some kind of development, and let us assume that the negotiations are moving well in tag with that kind of economic development, then I think that would be a recipe for success. &#xa0;              

[[[Q13]]] 

[[[Mr Baron:]]] Thanks, Professor. On a related theme, can I move on to Britain’s role in the peace process?               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] The Europeans’ role?              

[[[Mr Baron:]]] No, the British, the UK Government’s role. You were very complimentary in answer to a previous question from Sir John Stanley about the role we have played so far. However, as has been mentioned in the House of Commons, in Parliament, a number of times, we talk about a peace process but there is very little peace and there is not much process, so more needs to be done. What more should be done, can be done, by the UK Government to drive the process forward, given that we all accept that we could be drinking in the last-chance saloon?&#xa0;              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] First, let me be a little bit blunt. With all our praise and acknowledgment to the British Government in supporting the Palestinians, not only the peace process but the Palestinians per se in the Occupied Territories, we also have our frustrations with the British Government. Not recognising us as members of UNESCO was a total blow to me personally. I shouldn’t have seen such a position coming from the British Government while you have been very supportive of the Palestinians, let alone the issue of the Palestinians’ non-observer status in the UN, which was another frustration.               I think the British Government are trying their best to help but I can see certain pressures coming from the Israeli and American side. I see that the British are there not as full partners in the political process. They are much more involved in paying the cheques rather than in playing an important role in the peace process itself politically. But yet we never undervalued the role of the British Government in putting pressures—low profile and discreetly—with the Americans through their own recommendations, let alone their tough position, especially on the issue of settlements. The British Government have been very outspoken on the question of the illegality of building Israeli settlements.               That is very encouraging for us as Palestinians, but we need the British Government to play a little bit more effectively on the political scene. They could put pressures on the Americans, for example, to put aside the question of the Jewish state. Let’s put those issues aside and deal with them at the end of the political process. The problem has always been the process and not the substance. Both parties know exactly what the endgame will be and what the political solution will be. Our problem has always been the process. When the rules of the game are being permanently and draconianly changed while we are engaged in a process, that is not an encouraging gesture by the Israelis, so we would like the British Government to be more assertive and more affirmative in their position that the rules of the game should not be changed. You cannot change horses in the middle of the battle, and this is where we need you to be more proactive.&#xa0;              

[[[Q14]]] 

[[[Mr Baron:]]] A brief follow-up. You have described our role, perhaps accurately, as being more of a bystander than being proactive. If there were one, two, or perhaps three things that you would want to see changed in the UK’s approach with regard to the negotiations and the peace process, what specifically would they be?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] First, continue with your position of saying that settlements are an impediment to peace. This is very important. Secondly, we would like you to continue to give warnings to your business people not to do business with illegal settlements. We are not talking about an Israeli boycott here. We are talking about illegal Israeli settlements that are selling products for $700 million to $1 billion. That is profit a year, and that in itself gives the Israelis the incentive to expand their settlements. Trying not to warn but to discourage business people—British people—to make deals with the Israeli settlements is something that we would really appreciate. Very much so.&#xa0;              

[[[Q15]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Professor, in December last year, the European Council set out some conclusions that resulted in an offer of what they called an unprecedented package of European political, economic and security support to Israel and Palestine if they reach an agreement. What is the PA’s response?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] We opened our arms and we said we accept that. Israel has been lobbying the Europeans to improve the business guidance in its favour, and it has not stopped lobbying to change the rules of the association agreement. As far as we are concerned, we are really encouraged and we accept the fact that the EU has played a major role at least in economic development, but our frustration lies in the fact that it never had political teeth in the political process itself. So we have basically welcomed that package, but, of course, Israel is always trying to change the rules of the game and they always undermine the role of the Europeans, especially when it comes to the political part of the process.&#xa0;              

[[[Q16]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Do you not see that this offer, which obviously has benefits for Palestinians, also has benefits for the Israelis in that it gives them a better status in terms of the trading relationship with the EU?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] Israel has to decide whether it wants peace or wants to continue with its activities. Israel so far has shown us a war agenda, not a peace agenda. If Israel continues to go with impunity, we are discouraged to see any kind of resolution. Denying Palestinians human rights and their rights for self-determination will exacerbate the situation to the point where violence will be inevitable.               If you ask me, in a nutshell, where do we stand in the negotiations, I can give you one sentence that has been my tagline for the last three years: we are stuck between the historically inevitable and the politically impossible.&#xa0;              

[[[Q17]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] We are coming towards the end of our allotted time, Professor, but I want to press you on the status of  East Jerusalem. Will you tell us briefly about the importance that the Palestinian Authority attaches to the status of East Jerusalem and its availability to be the capital of a Palestinian state?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] First, East Jerusalem is considered to be an occupied Jerusalem, so when we talk about the West Bank and Gaza, we talk about East Jerusalem. We have never isolated East Jerusalem. We will never accept Jerusalem as being the undivided capital of the State of Israel. We have two solutions there. I have written extensively on the issue of Jerusalem, with 15 models of sovereignty through second-track negotiations. There is no time to discuss them, but our position, as the PLO and as the authority, is that without East Jerusalem there will never be an independent Palestinian state. That is number one. East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem should be part of an open city and the holy sites should be open to all faiths from all over the world, but if Israel decides to separate the city, the eastern part would be under our control and the western part would be under its control.               At Camp David, we accepted the fact that the Wailing Wall and the Jewish quarter would be ceded to the state of Israel as part of the continuation of the holy sites and religious rituals. We accepted that in a letter from the late Yasser Arafat to President Clinton. As you know, the Camp David accords did not succeed for two reasons. First, Israel did not accept the right of return of refugees. Secondly, Israel wanted total political sovereignty over East Jerusalem. Those were the reasons why the peace process failed and why we had a second bloody intifada.              As we stand today, East Jerusalem should be the capital whether open or not and that could be done. I have been working with Canadians on the issue of the internationalisation of the one square kilometre, which is the old city where we have all the religious sites, and on how an international body could control it, with the consensus of Israelis and Palestinians. There is much lateral thinking about how we can share the city of Jerusalem without building high walls between us and the Israelis.&#xa0;              

[[[Q18]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] Can I take you back to the right of return? You mentioned it a moment ago and in a little more detail earlier in our discussion. Do you accept that it is not now possible for there to be an absolute right of return and that some kind of compromise may be necessary, including, for example, financial compensation for those who might have that right in other circumstances but who cannot now exercise it for reasons of geography?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] First, let me say that the right of return is a legal, moral and individual right.&#xa0;              

[[[Q19]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] It is resolution 194 of the United Nations General Assembly, not of the Security Council.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, I agree that it is not a Security Council resolution and that it is not legally binding, but it is still a resolution that came from the General Assembly. As I said, it is a legal, moral and individual right. Each Palestinian refugee is entitled to reparations and to the right to choose how his or her right of return should be implemented. The refugees have been given meaningful options here. This is coming not only from my side as a Palestinian; it has also been discussed in the second-track negotiations. There are plausible solutions to the question of return.              Israel has to accept the principle of return. In terms of pragmatism, which means choosing between constraints, we know for a fact that 7 million refugees are not going to come back, and Israel also knows that for a fact. Our red line of refugees is basically the 350,000 who are living in Lebanon, but not all of them would like to go back to their original homes, as you know. The options are as follows. First is returning to their original homes in what we call today Israel; the second is returning to the state of Palestine. Third is naturalisation in host countries, and many of them have been naturalised. For example, our refugees in Jordan hold Jordanian citizenship. In Syria, they hold Syrian identity cards. They have been naturalised in many countries, such as Canada and America, but not Lebanon. Fourth is resettlement in a third country, such as if they opt to go to Canada, the UK or the US.              In addition to all those options, the question of reparations must include restitution of property, which Israel is adamantly refusing, and compensation for material and non-material damage that was inflicted as a result of the forcible removal of the Palestinian diaspora following the 1948 war. There are solutions to the refugee issues. We should not take that as an impediment for a final settlement.&#xa0;              

[[[Q20]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] Finally, do you accept that land swaps may be a tool to be used not only in the overall settlement, but also in relation to a right of return?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] I have to be explicit with you: I was the top consultant for the late Faisal Husseini, and in the year 2000 when we decided to go to Camp David it was my team that came up with the idea of land swaps. Land swaps are important, if we first acknowledge that the borders are the 1967 borders. If there are minor rectifications to be pragmatic—we agreed in Camp David that they should be equal in quality and quantity, consensual and accepted by both sides—land swaps could be a concession on the part of the Palestinians, and they could salvage Israel from getting into a deep confrontation with its own internal population, especially the upcoming war with the Israeli settlers if a decision is taken to dismantle the settlements. So yes, we agreed to land swaps at that time. We are reconsidering the question of land swaps, depending on the outcome of the negotiations.               

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] I visited Orient House on a number of occasions and I met Faisal Husseini. It is a matter of some regret to many of us that he is no longer with us. &#xa0;              

[[[Q21]]] 

[[[Sandra Osborne:]]] Can I ask about the human rights situation of the Palestinian people, in relation to non-violence? You have reiterated the PLO position on non-violence, but you have said that under certain circumstances violence is inevitable. The situation in Gaza is dire, as you know, and there is a lack of ability for economic development because of the blockade, etc. Do you think it is right that the tunnels should be destroyed? How do you think the people in Gaza are going to react if the peace talks fail, and do you think that Hamas will abide by a peaceful campaign?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] This needs a long answer.              

[[[Chair:]]] I am afraid that you have one minute.               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] First, if there is peace with the Israelis, I think all issues will be resolved; but the opposition is nurtured by conflict and if there is no progress, the opposition could take that as an excuse to perpetuate its presence on the ground. That is what Hamas has been doing.               With the situation in Egypt, the total crushing of the Muslim fundamentalists and all the tunnels being closed, Hamas is now precarious at best. It is in no position to make a political bargain, except accepting that the only way is to reconcile with Fatah and accepting the outcome of the negotiations. Hamas has no other choices. The military option for Hamas is no option at all. By the way, it is not Hamas that is instigating rockets against Israel: there are some Islamic jihadists, al-Qaeda members and extreme fundamentalists, which Hamas no longer controls in Gaza. They are the sources of tension now. That is why I say that if there is a breakthrough in the peace process, the situation will change on the ground and people will become more hopeful.               Nobody can control how people react to dire economic conditions. We saw that in the first and second intifadas. It was not political frustration that led to the intifadas, but the dire economic conditions. Now, with a package deal of $4 billion—the PLO has been investing almost half its budget in Gaza—and with a political process coming to fruition with the Israelis, with pressure put on by the United States, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel.               But I am not that optimistic, looking at the situation on the ground and trying to see, through leakage, what is going on in the negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis. There are no signs for us to be hopeful yet. We are emphasising that the peace process is the only way out, that there will never be a military solution to the conflict and that we have to exert all our strenuous efforts to make the peace process a success, but not at the expense of giving up our legitimate rights.               

[[[Chair:]]] Professor Hassassian, thank you very much indeed.               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Hassassian]]]

[[[:]]] Thank you, sir. It is my pleasure.               

[[[Chair:]]] Our time is up, but you can probably sense that the Committee is holding itself back, as indeed you have been. We could have gone on for at least another hour. Thank you very much indeed. We look forward to maintaining our contact with you.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Examination of Witness]]]Witness: 

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[, ]]]Israeli Ambassador to the UK, gave evidence.&#xa0;              

[[[Q22]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] We continue with our second witness. I am delighted to welcome His Excellency Daniel Taub, the Israeli ambassador to London. You have been the ambassador here since 2011, and we have enjoyed our contact with you. I am delighted that you can appear here publicly to take our questions today. We have 35 minutes and we have a lot of questions. Is there anything that you would like to say by way of an opening remark?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] First, thank you very much for having me. It is a pleasure to be here. Perhaps I will make a couple of very brief opening comments.              Anyone who thinks about our region at the moment, and through the two years that I have been here, has to approach it with a fair amount of humility, and we need humility at a number of different levels. We have been taught again and again how much we can actually know about what is going on in the countries of the region, how much we can actually analyse what it is that we know and, most of all, how much we can actually influence our neighbouring countries, which are going through a period of upheaval such that you would probably have to go back more than 100 years to find anything remotely similar. But even during this period, when things are playing themselves out and we are finding that the old order in many of these countries is both more fragile and more resistant or resilient than we imagined, there are one or two insights that might help us when we come closer to home.              If I had to point out just two of them, the first is that when it comes to Israel’s conflict, particularly with our Palestinian neighbours, we need to resolve it because we need to resolve it, but we should not delude ourselves that resolving our conflict will be the core of resolving all of the issues in the Middle East. For many years, that has been a dogma for a lot of people approaching our region. We have enough on our shoulders as it is.              The second thing is that if we look at all the different conflicts in our region, one of the things they have in common is that hardly any of them are territorial. They are ideological, tribal, generational, but not territorial. That invites us to look a little more closely at the conflict that we are involved in to see whether it is simply a territorial conflict.               Clearly, our conflict has a territorial dimension, and clearly a territorial compromise will be a part of any solution, but I think that it is a mistake to imagine that simply addressing territorial dimensions will actually resolve a conflict. I think one of the things that Israelis have realised is that we are talking about a conflict with roots that run much deeper—in some quarters, we are talking about a simple, fundamental opposition to the idea of the Jewish people having a homeland in this part of the world. Unless we address that, it will be very difficult to achieve a lasting solution. Those are my opening remarks. &#xa0;              

[[[Q23]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you, ambassador. Can I point out that we have half an hour and a lot of questions, so brevity in answers would be appreciated? As far as the current negotiations are concerned, John Kerry said there was a sense of urgency about this. Do you think this is the last-chance saloon for a two-state solution?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] We certainly agree that there is urgency and a desire for peace. If you look at the Israeli public, you will see something very interesting. The statistics show that, today in Israel, you have a larger majority that supports significant, generous concessions for peace—territorial concessions—to create a two-state solution than ever before in the history of the state of Israel. And yet the same statistics show that the Israeli public is more sceptical about the chances of reaching that peace than it has been at any time over the past 65 years.               I think there are two reasons for that. The first reason is that we are talking about a public which has tragically been burned. It has seen twice, over the past decade, territory handed over to neighbours in an attempt to reach peace or stability with them and in both cases we have seen the territory that was given back—whether in south Lebanon or Gaza—turning into launching pads for thousands of missiles that have been fired into the heart of Israel. Yesterday we saw the surprising, shocking spectacle at the funeral of Ariel Sharon, who pulled 9,000 Israelis out of Gaza, of missiles being fired from the areas that he pulled out of. This is something that Israelis are aware of: the danger that the area that we pull out of will not be a force for peace, but a basis for continuing the conflict.               The second reason, I think, why Israelis are sceptical, unfortunately, is that at the moment it does not seem like we are working with a partner that is able or prepared to grapple with the real nub of the conflict. To have a statement by President Abbas this week that continues, 65 years later, still to reject the partition resolution that talks about a Jewish state and a Palestinian state; to insist on what is called a right of return for Palestinian refugees, which would be the end of the two-state solution—those are the reasons why Israelis, unfortunately, are sceptical at the moment. &#xa0;              

[[[Q24]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] What would be the implications if the negotiations do not succeed?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] The focus of our attention at the moment is to do everything we possibly can in order to make them succeed. In fact, that is the reason why we are doing things today which previously would have been considered impossible or unconscionable for Israelis. You are talking to me at a time when Israel has just released the third tranche of brutal murderers. There are no other words for it: these are people who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment because they had deliberately killed innocent women and children and men, and they are being released into a society where the families of the victims are witnessing them go free, expressing no regret for their actions.               The only reason why Israel is doing that is that we realise that we need to give this particular round of negotiations everything that we possibly can. Our partner has said that that is what is necessary for them to stay at the negotiating table. If that is the case, as painful as it is, that is what we are prepared to do. &#xa0;              

[[[Q25]]] 

[[[Sir John Stanley:]]] Ambassador, how satisfied—or not—is the Israeli Government with the role and policies that have been pursued by the British Government in trying to get meaningful discussions under way between the Israelis and the Palestinians?               

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] First of all, thank you, Sir John, for the question. We are enormously appreciative of all the support that has been given to the current process. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, has spoken very highly of, and been very supportive of, John Kerry in getting the negotiations on track.               Having said that, there are a number of things that could be done that might help to contribute to making negotiations more effective. One is that there is a need to keep the centre of gravity at the negotiation table. One of the things that is most damaging to the negotiations is the sense that there is a magnetic attraction away from them. For example, one of the things that is very problematic for the negotiations is the sense that the Palestinians constantly have one eye on either the United Nations or other international organisations as an alternative track to try to get political achievements.               The fact is that there have been decades of resolutions against Israel in the United Nations, and they have not changed the situation on the ground for Palestinians. What has changed the situation on the ground for Palestinians are a few short years of negotiations that resulted in a situation where 98% of Palestinians voted for a Palestinian council that they elected themselves. If we are going to get further down that track we have to keep the centre of gravity at the negotiating table, which is why resolutions, initiatives and international organisations, in our view, probably play a counter-productive role in moving us forward. &#xa0;              

[[[Q26]]] 

[[[Sir John Stanley:]]] Do you think that the British Government have been as proactive as the Israeli Government would have wished in trying to get a meaningful negotiation under way?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] The British Government have made a number of different contributions. At the moment, they have made it quite clear that their view is that the initiative is being spearheaded by the United States and they are playing a supporting role as far as that is concerned. We have also noted that thought is now being given within Europe to ways of incentivising peace for the parties. We think that is very important, in order to try to paint a very clear picture for the peoples of the region of what a post-peace future could look like for them and to try to incentivise peace in that way. Those are positive directions. &#xa0;              

[[[Q27]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] Ambassador, you have said that, despite the scepticism and the experience of the past years, the Israeli Government decided last year to go back to the negotiating table. What was the specific reason why Israel went back?               

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] It may sound banal, but we went back because we want peace. The fact is that if you think about Israeli society, we are talking about a society that is paying a price for not having peace on a daily basis. Last year, we had 1,277 terrorist attacks or attempted attacks in the West Bank alone—that is not even talking about the vast number of missiles that have been fired from the Gaza strip, the tunnels that we have discovered going from the Gaza strip under Israel in an attempt to blow up Israeli villages or kidnap soldiers, and so on. We are talking about a society where every young man and woman has to serve three or two years of army service and then a month a year of army reserve duty. We are talking about a situation where if you simply look economically, the benefits of the synergy between an Israeli economy and a Palestinian economy that were working in peace next to each other would be enormous. There are clear and obvious benefits of peace, and those are things that we would very much like to achieve.               Having said that, we are doing it with a great deal of concern at the moment. We are doing it in a region where on every border we see signs of either current instability or potential instability. In that situation, we need to be very careful that when we do reach an agreement, it will be an agreement that enhances Israel’s security and does not reduce it. &#xa0;              

[[[Q28]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] Can I ask about one of those neighbours—not a direct one, but one that is not far away—Iran? Is it more important for Israel, as a security priority, to get an agreement with the Palestinians, or to have your concerns taken into account with regard to what is happening with Iran?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I don’t think anyone is offering us a choice between the two. We are talking about a situation where Iran is a strategic threat, not just to Israel but to the entire region and further afield, of an order that it is hard to imagine anything else that comes close. If we are talking about the most radical regime getting hold of the most radical weapons, what that would mean in terms of Iranian hegemony and in terms of an Arab nuclear arms race throughout the Middle East, what that would mean in terms of the empowerment of Iran’s terrorist proxies whom we already see are the most nefarious influences throughout the region, then the impact and dangers there are very clear indeed.              What is clear is that if we were able to address the Iranian nuclear aspirations effectively, that would be a significant setback for many of the elements in the region that are very destructive and obstacles for peace. The only connection that I might point out is that with all the complexity that we see at the moment, the fact is that when we think about Iran and its proxies and the radical axis that runs from Tehran, through Damascus to Beirut and perhaps even on to Gaza, it makes us realise that there is actually a profound commonality of interest between Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan and maybe the Gulf states. If we can hold fast to the realisation that we have fundamental strategic interests in common, that could actually be a help in moving us forwards towards a peaceful arrangement.&#xa0;              

[[[Q29]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] So there is a relationship between your security concerns about Iran and the Middle East peace process?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I think all these things are related, but those are particularly related because we have Iran deliberately playing an extremely negative role in training, supporting and funding the fundamentalist organisations and elements that have tried to destroy prospects for peace in the region. That is a fact.&#xa0;              

[[[Q30]]] 

[[[Mr Baron:]]] Ambassador, welcome. Can I press you on the areas of disagreement between yourselves and the Palestinians? You hinted—and it makes absolute sense—that it is in your interests as well as that of the Palestinians that the peace process progresses, particularly with regard to the wider security of Israel within the Middle East. We heard earlier from Professor Hassassian that when it comes to negotiations, the Israelis only really seem keen to focus on borders and security, and not to address some of the other substantive issues, whether it is the division of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, the settlements and so on. What would you say to that, and can you give us an outline of your position on those other issues, other than borders and security?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] First, I don’t think it is my job to give you details of Israel’s positions inside the negotiating room at the moment. One of the most effective aspects of the current negotiations is how little is actually being leaked from the room. It is something of a precedent and is one of the things that actually gives us hope that things may be moving differently this time round.               I certainly don’t think it is the case that Israel is only talking about or only showing flexibility on these issues. The fact is, we have had quite a number of negotiation processes, and I have had the opportunity to be involved in many of them, where Israel has gone into considerable detail on all issues, including those you have mentioned. Sadly, repeatedly, even when Israel has surprised the international community with the generosity of its proposals, whether it was by Prime Minister Olmert or Prime Minister Barak, it has not been met with a forthcoming response, or in some cases any response at all, by the Palestinian side.              I do think that security is important even to enable us to deal with some of the issues that the Palestinians want us to deal with. I say this as a negotiator: it is not possible to talk about territorial issues without addressing the security issues in some way, because what you are able to do in relation to territory very much depends on whether you have a presence, a protective force or some other kind of arrangement in another area, and you simply cannot talk about one thing in the absence of another. That is one of the reasons why we think that all the issues must be on the table.&#xa0;              

[[[Q31]]] 

[[[Mr Baron:]]] May I follow that up, Ambassador? One wouldn’t want to know, and one respects the confidentiality of the negotiations. However, can I push you on one issue that is in the public domain—the Jordan valley? I think it is common knowledge that Israel would like to maintain a presence in the Jordan valley. The Palestinian Authority has objected to that and has talked about, at least, an international presence. I know that it is a contentious issue from your point of view, but Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem is believed to be illegal under international law. I don’t want to go there, but isn’t adding in the Jordan valley adding in an obstacle to progress in the peace process?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] The simplest way to answer that is that we want peace, primarily, for our children, but it is not going to be any good unless it lasts for our grandchildren. We are trying to think of a peace that will be sustainable. If we try to think realistically about how to ensure a modicum of security for the state of Israel and, actually, for the Palestinian entity itself, it is very hard for us to imagine how that will happen without some form of security presence in the Jordan valley. That was one of the reasons why, in the past, for many years Israel thought that it could not accept the idea of a Palestinian state altogether.              Over the past decade or two, Israel’s positions have moderated considerably, in a way in which, interestingly, Palestinian positions have not. The fact is that today we have the establishment of a Palestinian state as being part of the Government’s manifesto. Having said that, that cannot be done at the expense of ensuring a line of security and defence that will prevent jihadist and other extremist elements being invited into Jordan and coming across into Israel.&#xa0;              

[[[Q32]]] 

[[[Mr Baron:]]] Can I press you on that very briefly, Ambassador? The Jordan valley has become an obstacle, rather than just an issue, only relatively recently, certainly from the point of view of the public ether. Can you understand the frustration of those sitting on the other side of the table? There are enough obstacles to a peace process as it is, yet this seems to be an additional one that has been introduced relatively recently.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I actually don’t think this is a new issue. Israel’s position on the issue has been long-standing; I think what is new is the Palestinian recalcitrance on the issue, genuinely. In fact, without going into too much detail, it is also fair to say that, even while the threats have increased, Israeli demands for a security presence along the Jordan valley have become more focused and narrower than they have been in most previous rounds of negotiations. I think you will find that, in the face of genuine security threats, Israel is asking for something far more focused, far less intrusive and far less troubling to the establishment of a viable, sovereign, independent Palestinian state. At the end of the day, however, that is something that is going to be necessary.              Unless we have some sort of security, for both Israel and Palestine—Israel has considered options regarding international forces. I have to say that the record of international forces in our region has been rather mixed. There is a phrase that Israelis sometimes use: “an umbrella which melts in the rain.” That phrase sometimes comes to mind when one describes the record of international forces when push comes to shove. Israel has never asked anybody else to defend its citizens, but if we are going to move towards a situation in which Israel will have a narrow waist—where there will be a significant territorial withdrawal—there needs to be some basic elements to try to ensure that what has happened in Gaza and south Lebanon, and what is even beginning to happen in Sinai, does not happen in large areas of land that are close to the centre of the Israeli population.&#xa0;              

[[[Q33]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] A moment or two ago, Ambassador, I interpreted you as expressing some optimism, heavily qualified, about the possible outcome of an agreement with Iran. However, it seems to me that that is in quite sharp contrast to the dismissive approach taken by Mr Netanyahu when it came to the recent agreement brokered by John Kerry and others.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] Okay. I don’t want to deny it, but can I just ask what I said that made you think I was optimistic about an agreement?&#xa0;              

[[[Q34]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] My understanding was that you were pointing to possible benefits if the Iran question could be resolved. I think I am right about that.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I think that’s absolutely true, yes. I think so, if we could resolve it.              &#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q35]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] And you did so, if I may say so, with qualified optimism.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] Sure.&#xa0;              

[[[Q36]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] That seems to be rather different from the rather dismissive attitude that Mr Netanyahu took in relation to the agreement recently brokered by John Kerry and others.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I think that within Israel there was very broad consensus about concern about the interim agreement that was brokered by John Kerry. The general feeling was that this is an agreement that in terms of preventing Iranian ambitions was not restrictive enough and did not stop any one of the current centrifuges from carrying on spinning. It did not stop the weaponisation programme and it did not stop the R and D programmes, and so on and so forth. The hints in the interim agreement as to what might be the parameters of a permanent agreement were also very worrying. I think the concerns are genuinely widely felt.               Having said that, we are now working very closely with the United States, and we are also in close dialogue with the United Kingdom. We are trying to make sure the final agreement, when it is reached, will be an effective way of resolving the issue. At the end of the day, our goals are joint goals, but I don’t think it is a secret that there have been some differences along the way as to what the arrangements are that will help us to achieve those goals.&#xa0;              

[[[Q37]]] 

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] But if any final agreement is to be reached, it needed a temporary, interim agreement, albeit one that Israel finds unacceptable. It is only one step along the road, isn’t it?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] That is certainly the position that has been presented to us by some of our close friends. Israel is concerned that at the end of the six-month period, whenever it starts, we may find ourselves in a situation where Iran is not further away from but is closer to being a nuclear weapon state. Obviously, that is a cause of great concern for us.              There are a number of reasons why we see this differently. One of them, if I put it simply, is that here, although there is genuine concern about Iran, it seems to focus on what Iran might do in future if it becomes a nuclear weapon state. That is of course of major concern to us, but where we sit in our region we see not just what Iran might do in the future, but what it is doing today on a daily basis. There is simply not a day when our security forces, our armed services, our kids and our diplomats—without going into too much detail—are not dealing with the results of an Iranian war against the state of Israel. That is continual on a day-to-day basis, and focuses our attention on the need for a very robust agreement to make sure that Iran’s ambitions cannot be fulfilled.&#xa0;              

[[[Q38]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Mr Taub, many would say that the Jewish state proposal would ignore the history of and probably undermine the rights of Muslim and Christian Arabs who are Israeli citizens. What place is there for the 20% of Israeli citizens who are not Jewish, and why is this being introduced into the negotiations at this time?                            

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] Thank you for the question. It has not been introduced into the negotiations at this time. The notion that we are going to resolve this conflict by having a Jewish state and an Arab state next to each other goes back almost as far as the conflict. The fact is that that was the language of the UN partition resolution in 1947 and almost every other initiative to try to resolve it. You are absolutely right that the fact that a state is a homeland for the Jewish people cannot and should not prejudice in any way the rights of the 20% of citizens in Israel who are not Jewish. That is why we have full equality under the law and Members of Parliament who are Christian and Muslim. In my embassy here—&#xa0;              

[[[Q39]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] So why do you say it is a Jewish state?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I don’t think there is a country in our region that does not have a definition of being a Muslim state, an Arab state, an Islamic state and so on. I wish we could see in those states freedoms for their minorities. The most important thing here—and the reason why it is so upsetting to Israel—is that we must recognise that the Palestinians have not only not recognised the fact that the Jewish people have a right to a homeland, they have been actively denying it.               This may relate to Sir John’s question about what Britain could perhaps do to help in the Palestinian context. I have spent quite a lot of time working with Palestinians on their school books and their children’s television, and so on. There is a degree of rewriting history, incitement, indoctrination and glorification of what is called martyrdom, but is effectively suicide terrorism, which to my mind really borders on child abuse because children are being deprived of access to their history and a proper education. Part of that is simply denying, in a preposterous way, any Jewish connection to Islam at all.&#xa0;              

[[[Q40]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Mr Taub, if you want the Palestinians to recognise an Israeli state, it would be a good start if you recognised a Palestinian state. The chance of their recognising Jewish state might come afterwards. Is this not putting the cart before the horse?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] No, quite the opposite. The fact is that, at the moment, between the two sides the only side that actually recognises the state of the other is Israel. Every single Prime Minister of Israel for close to two decades has talked about the right of Palestinians to a Palestinian state. Sadly, we are still waiting for the first Palestinian leader to recognise the right of a Jewish state. Only when we both do that will we be able to move forward.&#xa0;              

[[[Q41]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] How do you think it helps the establishment of a Palestinian state, because that is obviously what the endgame should be, when the construction of settlements in the Occupied Territories has been unabated since the 1967 six-day war, with an international view that the territories are occupied illegally? Why is Israel pursuing settlement expansion at a time when we are supposed to be talking about a peace process?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] First of all, of course, it is not unabated. I can think, very significantly, of a period of time when, in response to President—              

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] Why hasn’t it stopped full stop?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]—when, in response to President Abbas’s request, Prime Minister Netanyahu did stop settlement building and it turned out that that did not help to keep President Abbas at the negotiating table. I think that there is a need for a certain element of perspective here. The fact is that, within the West Bank, the entire quantity of territory that is taken up by Israeli settlements is less than 2%.&#xa0;              

[[[Q42]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] There are half a million Israeli settlers.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] It is less than 2%. We are talking about a situation where Israel has not only had periods of freezing settlements but has uprooted them. From Gaza, we pulled out 9,000 Israeli settlers, and we also pulled out settlers from settlements in the West Bank—              

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] What about international law? Do you not recognise international law?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]—and in those places where we did pull settlers out, unfortunately, as I mentioned before, we have seen those areas turning into launching pads for Iranian-backed weaponry.              The goal at the moment has to be not sending a message to Israelis that large parts of their population, or significant parts of their population, are disfranchised but quite the opposite: how do we create an environment where, once and for all, we and the Palestinians can reach an agreement that will render the issue of settlements, like so many other issues, obsolete because we have two states living side by side and working and co-operating together?              

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] How can you have proper negotiations—              

[[[Chair:]]] Order. I call Frank Roy.&#xa0;              

[[[Q43]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] Ambassador, last month the EU outlined a clear offer of support to both sides in the event of a settlement. What is Israel’s reaction to that offer of support?              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] As I mentioned before, the offer of support is very important. I think the whole process of incentivising peace and making people realise that peace is possible is very important. There are two elements that I would highlight. First, when you are offering support, no party in the Middle East is monolithic. One of the questions that you need to ask yourselves is “Who are we strengthening and who are we weakening in the way that we provide this support?” One of the areas where there has been improvement, although it could be that additional improvement is required, is that in the past aid, support and funds have gone to those aspects of Palestinian society that are not the most peace minded and are not the ones that are trying to reach out and accommodate but that, in many cases, have actually tried to subvert the chances for peace.              The other point I would make is slightly more general. I think that Britain and the international community, and we Israelis as well, probably need to change the way that we talk about peace. In an extraordinarily complicated arena, we talk about peace in our corner as though it turns out to be a rather simplistic approach and a rather utopian ideal. The fact is that that is not the case. The fact is that, when peace comes, it is going to be a very complicated peace. If I look at peace resolutions that have taken place in the modern era around the world—in Cyprus, in former Yugoslavia and so on—they have been complicated and messy agreements. I went with one of my Palestinian counterparts in the negotiations to see the situation in Northern Ireland, so many years after the Good Friday agreement. What was most inspiring to us was not seeing how easy it was to make peace, but seeing how hard it was to make peace and how hard it was to keep it alive. In a very profound way, it made this peace seem realistic to us. It made it seem tangible to us. &#xa0;              

[[[Q44]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] Ambassador, on that same analogy, surely it was right for the United Kingdom to offer support at a grass-roots level. If it was, surely it is right for the EU to offer that very same support at a very grass-roots level.              

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] I think support is very important. You need to have peace from the top down, you need to have peace from the bottom up and you need to have peace from the outside in. You need to have your neighbours being supportive of peace. The only point I am making is that when you have grass-roots support, you need to make sure that it is grass-roots support for peace and not grass-roots elements that are trying to undermine peace.               To return to the final point I was making, when we talk about peace we need to be honest. We need to send a message to Israelis and Palestinians that we recognise that peace is not going to solve all their problems. Peace is really exchanging one set of problems for a different set of problems; they are just a much better set of problems. &#xa0;              

[[[Q45]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] The Arab peace initiative—as you know, it has been on the table for over 10 years, but Israel does not accept it. Is there any reason for that?                             

[[[His Excellency Daniel ]]]

[[[Taub]]]

[[[:]]] We should start by recognising that the Arab peace initiative is a significant step forward from where the Arab League was in 1967 when we saw what were called the three “nos” of Khartoum: no to peace, no to recognition and no to negotiation. Here we have a document that talks about the possibility of genuine, normal relations between Israel and its neighbours, and I think that is a significant step forward. Having said that, it is not really a basis for negotiations. It is a document that sets out what the Arab League think that the results of the negotiation should be on a series of issues, and, obviously, Israel has a number of problems with the Arab League dictates.              I would say, picking up from Frank’s question, that there is another issue in relation to the Arab League document proposal that I see with a certain amount of disappointment. According to the document, no normalisation between Arab states and Israel can take place until every conflict that Israel is involved in—between Israel and the Palestinians, between Israel and Syria, and so on and so forth—has been resolved in its entirety. If we are talking about the potential for creating an environment in which the difficult decisions can be made, we are going to need some outside influence, and a process of gradually normalising relations between Israel and the Palestinian states is one of the elements that can contribute to that. To have the states of the Arab League saying, “We are not prepared to play this role; we are simply going to sit on the sidelines until somehow or other all the problems have been resolved,” is unfortunate. It takes out of the mix an element that could actually be very constructive.               

[[[Chair:]]] That is very helpful, thank you. May I thank you very much indeed, ambassador, for your time? It is time to move on to our next witnesses. We enjoy the regular contact that we have with you, and we look forward to its continuing in the future.

[[[Q46]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] May I welcome our third set of witnesses? We have Professor Rosemary Hollis, from City University, London, Dr Ahron Bregman, from King’s College, London, and Professor Yezid Sayigh, from the Carnegie Endowment’s Middle East Centre of Beirut. I thank you all very much indeed for finding the time to come and talk to us today. It is much appreciated. On an administrative note, I am told that there may be a vote at any second. Unfortunately, we would have to suspend the sitting for 12 minutes while we do that.               May I open the batting by taking soundings from you on how you see the current negotiations going? Dr Bregman, would you like to start?

[[[              ]]]

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] We do not know much about the negotiation. Kerry is very tough and determined and we are waiting to see what he is going to tell us. If he succeeds and puts a plan on the table, it will be a general one, with principles. If there is some progress, the secularists will probably be very unhappy about it. If it fails, the Palestinians will be very frustrated, so it is not going to be very optimistic. &#xa0;              

[[[Q47]]] 

[[[Chair:]]] What do you think the implications of failure are?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] There might be war. The Palestinians might embark on the third intifada. I think that it has already started. I think the historians, looking back, will say that the third Palestinian intifada started in 2012, 2013. It is different. It is not the first intifada, which was quite organised, and it is not the second intifada, which involved suicide bombers, but there are random, sporadic attacks in the Occupied Territories and in Israel proper. If the negotiations fail, they might embark on the third intifada. They are very careful, because the man who was buried yesterday—Ariel Sharon—taught them a very harsh lesson in 2012, turning the West Bank into middle-eastern Dresden. So they are very careful, but they are also very frustrated and they might do something.               

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] I thought it was instructive that the Israeli ambassador said earlier, “Be careful not to get too excited about any peace.” My position is that if the Kerry initiative produces a deal, an awful lot of Palestinians will perceive it as a stitch-up. They will not be celebrating peace. They will, in a sense, be feeling rather grim and humiliated that they have had to capitulate to something that they cannot be proud of and that will not end the conflict for refugees around the region. On the Israeli side, my perception is that, whereas once there was a conscience among most Israelis that they did not want to be party to an occupation and to the suppression of other people’s rights, I sense now that it is more common to find an attitude that simply says, “The Jews historically have had the most appalling treatment. Life is not fair. You guys get used to it.”              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] I guess a lot depends on just what is in any framework agreement or deal, if there is one. A lot also depends on just what the United States in particular, and to a significant degree the EU, and in general the UK, provide in the form of political oversight for the implementation, and on what sort of substance they give the whole process. That means that if there is just enough in a framework agreement, even if it is overall a modest package that is backed by the political will to see the process through—we have not see that sort of will before, so I am already casting some doubt—there is some hope of going forward with that in the West Bank, although not necessarily in Gaza.               However, I am not hopeful that we will start seeing that sort of political leadership from the EU or the United States in particular. I do not see any signs of that. I do not see why we should expect a package to come out of whatever secret talks are going on that would somehow produce outcomes that will differ fundamentally from what we have seen in the past. Whether that leads to what my colleague and friend Dr Bregman just referred to as a third intifada, I am equally doubtful. There is a high level of cynicism and fatigue among Palestinians over a number of different issues, including their own divisions, which means that the scope for mass mobilisation and confrontation is not very high. That leaves us pretty much where we are today, which is not great.&#xa0;              

[[[Q48]]] 

[[[Sir John Stanley:]]] May I ask all three of you—briefly, in the interests of time—to give us your assessment of the performance of the British Government, bearing in mind our long historical presence in the region since the end of the Ottoman empire and our P5 membership? What is your assessment of the British Government’s performance in trying to get meaningful negotiations under way between the Palestinians and the Israelis?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] I think it is an American affair; they will lead it. The British could help by providing incentives to the parties, for example. The Israelis are now reluctant to give up on the Jordan Valley for what they describe as security reasons. The British can say, “We will help you to protect the border from the Jordanian side of the river. We know the Jordanians and we will work with the Americans to help you there.” The Israelis would also like to see a deal that is bigger than an Israeli-Palestinian deal. Perhaps you can help to mobilise other Arab countries in the Middle East to support the Palestinians. Some of the issues are not in the hands of the Palestinian leadership. Abu Mazen cannot give up on Jerusalem. He needs the support of Saudi Arabia, for example, and other nations. Here the international community can help by mobilising other member states.              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] Historically, the British have never made a priority of a Palestinian state. In so far as they were quite vigorous about Palestinian rights for a period in the mid-20th century, it had to do with the perspective of a number of people at the Foreign Office. I would say that the most logical position that the British came up with, which they were driving inside the EU up until the beginning of the Blair Government, was to be careful about how you make a peace deal. If it utterly ignores international law and gives the Palestinians the absolute minimum, it is likely not to be a good peace. In other words, the more land, the more peace. The more that this is something that can be celebrated, the more it will last. The more that it is stingy, non-liberating, certainly not sovereign and certainly barely contiguous and so on, the less it is a sustainable peace.              Now, as of the Blair Governments, the British have essentially recognised that there is not a great deal that they can do. They defer to the Americans. The British position, up until John Kerry’s initiative, was essentially: “The parties must talk to each other directly. That will sort it, and the only player that can make them do that is the Americans”. So, it is playing second fiddle to the Americans; it is not really feeling any sense of agency or even any sense of vision of to what would work better as opposed to worse.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] I would agree with what Dr Hollis has just said. I will take one instance where I think Her Majesty’s Government could have done something differently. This was about a year and a half ago, when the Palestinians went to the United Nations—not the first time, when they went to the Security Council, but the second time, when they went to the General Assembly—for the request to become a non-member state. The Europeans were allowed a free vote, and most European countries voted in favour. A few abstained, one of them being, of course, the United Kingdom.              That was an instance when the UK could have delivered a different kind of political message—one that, frankly, would have had very little material impact on the ground, but which would have been very important demonstratively. It would have said: “We are unquestionably committed to Palestinian statehood”. This was going to be non-member status—it was bound and limited and was going to pass anyway, and other Europeans took that step. That is one little example of where the British did not need to be in the lead—they could still have followed the Americans in terms of process—but where the United Kingdom could have done something that politically was significant. &#xa0;              

[[[Q49]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] I absolutely agree on that last point. I regret that the British Government at the time took that position.               Does the panel believe that Britain’s strength is through its membership of the European Union and the line that the European Union is taking, albeit one more disposed towards development and trade; or do we have a role, as you say Professor Sayigh, in perhaps differentiating ourselves a bit more from the United States, so that we could apply more pressure and not just look as though we are falling into line with those views all the time?              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] I am glad you brought up the issue of the European Union. One of the positive tools that has been available for some time to the EU as a whole, as well as to member states, has been the trade association with Israel. The terms within that referred specifically to produce of the settlements—how it had to be marked differently and so on—and there were penalties attached. It took various Palestinian and non-Palestinian activists, lobby groups and the rest a very long time to get the EU to actually act on even these very minimum provisions.              Again, these were maybe more symbolic than anything else, but they were still available tools that had already been established and did not require a new political fight and more political capital in order to enact, because they were there. The UK can play a particular role—whether in bilateral relations, applying similar types of distinctions between the produce of Israel versus the produce of settlements, for instance—while also being much more proactive in the European context, not following the rest so much as taking more of a lead there.              Again, I am trying to emphasise relatively modest instruments that are already available and where the model is already there. These do not require a fundamental shift in political strategy or a rethinking of relations, either with Israel or the United States Administration. They have been established; it is not a new fight to engage in.              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] I notice a different mood in the European Union and a determination, if the Kerry initiative does not work, to get tougher on Israel; yet I also see a determination on the part of Israel to be less dependent on Europe as a market, to be less exposed to criticism and pressure from the European Union and instead to develop markets and opportunities in Russia, China, Latin America and Mexico. These are places where they do not anticipate that they will get pressure about the human rights of the Palestinians. So I think that the horse has bolted; this is closing the stable doors. The moment for the European Union to have made a significant difference has passed.              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] I would make one more point. I think it is very important to distinguish, as Yezid mentioned, between, for example, products coming from the Occupied Territories and Israel. If you decide to go down this path of boycotting—which is a quiet movement I can see also in the United States—then you should distinguish between the settlements and Israel. It is very important to do that, and it is not always done. I hear about boycotts on Israel; I would say boycott the settlements if you think that it is illegal—don’t eat their cucumbers if you think that it is illegal—but eat the cucumbers that are produced in Israel proper. Don’t say it is a boycott of Israel; say it is a boycott of the settlements.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] If I may clarify: what is already in EU legislation is not a boycott of Israeli settlement products; it is simply labelling, so that people can make informed choices when they go to the supermarket at Sainsbury’s or Tesco or wherever.              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] Also through customs.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] Yes, exactly. [Interruption.]               

[[[Chair:]]] Order. It is now 4.06 pm; we will reconvene at 4.18 pm.              Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.              On resuming—              

[[[Chair:]]] As we are quorate, we will continue. &#xa0;              

[[[Q50]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] Can I ask you what your perception is of the internal pressures within the Palestinian Authority during the negotiations? If there is an agreement, will the Palestinian Authority be able to deliver that agreement? How will Hamas react?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] I can say from an Israeli point of view that there is very little trust. The basic view in Israel, as you heard from the ambassador, is to sit tight and do nothing now, especially with the Middle East shifting and moving and so on. That is the basic instinct: “We have got the tangibles. We don’t want to give them now, especially not to Abu Mazen, whom we do not trust to be able to deliver the goods in terms of security, for example.” That is the Israeli view as I can see it in Israel now.              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] Professor Sayigh is the expert here, but I would say that my observation is that the rift between Fatah and Hamas at leadership level is utterly destructive and counter-productive to the servicing of Palestinian interests by the leadership. The “ordinary Palestinians” I am in touch with are very disillusioned with their leadership and put no enthusiasm or faith in either faction. They are barely paying attention to the talks initiated by John Kerry because they do not see them producing anything of relevance that they should be interested or excited about.               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] I agree pretty much entirely with that. I will add that in order to reach a meaningful and durable peace deal between Palestinians and Israel, it is important that both Hamas and the Fatah/Palestinian Authority in the West Bank can both be brought on board. I will explain briefly why I say that.               First, there is an opportunity. Hamas initially responded to the Arab Spring with a lot of enthusiasm and became over-optimistic. They thought that they and their general position of resistance had been vindicated and that the Arab Spring had brought a number of sympathetic Governments, in Egypt and beyond, and that they had made it to the shore of safety, as it were. They now feel differently and they are under siege again politically as well as economically. They are starting to have to face up to the fact that their grand strategy and expectations are not very likely to succeed in the foreseeable future.               At the same time, something important happened this year. When they had their internal elections, it was widely expected that Khalid Meshaal—who had been leading the way to position Hamas for negotiations on the basis of a two-state solution with 1967 borders and so on—was on his way out. In fact, he was returned along with a number of other people of his faction, at the expense of some of the more hawkish figures. That suggests that Hamas remains heavily pragmatic.               I have a concern about any kind of deal that John Kerry produces. On the one hand, as Professor Hollis just said, it is correct that most Palestinians just do not have much faith in their leaders and are too disillusioned to respond much. That does not mean that they have bought in; they might not do anything physical against it for a while. However, is that a peace upon which both Palestinians and Israel can actually build much further, without bringing Gaza—and therefore Hamas—back into the equation?               Sooner or later, we all have to bite that bullet and deal with it. I am making the point that I think Hamas is a party that needs to be brought in. Somehow, in some form, it has to be part of the political dialogue. There is no choice there in my view, if we really want some sort of long-term understanding. &#xa0;              

[[[Q51]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] On the Israeli side, this is a right-wing, or right-of-centre, Government. Mr Lieberman, the Foreign Minister, was here this week, making very clear where he is. I thought he was moderating his position for a British audience. I am interested to know your assessment of whether an agreement would actually be possible with the current Israeli Government, or would the internal compromises be too much? Would they, in effect, have to bring the Labor party in, so that they get the agreement with another Government?               

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] I think that he will have to change the composition of his coalition, because part of the current coalition—at least one important party—is based on settlers, and they would be very reluctant to vote for any agreement that involves giving up land which they believe belongs to them. But it is only a right-wing Israeli Government that can deliver peace in Israel, ironically enough, because the left will always support the right’s peace plans, and on the other hand, the right will never support a Labor Government offering the West Bank etc. So it is a Lieberman we need; Netanyahu is a moderate now. We need a right-wing Prime Minister who would be able to carry Israeli people with him. The Israeli nation now—and this is not a criticism but an observation—is a right-wing nation. In 1990-91, thousands of Jews came from Russia, and most of them, not all of them, are right-wing voters now. Interestingly enough, there is a wave of immigration coming from France now to Israel, and they are—most of them—right-wing Israelis. It is a right-wing nation. People like me—liberal-left—are not really important. We give them the ideas and they implement them.              

[[[Mr Roy:]]] Same here. [Laughter.]                

[[[Chair:]]] You can be liberal-right, you know.               

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] I don’t think we should go there.               

[[[Sir Menzies Campbell:]]] That’s the fate of the Liberal Democrats. &#xa0;              

[[[Q52]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] Professor Hollis?               

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] I am concerned. As you may know, with the scholarship programme that I am director of, I am very proud that one of our alumni went on to be the youngest Member of the Knesset, Stav Shaffir, and she made her name, after graduating from City university under the scholarship programme, as leader of the Israeli equivalent of the Occupy movement—the tent city in Rothschild boulevard—a couple of summers ago. She, as she explained to me and others, absolutely could not make any mention of the Palestinian issue, in order to make her political career. That movement had to appeal to social justice for the middle classes who find the prices too high in Tel Aviv. Only now is that element in the Knesset slowly and cautiously moving towards revealing how much the settlements cost Israeli taxpayers. But contacts such as hers and other alumni who are working for human rights organisations—some of which the Israelis have tried to crack down on and crack down on the foreign funding for—are reporting to me that Israeli schoolchildren and Israeli people in general since 1967 have not had maps in general circulation that show where the green line is. When it is pointed out to them what a settlement based on the green line would be, they become very nervous. This is not something that they think is doable without compromising their security.               The “narrow neck of Israel” theory has been around in the international observer community for ages. There is ignorance on the other side: ignorance of the issues and what they mean. There is no sense of “giving back land”—it is conceding stuff that belongs to Israel, to shut up these people who insist on living in the midst of what Israel needs for Israel. I feel that what used to be the conversations that you could have about the value of a two-state solution in the 1990s are inconceivable now because of ignorance, lack of contact with the other and fear, uncertainty and absolutely no concept of and no preparation for a positive version of peace.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] Your question usefully makes us think of Israelis, of voters, of ordinary people. I think that since Israel is a democracy it is critical for the Israeli public to rethink the incentive structure. In other words, as long as Israelis feel that Israel can continue to build settlements and expand and so on—and this has pretty much been the feeling for the past 20 years of the peace process—there has not been a choice to make. Ronnie has referred to the one time we saw evidence. At the start of the 1990s when hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews came to Israel, there was a moment, if you remember, when President George Bush Senior stood up and made the provision of housing loans guarantees to Israel partly contingent on spending on settlements in the Occupied Territories. By contingent, I mean where an amount that the US calculated was being spent by the Israeli Government on settlement activity would be deducted from the guarantees. It was a penalty.               That came at a moment when these hundreds of thousands of new immigrants needed housing and subsidies and a package, basically, and there was a cost. That created enough of a swing to bring Yitzhak Rabin to power in the next election in June 1992. Ever since then that sort of contingency, that sort of incentive structure has been lost. Israelis today feel that they have access to world markets; they want normalisation as per the Arab peace plan before providing peace—I mean an actual peace deal—and to build settlements. Every time John Kerry goes to Jerusalem, yet another few hundred or few thousand housing units are announced, and there is no cost to pay. Why should an Israeli voter think that this is an issue about which to distinguish between one party and another? I mean, if an Israeli party comes along and says, “We stand on a ‘no more funding of settlements’ ticket”, people would laugh at them. That has pretty much been the fate of the Israeli left, or left of centre. So the question here then becomes, what could the US have done, or the EU have done, or what can they do now? Not to penalise Israel—I am not talking about punitive sanctions, I am just talking about fixing the incentive structure a little bit. There is a choice and choice means costs and relative costs.               

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] It is against human nature for the Israelis to just give. The minimum that the Palestinians are asking for is such a maximum for the Israelis. You don’t just give up on water and mountains and strategic depth and so on, and therefore there must be pressure. Now I am not saying that pressure on Israel needs to be sticks—it could be carrots—but there must be pressure on the Israelis and the Palestinians. Otherwise, you cannot move. Here I agree with Yezid. You must do something—the international community—which is, again, not necessarily sticks, but some incentives that will make the Israelis and the Palestinians want to do something. &#xa0;

[[[              ]]]

[[[Q53]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] What has the Arab Spring meant for the Middle East peace process? Has it brought a solution closer or pushed it further away?              

[[[Dr ]]]

[[[Bregman]]]

[[[:]]] From an Israeli point of view, the Arab Spring means, “We don’t want to do anything now.” You can hear it. I could hear it when the Israeli ambassador gave his presentation. He said it in his opening words—not in my bold words, but that was the message: “It is all moving, it is all shifting; we don’t want a real peace process now.” That is the Arab Spring from an Israeli point of view.               It might be that in the future the Palestinians will look out and say, “Maybe we should do the same in the Occupied Territories. Maybe we should import the Arab Spring to the West Bank and do something to put some pressure on the Israelis.” Yezid said that they are tired and exhausted, and I understand that; but—and without encouraging violence; absolutely not—they cannot get a state on a silver platter by going to cocktail parties. In the war of independence, the Israelis lost 1% of their population, and they don’t stop talking about it. To add it to the package of pressures—God forbid, I am not encouraging the Palestinians to send suicide bombers into Israeli restaurants—what a stupid idea—but they could get out of bed tomorrow morning, cover themselves with white sheets and just walk through the streets.              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] You can’t walk through the streets; you can’t walk through the barrier—you have to go through the checkpoints. They do not have places to demonstrate in the major cities, and Israel still reserves the right to raid Palestinian houses in the middle of the night if there is someone they want to come and get. We are watching the erosion of self-confidence, self-agency and the sense of hope in a whole population. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Israelis that they cannot trust the other side to deliver, and the other side is a society in slow meltdown.&#xa0;              

[[[Q54]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] But what difference did the Arab Spring make?               

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] With the way the Arab Spring went, the Palestinians were very inspired initially. Yezid has pointed out that they thought it was going to be good news for Hamas, too, that resistance was rewarded with success in overthrowing Governments—there was resistance to the Palestinian Authority. However, the way things have gone and the appalling war in Syria mean that they cannot even claim to be the biggest victims in the region any more. They are not hurting anything like how the Syrian population is hurting. The sight of fellow Arabs tearing each other to pieces and a regime turning on its own people simply feeds the worst fears of the Palestinians that they are losers, losers, losers.               

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] The Arab Spring tells us something about timing. There was a reason why Oslo could happen when it happened: there was a convergence of Palestinian domestic dynamics, Israeli domestic dynamics—I just mentioned the Russian Jewish votes—the strategic situation of the Gulf war and the end of the Iraqi threat, and the international situation of the end of the cold war. A lot coincided to make it possible to have the Oslo Accords, and we are not in that fortuitous, virtuous convergence today.               The Arab Spring, although a good thing in many senses, has sadly taken us further away. The Arab countries in the Middle East are at the start of a long process of social and political transition as a result of everything that has been happening in the past 40 years: massive urbanisation; social transformation; massive state expansion; liberalisation and privatisation, which affect societies on a massive scale; and massive population growth. We are living with something that is going to be with us for a very long time. I don’t see any of the external powers—I am thinking mainly of western ones, of course, although I am not assuming a moral, political or other obligation on their part—able to intervene in pretty much any of these places. What are they to do about Egypt now that the armed forces have in effect reasserted authoritarian rule, or whatever we want to call it? What do they do about Syria? What do they do about Maliki in Iraq?  When you look at what is in front of us, I do not see any outside power or group of powers able to intervene in a sustained and systematic way in any one of these countries. So, to expect any kind of intervention, by which I could mean diplomatic or political—helpful, not adversarial—in Israel and Palestine, I just do not see it happening.              There was a time when much lesser interventions could have made a bigger difference. I will remind you of just one instance. I am thinking of March 1998: the Berlin statement, when the EU Council issued a commitment to Palestinian statehood, because the expectation was that the final status negotiations would start the year after. The statement said that unless statehood did result, the EU might reconsider waiting for the outcome of the negotiations and instead go ahead with recognition of statehood.               Where are we today, compared with that European position, which the UK was a part of? There was a time when something like that could have made a world of difference. Today, sending NATO in would not make that much difference. I wish I had something more positive to say, but I fear that not just the Arab Spring, but a whole range of things, have placed us today in a situation where there is no power around us—the British Government, the American Government or the whole coalition of Governments—that is able or willing to invest what it would take to make a real shift in the direction of events in Palestine or elsewhere. &#xa0;              

[[[Q55]]] 

[[[Mr Roy:]]] Lastly, can I ask you about the role of Iran and the conciliatory moves from the United States towards it? What difficulty does that bring to formulating a peace process for the Americans in relation to Israel and the Palestinians? Does their mindset change the game?              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] I am one of the few people I know who is not criticising Obama for being weak. I think he—unlike some people—learned the lesson of Iraq. Had the Americans sought to lead some sort of intervention in Syria at whatever stage, I think they would have ended up in the same situation as they did in Iraq.               Yezid may differ from me on that, but I am pretty clear and it is reinforced by what you just said. Intervention in any of these places is not an option that will turn things around. I therefore cannot think of anything more foolhardy than resisting an opportunity to get a negotiated deal with Iran. Of course it will not be 100% secure on whether they have a bomb in the basement, or the capacity close by, but I think it is mind-boggling that Israel should bounce the United States into a war with Iran. So I think the position of the United States has to be with the Israelis. We are determined that the region should not be destabilised by a nuclear-armed Iran and, if that takes some concessions for a one-off opportunity with President Rouhani, I am afraid you are going to have to put up with it.              

[[[Professor ]]]

[[[Sayigh]]]

[[[:]]] If I could add something, I think a comprehensive deal on the nuclear issue would be a tremendously positive thing for the region, but let us not assume that a de-escalation on that particular issue will necessarily change the dynamics of Iranian, Saudi or other competition. It is sort of like with the cold war: once we had established mutual assured destruction by the early ’60s, it did not prevent a lot of very destructive rivalry in the rest of the third world between the Soviet Union and the USA.               When it comes to Israel and Iran, in particular, my feeling is—I base this on what people I know who are very close to the Israeli nuclear programme have been telling me for several years—that Israel can live with the sort of deal that seems to be on the cards now. I think Israel will come to terms with this, never mind what Netanyahu says, but that does not mean that, when it comes to Syria, Iraq, Lebanon or elsewhere, Saudis, Iranians and others will not still be competing, or even more so than before. &#xa0;              

[[[Q56]]] 

[[[Mark ]]]

[[[Hendrick]]]

[[[:]]] It was interesting what you were saying, Professor Sayigh, about the United States or any other western power having enough influence to make any difference on the ground itself. What do the panel think about the first Obama Administration? When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, she was quite firm on settlements and what was happening on the ground. She gave the impression that she was quite firm, but that President Obama seemed to rein her in a little bit. We see in the second term an attempt by John Kerry to get this thing going again. While I am sure everybody around this table hopes it is successful and we get a deal, do you feel that the Americans’ heart is really in it and that they feel, as you described it, that there is not a lot that they can do? Is there an element that they are maybe going through the motions towards the latter days of the second Obama Administration?

[[[:]]] It is very difficult to work out how the Kerry initiative came about. The best interpretation I have heard is that it has a lot to do with his personality. Kerry has a particular way of operating and particular views, and he wanted to do something. I do not know whether that is a correct interpretation. I don’t feel that the Obama Administration took a strategic decision at some point saying that this was something they needed to do, but it is probably something that Kerry wanted hard enough to push and Obama was not going to stand in his way, or something along those lines, which suggests that the US could probably do at lot if it really wanted to.               I think Obama took a very wrong step at the very start of his first term by calling for a settlement freeze. I think he was absolutely right to raise the issue; he was wrong to select a freeze. He should have been speaking of an entire halt. For technical and legal reasons in Israel, a freeze is far more complicated to bring about and involved far more negotiation within the bureaucracy than a policy decision from the Government. Those are different things. Having done that, Obama backed off completely and I don’t think he is back on track to continue it and to push all the way through.

[[[:]]] I shall be brief. About this initiative, it is Kerry. It is him; it’s the man. He is very determined to get something. There are expectations now that something will happen. I am afraid that not much is going to happen. He is going to come up with some principles and I am afraid of the frustration that will follow his programme.               I want to say something about Israeli settlements. We should distinguish between the announcements and the heavy machinery on the ground. Two weeks ago, Netanyahu said that they were going to build 5,000 units—or 4,000; I can’t remember which. I want to see the heavy machinery. The heavy machinery is not there, whatever he is announcing, because in the coalition there is a right-wing party: Habayit Hayehudi—the Jewish National Home, etc. The settlement project lost much of its vitality. There are a lot of announcements now, but very little building.              

[[[Chair:]]] A last question and a very brief answer please.&#xa0;              

[[[Q57]]] 

[[[Mike Gapes:]]] What are the implications for an agreement of what is happening in Egypt? Is it positive because it closes off the tunnels and puts pressure on Hamas, as we heard earlier, or is it potentially uncertain for Israel because of the turmoil in Egypt and the possibility of problems in Sinai and elsewhere?              

[[[Professor Hollis:]]] I am deeply depressed that anybody could think it is okay to close the tunnels. You had a question earlier. There is a report on Gaza that says that this place is uninhabitable for that size of population by 2020—then what are we all going to do? So the fact that the Egyptians, as a result of their own domestic politics, choose sometimes to close the tunnels and sometimes not, and sometimes to mount an offensive against smugglers in the Sinai and sometimes not, and to have on-off relations with Hamas, means that it is just a mess. It is not clear-cut that there has been a fundamental switch and that it will be good or bad for the peace process. It is just terrifying that Gaza can be treated in that manner when it is home to 1.6 million people.

[[[:]]] I do not really have much to add to that. What is happening in Egypt is likely to continue to complicate Egyptian-US ties in particular and, to some extent, Egyptian-EU ties. I am not confident at all that Egyptian economic recovery is going to happen or to be sustained. Egypt is entering a very dangerous zone, as it were, that several other Arab countries have already been in for years, which is an inability to agree on the basic rules of the political game, as reflected in the continuing tinkering with the constitution. This is now the third constitutional referendum that we have had in three years—not to mention other constitutional declarations and initiatives. This is a country that is reaching a point where there is no consensus on the overarching authority within which people conduct their business. The implications for all neighbours are going to be very big but, as Rosemary said, one cannot assume that it will necessarily go in one direction or another when it comes to the peace process.              

[[[Chair:]]] Thank you all very much indeed. It really is appreciated. It is always quite difficult with a panel of three, but you have done very well. On behalf of the Committee, I thank you very much for your time.&#xa0;&#xa0;              Oral evidence: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories HC 957                            32
