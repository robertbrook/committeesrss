defaultMain points default&#xa0;default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultRSSB is owned by the rail industry but its governance and regulatory oversight ensures that it is
default independent of any part of the industry.  Its purpose is to support the industry to achieve their objectives of improving safety and performance and value for money across the industry.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn its ten years of existence, RSSB has supported the industry in th
defaulte area of level crossing safety through extensive research programmes, the collection and analysis of data relating to level crossing incidents, the development of risk assessment tools and guidance and through international collaboration with overseas aut
defaulthorities and research bodies
default. We publish extensive evidence-
defaultbased material on the subject of level crossing safety.  Arising from this body of experience, we have three general points to put to the Committee before responding to the detailed questions furt
defaulther below.
default&#xa0;default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultData published by the European Railway Agency shows that level crossings in the United Kingdom are the safest in the European Union.  Many studies have sought to understand international differences in level crossing safety and the overwhelming conclusion 
defaultfrom these is that the biggest determinant of level crossing safety is the level of road safety. It is also universally the case that although level crossings represent a reasonably significant amount of the total risk on the railway, they represent a very
default small proportion of road safety risk. The United Kingdom has among the best road safety records in Europe, and taken together with the risk based approach to level crossing safety practiced by Network Rail and its predecessors, it is therefore little surp
defaultrise that the safety record at level crossings is internationally recognised as the best.  The policy implication of this observation is that although there are likely to be reasonably practicable steps that Network Rail can take to improve safety at level
default crossings, the largest contribution will always come from the efforts taken by road authorities and government to improve road safety.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs you will see in the detailed answers, virtually all of the risk at level crossings arises from the actions of member
defaults of the public. Of that risk, around half is also the product of wilful acts while the other half arises because of mistakes or misunderstandings.  The rail industry can realistically make a contribution to address the risks arising from 
defaultmistakes
default and misu
defaultnderstandings, but is almost powerless to do anything about wilful acts – and this is where enforcement agencies come in.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultHaving said that, the nature of safety legislation, and the culture of continuous improvement mean that it is right for Network Rail 
defaultand the 
defaultindustry to
default search for ways 
defaultto further improve
default level crossing safety, in more cost effective ways, and of influencing others who can impact on this from their own perspectives and responsibilities.
default&#xa0;
default2default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre current safety measures at level crossings defaultadequate? How should they be improved?default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe majority of accidents at level crossings - estimated at around 95% of the total - are caused by errors or violations by members of the public in their capacity as road users or pedestrians. This is consistent wit
defaulth other European countries whose record in this area is tracked and compared by the European Rail
defaultway
default Agency, which has found the UK to have year by year the lowest or second lowest number of level crossing fatalities and injuries in the EU, normalised by 
defaultt
defaulthe number of train km travelled
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere is not, however, any room for complacency as every fatality and injury is a personal tragedy, and since its inception RSSB has been working with Network Rail and the road and rail sectors to 
defaulthelp 
defaultreduce risk in several key areas. In 
defaultthe last 50 years
default there have been three 
default– though quite different 
default– major
default level crossing accidents in which train passengers were killed, at Hixon (1968), Lockington (1986) and Ufton (2004) and the lessons learned from t
defaulthese and other events are scrutinised and changes implemented 
defaultas appropriate
default.  More recently Network Rail has been concentrating significant funding and effort in reducing the number of crossings, implementing improvements in engineering controls, educatio
defaultnal and public campaigns, and working with various agencies such as the British Transport Police (BTP) to improve the effectiveness of enforcement activities. Better evaluation of the effectiveness of such initiatives is also being implemented and closer e
defaultngagement with local communities
default, particularly schools,
default is also important.
default&#xa0;
default3default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?default&#xa0;default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultNetwork Rail’s funding arrangements me
defaultan that expenditure on level crossings is taxpayer funded, and so it is critical that measures adopted or even mandated are cost effective
default from society’
defaults point of view. Countries that seek to abolish all level crossing risk through widespread closure progr
defaultammes find that the costs far exceed the benefits and in almost all cases would be better off spending the money on other activities such as health services. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultEstablishing where it is justified to make
default investment on building bridges or underpasses is 
defaulttherefore 
defaultimportant and RSSB has worked with Network Rail and the road sector to develop the AXIAT model which 
defaultnow
default allow
defaults
default 
defaultpublic road and rail costs and benefits to be assessed holistically.  
defaultIn addition,
default closing private crossings, particularly in rural ar
defaulteas, makes a smaller but significant contribution to reducing risk.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultUnderstanding t
defaulthe most effective way of target
defaulting expenditure and effort is also very important.  RSSB has worked with the rail industry to develop the All Level Crossing Risk Model and 
defaulta
default 
defaultLevel Crossing Risk Management Toolkit to allow individual crossings to be examined, hazards rigorously compared and improvement schemes identified. RSSB maintains the 
defaultindustry database on safety related accidents and incidents 
defaultand
default uses 
defaultthis 
defaultdata and pred
defaultictive modelling
default 
defaulttechniques to produce 
defaultthe industry safety risk model
default. This 
defaultallow
defaults
default risk reduction
default proposals
default to 
defaultbe examined and 
defaultprioritised. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultEngineering improvements include the development of the radar-based obstacle detection level crossing system which
default will allow level crossing controls to be implemented more cost-effectively as part of
default the roll-out of its national Regional
default Operating Centres
default, currently under construction
default. Network Rail is also introducing short lifting barriers at many of the few remaini
defaultng automatic open level crossings.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultEducational activities include the very substantial investment that Network Rail has made in 
defaultnational TV and Radio advertising, targeting those most at risk from causing, or being 
defaultvictims of, accidents, but also 
defaultreinforc
defaulting positive behaviour among the majority of level crossing users.
default RSSB is currently supporting the industry in examining the effectiveness of road signs at both public and private roads, and the wider issue of pedestrian risk at these roads and on footpat
defaulth and bridleway crossings.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultAll these activities are contributing to the gradual but steady reduction of level crossing risks on the national rail network in Great Britain and RSSB would be happy to provide further information
default if required
default.  We also work closely with other European countries in exchanging information about safety initiatives and best practice and currently chair the European Level Crossing Group, and participate in 
defaultsteering 
defaultthe Global Level Crossing Symposium, which meets e
defaultvery two years, hosting it in London in 2012.  Planning is ongoing for the 2014 session in the USA.
default&#xa0;
default4default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis is the most sensitive s
defaultubject area. In an ideal world, public money would be directed at those areas that deliver the greatest benefit to the public – usually known as ‘value for money.’  The industry uses the criteria established in the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) and 
defaultthe EU Railway safety Directive to determine its safety expenditures – applying the principle of reducing risk ‘so far as is reasonably practicable.’  
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultUsing these criteria across the board could lead to some reallocation of resources away from level cros
defaultsings because many of the investments that are being made are not justified on those terms – rather they are made to meet a target of risk reduction, or in some cases simply to enable a particular crossing to be closed. RSSB has produced guidance on decisi
defaulton-making on safety priorities in the industry approved document

default are
default partly 
defaulta 
defaultrecognition of the public concern which is expressed whenever an accident occurs 
defaultand
default 
defaultalso because the risk comes largely from outside the rail sector, caused by people over whom the railways have no direct control. They are consequently diffi
defaultcult - and expensive - to reach and to influence. 
defaultThe number of trains on the network continues to increase significantly, so as
default the current initiatives continue to produce results and risk is driven down further, it may become more and more difficult to j

defaultn this area
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultGiven the comments in our opening remarks, the issue that we think should be addressed is whether the effort that is spent on level crossings by the rail industry is proportionate to the efforts taken by the highways authorities and government on campaigns
default and investment to improve the level of road safety across the road network.  
defaultFor example, if curren
defaultt research on improved signs at 
defaultpublic road crossings proposes changes to traffic signs and the Highway Code, will the road sector contribute support and fi
defaultnance or will Network Rail be expect
defaulte
defaultd to fund any changes?
default Given that the rail sector is severely limited in its ability to directly influence road driver behaviour, a stronger ownership of the issue by the road sector 
defaultwould be more equitable and potentia
defaultlly
default have a 
defaultwider 
defaulteffect.
default&#xa0;
default5default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?default&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe have dealt with this question in some detail our answers above, so the short answer is yes.
default&#xa0;
default6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIs Government policy and regulatory action by the defaultOffice of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe rail sector has engaged positively with Department of Transport in an effort to give level crossing issues greater prominenc
defaulte in the Highway Code and in the written driving test.  It is recognised that there are limitations to the amount of space / time that can be alloca
defaultted in the Code or during tests.
default 
defaultIn addition t
defaulthe
default excellent guidance for level crossing users produced by ORR
default 
defaultis available on its website but is not obviously accessible to most road users
default – who are unlikely to be looking for advice from the railway regulator
default.  It is suggested that it should be made more widely available, and promoted more positively
default by other agencies
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultORR ha
defaults
default looked at crossings both generally and at the individual crossing level and have perhaps not adequately considered the strategic view in terms of how crossings are kept up to date with 
defaultthe 
defaultchanges to HMRI/ORR requirements/guida
defaultnce and 
defaultthe 
defaultelimination of early Victorian arrangements
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Department for Transport could also do more to encourage collaboration between the highways/roads agencies with the railways to share the responsibility for managing level crossing risk.
default&#xa0;
default7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow defaultshould the legislation governing level crossings be updated?default&#xa0;default7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2008 The Law Commissions of England and Wales, and of Scotland, started work on identifying whether changes to level crossing legislation were needed, and if so, what they should include. The
defaulty specifically remitted work on public road signs to RSSB (which is in progress) and they worked closely with both road and rail sectors to agree proposals for change.  There was particular emphasis on the potential of the AXIAT model to help drive public 
defaultroad crossing closures forward, and the need for statutory co-operation protocols between rail and highway authorities. A number of dates for publication of a draft bill have been announced and have been passed, and it is suggested that this may be due to 
defaulta lack of political support for such changes.  Given that the existing body of laws is well out-of-date and does not help motivate all the various parties to work together effectively this delay is to be deplored.  It is hoped that the process may be resta
defaultrted 
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultRSSB 
default(
defaultand Network Rail
default)
default have 
defaultexpressed 
defaultconcerns over one aspect of the possible changes
default;
default that of the removal of the 
defaultL
defaultevel 
defaultC
defaultrossing Order procedure. Although this is intended to remove a level of 
defaultgovernment administration, it is also likely to remove a level of certainty that has served the railway well for the past 50 years. The 
defaultprincipal fear
default is that it will become very difficult, if not impossible
default,
default to prosecute a motorist for an offence at a lev
defaultel crossing.
default&#xa0;
default8default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?default&#xa0;default8.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultA number of methods are available, and some have been referred to already. Educating schoolchildren and other young people about the dangers present at level crossings is 
defaultimportant and resources should continue to be allocated to do this, especially in areas near crossings.  There is a particular need to emphasise to the public that trains cannot stop as quickly as a car can.  Emerging research suggests that elderly 
defaultpeople 
defaultare also particularly at risk
default if they do not understand how to use crossings effectively
default, so they need to be included as a target audience.  Finally, there is a definite need to make sure that road signs communicate the appropriate message, and when the cu
defaultrrent group of research projects have been completed, it is hoped that DfT, and Parliament, will support any changes indicated.

defaultConcluding remarksdefault&#xa0;default9.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the UK level crossings are demonstrably the safest in the European Union, it remains the case that it
default is only constant vigilance and reinforcement of the messages about how to use level crossings, enforcement of the rules by authorities, and the never ending search for more cost effective ways of providing effective protection at level crossings that will
default maintain that position. In that respect RSSB is proud to play its part in supporting the industry in the way that we do.
