[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]RSSB (SLC 016)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Main points [bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]RSSB is owned by the rail industry but its governance and regulatory oversight ensures that it is
[normal] independent of any part of the industry.  Its purpose is to support the industry to achieve their objectives of improving safety and performance and value for money across the industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In its ten years of existence, RSSB has supported the industry in th
[normal]e area of level crossing safety through extensive research programmes, the collection and analysis of data relating to level crossing incidents, the development of risk assessment tools and guidance and through international collaboration with overseas aut
[normal]horities and research bodies
[normal]. We publish extensive evidence-
[normal]based material on the subject of level crossing safety.  Arising from this body of experience, we have three general points to put to the Committee before responding to the detailed questions furt
[normal]her below.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Data published by the European Railway Agency shows that level crossings in the United Kingdom are the safest in the European Union.  Many studies have sought to understand international differences in level crossing safety and the overwhelming conclusion 
[normal]from these is that the biggest determinant of level crossing safety is the level of road safety. It is also universally the case that although level crossings represent a reasonably significant amount of the total risk on the railway, they represent a very
[normal] small proportion of road safety risk. The United Kingdom has among the best road safety records in Europe, and taken together with the risk based approach to level crossing safety practiced by Network Rail and its predecessors, it is therefore little surp
[normal]rise that the safety record at level crossings is internationally recognised as the best.  The policy implication of this observation is that although there are likely to be reasonably practicable steps that Network Rail can take to improve safety at level
[normal] crossings, the largest contribution will always come from the efforts taken by road authorities and government to improve road safety.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As you will see in the detailed answers, virtually all of the risk at level crossings arises from the actions of member
[normal]s of the public. Of that risk, around half is also the product of wilful acts while the other half arises because of mistakes or misunderstandings.  The rail industry can realistically make a contribution to address the risks arising from 
[normal]mistakes
[normal] and misu
[normal]nderstandings, but is almost powerless to do anything about wilful acts – and this is where enforcement agencies come in.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Having said that, the nature of safety legislation, and the culture of continuous improvement mean that it is right for Network Rail 
[normal]and the 
[normal]industry to
[normal] search for ways 
[normal]to further improve
[normal] level crossing safety, in more cost effective ways, and of influencing others who can impact on this from their own perspectives and responsibilities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Are current safety measures at level crossings [bold]adequate? How should they be improved?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The majority of accidents at level crossings - estimated at around 95% of the total - are caused by errors or violations by members of the public in their capacity as road users or pedestrians. This is consistent wit
[normal]h other European countries whose record in this area is tracked and compared by the European Rail
[normal]way
[normal] Agency, which has found the UK to have year by year the lowest or second lowest number of level crossing fatalities and injuries in the EU, normalised by 
[normal]t
[normal]he number of train km travelled
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is not, however, any room for complacency as every fatality and injury is a personal tragedy, and since its inception RSSB has been working with Network Rail and the road and rail sectors to 
[normal]help 
[normal]reduce risk in several key areas. In 
[normal]the last 50 years
[normal] there have been three 
[normal]– though quite different 
[normal]– major
[normal] level crossing accidents in which train passengers were killed, at Hixon (1968), Lockington (1986) and Ufton (2004) and the lessons learned from t
[normal]hese and other events are scrutinised and changes implemented 
[normal]as appropriate
[normal].  More recently Network Rail has been concentrating significant funding and effort in reducing the number of crossings, implementing improvements in engineering controls, educatio
[normal]nal and public campaigns, and working with various agencies such as the British Transport Police (BTP) to improve the effectiveness of enforcement activities. Better evaluation of the effectiveness of such initiatives is also being implemented and closer e
[normal]ngagement with local communities
[normal], particularly schools,
[normal] is also important.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Network Rail’s funding arrangements me
[normal]an that expenditure on level crossings is taxpayer funded, and so it is critical that measures adopted or even mandated are cost effective
[normal] from society’
[normal]s point of view. Countries that seek to abolish all level crossing risk through widespread closure progr
[normal]ammes find that the costs far exceed the benefits and in almost all cases would be better off spending the money on other activities such as health services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Establishing where it is justified to make
[normal] investment on building bridges or underpasses is 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]important and RSSB has worked with Network Rail and the road sector to develop the AXIAT model which 
[normal]now
[normal] allow
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]public road and rail costs and benefits to be assessed holistically.  
[normal]In addition,
[normal] closing private crossings, particularly in rural ar
[normal]eas, makes a smaller but significant contribution to reducing risk.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Understanding t
[normal]he most effective way of target
[normal]ing expenditure and effort is also very important.  RSSB has worked with the rail industry to develop the All Level Crossing Risk Model and 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]Level Crossing Risk Management Toolkit to allow individual crossings to be examined, hazards rigorously compared and improvement schemes identified. RSSB maintains the 
[normal]industry database on safety related accidents and incidents 
[normal]and
[normal] uses 
[normal]this 
[normal]data and pred
[normal]ictive modelling
[normal] 
[normal]techniques to produce 
[normal]the industry safety risk model
[normal]. This 
[normal]allow
[normal]s
[normal] risk reduction
[normal] proposals
[normal] to 
[normal]be examined and 
[normal]prioritised. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Engineering improvements include the development of the radar-based obstacle detection level crossing system which
[normal] will allow level crossing controls to be implemented more cost-effectively as part of
[normal] the roll-out of its national Regional
[normal] Operating Centres
[normal], currently under construction
[normal]. Network Rail is also introducing short lifting barriers at many of the few remaini
[normal]ng automatic open level crossings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Educational activities include the very substantial investment that Network Rail has made in 
[normal]national TV and Radio advertising, targeting those most at risk from causing, or being 
[normal]victims of, accidents, but also 
[normal]reinforc
[normal]ing positive behaviour among the majority of level crossing users.
[normal] RSSB is currently supporting the industry in examining the effectiveness of road signs at both public and private roads, and the wider issue of pedestrian risk at these roads and on footpat
[normal]h and bridleway crossings.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]All these activities are contributing to the gradual but steady reduction of level crossing risks on the national rail network in Great Britain and RSSB would be happy to provide further information
[normal] if required
[normal].  We also work closely with other European countries in exchanging information about safety initiatives and best practice and currently chair the European Level Crossing Group, and participate in 
[normal]steering 
[normal]the Global Level Crossing Symposium, which meets e
[normal]very two years, hosting it in London in 2012.  Planning is ongoing for the 2014 session in the USA.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This is the most sensitive s
[normal]ubject area. In an ideal world, public money would be directed at those areas that deliver the greatest benefit to the public – usually known as ‘value for money.’  The industry uses the criteria established in the Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) and 
[normal]the EU Railway safety Directive to determine its safety expenditures – applying the principle of reducing risk ‘so far as is reasonably practicable.’  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Using these criteria across the board could lead to some reallocation of resources away from level cros
[normal]sings because many of the investments that are being made are not justified on those terms – rather they are made to meet a target of risk reduction, or in some cases simply to enable a particular crossing to be closed. RSSB has produced guidance on decisi
[normal]on-making on safety priorities in the industry approved document
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]aking Safe Decisions 
[normal](RSSB 2008
[normal])
[normal] which mirrors some of the wording of Network Rail’s certified Safety 
[normal]M
[normal]anagement System. 
[normal] 
[normal]Network Rail
[normal]’
[normal]s decisions and proposals on 
[normal]l
[normal]evel crossing expenditure
[normal] are
[normal] partly 
[normal]a 
[normal]recognition of the public concern which is expressed whenever an accident occurs 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]also because the risk comes largely from outside the rail sector, caused by people over whom the railways have no direct control. They are consequently diffi
[normal]cult - and expensive - to reach and to influence. 
[normal]The number of trains on the network continues to increase significantly, so as
[normal] the current initiatives continue to produce results and risk is driven down further, it may become more and more difficult to j
[normal]ustify and implement further improvements to address the 
[normal]r
[normal]isk
[normal] which will remain
[normal].  It must be noted that the
[normal] between 
[normal]six 
[normal]and 
[normal] ten 
[normal]fatalities 
[normal]to members of the public 
[normal]which occur 
[normal]at level crossings 
[normal]each year are spread across some 6000 locations, and as a pr
[normal]oportion of total road fatalities they are very small.  However, 
[normal]collisions between train and road vehicles at 
[normal]level crossings 
[normal]do 
[normal]still 
[normal]represent a 
[normal]contributor to
[normal] 
[normal]the risk to passengers from 
[normal]train accident
[normal]s (
[normal]less than 
[normal]10%)
[normal] so 
[normal]there 
[normal]will always be a
[normal] focus 
[normal]i
[normal]n this area
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the comments in our opening remarks, the issue that we think should be addressed is whether the effort that is spent on level crossings by the rail industry is proportionate to the efforts taken by the highways authorities and government on campaigns
[normal] and investment to improve the level of road safety across the road network.  
[normal]For example, if curren
[normal]t research on improved signs at 
[normal]public road crossings proposes changes to traffic signs and the Highway Code, will the road sector contribute support and fi
[normal]nance or will Network Rail be expect
[normal]e
[normal]d to fund any changes?
[normal] Given that the rail sector is severely limited in its ability to directly influence road driver behaviour, a stronger ownership of the issue by the road sector 
[normal]would be more equitable and potentia
[normal]lly
[normal] have a 
[normal]wider 
[normal]effect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Is Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We have dealt with this question in some detail our answers above, so the short answer is yes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Is Government policy and regulatory action by the [bold]Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate? What more should the Government and ORR do?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The rail sector has engaged positively with Department of Transport in an effort to give level crossing issues greater prominenc
[normal]e in the Highway Code and in the written driving test.  It is recognised that there are limitations to the amount of space / time that can be alloca
[normal]ted in the Code or during tests.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition t
[normal]he
[normal] excellent guidance for level crossing users produced by ORR
[normal] 
[normal]is available on its website but is not obviously accessible to most road users
[normal] – who are unlikely to be looking for advice from the railway regulator
[normal].  It is suggested that it should be made more widely available, and promoted more positively
[normal] by other agencies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]ORR ha
[normal]s
[normal] looked at crossings both generally and at the individual crossing level and have perhaps not adequately considered the strategic view in terms of how crossings are kept up to date with 
[normal]the 
[normal]changes to HMRI/ORR requirements/guida
[normal]nce and 
[normal]the 
[normal]elimination of early Victorian arrangements
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The Department for Transport could also do more to encourage collaboration between the highways/roads agencies with the railways to share the responsibility for managing level crossing risk.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How [bold]should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2008 The Law Commissions of England and Wales, and of Scotland, started work on identifying whether changes to level crossing legislation were needed, and if so, what they should include. The
[normal]y specifically remitted work on public road signs to RSSB (which is in progress) and they worked closely with both road and rail sectors to agree proposals for change.  There was particular emphasis on the potential of the AXIAT model to help drive public 
[normal]road crossing closures forward, and the need for statutory co-operation protocols between rail and highway authorities. A number of dates for publication of a draft bill have been announced and have been passed, and it is suggested that this may be due to 
[normal]a lack of political support for such changes.  Given that the existing body of laws is well out-of-date and does not help motivate all the various parties to work together effectively this delay is to be deplored.  It is hoped that the process may be resta
[normal]rted 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]RSSB 
[normal](
[normal]and Network Rail
[normal])
[normal] have 
[normal]expressed 
[normal]concerns over one aspect of the possible changes
[normal];
[normal] that of the removal of the 
[normal]L
[normal]evel 
[normal]C
[normal]rossing Order procedure. Although this is intended to remove a level of 
[normal]government administration, it is also likely to remove a level of certainty that has served the railway well for the past 50 years. The 
[normal]principal fear
[normal] is that it will become very difficult, if not impossible
[normal],
[normal] to prosecute a motorist for an offence at a lev
[normal]el crossing.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]How should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A number of methods are available, and some have been referred to already. Educating schoolchildren and other young people about the dangers present at level crossings is 
[normal]important and resources should continue to be allocated to do this, especially in areas near crossings.  There is a particular need to emphasise to the public that trains cannot stop as quickly as a car can.  Emerging research suggests that elderly 
[normal]people 
[normal]are also particularly at risk
[normal] if they do not understand how to use crossings effectively
[normal], so they need to be included as a target audience.  Finally, there is a definite need to make sure that road signs communicate the appropriate message, and when the cu
[normal]rrent group of research projects have been completed, it is hoped that DfT, and Parliament, will support any changes indicated.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Concluding remarks[bold]&#xa0;[bold]9.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]While the UK level crossings are demonstrably the safest in the European Union, it remains the case that it
[normal] is only constant vigilance and reinforcement of the messages about how to use level crossings, enforcement of the rules by authorities, and the never ending search for more cost effective ways of providing effective protection at level crossings that will
[normal] maintain that position. In that respect RSSB is proud to play its part in supporting the industry in the way that we do.
