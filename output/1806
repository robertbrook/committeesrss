defaultAN influential committee of MPs is calling for evidence on p
defaultassenger transport in isolated communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe
default&#xa0;
defaultinquiry by the House of Commons Transport Committee
default&#xa0;
defaultbelieves all communities should have access to adequate transport services.
defaultCommittee chairman Louise Ellman said: "People from different communities acros
defaults the UK should have access to adequate transport services.
default"We will be looking at how best to meet the needs of passengers in isolated communities, including rural areas, island communities, and suburban or urban areas with poor transport connections.
default"We
default are particularly interested in the provision of bus and rail services, as well as the role of Community Transport services."
defaultThe Committee intends to hear oral evidence in the Autumn. Ahead of this, it would like to receive written evidence on the followi
defaultng points:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultHow do Government and local authorities identify demand for passenger transport in isolated communities (including rural and urban areas and island communities)?
default&#xa0;
defaultSometimes local survey are undertaken, but from experience figures come from for
defaultmer subsidised bus routes that are cancelled because of reducing populations and an increased dependency on personal transport
defaultWe originally conducted our own assessment of need under a project called the “Vital Villages Scheme” 10 years ago
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default*To what 
defaultextent are the needs of different groups of passengers (e.g. people with disabilities, older people, young people) taken into account in determining the provision of public transport to isolated communities?
default&#xa0;
defaultWe always try to take a holistic view when plan
defaultning vehicle purchase so that our services are available to the largest number of people possible
default&#xa0;
default*What are the main challenges associated with providing better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities? How can these challenges be
default overcome?
default&#xa0;
defaultOnly one really adequate funding we need someone to recognise the large distances we cover serving isolated people and make provision to fund the services we provide accordingly 
default&#xa0;
defaultExample each Friday we connect two market towns, actual distance
default 16 miles our shoppers bus covers at least 70 miles each time connecting those isolated communities
default&#xa0;
default*How effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal
default services are the only way to maintain an adequate link with the outside world for these people and usually this is best served by CT. CT work needs properly recognising and funding Example The recent 20% cut in our BSOG has hit us all badly
default&#xa0;
default*To what exte
defaultnt should passengers in isolated communities be expected to rely on taxis and other demand-responsive transport services?
default&#xa0;
defaultTaxis usage is largely dependent on ability to pay. Low incomes in the rural community make reliance on taxis difficult
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDRT should always be us.ed because of the associated costs of running a traditional service
default&#xa0;
default*What are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can these services be made more affordable? 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main chall
defaultenge is one of distance and associated fuel cost
defaultOur services are affordable we currently make a vehicle available to community groups cheaper than anyone else because of our innovative attitude to fuel We have most of our vehilce running on LPG
