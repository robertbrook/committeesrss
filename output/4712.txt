[[[Written evidence from Unite the Union (HCS0008)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The death of four offshore oil and gas workers returning from the Borgsten Dolphin platform, after their helicopter transfer ditched in the waters off the south Shetland coast on the evening of August 23rd 2013, provoked further questions into the safety of helicopters serving offshore installations on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS).  1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the immediate aftermath of August’s tragedy Unite was inundated with the concerns expressed by our offshore membership regarding their confidence in the safety of the UK offshore oil and gas sector helicopter fleet, specifically regarding the various Super Puma types manufactured by the French firm Eurocopter. &#xa0;1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a direct response to this, Unite launched our ‘Back Home Safe’ campaign calling on Oil &amp; Gas UK (OGUK) to address the lack of confidence in the serving helicopter fleet through the implementation of the following demands:                                           &#xa0;1.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In conjunction, Unite also conducted an extensive consultation with our membership and the wider offshore workforce; a survey of over one thousand offshore oil and gas employees (the results of which will be presented in this submission) on the issue of helicopter safety. &#xa0;1.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Through the extensive nature of our consultation we believe that our findings accurately reflect the concerns and views of offshore workers across the UK offshore oil and gas sector with regards to helicopter transfer safety. &#xa0;1.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a result, Unite is very clear that any detailed review of UK helicopter safety - particularly offshore helicopter commercial transfers - must incorporate the views of the offshore workforce and we believe this submission should compel Committee Members to begin that process. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Approximately 75 helicopters serve the UKCS for offshore commercial transfer purposes with three main operators: Bond; Bristow; and CHC, collectively operating upwards of 50,000 flights a year. There are two key manufacturers providing helicopters to the industry; Eurocopter and Sikorsky. &#xa0;2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Eurocopter Super Puma AS332 L type, AS332 L1 type, AS332 L2 type and EC225 type provide approximately 50 per cent of the service provision.  The remaining 50 per cent are Sikorsky S-92 type helicopters. &#xa0;2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; August’s ditching was the fifth such incident in four years and the death of four people raised the total number of fatalities to twenty, with sixteen people having perished off the Aberdeenshire coast in April 2009.  &#xa0;2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since February 2009 there have been five major incidents involving the transfer of offshore workers to or from installations in the UKCS: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our comparative offshore helicopter safety record with our North Sea neighbour Norway makes for unfavourable reading and the disparity in safety records between the UK and Norway is often cited by offshore workers as a long-standing concern. This is more than justified.&#xa0;2.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the last decade, since 2002, the UK offshore oil and gas industry has suffered 

[[[38 fatalities]]] involving offshore helicopter transfers. There have been 

[[[zero]]] 

[[[fatalities]]] attributed to offshore helicopter transfers in Norway over the last decade with the last such incident in 1997, claiming 12 lives.&#xa0;2.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Leading academics, like Andrew Watterson, Professor of Health Effectiveness at the University of Stirling, has suggested the Norwegian success can be attributed to occupational health and safety structure laws developed in 2000, specifically the Norwegian Work Environment Act. &#xa0;2.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unite believes that in the wake of these recent fatalities and against the backdrop of the last decade the industry should follow the Norwegian example, given the obvious environmental similarities due to its geographical proximity, driven by the objective of creating a world leading safety record on offshore helicopter safety.  &#xa0;2.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ‘Back Home Safe’ Campaign will act as a driver for this, amplifying the collective voice of Unite’s offshore members and also the wider workforce to ensure both industry and government does more to protect the industry’s most important asset – its people.

[[[&#xa0;]]]3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The sample]]]3.1.1              Over 1,100 workers were interviewed representing a cross section of the offshore workforce. Responses were received from workers employed on over 100 different offshore installations.  3.1.2              62.1% of respondents were employed on a permanent basis in the Oil &amp; Gas Industry and 37.9% gave their employment status as ad-hoc, or non permanent.  3.1.3              Respondents had on average 12 years of employment in the industry.  Responders were both union members, 46.6% and non union members, 53.4%. 3.1.4              The gender of those responding was not recorded. &#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The results]]]3.2.1               Overwhelmingly helicopters are the main mode of transport offshore,  99.1%. With the average number of flights undertaken annually per worker approximately 28.6. The majority fly less than 40 helicopter flights annually but a significant minority of workers fly more frequently with 188 workers taking over 40 flights annually.3.2.2

[[[              ]]]Two manufacturers, Eurocopter and Sikorsky, and two models of helicopter, Sikorsky S-92 and Eurocopter Super Puma EC225 dominiate the North Sea fleet – they can accurately be described as the workhorses of the industry. 3.3.3

[[[              ]]]When workers were asked, ‘Which make and model of helicopter do you fly in most frequently?’ Sikorsky S-92 was the stated by 57.0% of workers. The next most frequent response was Eurocopter EC225 42.7%. Other significant models and types stated were the Eurocopter AS 332 L1 &amp; L2 (7.1 &amp; 17.1%).

[[[Worker confidence in offshore flights]]]3.3.1              In response to the question, ‘At the present moment how confident are you in the safety of offshore helicopter flight?’ over 45% stated they were not confident. This figure incresed to over 53% when those who did not give an opinion are excluded:3.3.2              When subsequently asked, ‘In the past 12 months has your level of confidence in helicopter flight offshore increased, decreased or stayed the same?’ over 77% of workers stated that their confidence had decreased. Less than 1% of the workforce said that their confidence had increased:3.3.3              When the confidence of workers is examined for each of the most commonly used helicopters (

[[[TABLE 1]]]). The results show significant different levels of confidence in each of the 5 most commonly flown in helicopters, (Sikorsky S-92s and Eurocopter EC225s, AS 332 L, L1s &amp; L2s). Workers have a higher level of confidence in the Sikorsky S-92s. It is only this make and model in which the number of workers confident is greater than the number of workers who are not confident, although even for the S-92s 41.1% are not confident. At the present moment how confident are you in the safety of offshore helicopter flight?

[[[What changes do workers demand?]]]3.4.1              Workers were asked, ‘What actions they thought UK Oil &amp; Gas must now take to improve safety?’  These questions involved changes workers would like to see made to the helicopter fleet and also other methods for offshore transfers. Tellingly when asked about the use of both ships and fixed wing aircraft for offshore transfers a majority of the workforce did not support these options. (Transfers by ship 41.5%, transfers by fixed wing aircraft 46.6%). 3.4.2              When asked about changes to the helicopter fleet the most popular demand from the workforce is for a larger offshore fleet , supported by 95.1% of workers, followed by changes to the internal seat configuration of helicopters, supported by 92.9% of workers, followed by changes to the design of helicopters used for passenger transport offshore, supported by 92.2% of workers. 3.4.3              These three actions are futher demonstrated as being the most important for the workforce as they were also the top three priorities when workers were asked to prioritise the actions that would improve offshore flight safety.What action(s) do you think the Oil &amp; Gas Industry must now take to improve offshore safety?&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;What are the top 3 priorities for the Oil &amp; Gas Industry to improve offshore safety? (Highest priorities have the lowest number) &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Conclusion]]]

[[[s]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a direct result of this consultation offshore workers on installations throughout the UKCS are taking an active role and supporting the ‘Back Home Safe’ campaign.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Unite strongly believes the issues highlighted by the workers and the support for the four key demands emphasise the legitimate and genuine concerns among the workforce regarding the safety of helicopter transfers.  Both government and the wider industry have an obligation to address these concerns. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the same vein, there should be no surprise in either the industry or in government to the responses received via our consultation as these concerns have been growing and exacerbated with each major incident. The problem is further compounded when workers look at their Norwegian counterparts and compare the respective safety records. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The reality is that helicopter transfers are the most efficient, effective and in all likelihood, the safest means of commercial transfer to and from offshore installations. However, that does not mean that changes to improve these transfers cannot be undertaken immediately.

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The oil and gas industry is our growth sector for the next thirty years but it is also at a crossroads as we move into what the industry refers to as the next phase of the UKCS. This is emphasised in the recently published Wood Review Interim Report, which has recommended the fast-tracking of measures aimed at maximising the economic benefit of the remaining UK offshore capacity. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, while the industry and government speed are at pains to maximise the remaining profits of the UKCS, this pursuit must be matched by an improved and robust health and safety agenda to protect the industry’s most important asset – its people. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As a result, Unite urges the committee to take on board these initial findings from our Back Home Safe Campaign as a highly representative sample of opinion from across the UK oil and gas workforce and help to address these clear concerns with offshore helicopter safety with the utmost haste.
