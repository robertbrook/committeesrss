"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Safermedia [FBB0059]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSafermedia\n will respond only to \ncertain aspects of this Inquiry \nwhich we set out below:\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?The raison \nd’etre\n of the BBC \nshould be to provide the licence fee paying British public\n with \na  first\n-\nclass service which is based on integrity and imp\nartiality and produces high quality output for all including news, current affairs\n, education\n and  entertainment.\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?In some cases very well but in others it has been lacking\n.\n•&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?The BBC has a worldwide reputation for the \nquality of its journalism from highly respected BBC reporters around the world\n and the BBC can be proud of this record. \n&#xa0;\nHowev\ner, \nas about 70% of the news\n that\n people ‘consume’ in this country is via the BBC, we believe that there should be a better balan\nce in staff recru\niting.  \n&#xa0;\nThe BBC should always maintain the highest standards of neutrality, both factually and in its commentary.   There have been some notable deficits:  Panorama has been exposed for fabricating or skewing stories as in the programme \nabout Primark and child labour in \nBangalore\n; \nand\n in \nthe coverage of \nAndrew \nTyrie\n MP at the Conservative Party Conference.\nIn an earlier study, a BBC journalist David Kerr set o\nut to discover if the BBC is a \nneutral a\nrbiter.  This study appears in \nRobin \nAit\nken's\n book, Can We Trust the BBC?\n&#xa0;\n In a chapter entitled The Moral Maze, Kerr considers 'the population control debate'.  “The BBC generally avoids entering into partnerships with campaigning groups but Kerr uncovers a complex web of relationships between \nthe BBC, IPPF and a charity called Television Trust for the Environment (TVE). TVE is a prolific producer of programmes about the environment, development, human rights and health issues which it sells worldwide\n.\n“TVE's relationship with Panorama was both \npersonal - the reporter on 'Sex and the Holy City', Steve Bradshaw, is the husband of TVE's deputy director Jenny Richards - and formal - TVE co-hosted a pre-broadcast screening of 'Sex and the Holy City' followed by a debate chaired by the BBC's Francine \nStock”.   \n“Kerr says the BBC also has a close relationship with IPPF through a project called \nSexwise\n.\n&#xa0;\n This consists of sex education programmes\n&#xa0;\n broadcast worldwide\n&#xa0;\n and covering such 'topics as foreplay and intimacy, masturbation, homosexuality, unsafe\n abortion, sexual coercion, prostitution alongside subjects such as HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and contraceptive methods for both men and women.'\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n In all t\nhe programmes and accompanying\n&#xa0;\nwebsite information and literature there are no re\nferences to social conservative teaching\n.\n“So when the BBC proclaims: 'We are independent, ho\nnest and impartial' Kerr wondered how that could\n be squared with the Corporation's close partnership with a pro-abortion organisation like IPPF.\n“\n £\n15m in taxpayer cash is spent by the  Corporation's charity on ‘international aid’ projects (''changing lives through media and communication') including ‘educating’ \nAfrica\n on climate change and a ‘romantic’ soap for Indian radio.\n&#xa0;\n The charity is called \nthe BBC World Service Trust .......It also produces foreign sex edu\ncation programmes, including an\n advertisement star\nr\ning an Asian beauty queen emerging from a bath seductively \nencouraging men to use a condom.\n&#xa0;\n It has also produced a Hindi drama on relatio\nnships - 156 in the series.  The BBC’s charity gets £800,000 from the BBC, also funding from the Foreign office, the British Council, the EU and the UN, as well as cash from the charitable fo\nundation of Bill Gates.”\n   [Sunday Telegraph 22 May 11]\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMost r\necently,\n in 2013\n, \n th\ne\n BBC charity has been in the s\npotlight over impartiality \nof coverage of  EU enlargement since it was disclosed its Global News division received £4.5m from \nBrussels\n last year.\nSafermedia\n \nwonders how \nmany licence\n \nfee payers are aware o\nf this charity and its activities.\n&#xa0;\nAnother recent example of bias, in our view, has been shown \nin the BBC’s attitude towards pornography.    In Radio 4 Analysis ‘Pornography: What do we know?’ on 30 June 2013 and \nNewsnight’s\n ‘Online porn boom: liberating \nminds or damaging brains’ on 14\nth\n August 2013\n, the \nBBC  did\n not provide balance or show any interest in the precautionary pr\ninciple where harm is concerned;   \nthis shows\n that\n the BBC \nis \nout of step with the majority of society which is extraordinary \ngiven \nthe concern not just in this country but globally \nabout pornography especially its e\nffects on children.\n.\nThe licence fee should stay in order to keep the BBC as a public service broadcaster\n serving the licence fee payer\n.\n   There is a case for a reduction in the fee which could be achieved by scaling down the number of channels on offer for example.   Please see our views on Channel Three below.\nW\ne think that\n the licence fee should remain with the BBC\n and not be given to commercial broadcasters.\n&#xa0;-  Lord Hall recently spoke\n of his vision for the BBC’s future, which “\nbelongs\n” to viewers.\n“Digital technology now means that we are able to hand to our listeners and viewers a huge amount of control that 30 years ago we kept to ourselves,” he said.\n“No listener or viewer should ev\ner have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the BBC they want has succumbed to a BBC they didn’t ask for, because in future individuals will have the ability to control the BBC themselves\n.”\nThis\n is a rather lofty \nstatement and we wonder what it m\neans in practice.    Digital technology is only accessible for those who are online.    This leaves the 15% or so of people not online disenfranchised, particularly the elderly and the disadvantaged.   \n \n-\nGiven the recent scandals at the BBC, including \nSav\nile\n (please see note at the end of this section\n*\n)\n, remuneration, bias and the unseemly blame game between the Trust Chairman and the previous Director General Mark T\nhompson, we believe there needs to\n be a real change in the culture\n,\n and proper accountabili\nty to the licence fee payer\n, not just lip service\n.  \n                                                                                      \n-\n \nThis accountability can work more fairly if the Trust \nbecomes entirely independent of, and separate from, the BBC Executive.   It cannot represent \nboth at the same time.\n- Editorial Guidelines should be re-drafted\n and simplified \nunder close scrutiny by the\n Trust.\n-\n \nIn the interests of transparency and \nopenness we also suggest that the Trust should include\n \none member who represents the licence fee payer\n \ndirectly, for example a representative from an independent\n media\n charity such as \nSafermedia\n.   \n- \nA member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committ\nee might also be \nincluded\n on a rotating basis to ensure political \nbalance.\n*\nIt is interesting\n to note that on the subject of\n the \nSavile\n scandal, in June 2002 the BBC broadcast, ‘Hunt for \nBritain\n’s Paedophiles’ on BBC Two.   This programme generated large n\numbers of complaints for its graphic content.  The video footage, photos, ‘sex’ drawings, taped telephone conversations\n of paedophiles with children, and verbal descriptions (including bad language) were so explicit they might have helped to: develop an in\nterest in paedophilia in some vulnerable adults and desensitise others;  give existing paedophiles guidance on how to target and groom children; traumatise some child viewers, or lead them to develop a precocious sexual interest and lastly create the sort \nof hysteria which can lead to dangerous vigilantism. \no&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?We believe it does and should continue to do so.   However, there needs to be a \nvery \ndifferent style of management and accountability if this is to work\n for the public good\n.\n \n  \nA little more humility and less arrogance.\nThe BBC’s Royal Charter states that “The BBC exists to serve the public interest” and that its main object is the promotion of the following Public Purposes:The public purposes are extremely worthy but t\nhe BBC does not live up to them.   \nE\nxample\ns of three\n on which we base most of ou\nr comments are\n: sustaining citizenship and civil society\n;\n stimulating cre\nativity and cultural excellence and promoting education and learning\n.\nOver several years, the BBC has consistently driven down standards in some of its content and we believe this has contributed towards a coarsening of society, especially harmful to the development of good values for children and young people.   We have \nbro\nught this to the attention of the BBC \nmany times as have \nou\nr supporters \nalso.   Please see \nour  \nproforma\n letters of 2002 and 2007 which, while eliciting so\nme interest from the Trust\n initially\n, \n did not convert into any action to reduce the decline in stand\nards.\n    Inde\ned\n this decline continues apace; \nincreasingly\n,\n TV and radio programmes, in particular dramas, feature unacceptable levels of violent, sexual and sexually violent material and bad language. \nWe continue to experience biased reporting of news an\nd current affairs, indeed reports of BBC bias are far too frequent\n, and not without foundation.\nShould the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degree for particular audiences?Lord Hall said, “Now we deliver so much more with fou\nr times more television channels, twice as many national radio stations, impressive web services and the \niPlayer\n.”\n \n&#xa0;\n1.  \nT\nhe number of television\n channels\n. The BBC should have fewer television channels and would do well to focus on the audience as a whole,\n and treat everyone with equal respect and provide equal quality.   The current situation regarding television breaks the population down into groupings: the populist BBC One; the more serious BBC Two and BBC Four (BBC Four was be\nst rated channel in 2011)\n,\n  and\n \nBBC Three for younger audiences (we are not going to discuss children’s programming here).\n    By targeting different groups this ghettoises viewing and does little to raise aspiration or promote family viewing and link g\nenerations.   \n&#xa0;\n2.   \nBBC \n \nThree\n.    This \nchannel\n \n \n“\ntargets young audience as a …...place to nurture \n‘\ntalent\n’\n for BBC One\n”\n.   \n  \nBBC Thre\ne \nshares programmes with BBC One,\n apparently \nto provide additional chances to watch programmes which appeal to younger audience (surely BBC \niPlayer\n does this,  \nso why repeat \nEastEnders\n for example, on another channel)\n.\n This adds to unnecessary duplication.\n&#xa0;\n(We note the projected service licence content spend 2016/17 for  BBC Three was £85.5m and that it will see a percentage reduction of 10%.  This \nspend is still significantly higher than say BBC Four which manages to make good quality, informative programmes.)\n&#xa0;\nThe question that must be asked is why does the BBC target young people with such down market \ndross and \noft-repeated material?  \nT\nhere is the\n occasional good\n documentary but why are these not given a wider audience\n.  \n The BBC Three Controller tells us\n the young people like the content\n but is that good enough?   After all, the current younger generation has been raised on a diet of declining con\ntent standards and coarsening programming and this is what they know\n, \n expect\n, and enjoy\n.  Much o\nf Channel Three output is \nhighly \ncrass and crude\n \n‘\ncomedy\n’\n (try Russell Howard’s Good News or Family Guy). \n   This does not \noffer valuable and enriching content\n to\n \nraise the aspirations of young people or teach them about history or the arts, or \nserve the \npublic  interest\n  but\n,\n rather, \n \nthe opposite.\n   \n&#xa0;\nBBC Three \ncaters for \nages 16-34 \nbut \nwill without doubt attract a good many under 16 year olds \nwho will enjoy t\nhe animations.   \nMany\n of the programmes have a warning at the beginning such as ‘Contains strong lan\nguage’ and ‘\nContains\n \nsome strong language and adult humour’\n.  To access the programmes you simply have to click on a button.   There are no checks to verify\n age and, although the BBC does operate a parental control system, this does not seem enough given the propensity of many parents to neglect these controls as \nOfcom’s\n ‘Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report, October 2013’ clearly shows.\n  It i\ns simply not good enough to put the burden of responsibility on parents alone who are generally unaware of th\ne content of the programmes or w\nhat their children are watching.   This is exacerbated by the variety of devices used to watch television now \nonlin\ne \nespecially with the rise in children using \nsmartphones\n.\n   Given the findings of the \nOfcom\n Report, the BBC shows an extraordinary disregard for children and young people.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.  \nA reduction in episodes of\n \nEastEnders\n could be undertaken especially as an incr\nease in \nthe  number\n has resulted in poorer quality and a growing trend towards sensationalism, violence and sexual content as a ploy to keep viewers watching.  Any justification for controversial storylines on the grounds \nof  raising\n difficult issues is di\nsingenuous, and in some instances has contributed to high levels of complaints.   The bottom line seems to be ratings once again and keeping viewers in front of the television for the rest of the evening.    \n5\n.   The \nBBC \n has\n been host to nudity, violence\n and explicit drug taking in the risqué thriller ‘Hidden’\n for example\n.   From The Romans to Henry Tudor, \nLady Chatterley’s Lover to Men Only, \nthe BBC seems intent on reducing its drama, historical or otherwise, to the lowest common denominator.  \nThe contro\nversial Jerry Springer the Opera \ndrove a horse and cart through our blasphemy laws in the face of huge public outcry.\n  \n&#xa0;\nMost \nrecently \n new\n dramas such as Escape Artist  and  \nRipper Street\n glorify in\n graphic\n violence\n,\n sexual violence\n and gore\n.  \n  While scheduled p\nost \nthe \nwatershed\n such \ncontent is a problem \nfor the\n many older viewers\n who\n do \nnot  enjoy\n ‘gritty/edgy’ drama and are upset by being confronted with bad language, violence, sex  etc.   ‘Context’ does not dispel the effect of the image or \nword, even for the most discerning viewers.    It should also be remembered that scheduling does not prevent younger viewers watching unsuitable content\n (as commented on under BBC Three).\n \n&#xa0;\nOn Radio 4 G F Newman’s ‘The Corruption’ attracted a large level o\nf complaints.\n \nOther daytime programmes have also drawn complaint\ns\n about their sexual references such \nThe Archers, t\nhe Diary of Samuel Pepys and a\n Woman’s Hour drama.\n  \n&#xa0;\nIn the portentous words of \nAldous\n Huxley on Pleasures (1923): “\nWith a mind almost atrop\nhied by lack of use, unable to entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested in the ready-made distractions offered from without that nothing but the grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence and crudity can move it, the democracy of the futu\nre will sicken of a chronic and mortal boredom.”\n6. \n  \nEditorial Standards\n&#xa0; Everything hinges on the\n ‘Editorial Guidelines’ giving details of how the language used in the Guidelines can be interpreted\n \nand how little understanding the ordinary licence fee \npayer \nhas of the Guidelines which require a great deal of effort\n, both in time and intellectual ability,\n to refer to.\n&#xa0;The BBC \nsay they \nset out to apologise quickly\n when appropriate and respond\n to the issues \nraised\n.\n   \nHowever, \napologetic responses very oft\nen leave the complainant frustrated and confused when the complaint is not upheld.\nFor example, letters in response to a complaint say things like “We would never deliberately set out to cause offence”*; “It is inevitable that programmes which are \nacceptable to some will occasionally strike others as distasteful and the only realistic and fair approach for us is to ensure that the range of our output is broad enough for everyone to feel that they are catered for at least some of the time”**; “We fee\nl that our adult audience members should make up their own minds about what they personally find acceptable and we therefore try to ensure that enough detail is given about programmes for an informed decision to be made.”; “programmes containing strong lan\nguage are usually signposted by presentation announcements so that no-one will be taken by surprise.”**\n* ;\n “There is no single set of standards in this area (\nbad language on this occasion) \non which the whole of society can agree.  The BBC has issued detail\ned guidelines to programme makers in order to try and minimise the risk of gratuitous offence.”****    (these BBC response comments come in one email dated 18 July 2011 Ref: CAS-869429-1H894G)\n&#xa0;\n* \nequally\n, this suggests that the BBC is sanguine if it has ca\nused offence.\n**this begs the question, where is the line on ‘broad range of output’ drawn and what percentage of the time should a licence fee payer expect to find something which doesn’t offend?  And why is it ‘fair’ to cater for the taste of the lowest \ncommon denominator?\n*** this does not allow for channel hopping and accidentally coming across offensive material, even in programmes which sound innocuous enough.   This is a common complaint from our supporters.  \n**** Surely there should be certain (eth\nical) standards for the BBC to abide by. The BBC’s “duty to use resources efficiently and proportionately in the interests of the licence fee payers as a whole” would be easier to achieve if the Editorial Guidelines were clear and specific, thus saving a g\nreat deal of everyone’s time and energy and contributing to higher standards.    At present they are weighted in favour of editorial flexibility by being couched in permissive language.  This means that the complainant generally will receive a typical BBC \nbrush\n off.\n \nIt must be the responsibility of the Editor in Chief, the Director General, to ensure the Guidelines cannot be interpreted too widely by program\nme makers and editorial staff, also, and of equal importance, to ensure that the Guidelines are easi\nly understood by the viewer and listener.\n    For too long the Guidelines h\nave helped the BBC make a speciality\n of\n self-jus\ntification which takes \ntime and great determination to tackle\n through the lengthy \ncomplaints procedure.\n&#xa0;\nIt is hardly surprising then,\n that at a meeting with Fran O’Brien at the Trust three or four years ago  she told us they had only received one appeal on the subject of sexual content.\n  \n&#xa0;\nFor a previous consultation, \nDirector General, Mark Thompson,\n \nsaid\n:  “Your views help shape the \ndecisions we take about the BBC’s services and the priorities we set the BBC’s management.”\n    These words appear to\n have been\n empty rhetoric most of the time.    \n&#xa0;\nThe Guidelines are still lacking in clarity, ambiguous, open to interpretation and permissi\nve, as before, serving producers’ interests rather than the interests of the licence fee payer, and causing confusion among employees as to what is and is not allowed.  What is the resulta\nnt \ncost of editorial and legal \nadvice to programme makers?  If guide\nlines were more specific and clear cut, there would be less need to resort to such advice – so is this costing the licence fee payer more money as some producers \npush boundaries\n and editors make mistakes\n?\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013 \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n.   \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
