[normal]1.[bold] [bold]Executive Summary[bold] and Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The University of York undertakes internationally recognized cross-disciplinary 
[normal]research in biology, environmental science and chemistry ge
[normal]rmane to food security
[normal]. T
[normal]his 
[normal]expertise 
[normal]illustrate
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]the improvements s
[normal]cience and technology could
[normal] deliver
[normal] to UK agriculture
[normal]. In particular, the combination of
[normal] new DNA sequencing technologies
[normal],
[normal] improv
[normal]ed bioinformatics and 
[normal]advanced 
[normal]analy
[normal]tical methods has:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]revolutionised approaches to 
[normal]crop
[normal] 
[normal]improvement
[normal];
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]identified new routes to crop protection
[normal];
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]increased our ability to extract value from 
[normal]food a
[normal]nd agricultural waste; and
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]g
[normal]rea
[normal]tly increased 
[normal]understanding 
[normal]of 
[normal]the complex intera
[normal]c
[normal]tions between crops, soil and 
[normal]their
[normal] microbial communities
[normal],
[normal] both beneficial and pathogenic
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 The University of York recommends that:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given the development of advanced 
[normal]plant breeding 
[normal]techniques to 
[normal]restore
[normal] lost resilience to importan
[normal]t food crops, increased investment should be made to shorten the time to translate new varieties from laboratory to 
[normal]full scale 
[normal]cultivation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Competition for food crops between the food and 
[normal]bio
[normal]fuel industries could be lessened if 
[normal]more efficient 
[normal]routes to co
[normal]nvert woody agricultural and forestry waste into biofuels were available. Lignocellulose-degrading enzymes have been discovered and their exploitation should be accelerated.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]c)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Biofumigation
[normal], the
[normal] suppress
[normal]ion of crop pests by co-cultivating plants 
[normal]that 
[normal]natura
[normal]lly 
[normal]prod
[normal]uce chemicals detrimental to
[normal] pests
[normal], is an exciting route to natural crop protection that warrants increased attention
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]d)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Considering 
[normal]food waste
[normal] 
[normal]as a
[normal] valuable 
[normal]source
[normal] of energy and raw materials
[normal] will aid the much-needed reduction in the amount of food 
[normal]thrown away
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is important that t
[normal]he investigation of n
[normal]ovel strategies for the 
[normal]commercial exploitation
[normal] of food 
[normal]and agricultural 
[normal]waste 
[normal]go
[normal]es
[normal] beyond current 
[normal]narrow 
[normal]organic w
[normal]aste reuse and recycling
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]e)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A greater u
[normal]nderstanding 
[normal]of the molecular and biochemical basis of the interactions between crops and soil biota, both beneficial and pathogenic, 
[normal]presents an exciting opportunity to increase yields
[normal]. Exploitation of the 
[normal]latest meta-genomic and high throughpu
[normal]t sequencing techniques make advances 
[normal]in this field
[normal] particularly timely
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]they 
[normal]should be prioritised
[normal].

[normal]2. Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 
[normal]The University of York 
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]one of the UK’s leading research universities, consistently ranked in the top 
[normal]ten
[normal] in the UK
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]and
[normal] in the wor
[normal]ld top 
[normal]one hundred
[normal]. 
[normal]York is 
[normal]ranked 
[normal]seventh 
[normal]in the world for universities under 
[normal]fifty
[normal] years old (the only UK University in the top 
[normal]ten
[normal]) 
[normal]and attracted over £200 million of funding last year. 
[normal]A member of the elite Russell Group of universities, it
[normal] was ranked 
[normal]eighth 
[normal]overall 
[normal]in the UK’s most recent e
[normal]valuation of research
[normal] excellence
[normal].
[normal] It has 
[normal]acknowledged
[normal]

[normal] among broad spectrum bioscience departments in the UK for research judged to be world-leading
[normal]. 
[normal]The impact of the ecological and environmental science at York was ranked second in the UK and 
[normal]seventeen
[normal]th in the world. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 
[normal]York has several specialist resea
[normal]rch centres relevant to food security
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he Centre for Novel Agricultural Products (
[normal]CNAP
[normal]) 
[normal]is an award winning
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]internationally recognised 
[normal]research centre 
[normal]delivering research 
[normal]with impact, 
[normal]focused on development of 
[normal]plants and microbes as green factories.

[normal]2.3 In July 2013, 
[normal]DEFRA’s
[normal] Food and Environment
[normal] Research Agency (
[normal]FERA
[normal]) 
[normal]in Sand Hutton, York, 
[normal]and 
[normal]the
[normal] University of York
[normal] announced a joint initiative in Agri
[normal]-
[normal]food Resilience
[normal]. This
[normal] 
[normal]bring
[normal]s together 
[normal]expertise on food and non-food crop production systems and address
[normal]es
[normal] the key issues of food security an
[normal]d environmental sustainability.
[normal] 
[normal]The aim of th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal]itiative
[normal] is to ensure the stability and integrity of agri-food supply chains in the face of climate change, declining resources and rapid socio-political transformations
[normal].
[normal] Uniting the world-class research at York with FERA’s unrivall
[normal]ed expertise in applied science 
[normal]has
[normal] create
[normal]d
[normal] a research platform for researchers and companies in the agri-food supply chain to work together to understand and quantify the multiple challenges faced, to develop innovative solutions to those challenges, and to identify and exploit the comm
[normal]ercial opportunities that arise in responding to them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 This expertise and research excellence makes the University of York 
[normal]well placed
[normal] to give evidence to this committee. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]The Challenge[bold]s[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]Global and local agri-food supply chains face multiple 
[normal]challenges: economic uncertainty
[normal];
[normal] a
[normal] changing and more unpredictable
[normal] climate
[normal];
[normal] new pests and diseases
[normal];
[normal] crop and commodity shortages
[normal];
[normal] inferior, contaminated and adulterated food
[normal];
[normal] and the drive to reduce inputs, increase yields and extract value from waste wit
[normal]hout compromising on food quality, crop pest and disease control, and biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides. 
[normal]Furthermore, securing supply chains is proving difficult
[normal] 
[normal]in an increasingly complex world.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]T
[normal]o ensure that food production 
[normal]is
[normal] rob
[normal]ust and resilient
[normal] in the face of 
[normal]these challenges, w
[normal]e urgently need new crop varieties with higher yields, 
[normal]better
[normal] nutritional 
[normal]and by-product 
[normal]value, resistance to drought and pests, lower external inputs, produced and harvested in ways that protect natural 
[normal]ecosystems and the services they provide.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]ncreasing vulnerability due to climate change and more complex supply chains mean we need better strategies to deal with 
[normal]exotic pests and diseases
[normal] 
[normal]as well as existing threats
[normal],
[normal] including
[normal] horizon scanning for biosec
[normal]urity risks, models to predict their spread and new plant protection agents designed, discovered and tested
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. [bold]How[bold] [bold]science can contribute to[bold] improve[bold]d[bold] UK (and EU) food security[bold] and [bold]the more efficient use of resources[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal] 
[normal]Feeding a growing population in a
[normal] warming world, whilst protecting biodiversity and
[normal] the services it provides, 
[normal]require
[normal]s
[normal] innovative thinking, unprecedented collaboration between countries and academic communities,
[normal] and a willingness to cross disciplinary boundaries
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]We need new ways to incre
[normal]ase
[normal] yields, but 
[normal]n
[normal]ot
[normal] at the expense of the agricultural environment and the ecosystem functions and services it provides. Nor can we neglect the ne
[normal]ed to conserve 
[normal]scarce resources
[normal]:
[normal] land, healthy 
[normal]soils, and adequate 
[normal]nutrients and water.
[normal] 
[normal]Science, including 
[normal]advanced genetic techniques
[normal] allied to traditional plant breeding
[normal], can
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]and
[normal] will need to
[normal] -
[normal] play a significant role in 
[normal]growing more food from less land using less energy, less water
[normal], less
[normal] fertiliser
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]less and fewer pesticides
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]ncreasing 
[normal]food security
[normal] 
[normal]b
[normal]y maintaining yields in the face of reduced inputs and increased frequency of extreme weather events is a key goal for agricultural innovation, as is 
[normal]using res
[normal]ources, including waste, 
[normal]more efficiently
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Breeding lost attributes back into modern crops[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal] 
[normal]Agricultural crops will need to supply sufficient food to nourish around 
[normal]nine
[normal] billion people by 2050
[normal] but climate change is expected to 
[normal]threaten this endeavour. 
[normal]Recently the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall event
[normal]s
[normal] was described by the President of 
[normal]the National Farmers Union as the greatest threat to UK agriculture
[normal],  whilst
[normal] globally both high and low extremes in rainfall increasingly limit food production, particularly for the poorest farmers. 
[normal]D
[normal]roughts and floods are predicted to occur more frequentl
[normal]y under climate change, whilst the availability of water for agriculture will decline. 
[normal]S
[normal]cientific 
[normal]innovations are required 
[normal]to create 
[normal]new 
[normal]crop
[normal] varieties
[normal] that are 
[normal]more 
[normal]resistant to 
[normal]such 
[normal]environmental stress
[normal]es
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]Crop 
[normal]varieties 
[normal]commonly grown today
[normal] were developed
[normal] 
[normal]to maximise yield at the expense of other traits
[normal], and
[normal] so 
[normal]have 
[normal]lost some of their 
[normal]resilience to 
[normal]extreme events 
[normal]such as drought
[normal]s,
[normal] 
[normal]floods
[normal] and pest outbreaks
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]raits 
[normal]providing 
[normal]resilience to 
[normal]these threats 
[normal]remain in the wild ancestors of modern c
[normal]rops
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and now 
[normal]need to 
[normal]be bred back into the modern 
[normal]cultivars 
[normal]that have lost th
[normal]is resilience
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The recent advent of new DNA sequencing technologies has transformed our ability to collect genomic information quickly and cheaply. 
[normal]This
[normal],
[normal] along with improved bioi
[normal]nformatics and analytical methods
[normal],
[normal] has 
[normal]revolu
[normal]tionised the approaches that 
[normal]can now 
[normal]be 
[normal]take
[normal]n
[normal] to source the natural variation that exists in 
[normal]both 
[normal]domesticated crops and their wild ancestors. 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]such
[normal] approaches allow
[normal] CNAP
[normal] t
[normal]o 
[normal]domesticate 
[normal]neglected and
[normal] underutilised 
[normal]crops 
[normal](‘orphan’ crops)
[normal], which have 
[normal]not previously benefited 
[normal]from modern breeding techniques
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]to 
[normal]apply new molecular breeding tools to established crops such as rice and oil
[normal]-
[normal]seed rape.
[normal] 
[normal]These 
[normal]modern 
[normal]methods speed up the breeding process 
[normal]such that what previously took six generations can now be achieved in two
[normal]. 
[normal]Almost any trait can be targeted
[normal]: 
[normal] resistance to 
[normal]specific 
[normal]pests, the ability to
[normal] resist pathogens,
[normal] fix nitrogen
[normal], consume less water and 
[normal]need 
[normal]less fertilis
[normal]er.
[normal] 
[normal]In York we are particula
[normal]rly interested in developin
[normal]g 
[normal]both 
[normal]more resilient crops and 
[normal]those
[normal] with increased by-product value.

[normal]Quantifying the [bold]impact of [bold]climate change[bold] on wheat[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 
[normal]C
[normal]limate
[normal] change
[normal] 
[normal]is predicted 
[normal]to affect
[normal] wheat production in the UK
[normal], but t
[normal]here is little consensus
[normal] on whether 
[normal]any potential 
[normal]benefits to 
[normal]yields from rising temperatures
[normal] 
[normal]will be offset by 
[normal]extreme and
[normal] unpredictable rainfall
[normal], 
[normal]nor sufficient understanding of how these changes will affect the quality of grain upon which food manufacturers rely, 
[normal]limit
[normal]ing

[normal]ir
[normal] ability 
[normal]to assess
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]risk

[normal]More e[bold]fficient [bold]u[bold]se of [bold]biomass[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7 
[normal]The economy of the future will increasingly rely on biological rather than fossil resources for 
[normal]materials, chemicals and
[normal] fuels. 
[normal]The rising demand for crops for fuel has put them in direct competition with
[normal] food crops over land and water
[normal]; 
[normal] the use of food crops for non-food purposes to meet environmental objectives is increasing. For 
[normal]example, the Vivergo 
[normal]F
[normal]uels refin
[normal]ery near Hull
[normal] require
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]over one
[normal] million tonnes of whe
[normal]at each year, equivalent to nearly 60% of
[normal] the r
[normal]egion’s cultivated area of wheat
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.8 
[normal]The impact of using 
[normal]grain
[normal] crops 
[normal]to produce fuel 
[normal]on food supply is 
[normal]debated, but it is clear that
[normal] g
[normal]rowth of the bio-economy
[normal] 
[normal]require
[normal]s
[normal] new technology
[normal]. 
[normal]I
[normal]f
[normal] agricultural 
[normal]waste could be turned into 
[normal]useful products
[normal], it 
[normal]would
[normal] lessen 
[normal]the risk of divertin
[normal]g farmland or crops for biofuel
[normal] production to the detriment of food supply
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The 
[normal]exploitation
[normal] 
[normal]of biomass
[normal] as a feedstock for biofuel production is
[normal] 
[normal]technically challenging but
[normal] attractive.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]traw 
[normal]from 
[normal]maize, 
[normal]wheat
[normal], 
[normal]barley
[normal] a
[normal]nd oilseed rape
[normal], dedicated biomass crops such as 
[normal]M
[normal]iscanthus
[normal] 
[normal]and forestry products 
[normal]are 
[normal]all 
[normal]potential bioethanol feedstocks. 
[normal]Annually, over five million tonnes of 
[normal]wheat and barley straw is 
[normal]produced
[normal] in England
[normal], of which around half
[normal] could be sold for bioenergy purposes
[normal], with
[normal] the potential to generate 
[normal]sufficient 
[normal]ethanol
[normal] to
[normal] contribute around 2% of the UK petrol requirement
[normal] as a fuel additive
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]he major cereal producing areas 
[normal]of 
[normal]Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and East of En
[normal]gland
[normal] 
[normal]have
[normal] the potential 
[normal]to 
[normal]supply 
[normal]almost two million tonnes 
[normal]of straw for bioenergy purposes. The environmental and economic cost of straw transportation would 
[normal]point to
[normal] biofuel processing plants being 
[normal]situat
[normal]ed within these region
[normal]s
[normal].

[normal]Food is a valuable resource and yet UK households throw away over 
[normal]7 
[normal]m
[normal]illion tonnes every year
[normal]. 
[normal]Considering
[normal] 
[normal]food – and agricultural 
[normal]– 
[normal]waste 
[normal]to be a 
[normal]valuable 
[normal]resource 
[normal]would
[normal] ameliorate the related problems of waste management and resource scarcity. 
[normal]Novel strategies for 
[normal]the utilisation of 
[normal]food waste 
[normal]need 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]go beyond
[normal] 
[normal]organic waste reuse 
[normal]and recycling
[normal] to include 
[normal]animal
[normal] feed, composting,
[normal] and
[normal] anaerobic digestion
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.13
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]naerobic digestion (AD) is the best option
[normal] for food waste processing
[normal]. AD is the process where 
[normal]complex 
[normal]pla
[normal]nt and animal material
[normal] is converted into 
[normal]simple molecules 
[normal]by 
[normal]microorganisms
[normal] in th
[normal]e absence of air. The 
[normal]useful 
[normal]products of AD
[normal] are b
[normal]iogas
[normal] (around 
[normal]60% methane, 40% carbon dioxide
[normal])
[normal], which
[normal] is combusted to generate heat
[normal] and
[normal] power
[normal], and d
[normal]igestate
[normal], 
[normal]which

[normal]New routes to [bold]sustainable [bold]weed, [bold]pest [bold]and disease [bold]control[bold] and [bold]improved[bold] soil health[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.17 
[normal]Modern crops deliver high 
[normal]yield
[normal]s
[normal] with the aid of extensive irrigation, ferti
[normal]liser 
[normal]and chemical pesticides, but this may not be environmentally sustainable. Even with 
[normal]such 
[normal]inputs, g
[normal]lobal losses in crop production due to
[normal] pests, diseases and
[normal] 
[normal]w
[normal]eeds are 
[normal]around
[normal] 
[normal]30%
[normal]. F
[normal]uture losses are likely to be greater due to
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]warmer climates increasing the abundance and range of exist
[normal]ing and new biological threats;
[normal]b)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[normal];
[normal]c)

[normal]4.18 
[normal]Given 
[normal]76% of pesticide active ingredients have been removed from the EU market
[normal], t
[normal]here is a major opportunity for the UK to develop new crop protection 
[normal]solutions.
[normal] 
[normal]One 
[normal]approach
[normal] is to harness 
[normal]“
[normal]natural
[normal]”
[normal] crop defences
[normal], i.e. 
[normal] metabolites 
[normal]that
[normal] defend wild plants against pests and diseases
[normal], which
[normal] 
[normal]have often been bred out of
