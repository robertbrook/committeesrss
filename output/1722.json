"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the British Psychological Society (WSC067) &#xa0;\nThe British Psychological Society, incorporated by Royal Charter, is the learned and professional body for psychology and \npsychologists in the United Kingdom. We are a registered charity with a total membership of just over 50,000.\n&#xa0;\nUnder its Royal Charter, the objective of the British Psychological Society is \"to promote the advancement and diffusion of the knowledge of psyc\nhology pure and applied and especially to promote the efficiency and usefulness of members by setting up a high standard of professional education and knowledge\".  We are committed to providing and disseminating evidence-based expertise and advice, engagin\ng with policy and decision makers, and promoting the highest standards in learning and teaching, professional practice and \nresearch.\n&#xa0;\nThe British Psychological Society is an examining body granting certificates and diplomas in specialist areas of professio\nnal applied psychology\n.\n&#xa0;\nAbout this ResponseThis response was prepared for the British Psychological Society by\n the Research Board and the Psychology Education Board\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2  \nIn psychology, as \nwith the humanities, there is a leaky pipeline but it occurs l\nater on than in the harder STEM\n subjects where it is more a matter of moving women from PhD to \npostdoc\n to lectureship. \n2.3 In psychology it operates differently. Nearly all of our undergraduates are female yet that only equates to an average 50/50 split at lecturer/senior lecturer lev\nels and then women are again under-represented at the higher levels. In what is a female dominated subject, this gender discrepancy at \nthe higher levels in troubling. \nIt simply becomes harder for women to be promoted there. Some of this can be argued to be\n due to family policies whereby women pay the 'mommy penalty'. However, studies have demonstrated that this doesn't explain it all satisfactorily. \n2.4 Several reasons ranging from decisions about childcare to bias. However, it would be a mistake to decid\ne that interventions at the top of companies/universities will affect attitudes about gender and science. Beliefs about what is/isn’t a possible or suitable career for boys and girls are set in mid-childhood (around 8-10 years).\n2.4 \nThe Athena SWAN schem\ne and the extended ECU will start to uncover some of these \nproblems across institutions by \nasking institutions to disclose information on application, recruitment and staffing at all levels.\n  We are aware that a number of Departments\n of Psychology have Ath\nena \nSwan\n awards and \nprovide a useful network for data-gathering on differing practices\n.\n \nHowever, how the institutions choose to act on this becomes a different matter. Tying it to real consequences is one step in the right direction but we need further \nmoves to ensure that women are represented at senior levels.\n3.  \n              \nWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?\n3.1 \nOur \nCareers Destinations project (January 2013 report)\n has shown that \nPsychology graduates transition into a wide variety of\n STEM and non-STEM\n careers\n.\n  \nSome will go on to become qualified psychologists; others will go into different career areas (such as the \npolice, armed forces, employment and selection, as well as other areas of employment in which advanced research skills are required – such as the food and drink or pharmaceutical industries).  We believe that this wide transferability of skills obtained fr\nom studying psychology is one of the reasons why it is so popular and why its popularity continues to grow.\n \n3.2 \nA\nn undergraduate degree in psychology provides graduates with hugely transferrable skills as well as those in\n \npsychological literacy.  For exa\nmple, in terms of \nthe employability skills acquired during \na psychology degree\n, our own research has shown that  \nself management, team-working, problem solving, communication and literacy, application of numeracy, application of information technology \nwere\n \nwell developed\n.  \nIn relation to “psychological skills”, \na basic knowledge of the critical subject matter of psychology, scientific and critical analysis/problem solving, applying psychological knowledge to work, relationships and the broader community, be\nhaving ethically, recognising, understanding and fostering respect for diversity, \nand\n being insightful and reflective about one’s own and others’ behaviour and mental processes\n were\n also\n \nwell developed\n \n.\n3.3 \nW\ne\n therefore\n welcome and support the usage of t\nhese skills in\n different employment sectors both within and beyond STEM.\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would anticipate th\nat those Departments and Institutions that are Athena Swan award recipients will be able to provide the strongest examples of best practice. \n4.2 Harriet \nTenenbaum\n and Patrick Leman at the University of Surrey have\n \njust completed a project on mentoring un\ndergraduate women in science which has demonstrable positive effects both in terms of academic performance and intentions to pursue careers in science. \nThe outcomes of this research are also applicable to those further along in their academic careers.\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt should \nhave a \nfacilitatory\n role\n. \nImportantly, it needs\n to fund research into the early causes of beliefs about gender and science. The focus on addressing inequalities in post is worthwhile in the short and medium term. But role model women in these areas will not \ngenerate a lasting move towards equality if, \nat school and through childhood, the sense in which some aspects of science are a male domain, becomes ingrained.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
