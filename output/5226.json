"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Electoral Reform Society Cymru (DWB 06)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;\nThe Electoral Reform Society (ERS) Cymru welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee’s consideration of the Draft Wales Bill.  While ERS Cymru’s interest in the Draft Bill extends across a broad range of matters, this written submission focuses on dual candidacy.\n&#xa0;\nThis paper updates the written evidence that ERS produce in 2006 during the passage of the Government of Wales\n Act\n.   All of the key arguments from 2006 remain relevant in 2014.  ERS Cymru observes there are five main arguments \naround \nthe ban, not all of which stand up to scrutiny.  Those arguments are:\n&#xa0;\nThis paper outlines the basis for each of these arguments.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Partisan motivations&#xa0;\nWhile ERS Cymru favours the reversal of the ban, we recognise that both proponents and opponents of the ban hold principled positions.  The danger, in terms of public perception, is that parties that support the ban could, arguably benefit most from it; whilst parties that oppose the ban would benefit the greatest from its reversal.   The fact that the debate has taken on a partisan hue is therefore, inevitable.  The Electoral Commission warned that:\n&#xa0;\n“The ban is perceived widely as disadvantageous to opposition parties (the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats) in its effects if not its intention.  It is likely to favour incumbents in constituencies because opposition parties basically have to choose where to put some of their best candidates, whether in constituencies or on the list, and therefore they may have to put weaker candidates in constituencies and that is likely to favour incumbents.  It is perceived, rightly or wrongly across the political spectrum, as partisan and there is a danger that if it is perceived as partisan it might undermine public confidence in the process… We were worried that in the run up to the elections if there are accusations about partisanship, which we think is very likely, that that could have an impact on voter participation at the next election.  Also one of the criteria is that we have said in terms of arrangements for political parties and candidates to participate, and obviously if there are strong views by some parties about those electoral arrangements those, in our view, could not be the best idea of arrangements”.\n&#xa0;\nThe realistic prospective exists that this Parliament could pass a Draft Wales Bill that reverses the ban, but a future UK Labour government would re-introduce the ban.  ERS Cymru is mindful of the Electoral Commission’s concerns regarding public perception in this respect – that on each change of government in Westminster, the National Assembly’s voting system is altered\n.  \nThis has the danger of causing prolonged instability from one electoral cycle to the next, and undermining the credibility of the electoral process. \n  \n&#xa0;\nERS Cymru views the Wales Office’s proposal within the Draft Bill as a return to the status quo, and would hope that regardless of whether or not the ban is overturned in this Bill, this Parliament provides a sustainable resolution to this question, and that the issue is not constantly revisited by subsequent Parliaments.  This is, in our view, particularly important given the wider questions emerging regarding the size and capacity of the National Assembly and whether or not the numbers of Assembly Members should be increased.\n&#xa0;\nAllied to this argument, ERS Cymru would urge that all parties engaged in this debate\n to\n moderate language and argument.  We note th\nat\n ‘colourful’ language was used on both sides \nof the argument \nin 2006.  Accusations of gerrymandering and corruption do nothing to maintain public confidence in our democracy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVoters’ dissatisfaction with dual candidacy&#xa0;\nVoter dissatisfaction was one of the major justifications for the introduction of the ban.  The 2005 White Paper argued that\n:\n&#xa0;\n“\nThere\n is considerable dissatisfaction that candidates who are rejected by a particular constituency can still become Assembly Members through the regional list… This can have done little to enhance the voters’ level of engagement with it… In the Government’s view, for losing candidates to be able to become Assembly Members regardless of their constituency election results both devalue the integrity of the electoral system in the eyes of the public and acts as a disincentive to vote in the constituency elections”.  \n&#xa0;\nThe ‘Clwyd West problem’ where all four main party candidates standing in the 2003 constituency election were elected, either in the constituency or via the North Wales regional list\n is often cited.\n \nERS Cymru would echo the comments made by Glyn Mathias from the Electoral Commission that Clwyd West is \n“not perhaps the best example of how the AMS system works” yet “it does not man the Additional Member system is inherently defective\n”.  The issue of Clwyd West should not be overstated\n and is itself anomalous\n.\n&#xa0;\nThere appears to be very little evidence to support the claim that voters are dissatisfied with dual candidacy.  In its written evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, the Electoral Commission stated that:\n&#xa0;\n“Drawing on our quantitative and qualitative research on public attitudes to the National Assembly election in 2003, however, we note that the ‘Clwyd West problem’ as described in the White Paper did not emerge in any attitudinal research about voting in the election.  \n“In the absence of any research findings on voter attitudes on dual candidacy in the public domain, we believe it is necessary for the Government to provide more information regarding the justification underpinning the statement in the White Paper that voters are confused and concerned about the issue and that it is a disincentive to voters.”\n&#xa0;\nIt could be argued that in 2006, the UK Government conflated the evidence between \nconfusion\n about the voting system, and \ndisaffection\n with it.  The Electoral Commission suggested that any voter confusion may not so much be concerned with issues of dual candidacy but rather with a lack of understanding of the Additional Member System per se.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Regional AMs have engaged in ‘systematic abuse’ of their positions&#xa0;\nWhilst not stated in the 2005 White Paper, the argument that Regional AMs were engaging \nin \nthe ‘systematic abuse’ of their positions was forwarded by some proponents of the ban.   The primary concern within this argument is that a Regional AM can target a First Past The Post (FPTP) constituency for electoral purposes; opening up a regional office in the constituency, and presenting themselves as the ‘local’ AM.  \n&#xa0;\nAny Assembly Member will seek to do all they can to promote themselves and their party. Even with the ban in place since 2007, the practice of Regional AMs targeting FPTP constituencies has not altered.  Whilst the National Assembly has tightened the rules on how Regional AMs can ‘present’ themselves to the electorate, Regional AMs even under the ban on dual candidacy can target an individual FPTP constituency for electoral reasons. \n&#xa0;\nCompetition between representatives can make for better engagement with voters, giving a greater incentive for all parties to work hard for voters. The difficulty under AMS (unlike under STV for example), is that \nconstituency\n and region\nal\n AMs do not represent the same geographical area.\n&#xa0;\nERS Cymru recognise\ns\n that electing AMs via two different methods presents problems.  There is a sense of competition between constituency AMs and regional list AMs.  These tensions are exacerbated by the fact that the Labour Party has many more constituency AMs than the other parties, and the other parties have considerably more regional AMs than Labour.\n&#xa0;\nERS Cymru does appreciate the frustration of constituency AMs in this regard.  However, under the Government of Wales Act all Assembly Members are, regardless of mandate, equal.  Regional AMs are just as legitimate representatives of their region as constituency members are of their constituency. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHowever, whatever one’s views on these issues, it is clear that a ban on dual candidacy does nothing to resolve this problem – regional AMs can still target particular constituencies.  \nERS Cymru would argue that the only effective way to deal with problem is to elect all Assembly Members \nunder the same mandate\n.  An element of proportionality is part of the devolved settlement, which is why electing all Assembly Members using FPTP would not be, politically realistic, or in ERS Cymru’s view desirable.  A proportional system, the Single Transferable Vote, as used to elect the Northern Ireland Assembly and as recommended by the Richard Commission, should therefore be adopted for National Assembly elections.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;International precedent&#xa0;\nInternational comparisons have been used, by proponents and opponents of the ban; and the \nindependent \nevidence \noverwhelmingly \nsupports the position that a ban on dual candidacy is anomalous.\n&#xa0;\nIt is important to make the distinction between two voting systems, which often get conflated in this debate.  In Wales, like Scotland, Germany and New Zealand the Additional Member System, also known as the Multi Member Proportional System is used.  Under this system, the allocation of ‘additional members’ (i.e. list members) is decided using a formula based on the number of constituency seats won by individual parties.\n Its aim is to compensate for the vast distortions that can happen under FPTP, and so to allow fair representation of parties.\n \n&#xa0;\nT\nhe Multi Member Majoritarian (MMM) System\n has been conflated in the debate on dual candidacy with AMS/MMP \n.  Like AMS/MMP, MMM returns members via constituencies and lists, but unlike AMS/MMP, MMM does not allocat\ne \n‘additional members’ using a formula based on the number of constituency seats won by individual parties.\n It does not compensate for the distortion of FPTP, but is used only to elect candidates on a different mandate at the same election. Since it does not use a formula (such as d’Hondt) linked to the FPTP, it is not bring an element of proportionality, \nand hence\n why it is ‘majoritarian’. As such, the rationale for using the system is different to that of AMS/MMP.\n  \n&#xa0;\nThe Electoral Commission noted in 2006, that around 30 other countries use AMS a\ncross \nthe world, and none ban dual candidacy.  The then Secretary of State for Wales and First Minister argued that dual candidacy has proved ‘controversial in many other jurisdictions’ where bans were under consideration.  T\nw\no notable examples are New Zealand and New Brunswick in Canada; however in both jurisdictions independent inquiries ultimately rejected dual candidacy bans.\n&#xa0;\nThe then First Minister cited further, examples of ‘dual candidacy bans’ in Thailand, Mexico and Japan.  However all three countries use the Multi Member Majoritarian system not the AMS/MMP system used in Wales.  Further, in Thailand at least, the reasons for the ban differ considerabl\ny\n than the arguments for a ban in Wales.  The expectation in Thailand is that ‘professionals’ would contest the list and become ministers, whereas constituency members would concentrate on legislative matters.  In Mexico the balance between list members and constituency members differs enormously to Wales.  In Mexico the number of elected members per regional list is 40, 10 times the size of Welsh regional lists.  \n&#xa0;A review by the New Zealand Electoral Commission is probably the most rigorous and robust analysis of how the AMS/MMP system works, following a period of controversies around the mechanics of the system since its inception in 1993. On the issue of dual candidacy, the report’s recommendation was unambiguous – ‘candidates should continue to be able to stand both for an electorate seat and be on the party list’.\n \n&#xa0;\nAmong the reasons for not supporting a ban were: it is important\n that regional representatives should have equal status\n, and that a ban \non \ndual candidacy would, in effect, place a primacy on local\n against wider representation\n; to ensure that good candidates be elected; \nand \nto ensure a be\nt\nter elections \ncampaign for voter \nby ensuring that good candidates were not discouraged from standing in marginal or unwinnable seats\n and so in a position to convey their message to the public.\n&#xa0;              The experience of Scotland&#xa0;\nThe most relevant comparison for Wales is Scotland.  There, the Arbuthnott Commission\n’s report \nPutting Citizens First: Boundaries, \nVoting and Representation in Scotland\n \nassessed the issue of dual candidacy, and concluded:\n&#xa0;\n“While we acknowledge that there is some misunderstanding about this aspect of the mixed member system, we have serious concerns about the impact such a ban would have.  As the Commission on the Powers and Electoral Arrangements of the National Assembly for Wales (Richard Commission) noted, it may encourage parties, particularly small ones, not to field candidates in constituency seats, where they would be more likely to be elected.  This could have a negative impact on the quality of constituency contests and unduly favour incumbent candidates.  Barring dual candidacy could also create tensions between constituency and regional candidates with the same party, since the chances of a regional candidate being elected would be enhances when candidates from his or her party perform poorly in the constituency election.  It might therefore be in the interests of regional candidate of any party to see colleagues lose constituency elections.\n&#xa0;\n“\nDual candidacy is a common and accepted feature of mixed member proportional systems across the world – indeed, in some cases candidates are expressly required to stand in both contests.\n&#xa0;\n“The Commission believes that preventing dual candidacy would be undemocratic and agrees that it would place ‘an unnecessary restriction on the democratic rights of potential candidates, parties and local electors to have as unrestricted a choice as possible in an election.\n&#xa0;\n“The Commission has put the interests of the constituent at the centre of our concerns and we would not favour any action which would have a negative impact on these”.\n&#xa0;\nArbuthnott’s ‘alternative solution’ was to advocate open regional lists which would enable the voter to exercise control over who is elected at both the constituency and regional leve\nl, and give regional AMs a clearer personal mandate.\n \nIf the AMS \nsystem\n is to be retained, ERS\n Cymru\n agrees with this position. \nThe ERS agrees with the position that a ban on dual candidacy impinges on the choice available to voters, makes it less likely that the best candidates will get elected. As a consequence, it is likely to have an effect on the quality of Welsh election campaigns and for effective scrutiny in the National Assembly for Wales.&#xa0;January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nReport of the Electoral Commission on the Review of the MMP Voting System 2012 (NZ Electoral Commission: 2012), p 37-41\n"
