"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Green Lanes Protection Group – Further written evidence&#xa0;\nDeregulation Bill - Clauses 12-19&#xa0;\nI wrote on 27 Aug in support of the GLEAM proposal regarding TRO appeal rights.  I wish to add to that.  \n&#xa0;\nI live in Hampshire and have extensive experience of rights of way work there. Hampshire CC is notoriously slow to impose TROs, and in many cases chooses to repair at public expense in preference to preventing the damage in the first place.  A check on HCC's website as to TROs reveals that the Policy has not been reviewed since 2007.  The Policy itself focuses on the core statement: \n\"\nThe response to a problem or a potential problem should always be the least restrictive necessary\"\n and there is no mention in the Policy of conflict between users.  Where damage is caused, the response is to be a Voluntary Restraint (VR) agreement and only if that does not work is a TRO considered - too late.  VRs are normally of very limited benefit given that the body concerned has little control even over its own members, let alone members of other bodies and off-roaders who do not subscribe to any organisation.\n&#xa0;\nHCC also publishes \"Policy Statements\" but these do not appear to be authorised by Committee, and the reason for issuing these separately is not explained.  The Statements do mention user conflict, which begs the question as to why that factor does not appear in the Policy itself.\n&#xa0;\nIt is conflicts like this which demonstrate so clearly the need for an appeal system when such discrepancies can be examined.\n&#xa0;\nGraham \nPlumbe\nVice Chairman\n&#xa0;\n28 August 201\n3\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
