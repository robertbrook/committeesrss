\nThe Chairman: \nWe are in a rather bigger room than usual and you look rather a long way away.  I hope that does not make any difference to the way we conduct ourselves.  Let me first of all say I am not the Chairman of the Committee, \nal\nthough some will remember that for many years I was.  Lord MacGregor is away today so I have been asked to take the Chair instead.  I know the familiar faces down there and you know the routine very well.  We are delighted to see you\n, \nMr Haskew, Ms Barbour and Mr Roy-Chowdhury.  I do not know whether you want to make an opening statement, or do we g\no straight into the questions?\nFrank Haskew: Straight into the questions.\nThe Chairman: If I should be the one to start, then, have you been able to review the report on partnerships published recently by the Office of Tax Simplification?  If so, can you give us your initial reactions to that?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I have been on the OTS panel looking at partnerships, so I will start with a preamble.  I looked at the draft in a lot of detail, and I \nhave \nprobably not been through \nthe final version \nin as much detail as I would like.  \nACCA\n, as an organisation, will make a separate submission.  A lot of work has gone into the report.  As it says on page 13, there have been 50 meetings around the country.  Various groups have been consulted.  It is an interim report and has been categorised into quick fixes, medium-term and long-term.  \nIn \nthe \nlong-term\n category\n, and I know we will come on to this later on, I would be very keen to see the LLP legislation incorporated in.  We would perhaps look at a much more holistic report at the end of the day on partnerships.  One of the problems \nthat \nwe had in the OTS committee is that the LLP draft legislation only came out \nwhen \nthe final report was about to be produced.  I know it says in the interim report that it was not within \nits \nremit, but it could not have been in \nits \nremit because the legislation was not available at the time.  That is something we probably need to pan\n \nout and look at more later on.  \nIn terms of the timetable, the OTS is going to be looking \nat other aspects \nof partnership\n \nlate\nr this year\n, if it is allowed to continue.  \nT\nhere is an election next year, so we are probably looking at legislation\n \nin 2016\n \nat the earliest\n.  Within that time, we probably have enough time to look at the current proposals on LLPs, et cetera.\nFrank Haskew: I very much concur with what\n Chas has just said.  As you know, the OTS report came out \nat \npretty much the same time.  Our initial view is that the OTS, as \nit has \nconsistently done, \nhas\n made some very telling, useful and helpful contributions about the way the tax system can be simplified.  It could be seen \nas their being \nlet down somewhat by the fact that we have \ng\novernment policy going on in parallel, at the same time.  It makes it very difficult when you have almost a twin-track approach.  Really, we need to bring it all together and have one consistent approach.\nCharlotte Barbour: ICAS is in a similar position\n.  We worked\n with John Whiting.  He came to meet a lot of our members and we were really pleased with the conversations.  They were robust; they were interesting.  A lot of our members\n’ concerns\n have come into the OTS report.  We are really pleased to see that.  In the short term, that may be refocusing HMRC activities and how we support partnerships.  To remember they are not the forgotten partner would be helpful.  In policy terms, it would be nice to see a bigger picture, and we concur \non \ndoing everything collectively in one place, rather than piecemeal.\nQ44 &#xa0; \nLord Rowe-Beddoe: The draft legislation does not impose the general partnership law tests to determine whether a member of an LLP is a partner or an employee for tax purposes.  It said \nthat \nit produces some detailed mechanical tests.  Could it not have been simpler, is the question, and more coherent to have extended the general partnership law rules to LLPs?  Why did you think the Government chose not to?\nFrank Haskew: That is quite an interesting question.  I do not think it is very clear why they went down that route.  The original May 2013 consultation effectively talked about using the existing tests.  Somewhere along the line, it seems as though that view was changed in favour of these totally different tests.  We would still question whether the fundamental basis\n for the way the Government have \napproached this is correct.  Section 4.4 of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act talk\ns\n in terms of a member of an LLP being treated as a partner.  It then go\nes\n on to say\n that \nif they were treated as an employee under the existing partnership rules, that would still apply.  On the face of it, you would say \nthat \nthe LLP rules and the existing partnership rules are pretty much coherent, and I still do not think we have had a satisfactory answer as to why it seems \nthat \nthat is not regarded as the case.  \nCharlotte Barbour: There certainly has not been any kind of discussion of it.  It was mentioned briefly in the initial consultation paper last May.  It discussed, much as Frank has, the differences between partnership and limited liability partnership, and that members of an LLP should be treated as a partner.  I suppose the only difference there is that you do have limited liability.  My reading of it is that perhaps\n \ndraft\ning\n the tests of what is or is not an employee or disguised employee is quite difficult, allowing for the limited liability.  \nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I fully agree with Frank and Charlotte.  One of the key reasons, I guess, behind why we have the three tests is to create no requirement for clearance, uncertainty or ambiguity for self-assessment purposes.  So, yes, it probably helps the HMRC and the Treasury, but at the same time it seems as though the Treasury thought of these tests outside the consultation.  They did not appear anywhere in the consultation.  Looking at the consultation again for the purposes of today, the three tests appeared from left field.  I am not sure other than for certainty why these tests appeared, or how they were devised.\nLord Rowe-Beddoe: Is it right that the original policy aim was to place members of LLPs in the same position for tax purposes as a partner in a general partnership?  Would you agree with that?\nCharlotte Barbour: Yes.\nFrank Haskew: I think \nS\nection 4.4 of the LLP Act makes it quite clear that that was the policy intentio\nn.\nLord Rowe-Beddoe: So why do you think the legislation that was introduced in 2000 did not achieve the then\n \nstated policy objective of aligning the tax treatment of LLPs with general partnerships?\nCharlotte Barbour: It would probably be our view that it did, and that perhaps things have moved on.  Back in 2000, it did work.  Some partnerships became LLPs\n, \nthose that were partners became members\n, \ntaxation rolled on with limited liability for the bigger firms, and that worked well enough.  Over the process of the last maybe 14 years, various factors all combine to make national insurance more expensive\n, such as \nemployee rights\n and \nperhaps auto\n&#x2011;\nenrolment.  Employees are quite expensive, and perhaps that is the driver.\nLord Rowe-Beddoe: Has the option of realigning with general partnerships been sufficiently explored, and has it been sufficiently explored clearly with the Government?\nFrank Haskew: Our answer to that would be that the initial consultation document back in May was very much along those lines.  \nC\nlearly a lot of submissions \nwere \nmade to that.  However, we took the view that we should work with what we had\n. W\ne should work as best we could within the existing rules, which at least have the benefit of having been with us for many years.  It seems, somewhere along the line, \nthat \na decision was made to change that, but I do not think that was really communicated very properly and a detailed case made as to why these new tests had been devised.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I would go back to what I said earlier about the OTS.  We need to defer this legislation coming into effect retrospectively from April before the legislation is even enacted in July, or whenever the Finance Bill passes to become the Finance Act.  Let us actually look at these tests\n. L\net us actually look at the proposals for LLPs and come back to them fully under the OTS umbrella, rather than just dealing \npiecemeal \nwith partnerships the way that this has.  It creates a lot of uncertainty\n and \na lot of administrative burdens, which we will go on\n \nto in the next question.  It is something \nthat \nwe could do in a much better way, rather than the way that is being proposed at the moment.\nQ45 &#xa0; \nLord Leigh of Hurley: I wanted to look at the detailed tests to determine whether an LLP member should be treated as an employee for tax purposes.  I have read them with care.  I would be very interested in your views on how you think they might or might not work in practice.  Condition C \nin particular \nis troubling me, but I would be interested to see how you would see \nit working in practice.\nFrank Haskew: We are equally struggling with them, I think it is fair to say.  As you say, we have this three-part test.\n  You run into trouble straight\naway where you have words like “reasonable to expect”\n, and you \nget to Condition B, where a person needs significant influence.  That may not be the case in a large partnership with individual offices, where profit-sharing arrangements may be by office rather than the wider partnership.  Even before you get to C, you get into trouble with Condition B, for instance.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: It is very difficult to fulfil.  Whoever thought up these tests do\nes\n not seem to understand how partnerships, say accountancy practices across different jurisdictions, across different countries, come together and how you would have to change the partnership agreements to be able to fall within these tests.  \nThey do \nnot seem to properly understand commercial reality and how businesses operate in partnerships.  \nThey are \ntrying to hit a tax\n \navoidance nail on the head and missing, and then using a sledgehammer to do that.\nCharlotte Barbour: Anecdotally, we have had a lot of feedback from our members, and all of them seem to be considering their partnership agreements and worrying about it.  There certainly seems to be quite a bit of feedback from members that they are concerned about the tests as well.  We are all sitting here looking at tests that are not that easy to get to the bottom of, quickly and easily.  Again, relying on guidance is questionable\n,\n too, for a statutory test.\nLord Leigh of Hurley: Are you seeing people in practice restructuring their partnership agreements?\nCharlotte Barbour: Our members are coming back to us and saying \nthat \nthey are looking at it.  I do not know if they have actually done it yet.  Of course, they are concerned too, as April is not far away, and in a big business—\nFrank Haskew: The draft legislation was only published on 10 December.  We have had Christmas.  The tax-return season, January, is an extremely busy period for professional partnerships, so with the best will in the world we effectively have two months now to try to implement legislation that is actually quite difficult.  When you look at the anti\n&#x2011;\navoidance provisions, I think in 863(c), you have some very difficult provisions to apply.  On the face of it, anything you do to get you out, you ignore.  \nThe \nHMRC guidance then goes on to give examples where clearly they take the view that normal arrangements will not be caught.  That is very helpful and welcome, but it is all in guidance.\nLord Leigh of Hurley: Yes.  Again in practice, when your members and your clients are trying to determine who is a partner and employee, have you seen similar tests, and in particular capital contribution tests, as being a fundamental part of their decision\n&#x2011;\nmaking process as to whether or not people are equity partners, as far as they are concerned?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: That is going to happen after this month.  A lot of partnerships, especially a lot of ACCA members, \nhave \nprobably not even woken up to some of the problems \nthat \nthey have.  So after the tax return season is over I think they will be getting down to looking at these things.  As we have said in our submission, we have a situation where somebody might be an employee under this legislation and have to pay national insurance, but they would not be an employee under employment law.  All round, there seems to be a greater complexity and things that have not been properly thought through.\nQ46 &#xa0; \nLord Joffe: In relation to partnerships with mixed membership, the policy objective of the draft legislation is to prevent the tax\n&#x2011;\nmotivated allocation of profits and losses.  To what extent does this happen in practice, and are their bona-fide commercial arrangements likely to be \na\nffected?\nFrank Haskew: Again, we are seeing more evidence of mixed-partnership structures coming through.  That has certainly been feedback that we have been getting over the years.  The fact is that people are responding to the changing business environment here.  LLPs have been with us now for some years.  We have a large disparity between income-tax rates, and particularly marginal income-tax rates.  If you are just over £100,000, your marginal income\n&#x2011;\ntax rate, including national insurance, is potentially 62%.  That compares to a corporation\n \ntax rate that will be 20%.  So there are huge distortions within the tax system.  \nWe are increasingly seeing, obviously, people looking to take advantage of lower rates because of commercial reasons, such as wanting to retain working capital.  We do know that there are a lot of existing mixed partnerships that historically have had corporate partners within them.  Our initial view is that there are a lot of arrangements out there, but a lot of this is fairly normal, conventional tax planning.\nCharlotte Barbour: I thought \nthat \nsome of the OTS statistics were helpful and useful on this, because we did not have much of a handle on it.  In family businesses, rural and estate\n&#x2011;\ntype businesses where you may have three generation businesses, there are bigger structures to accommodate farms, \nthe \nbits and pieces that they do, \nand the \ndifferent commercial operations within a family business.  In the professional world, by way of numbers, it is only in the last three or four years that our institutes have changed the rules to allow mixed groups.  \nN\not that many partnerships are mixed partnerships with corporate.  There are more, and they are becoming more common.  It is one of the reasons \nwhy \nthe rules were changed.  They are definitely in a small minority at the moment.\nLord Joffe: The second part of the question was what commercial arrangements are likely to be \na\nffected\n.\n  Could we have a few examples, perhaps putting aside Scottish agricultural properties?\nCharlotte Barbour: Why would we do that, now?\nLord Joffe: It is fairly limiting.\nCharlotte Barbour: Family businesses perhaps are in a similar position.  You might have had a business that started as unincorporated\n and \nstayed as unincorporated.  It may have been set up with one young member of the family to do a particular venture\n,\n and you might want to limit your liability there, so you would perhaps park that in a separate company.  That might be an instance where you end up with a mixed group.  That is a possibility.  Also, in family businesses your succession planning can be important, \nso \ncoming down the generations you might want to stay unincorporated rather than incorporated.\nFrank Haskew: What \nCharlotte\n has said is entirely right.  It is important to remember that in recent years incorporation has become very much the vehicle of choice.  Perhaps 20 or 30 years ago, people did not tend to set up companies, certainly at family level, because of all sorts of reasons, not just tax but others as well.  The environment has become very much more favourable towards companies in policy terms in the last 20 years, not just in tax, but in terms of company law and reporting. It is much easier now to use corporate vehicles within larger structures in a way that 20 years ago it was not.\nCharlotte Barbour: A lot of policy has driven people towards incorporating.  The tax rates are a good example of that.\nLord Joffe: Why, if the solution is corporate, is it necessary to change the law in relation to non\n&#x2011;\ncorporates?\nCharlotte Barbour: That assumes that you think it is appropriate, and that everybody should want to have their vehicles driven by tax into a corporate.  About 10% of business\nes\n are still unincorporated in partnerships.  There are sole traders.  It is a moot point as to whether you should start out as a corporate in the first instance.  If somebody came for advice, you would probably say, “Start up as a sole trader\n, \nstart up in a smallish partnership\n, \nsee how things go\n, \nmove onwards”\n.\n  It is a much more flexible means of doing business.\nThe Chairman: There was evidence previously from people who said to us, “A lot of the smaller businesses ought to be companies rather than partnerships, because that has more flexibility\n”.\n These proposals will increase that tendency, will they not?\nFrank Haskew: That is likely.  It is rather strange that at the same time we have all this\n legislation, the Government have\n asked the OTS to undertake a review of the competitiveness of the UK tax system with a view to making recommendations about how it can be improved.  What we are seeing on the LLPs and structuring is a reasonable use of LLPs in a competitive environment.  It seems rather odd that we have a review of competitiveness going on but at the same time we seem to be clobbering LLPs and mixed partnerships in this way.  On the face of it, they are undertaking transactions in a commercial way that you might say is fairly reasonable.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: The OTS interim report says that LLPs are not there as a tax\n&#x2011;\navoidance measure, by and large.  It is something that has been examined.  When we talk about partnerships, we are talking about £150 billion in the \nUK\n economy.  It is quite a significant amount.  We need to be very careful about what we are doing\n when we \nchang\ne\n the rules and the law \nin the \nvery piecemeal way \nthat \nit seems \nhas been done \nhere, which is going to impact a lot of LLPs and partnerships\n directly\n.\nQ47 &#xa0; \nLord Joffe: One of the reasons \nwhy \nthat has been advanced is\n that \nthere is a move to change the law to allow LLPs to retain capital, one of the consequences of which would be to pay tax at a lower rate.  Now, I wonder why there \nshould \nbe a tax incentive to companies or LLPs to retain profits when they can retain profits in any event at the normal rate of taxation\n.\n  Why should there be an additional incentive?  What is the justification?\nFrank Haskew: Since the previous Government, we have seen a move to encourage the use of companies.  The previous Government and this Government have always been keen to encourage growth and to retain and reinvest as a fundamental policy.  We saw that with the last Government\n and the \nzero rate of corporation tax.  So there is a policy to try to encourage people to retain earnings.  A mixed partnership is one way of achieving that but within a wider LLP.\nCharlotte Barbour: A mixed partnership allows you to use the corporate member to retain profits.  That is no different from if you had totally incorporated your whole business.  It allows you to use the legislation in a different way but to achieve the same result.  I do not think you should differentiate between the two.  To me, it is a perfectly sensible proposition that you could retain capital for working capital to reinvest.  Of course, the other thing with mixed partnerships is that they do not always get access to some things that companies have, so that is another reason for allowing them to retain it as working capital.  As and when money comes out into the hands of the individual owners, they are still going to be paying inco\nme tax at whatever their income-\ntax rates are.  It is purely to allow reinvestment, which is one aspect of policy.\nQ48 &#xa0; \nLord Bilimoria: I have declared all my interests, including being a Fellow of the \nInstitute\n of \nChartered Accountants\n in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n.  May I build on some of the points you have just made with regard to competitiveness of the \nUK\n tax system?  \nT\nhe blunt question is \nwhether \nthese changes \nthat are \nbeing proposed \nare \ngoing to make us\n \nmore competitive or less competitive\n.\n  Secondly, the \nInstitute\n of \nChartered Accountants\n in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n has this excellent list of 10 tenets for a b\netter tax system, which include\n competitiveness.  How many of these 10 tenets do you think this new proposal ticks?\nFrank Haskew: Not very many would be a short answer to that.  To give you a longer answer, these rules are not competitive.  We do seem to have a bit of a dysfunction here between a Government keen to encourage competitiveness and encouraging the OTS to look at the tax system in that regard, and provisions such as we are talking about at the moment.  Administratively, trying to comply with this is going to be very, very difficult.  Every year, you are going to have to look at these three-part tests to see whether you are complying with them.  That is not a very competitive tax system, because the costs of trying to administer it and deal with it for both taxpayers and HMRC are going to be quite substantial.  We have a problem with the costs of these measures being anti\n&#x2011;\ncompetitive.  \nGoing back to the 10 tenets, I am delighted that you have them there.  Certainly competitiveness is one of them, but it is one of 10.  While we have not looked at these provisions against our 10 tenets, I can pretty much put my hand on my heart and say \nthat \nI do not think\n they\n are \nactually \nvery simple.  They are certainly not very certain.  By and large, the provisions do not really match up to our 10 tenets.\nCharlotte Barbour: One of the areas where we would have a question mark over competitiveness is\n that \nif you have income tax and corporation tax at significantly different rates, whether we like it or not it is going to become part of a driver of what you do.  Your competitiveness should not be driven by that.\nLord Bilimoria: It is not our remit to question the tax rates, but you have made a very valid point there.\nCharlotte Barbour: It is not really \nabout \nrates.  It is more \nabout \npolicy as to whether you want them \nto be \nso different.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: It is also \nabout \nnational insurance.  That is really what the legislation is all about, as well.  There is a big disparity between the self-employed rate and the employee rate, which is driving this.  We need to be very careful, in terms of \nUK\n competitiveness, where we are going.  Just to redress the balance, the ACCA published 12 tenets of taxation about four years ago, which is available on the ACCA website.  We have circulated it to this Committee in the past and would be very happy to do so again.\nLord Bilimoria: May I just ask another very simple question, based on what you just said?  Do you think on the whole\n that\n people create LLPs for the protection of the limited liability or for tax reasons?  Do these new rules change that?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I think quite honestly \nthat \nthey create them first of all for limited\n&#x2011;\nliability and \n“\nif\n \nthey\n \nfall\n \nout\n \nwith\n \ntheir\n \npartners\n”\n reasons.  They are an evolution of the partnerships that probably existed previously with unlimited liability, and they then formed LLPs.  Tax cannot be ignored, but I think \nthat \nthe main driver really \nis \nnot tax but the commercial-liability issue.  As I say, the OTS report accepts that \nthat \nis the main driver behind LLPs.\nFrank Haskew: LLPs were introduced entirely for commercial reasons.  They are a valuable extra way of operating a business in the \nUK\n, alongside companies and traditional partnerships.  The danger is that these provisions will potentially put people off using LLPs, which would seem anti\n&#x2011;\ncompetitive.  You want to adopt whatever business structure is the most appropriate for your needs.  LLPs should not necessarily be disadvantaged.  We have been approached by another \ngovernment department \nin the last month or so to say LLPs are disadvantaged as compared to companies\n, and \ndoes that\n not \nneed\n t\no be addressed?  The answer is that \nit is going to get worse if we have these rules coming through.\nQ49 &#xa0; \nLord Leigh of Hurley:\n Can I just re\n&#x2011;\ndeclare my interests, \nwhich I declared the \nfirst time, which\n include being a member of the j\nunior \ni\nnstitute to the Scottish \ni\nnstitute?  I understand your remarks in respect of the partnerships that moved to LLP\n, and that \nmost of your members will be in that position.  Just re\n&#x2011;\naddressing Lord Bilimoria’s question again, does that apply to organisations that were not partnerships and became \nan \nLLP, or indeed started off life and became LLPs?  Obviously, limited companies come in.  Would your comments apply in those circumstances?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: Yes.  We must recognise that tax is an issue.  However, the primary reason why they wanted to form a partnership rather than a limited company was because of the liability issue.  Yes, you have the same kind of protections within a limited company, but you do not have the same kind of flexibilities perhaps.  Certainly, things have moved on in terms of corporation tax, et cetera\n, b\nut LLPs were really there for liability reasons.  That is why people went into those, rather than for tax savings.\nLord Leigh of Hurley:\n But a limited company does that as well.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: Yes, but if you are in an accountancy practice, or a law practice, you would normally set up as a partnership rather than going to limited company.  Maybe that needs to change, but that is the way it has been inherited in our profession.\nFrank Haskew: Once upon a time, you were not allowed to operate, for instance, as a chartered accountant through a company.  That has changed\n,\n but the rules are still quite difficult to get within, so it is still normal that our members tend to operate through LLPs or partnerships.\nLord Leigh of Hurley:  Forgive me\n, \nI am specifically addressing organisations that are not necessarily your members and that are not necessarily accountancy or legal partnerships but that have chosen to become LLPs for reasons that we are trying to understand.\nCharlotte Barbour: \nIt \nwould be quite interesting to take up\n,\n \nperhaps \nin further work with the OTS\n, the matter of \nhow many relatively recent non-professional LLPs have taken up.  I quite accept that there could be some \non the \nfringes of the low-paid and the highest-paid \nthat\n have gone into it in order to get the benefits of, say, self-employment.  I appreciate that that is a possibility.  I am not aware of any number work that has been done around that, and it would be helpful to try to quantify that before we bring in these rules, which, from our members’ feedback, seem to have a much wider impact than we would expect to target the evil, if it is there.\nQ50 &#xa0; \n \nThe Chairman: Apart from the measures \nthat \nwe have been discussing, the draft \nB\nill also includes proposals affecting alternative investment fund managers and countering the practice of reducing tax liabilities by transferring assets or income streams within a partnership.  None of your written submissions had much to say on these measures.  Are we entitled to read it that you broadly agree with them?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I think you have probably singled out the ACCA submissions, where we thought there could be double taxation.  Where we are coming from is that\n \nin \nSection 863(e)(iv)(d) \nin \nS\nchedule 1, where the remuneration has been allocated to a specific partner, that partner has to pay, under \nparagraph \n(iv)(d), a tax\n charge at the additional rate: \ni.e. 45%.  If you like, that payment of 45% is made, and we are not entirely clear \nwhether \nit is held in a pool within the partnership or given to HMRC.  If it is given to HMRC, we appreciate that under \nparagraph \n(v) of that section, there is not meant to be an additional charge subsequently on those profits\n,\n but from what we can see, if that allocation of profit does not vest with the partner it was originally allocated to, there does not seem to be a mechanism by which that partner could be refunded tax from HMRC, if that is where the tax ends up.  We are just flagging up that there seems to be perhaps, without sufficient information here, \nthe \npossibility of double tax.\nCharlotte Barbour: We have not commented on this particular part because we have not had a lot of member feedback on it.  I would not take from that that we are either in favour or not in favour.  We are ducking.\nThe Chairman: I added that little bit on the end\n,\n but perhaps I should not have done.  \nLord Bilimoria: To build on what you have just asked, Chairman, Mr Roy-Chowdhury, you just mentioned \nthat \nyour submission concludes that in some circumstances these AIFM partnerships would\n in effect\n be subject to double taxation.  Could you just talk further about that, please?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I discuss\ned\n with Bill yesterday whether this is too complex to bring to the Committee today, and he said that this is exactly the sort of thing that we should be bringing here.  The situation is that if you have an allocation of profits under this type of partnership, under \nSection 863(e)(iv)\n you are taxed at the time of the allocation and you are taxed at the additional rate\n, which \nat the moment is 45%.  \nW\ne would envisage\n that that \nhas to be paid across to HMRC, but we accept that without clarification it might be pooled within the partnership itself and then paid across subsequently, in which case some of our concerns about double taxation would disappear.  If it is paid across to HMRC, however, it then says, under \nparagraph \n(v)\n below that, that HMRC will not double tax the profits.  However, there does not seem to be a mechanism for this example.  Partner A has the profits provisionally allocated\n,\n and therefore has to suffer the 45% tax, but he does not fulfil the requirements where the profits vest with Partner A.  If Partner A does not then get the £100 of profit, say, and he has already paid £45 tax, that profit goes back into a pool and to another partner or a number of partners.  What then happens \nto \nthe tax?  Is it repaid back to Partner A if it has gone to HMRC, or is it purely ignored and is \nthe \npool of profits \nthat is \ngoing to Partners B, C and D taxed again?  Is that double taxed\n,\n or how is \nparagraph \n(v) going to be applied so that double tax does not occur?\nThe Chairman: I would ask you to answer that question.  I think we will move in a minute to the new approach, and I am going to ask Baroness Drake to start that, but has anybody got any question on the stages we have reached so far?\nQ51 &#xa0; \n \nLord Bilimoria: If I could just build on this, the other \npoint \nis that AIFM proposals emerged from the consultation that HMRC had on profit and loss allocation for mixed-membership partnerships.  How much additional yield does this produce?\nFrank Haskew: It is substantial.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: Yes, quite a lot, according to the impact assessment.\nFrank Haskew: It is about half a billion pounds, I think, according to the impact assessment.  I just need to find it.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: \nPartnerships: A Review of Two Aspects of Tax Rules\n does not give numbers, \nbut the proposed revisions that they are looking at in the current year are very low\n: £\n125 million in \n20\n14-15\n, \nbut £1.45 billion in 2015-16.  It then seems to stabilise above £600 million, but we are not entirely sure where these numbers come from.\nFrank Haskew: If you look at the figures, the second row is the extra that will \ncome\n from these measures.  In 2015-16, that is £680 million, and you get to over £1 billion when you add in the original measures on the mixed partnerships.  \nW\ne are talking potentially\n about more than \n£\n1 billion here from these measures, so \nas you can see it is a substantial revenue \nraiser.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: That is part of the reason why\n we ask whether some of this is\n double taxation that has been factored in.  I suspect \nthat \nis not the intention, so we are just wondering where it is coming from.\nLord Leigh of Hurley: Can I just ask you to clarify?  You understandably stated that the ABC questions were too rigorous, difficult and mechanical and had administrative problems to implement.  Are you saying that they should not be implemented\n for that reason? We have seen \nevidence that, for example\n,\n about 20,000 fruit pickers \nare \nall partners, \nso are you saying that \nthere should be some sort of tests but that these are the wrong tests\n, \nor are you just saying that there should be \nno \ntests?\nFrank Haskew: Bearing in mind \nthat \nwe have only seen these tests since 10 December, and \nthat \nwe are going to have to implement them by 6 April, \nin effect, \nwe are saying that this is potentially extremely difficult territory.  We have the OTS also looking at a review of partnerships.  We think that there needs to be more time for this.  Going back to your figure of 20,000, we do not have any experience of partnerships that large.  That is huge and that is not our experience.\nCharlotte Barbour: It does not feel like a partnership, somehow, does it?\nFrank Haskew: It does not.\nLord Leigh of Hurley: For tax, however, it may be.\nThe Chairman: If the Inland Revenue \nhas \nexamples of that, \nis it \nright t\no want to do something about it?\nCharlotte Barbour: Yes.\nFrank Haskew: Precisely, but that is not our experience of the LLP rules.  Just going back to the position, we are not against what the HMRC and Government are necessarily trying to do in policy terms, but we need some rules that are workable, simple\n,\n certain to implement, and not too anti-competitive for the UK.  We think that we need a bit more time to do that.\nCharlotte Barbour: In our first submission following on from the May consultation last summer, we understand that if there is an issue with the extremes of LLP usage, there should be targeted anti-avoidance legislation, and that is \nunderstandable.  The proposed A to \nC tests are quite hard to work with.  We have not had a lot of time to look at them.  There is not a lot of time between now and April.  When you combine that with, say, the work that the OTS is doing, the ideal situation perhaps might be to have these wrapped up back into the OTS work or a wider version of that work, and to look at it in the round before we just bring in these anti-avoidance measures and then think, “Oh, heck, what have we done?”\n.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: At the very least, do not bring them in retrospectively in April, because we do not even know what the legislation will be, ultimately, in July.  We had the same situation for GAAR—the \ngeneral anti-abuse rule\n—and that was then changed to vesting.  At least that would be the logical time to bring it in if it is to come in this year, but ideally let us think about what we are doing.  None of these three tests \nwas \nput out for consultation\n. They \njust came totally from left field.  I just do not understand where they came from, other than some ideas within \nthe \nTreasury \nthat \nwere then not properly tested.\nLord Bilimoria: You just mentioned GAAR.  Some commentators have said\n \nthat this transfer of assets and income streams could have been better tackled through GAAR.  What would you think of that suggestion?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I have seen that, and one of \nmy \nconcerns about GAAR is that we need to keep it at the extreme\n,\n abusive\n,\n end.  I would probably counsel against that, because I think we can get something to work better within the LLP legislation.  In terms of the LLP legislation\n itself, if the Government feel that\n there are abuses, we need to deal with that rather than going through this mechanistic test.  We need to look at that rather than just having a plaster of GAAR over that.  One of the problems we would consider to be an issue is if GAAR then starts mission-creeping down to be\ning\n general rather than at the abusive end.  That is why I would probably counsel against using GAAR but get the LLP legislation properly worked through and worked out.\nFrank Haskew: I would entirely agree with that.  Part 4 is clearly aimed at abusive situations, so it is quite right and proper that \nthe \nGovernment should be looking to counter what seems to be an abusive use of LLPs.  Chas is right that we should not be looking to necessarily use GAAR to tackle that sort of thing.  They probably have the right approach with that.\nBaroness Drake: Could I just ask a question on the AIFM point?  It comes back to your express concern about the risk of double taxation, where retained profits are taxed and then not subsequently vest\ned\n back to the individual partner.  I am assuming that that is the issue that you are concerned about.  Are the Government’s proposals in part constrained by the requirements of the AIFM directive, where, as I understand it, there still has to be a tax charge on profits that are deferred, even if the partner cannot access them?  I thought that was a requirement of the directive\n,\n and therefore to some extent HMRC is constrained by having to meet the terms of that directive.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: Yes.  We do not have an issue about the tax charge.  It is a matter of making sure that the tax then goes back.  The tax overall is 45\n%\n on that \n£\n100 of profit rather than perhaps being 45\n%\n and then the tax being charged again, where it vests with another partner.  In \nparagraph \n(v), it is quite clear that that is not the intention, but we would just like more detail to make sure that that is the case.\nBaroness Drake: You think there is a need for clarification of the Government’s response, because presumably they want to discourage people using corporate partners in order to address the directive issues.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: Yes.\nQ52 &#xa0; \nBaroness Drake: May we get your views on the new approach to tax \npolicy-making\n using, again, the proposals relating to salaried members of LLPs as an exemplar?  The gulf between some commentators and the Government on this seems to be growing.  Far from iterating back to a point of clearer consensus, the gap seems to be growing, particularly on these economic tests.  Is this a failure of the new \npolicy-making\n process?  Why do you think this is happening?  Is it a fundamental disagreement of opinion or a failure of the process?  What would you say?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: One of the issues \nthat \nwe have—and we have probably said quite a lot about the LLP proposals or draft clauses—is that the consultation said one thing and we have ended up with the proposals or draft clauses saying something else.  Clearly, there has been \na \ndisconnect between the consultation and what has now come out.  A lot of the tax \npolicy-making\n is vested within \nthe \nTreasury.  There are some very bright people in \nthe \nTreasury but there is not, perhaps, sufficient tax experience or knowledge there, and perhaps there is not sufficient tax challenge, as used to happen in the past, where HMRC would devise tax policy and there would be quite a lot of challenge from the Treasury.  I think we need to look at the way that policies are challenged within \nthe \nTreasury, because it does not seem as though it was done effectively.  We have other examples with the \nchild benefit that has co\nme out, which has been universally criticised. There have been a lot of policy issues in the way the final product is then put out in legislation, or the final product itself.  What is it trying to achieve\n,\n and why is it not trying to achieve it in a way that is less complex, to get to the root of the problem in an easier-to-implement way?  \nThat is where it has fallen down, and we need to go back to what we are trying to do.  We had a consultation, so let us look at the responses.  If we do not get responses back that are necessarily in tune with \ng\novernment policy, let us go back and do it again.  In some ways, \nwhile \nACCA\n was\n not in favour of GAAR and we are not in favour of GAAR, the consultation process \non GAAR \nwas very good.  I think the controlled foreign company consultation was very good.  There have been iterations and changes along the way, so that the final product has taken account of input, and that is really what we need to do.  Hopefully, part of the process \nthat \nwe are going through here will affect what finally comes through on LLPs as well.\nBaroness Drake: In your view, then, a weakness in the consultative process is the knowledge base on partnerships\n, \nparticular\nly\n contemporary developments in partnership.  This \nquestion \nis for the rest of the panel as well: how do you think the Government should correct that, if that is a valid perception?\nFrank Haskew: That is the emerging consensus from quite a lot of commentators, and \nthe \nGovernment need to recognise that what they have produced still needs further work and consideration, because I do not think \nthey have \ntaken \nfull \naccount of the real implementation difficulties, for a start, of what is on the table.  There has been a comment that it seems as though HMRC or HM Treasury do not understand what partnerships are about and how they operate commercially.  We need to recognise that and to look at these provisions again and do another consultation.  We seem to have gone from a consultation \nthat \nwas going down one track to suddenly\n \nsomething completely different, with no obvious linkage as to how they really got there, and I do not think that is very satisfactory.\nCharlotte Barbour: I\n thought that \nthe OTS report was quite informative, and perhaps partnerships have fallen somewhere down the middle as a poor man or something like that.  \nW\ne \nmay \nneed to bring them back up to the table and spend a bit longer looking \nmore widely at how \npartnerships work.  Maybe everybody is in that boat.  I will admit\n that \nif \nyou \ngo back and look at the consultation paper \nfrom \nlast summer you can see strands that come through now, but there does seem to be a mismatch in understanding.  Maybe folk have not spoken about it enough together.  \nOne of the things that was quite interesting for us when this partnership consultation first came out was that our members were really concerned about the mixed partnerships.  We invited HMRC to meet our members to discuss it, and I think \nthat \nfinancial pressures, time pressures and all the rest of it meant that we ended up with a phone call, which was really helpful and it was very good of them to do that.  We \nhad \na fulsome discussion\n,\n but if I compare that with something like changes to trusts, where the HMRC officials concerned came and met us, in fairness you can have more exploratory and wider discussion on a face-to-face basis than perhaps you would just on a paper consultation and phone calls.\nBaroness Drake: There is a slight tension, is there not, between on the one hand not being onerous and not being anti-competitive in the impact of the tax provisions\n,\n and on the other hand the Government’s concern that people are using LLP status when, in fact, they are employees\n.\n What partnership tests, in your view, would reconcile those tensions, if \nthey are \nnot the economic tests?\nCharlotte Barbour: To take a slightly different tack, one of the interesting aspects here is that when anything is anti-avoidance, it gives a different flavour because the Government will want to stop people from doing things that arguably they should not be doing.  Sometimes, however, it is a moot point as to what is labelled anti-avoidance and what is not labelled anti-avoidance.  I am not convinced that we have seen the full range of evidence yet to demonstrate that these are really big anti-avoidance measures or whether, in actual fact, if we took a step back and discussed them on broader principles we might find out that there is not as much money at stake or that they are not being used as aggressively as perhaps folk think.\nBaroness Drake: Would other panel members like to comment on that tension and how the tests would best resolve that tension between inappropriate use of partnership status and remaining competitive?\nFrank Haskew: There is a tension, is there not?  There always has been and there always \nwill \nbe.  The OTS report makes exactly that same point\n,\n but there is a danger where the Government ha\nve\n always\n in effect \nhad an override on the consultation process for measures that are anti-avoidance.  We subscribe to that and that is entirely fair and reasonable, but the problem starts where you have measures that are probably a bit of both or it is not clear that some of the proposals are anti-avoidance but in fact impact on a much wider population.  That is the problem with this: we are into measures that are trying to tackle a certain area of difficulty but are potentially impacting on a much wider scale.  There is that tension there, and the way to resolve that has to be further discussion, and honest and straightforward discussion, between HM Treasury, HMRC and interested parties to try to make sure that if \nthe Government think that \nthere is abuse in \na \nparticular area, that abuse is tackled but not everything else with it.\nQ53 &#xa0; \n \nBaroness Blackstone: I want to pursue the subject of consultation.  The ICAS has commented, “Some consultations feel genuine whereas some others leave the sense that they are observing the process rather than the spirit”\n.\n  How far do your organisations share that view?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I guess this is directed to Frank and me, is it?  What Charlotte and ICAS have said is specifically true.  As we can see in the LLP consultation, we had one set of proposals on th\ne ideas under the consultation, but\n the draft legislation has come up very different.  There is \na \ndisconnect.  What was taken on board\n,\n or why were those consultation questions asked if the final product is not within that document?  It just seems very odd.\nFrank Haskew: Our view is that the consultation process is clearly better, and we have always welcomed that.  The trouble is that it is let down by certain proposals, and this is one of them.  In particular, where there is an anti-avoidance element, it seems as though it is just going to happen, regardless of just how difficult it might be commercially and how expensive it might be to implement for people.  We saw that over the last few years with measures such as the annual tax on envelope dwellings, where you just felt that there was a juggernaut rolling, that this was going to happen and, no matter what you said about it going to be almost impossible to implement, nobody was listening.  By and large, it is better, but there seem to be particular examples where it really needs to be improved.\nBaroness Blackstone: Can you give us a few more examples \nof \nwhere you feel \nthat \nconsultations on this year’s \nB\nill have been a mere formality?\nFrank Haskew: The trouble is that we are still in the consultation process for this year.\nBaroness Blackstone: Do you mean that there are going to be more to come?\nFrank Haskew: Some of it may come right; we are still in the process.  Other examples \nof \nwhere we are finding potential difficulties are the onshore intermediaries rules, where again we sense \nthat \nthere could be instances that are going to apply in commercial situations that we do not think should be caught.  They are the same sorts of principles.  We are talking and we are hopeful that we will get change\n,\n but at the moment it is fair to say that we do not seem to be making a lot of headway.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: The HMRC digital self-assessment consultation document was a four-week consultation over Christmas and \nthe new year\n.  The clauses are already in the Finance Bill.  Also, I believe \nthat \nthe employee share\ns-\nfor\n-\nrights proposals were already before the House when apparently the impacts were being consulted on.  There has been quite an array of different areas that have been “consulted on” but not really.\nBaroness Blackstone: Do you think that anything more can be done to embed the new approach to \npolicy-making\n in the way in which both Treasury Ministers and officials are working?\nFrank Haskew: We have said that improvements \ncould be \nmade to the way impact assessments are drawn up.  Impact assessments are ultimately the bedrock of policy formulation, or at least that is the Government’s position.  We do not feel that those impact assessments are properly taking account of the costs of implementing them.  The cost generally and the processes you need to go through to implement change are completely underestimated.  They also do not take account of what processes businesses have to go through\n,\n and in a way we are seeing it here with the partnership rules, because it does not seem to be reflected in the way the commercial world works.  Our view is that the process could be improved if there was greater emphasis at an earlier stage on getting those impact assessments and the costings of change built in, so that you have a real indication of what it is going to cost to make the changes.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: It would be very useful if the Cabinet Office principles on consultation were enshrined in law.  At the moment, the Cabinet Office’s principles seem to be being watered down.  I have not brought it with me but the period of consultation used to be 12 weeks; it has gone down and has become an “if you can, consult for a period of time”.  If the requirement for \nthe \nGovernment to do that\n was \nin legislation\n, unless it \nrelates to \nanti-avoidance, which would only be very narrowly focused, there should be proper consultation.  That really is a part of why the OTS was set up and part of why draft Finance Bill clauses are published, but we need to look at the other consultations that go on.  They should follow a proper template\n that is \nenshrined in law\n and which \nthe Government should be going through, rather than something \nthat \nthey can cherry-pick and change as they wish.\nBaroness Blackstone: You have not mentioned the Tax Professionals Forum.  Does that have any role in all this?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: I think you had two members from there giving you evidence on Monday.  Clearly, they look at the administrative side of tax \npolicy-making\n and implementation\n,\n and hopefully they will comment on this type of thing\n,\n but I am not sure that we are involved in that forum ourselves.\nLord Wrigglesworth: Just before we move on to the next question, I am going to follow up on that.  Where do you think the problem lies?  Is it with officials in HMRC?  Is it with officials in \nthe \nTreasury?  Is it with Ministers?  Where is the problem?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: There seems to be a rush to get things done.  Clearly,\n the \nGovernment \nare\n always under pressure.  There is \nnever\n enough time.  If they spot something, they want to do something about it.  The reality, however, is that where \nyou \nhave something done very quickly, you repent at your leisure, so it is better to do things properly and not come against obstacles like the \npasty tax or the child benefit \nchanges or something else that has just been thought up and has to be implemented today or as soon as time allows.  There is ministerial pressure and there is also probably pressure within the Civil Service to get things done quickly, but as we mentioned, \nunder the last Government \nthe tax policy quite deliberately moved away from HMRC\n, \nor the Inland Revenue as it was\n, \nto \nthe \nTreasury, and we probably need to see some of that \npolicy-making\n going back to HMRC \nand the Treasury creating the tensions to challenge some of those policies, which is perhaps not happening enough.  That then ties in with the consultation process, which needs to be given sufficient time for people to make a proper submission, and there should then be responses back as to why the Government, for example on the LLP proposals, decided to go in a totally different direction to what was in the consultation document.\nQ54 &#xa0; \n \nLord Wrigglesworth: The Scottish\n,\n English and Welsh \ni\nnstitute\ns\n in their submissions have both called for the Government to clearly identify a strategy for different parts of the tax system, \nas they did \nfor \ncorporate tax \nin 2010.  I wonder if you would like to expand on that proposal, and whether the ACCA might give us a comment on it as well.\nThe Chairman: Expand, but not \nfor \ntoo long.\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: Shall I just be very quick?  I entirely agree with ICAEW and ICAS that there should be a strategy of mapping other areas.  Corporate tax has been very helpful and has acted as a road\n \nmap of where the \nUK\n is going in inward investment and business in general.  The same ought to apply for income tax.  There is no reason why we should keep tacking and changing rates and strategies of \nincome tax\n, so, again, a road\n \nmap in that area would be very helpful.\nCharlotte Barbour: We have all been here long enough to see corporate tax and income tax rates do this, and behaviour perhaps follows suit.  It would be really helpful to have a slightly bigger picture rather than trying to nip away at the problems once they become anti-avoidance problems.  That is why I think a bigger strategy picture is needed.  The corporation tax \nroad map\n was really helpful.  It would be great to have a business tax, and that would be for all businesses, as we have been discussing today, regardless of whether they are income tax or corporation tax.  The other really big driver is employee versus self-employed.  To try to get a wider wrapper around would be very attractive.\nFrank Haskew: We have said that as well.  We have to recognise that the tax system, particularly on the smaller business end, is facing a lot of pressure points.  IR35 in 2000 was one attempt to try to tackle certain elements of it, but here we are, 14 years on, and we seem to have many more sticking plasters.  Indeed, the LLP provisions are sticking plasters.  There is a need to step back and look at the tax system strategically, which might mean looking at income tax and national insurance\n and how \nthey work together, and whether that is the right way forward.  I do not think that we can duck these questions in the long term if we are going to have a simple and competitive \nUK\n tax system.\nLord Wrigglesworth: You will be aware that the \nsub-committee \nmade a similar recommendation in 2011 but it has not happened.  I just wonder whether you think it is \nbecause of \na lack of resource, a lack of time or a lack of inclination.\nCharlotte Barbour: It is a difficult mix, is it not?\nFrank Haskew: It is easy to understand the Government’s difficulty when \nthey are \ntrying to tackle a budget deficit.  It is very difficult to undertake fundamental tax reforms when you are up against needing to shore up a \n£\n100 million deficit.  It is much easier to have a strategic change in the tax system when you have a budget surplus and you can probably \nmake it \npart of a tax-cutting agenda.  That is easier to sell. It is difficult.  You need to secure your revenues as a Government, and the one thing that you cannot afford to do is to put your revenue streams at risk at this particular juncture.  One can understand the difficulty of wanting to make major strategic changes to the tax system.\nQ55 &#xa0; \n \nThe Chairman: We are coming to the end, but listening to what you have said I am not sure that you have not answered this question.  In his evidence last week, John Whiting commented that the partnership between HMRC and the Treasury was working pretty well.  Am I right to conclude that you would not absolutely agree with that?\nChas Roy-Chowdhury: What John Whiting seems to have said in the middle, compared to his wrap-up, \nwhich \nwas positive, seems to be contradictory.  He was \ntalking \nabout the tensions and the lack of experience within \nthe \nTreasury, which are really the sorts of things we have been saying, so we are not entirely sure how he then comes to say \nthat \nit is very positive.  While we are not negative and doom\n \nand\n \ngloom about the relationship at all or the way that policy is working, we just feel \nthat \nit could work a lot better with HMRC looking at and building policy, and HMT then challenging that policy rather than, \nas it is \nat the moment, producing a policy and challenging it \nitself\n, which is perhaps not the right way.  Looking at yourself and criticising yourself is perhaps not the best way of devising tax policy.\nThe Chairman: We have to end but I am going to ask whether anyone has a question.  Lord Joffe has one.\nQ56 &#xa0; \n \nLord Joffe: I have a few\n,\n but because of a shortage of time I think we might rule out the second one.  This is addressed to Ms Barbour.  In \nClause 14 of \nyour written evidence, you say, “\nAlthough it is accepted that there may be some tax ‘schemes’ where there appears to be no or very little commercial purpose other than tax saving, ICAS members have said that in the majority of mixed partnerships this is not the case\n”\n.\n  Bearing in mind that there is a lot of opposition to the \ng\novernment proposals, have you any thought on what sort of legislation could be prepared to deal with the minority who are using this particular process in order to avoid taxation?\nCharlotte Barbour: That is one of the difficult issues around here, and it \nis \nperhaps reflected in the LLP legislation as well.  It is difficult to write targeted anti-avoidance legislation and, as we have said in our evidence, there are some schemes where you perhaps raise your eyebrows, but I think the vast majority do not do that.  \nO\nur members have to combine that with a lot of regulatory requirements \nsuch as \naudit registrations\n and \ninsolvency licences\n—\nkinds of things.  It is not necessarily that easy just to nip in and get one tailored measure, which is why we have come back to really welcoming the OTS investigation and \nits \ninterim report, because we think that it raises all the issues and it would help to look at it in the round as to how you solve it, because it is not that easy.\nLord Joffe: It needs to be solved for the minority.\nCharlotte Barbour: If there is a minority that HMRC have a problem with, of course it does.\nFrank Haskew: I will just help \nCharlotte\n here a bit.\nCharlotte Barbour: Thank you.\nFrank Haskew: There is no real motive test in this at all.  It is a mechanical test, effectively.  In most anti-avoidance legislation that we have had over the years, there is a clear motive test.  There is a sole or main purpose test being tax avoidance, and there is not really a lot of evidence of that here.  That would normally in the old days have got you out, because you would have a commercial override.  We probably \nneed to \nlook a bit at directing it clearly towards cases where there is obvious tax avoidance.\nLord Joffe: We need a better test, and that was what I was asking: have you any suggestions as to a better test?\nFrank Haskew: A better test would be at least having a motive test\n that is \nsimilar to many of our existing anti-avoidance provisions.\nThe Chairman: It has been very nice for me to see familiar faces over all the years, and I would like to thank you very much for coming.  Thank you for your written submissions and thank you for the way you have answered all the questions.  You certainly have not lost any of your skills over the years, and thank you very much indeed.\n \n"
