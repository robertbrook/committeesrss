[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2. [bold]              [bold]Impact on social sector housing [bold]in Scotland[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]At the end of May 2013, the Scottish Government and C
[normal]onvention of Scottish Local Authorities
[normal] carrie
[normal]d out a survey of all 
[normal]S
[normal]cottish local 
[normal]authorities
[normal] to gain an early understanding of the impact of under occupancy 
[normal]measures
[normal].  With a 94% response rate
[normal], it was 
[normal]estimated that: -
[normal] 
[normal]82,500 households
[normal] in Scotland 
[normal]were 
[normal]incurring a reduction in their housing 
[normal]benefit because they were assessed as under occupying their property.
[normal]Of these households:-
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]The average reduction is estimated to be around £11 per week per household and if households were to take no mitigating action, this would result in an estimated total reduction in Housing Benefit payments to Sco
[normal]tland of around £50 million per annum.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Around 80% of household
[normal]s
[normal] affected by the under-occupancy penalty i.e
[normal].
[normal] around 63,500 households are estimated to contain an adult with a 
[normal]disability recognised under the 
[normal]Disability Discrimination Act.
[normal]  And, a
[normal]round 
[normal]15,500 
[normal]households affected by the under-occupancy penalty are estimated to be families with children.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Of the 82,500 households affected, 60,000 would need to move to a one bedroom property to avoid under occupation penalties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] However it 
[normal]is estimat
[normal]ed
[normal] that only around 20,000 one bedroom local authority or housing association properties become available for letting each year.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]With the exception of one, all local authorities with housing stock reported an
[normal] 
[normal]increase in arrears due to under occupan
[normal]cy. Three quarters of councils are
[normal] 
[normal]reporting that non-payment of rent following 
[normal]the 
[normal]under occupancy changes is
[normal] 
[normal]directly responsible for the increase in their rent arrears.
[normal]  
[normal]Of that rent now due to be collected from tenants affected by under occupancy
[normal] 
[normal]measu
[normal]res, 60% of councils are reported receiving 40% or less and 80% reported
[normal] 
[normal]receiving 50% or less as at the end of May
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]In total, councils have received over 22,000 applications for DHPs since advising
[normal] 
[normal]tenants of revised Housing Benefit awards. For 19 
[normal]local authorities this is 4 times
[normal] 
[normal]higher than the same period last year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. [bold]              [bold]Impact of debt on health[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Given the increase in 
[normal]rent 
[normal]arrears due to 
[normal]under occupancy
[normal], there are clearly a significant nu
[normal]m
[normal]ber of tenants who are now in debt in Scotland.  The 
[normal]re
[normal]lationship between the 
[normal]impact of debt on
[normal] 
[normal]health
[normal] and in particular mental health
[normal] is well 
[normal]established
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The under occupancy rules 
[normal]disproportionately
[normal] affect people who are already disadvantaged, including disabled people and 
[normal]those
[normal] who suffer long term health conditions, addictions, mental health problems and carers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]Being in debt can
[normal] 
[normal]negatively affect a person’s mental health, while
[normal] 
[normal]living with a mental health problem increases the
[normal] 
[normal]likelihood of falling into debt
[normal], 
[normal]for example
[normal] the number of people 
[normal]who have trouble paying their debts are more than twice as likely to have mental health problems or suffer severe anxiety compared with the general population
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]According to the Royal College of 
[normal]Psychiatrists
[normal], m
[normal]ore debt equate
[normal]s to more mental ill health, even after adjustment for income and other socio-demographic variables.
[normal]  Their research has concluded that:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold] [bold]Impact of homelessness on health[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]In contra
[normal]s
[normal]t to England, homelessness has been falling in 
[normal]S
[normal]cot
[normal]l
[normal]and
[normal].  However the increase in rent arrears due to under 
[normal]occupancy
[normal] rules and lack of appropriate housing stock for people to ‘downsize’ 
[normal]to
[normal] is likely to increase evictions. 
[normal]Whilst some local authorities in Scotland have stated they will not evict tenants who fall into arrears 
[normal]because
[normal] of the under-occupancy rules, 
[normal]most hou
[normal]sing
[normal] associations and local 
[normal]authorities
[normal] 
[normal]cannot
[normal] afford to take th
[normal]is
[normal] approach
[normal], therefore
[normal] it is likely that t
[normal]here will be an increase in 
[normal]the 
[normal]number of people who become homeless
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Poor health is a well established consequence of 
[normal]homelessness
[normal];
[normal] this can include 
[normal]chronic conditions as well as anxiety, stress, self-harm, other mental health problems and infectious diseases. A significant minority of homeless people are dependent on drugs or alcohol often alongside mental health problems and other m
[normal]ultiple needs
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]An increase in h
[normal]ealth problems 
[normal]is
[normal] not confined to those sleeping rough. People living in temporary accommodation, with friends or in hostels have little stability, often have to share kitchens and bathrooms and have little privacy or security
[normal]. They may also experience problems relating t
[normal]o damp or overcrowded conditions. Research also shows that homeless families in rural areas may spend longer in temporary accommodation than those in urban areas
[normal] and that
[normal] health problems arising from such circumstances include an increased risk of dermato
[normal]logical problems, musculoskeletal problems, poor obstetric outcomes and a range of mental health problems.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]The effect on children in homeless families living in temporary accommodation can be serious
[normal]. There are many detrimental effects on the physi
[normal]cal and emotional development of children living in unsettled or overcrowded accommodation with little room to play or do homework. Studies have shown children in these circumstances 
[normal]are more likely to experience
[normal] behavioural disturbance, have higher levels of illness and infection, have poor sleep patterns and are more prone to accidental injury
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]It can be more difficult for homeless people to sustain continuity of care, to meet appointments made a long time 
[normal]in advance, or to participate in health 
[normal]improvement and health promotion activities, such as healthy eating and physical activity
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold] Impact [bold]of low[bold] [bold]income on health[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst 
[normal]some tenants 
[normal]may become homeless because they have incurred arrears due to the under 
[normal]occupancy
[normal] rules; other tenants on low incomes, with no option of moving to a smaller property, will try to meet the shortfall in rent, therefore having less money to spend on basic liv
[normal]ing costs such as fuel, food and transport.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The rapid increase in the number of Food Banks now available in Scotland 
[normal]serve
[normal] to illustrate a growing level of need that individuals and families face as a result of increasing financial difficulties
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]Any
[normal] decrease in income for 
[normal]th
[normal]ose
[normal] population groups 
[normal]affected by the under occupancy rules is
[normal] likely to cause increased income inequalities in Scotland, increased fuel poverty, increased food poverty (and a consequent shift from quality foodstuffs to calorific quantity); and decreased housing 
[normal]security
[normal].
[normal]  These factors are likely to cause a number 
[normal]of negative health outcomes, 
[normal]and predictions
[normal] are
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]Those population groups who
[normal]se health is most 
[normal]likely to be most affected 
[normal]are
[normal] disabled people, carers and women, and those living in rural communities in Scotland
[normal].  
[normal]Prior to April 2013, 
[normal]th
[normal]ese
[normal] population group
[normal]s
[normal] were already 
[normal]found to be 
[normal]disproportionably
[normal] affected by the recent recession and public sector adjustments. 
[normal] 
[normal]Scottish Gover
[normal]nment Social Research
[normal] in 2010
[normal] 
[normal]found that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]. [bold]              [bold]Impact on NHS services[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]The potential increase in the burden of ill health due to increase in
[normal] 
[normal]health inequalities
[normal], 
[normal]income inequalities
[normal], and 
[normal]poverty and debt 
[normal]will clearly have an impact on NHS services, particularly primary care
[normal],
[normal] in terms of increasing demand for appointments and increased costs associated with diagnostic testing and medication
[normal].  And
[normal] what is of 
[normal]particular 
[normal]concern 
[normal]has been 
[normal]the increasing
[normal] demand
[normal] for medical evidence to support applications for Discretionary Housing
[normal] 
[normal]Payment (
[normal]DHP)
[normal]. 
[normal]Given that 80% of those affected by the under-occupancy rules in 
[normal]Scotland
[normal] are disabled, many are applying for DHP on medical
[normal] 
[normal]or health grounds.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]Due to a lack of clear guidance
[normal] and supported by Local Medical Committees
[normal], GP’s are 
[normal]taking a number of approaches in 
[normal]responding
[normal] to reques
[normal]t
[normal]s for medical evidence to support applications for DHP, this includes charging for the evidence or refusing to provide any evidence.  GP’s have taken this stance given the number of r
[normal]e
[normal]quests they now re
[normal]ceive to provide medical evidence in support of those appealing W
[normal]ork Capability 
[normal]A
[normal]ssessment (WCA)
[normal] 
[normal]decisions
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]T
[normal]he additional work of providing evidence for DHP applications and WCA appeals falls disproportionately on general practices in areas of 
[normal]deprivation in Scotland which are already struggling as a result of the inverse care law
[normal] 
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.[bold]              [bold]C[bold]onclusion[bold]As outlined above 
[normal]there are concerns amongst the NHS and public health 
[normal]workforce
[normal] of the impact that the social size criteria is having on
[normal] the most vulnerable communities in Scotland.  Of the 82,500 households affected by the under occupancy rules, 60,000 need a one bedroom property, however only around 20,000 one bedroom 
[normal]properties
[normal] in the social housing sector become available each year.  C
[normal]onsequently the impact o
[normal]f the under occupancy rules are 
[normal]likely to cause an increase in health problems, health inequalities and pressure on NHS services, particularly primary care.
[normal]  
[normal]It is hoped that the 
[normal]UK 
[normal]Parliament Work and Pensions C
[normal]ommittee
[normal] recognise these impacts and can identify how these impacts can be minimise in order to protect the health of those 
[normal]most 
[normal]affected in Scotland.
