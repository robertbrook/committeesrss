"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire [CST0070]&#xa0;\nThank you very much for your letter regarding your inquiry into crime statistics. I hope the below will assist your Committee in forming an overview of the recording and use of crime statistics in North Yorkshire.\n&#xa0;\nMy Police \nand \nCrime Plan contains no specific targets for crime. Currently, our only objectives are broad, but are the focus of our work in North Yorkshire. We have one specific overarching \ngoal, \nwhich is \nto \nmaintain North Yorkshire as the safest county in England.\n&#xa0;\nMore generally, I am reviewing my Police and Crime Plan \nat \nthe moment, and \nam \ndeveloping \na \nmore thorough system for measuring performance. This will be based on outcomes rather than fulfilling targets, and I hope to publish the renewed plan in \nthe \nsummer.\n&#xa0;\nAt this stage, it is hard to disaggregate police performance to know what effect the \nwholesale \nremoval of targets has had in North Yorkshire. It is \nalso \nimportant to bear in mind that other police agencies, such \nas \nHMIC, and to a large extent the \ngeneral \npublic, \nstill \njudge police forces \nby \ntargets, \nand \none target in particular- crime coming down. \nThis \nhas had \nan impact \non police culture generally, but \nas \nexplained \nabove, \nI hope to be \nable \nto implement \na \nnew \nseries \nof \noutcomes \nmeasures rather than a reliance on targets.\n&#xa0;\nIt \nis also \nimportant to note that we \nwould welcome \nthe increase in the reporting \nof some crimes. We \nknow anecdotally that domestic \nabuse, \nsexual \nabuse, \nrural crime and hate crime (among\ns\nt others) \nare all \nhistorically under-reported. The \nopening of \na new \nSexual \nAssault Referral \nCentre \nin York has led to an increase in crimes being \nreported, \nbut this is \nwelcome as we are \nnow \nable \nto support more victims \nof this \nterrible crime.\n&#xa0;\nOn \nthe accuracy and assuredness \nof \ncrime \nfigures more \ngenerally, \nwe have a \nrobust \ns\ny\nstem of checks and \nbalances in North Yorkshire.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
