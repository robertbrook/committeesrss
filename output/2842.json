"              \n              \nWritten evidence from Passenger Focus (WRT 022)\n&#xa0;\n1.              Introduction&#xa0;\n1.1\n              \nPassenger Focus is the official, independent consumer \nwatchdog \nrepresenting the interests of rail users \nthroughout Great Britain \nand bus, coach and tram users \nacross England\n,\n outside \nLondon\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nPassenger Focus welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to the Transport \nCommittee’\ns Inquiry \ninto winter resilience in transport.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.              Service disruption: rail passengers’ attitudes and priorities &#xa0;2.1\n              \nAnalysis \nof the National Passenger Survey\n (NPS)\n shows that b\ny far the greatest \n‘\ndriver\n’\n of passengers’ overall satisfaction with a rail journey \nis whether the train is punctua\nl.  At \n42% it dwarfs all other factors.  \nThe \nlargest \n‘\ndriver\n’\n of overall dissatisfaction\n, \nhowever,\n is how well a train company deal\ns\n with delays\n – \n51%.\n  This gives a good indication of passengers’ requirements during bouts of severe weather, which can be summarised as:\n&#xa0;\nMinimising disruption in the first place2.2\n              \nIn recent years th\nere have been a number of initiatives to ensure that the railway is less \nsusceptible\n to snow and ice than it has been in the past, some led by train operators and some by Network Rail.  \nFor \nexample, m\nodifications to prevent snow damaging electric traction motor\ns and heating the third rail at key locations to prevent icing\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nIt is impossible for Passenger Focus to judge w\nhether what has been delivered so far\n \nis sufficien\nt.  However, \nit is \nworth noting that train performance\n (as measured by the Public Performance Measure) \nin winter 2012/13 was worse than 2011/12 – \nalthough \nfactors\n other than the weather may have been involved.\n \n We \ntherefore \nsupport the Office of Rail Regulation’s requirement\n for robust weather resilience proposals in Network Rail’s Control Period 5 (2014-19) Delivery Plan.\n              \nPeriod 8\n (mid Oct to mid Nov)\nPeriod 9\n(mid Nov to early Dec)\nPeriod 10\n (early Dec to early Jan)\nPeriod 11\n(early Jan to early Feb)\nPeriod

terms of what more should be done, it would perhaps be helpful \nif\n, \nroute by route\n, \nNetwork Rail and train companies \nwere explicit \nabout \nwhat further measures they \ncould\n take\n to make the railway more resilient to severe weather \n(i.e. over and above \nthose already in\n-\nhand and \nrequired to achieve Control Period 5 2014-2019 \npunctuality\n target\ns).  \nT\nhen the \nindustry, stakeholders and government could consider w\nhat further improvements would \nrepresent \nvalue for money.\n  A similar approach could be used to identify w\nhat more could be done to improve resilience \nto \nflooding, high winds, lightning str\nikes\n and exceptionally high temperatures.\n&#xa0;\nEffective handling of disruption when it does happen2.\n5\n              \nThe \nNPS\n \nquestion \nwhich\n tracks opinion in this area asks passengers \nto \nrate the handling of delay\n.  The long-term trend shows improvement, \nalbeit \nmodest and \nstarting from a low bas\ne.  The proportion of passengers saying that their delay was handed “well” was \n38\n% in the \nSpring\n 2013 NPS.\n&#xa0;\n              \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSource: National Passenger Survey, 1999-2013\n2.\n6\n              \nPassenger Focus research\n suggests that various factors \ncontribute to how passengers rate the handling of disruption\n, including\n:\n&#xa0;\n2.\n7\n              \nI\nnformation at times of disruption \nis heading \nslowly in the right direction\n.  Many more train companies now have ‘rainbow boards’ on their websites giving ‘at \na glance’ status of the service\n; p\nassengers\n following most train companies on Twitter \nreceive \nmarked\nly better information than in the past\n; and it is now possible for pre-prepared ‘snow timetables’ to show through electronic journey planners the evening before\n.  \nHowever, \nwe continue to see inaccur\nacies, inconsistencies and ambiguities at times of disruption, whether the cause \nis winter weather \nor not.\n  A \nremaining \nweakness is the \nin\nability to give an accurate estimate of how long \na disruption will last, \neven some hours into an incident, let alone \nan indication of how long knock\n-\non delays will continue to affect journeys.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n8\n              \nInformation.  \nAfter observations over winter 2012/13, Passenger Focus \nhighlighted \n– via the \nrail industry’s \nNational Taskforce – \nfour areas of continuing weakness\n in informati\non provision during disruption\n:\nas\n necessary\n&#xa0;\n2.\n9\n              \nEmpathy and practical action.  \nThe tendency of train companies to\n sometimes\n give the impression \nt\nhat they do not “treat me with respect\n [as a paying customer]” is a particular problem at times of service disruptio\nn, whether caused by \nwinter \nweather \nor anything else.  \nPassengers also get the impression that the \nrail \nindustry can be slow with practical action\n to minimise th\neir inconvenience\n.  \nPassenger Focus continues to highlight specific areas that contribute to th\nese\n impression\ns\n, including:\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n0\n              \nWelfare of passengers.  \nOccasionally, \nthe way \ndisruption \nis handled g\nets close to the line between \npoor \ncustomer service and failure to safeguard the welfare of passengers.\n  Incidents at Kings Cross on 19 February (200 passengers forced to ‘sleep’ overnight on a train in the station\n; at Virginia Water on 9 May (passengers arrived home \naround midnight h\naving left Waterloo at 1720 \nafter a tree fell across the railway); and at \nPewsey\n on 4 August\n (Penzance to Paddington train \nstuck for 5 hours).  \nIncident reviews often find a culture of “don’t worry, this problem will sort itself out in half an hour”, with \nno\n parallel\n “but what\n about the passengers \nif it doesn’t\n?”  \nSince the Kings Cross incident, Passenger Focus has written to all train companies about late-night service \ndisruption,\n and most have replied that their arrangements would have prevented a similar\n incident.  \nNevertheless\n,\n incidents keep \nhappening\n which, if they had coincided with extreme winter weather (or extreme heat)\n,\n could have led to serious \npassenger \nwelfare issues.\n2.\n11\n              \nInformation needs – extreme weather.  Passengers’ information requirements during disruption caused by winter weather are largely the same as during any other disruption.  However, when snow has \nfallen\n passengers have an extra requirement – because they have reason to suspect that trains \nmay\n b\ne affected.  Train companies still have more to do to help passengers answer th\ne\n initial “can I get there?” question when \nthey \nopen their curtains to snow, or hear about it on the radio.  This is as much about reassurance that all \nis\n \nwell\n as it\n is about wa\nrning of disruption.  For commuters, the question “and will I get home again\n?\n” will also be in their mind.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n1\n2\n              \n‘snow timetables’ – commuter networks.  Passenger Focus is in principle persuaded by the argument \nthat\n,\n faced with a horrendous weather forecast\n it is in \npassengers’ interests if commuter train \ncompanies \nrun a timetable \nthey are \nconfident can be \ndelivered \ndespite the weather.\n  Attempting to deliver the impossible and failing spectacularly does not help\n anybody\n.  \nWith effective communications it should be possible \nfor train companies \nto get the message to commuters that a ‘snow timetable’ will run tomorrow, with full details of what that means made available quickly\n.  However, ‘snow timetables’ must\n \nstil\nl \nmeet the needs of passengers\n – \nin\n \nterms of continuing to run trains from all stations \nwherever p\nossible and providing \nenou\ng\nh coaches \nthat \npass\nengers do not get left behind.  Passenger Focus felt that South West Trains did not \nquite \nget this right when th\ney implemented a ‘snow timetable’ in January 2013 and they have undertaken to review arrangements for the coming winter.\n  \nT\nhere is always \nthe potential \nthat the \nforecast snow does not materialise and \npassengers conclud\ne \nthat the train company has redu\nced t\nhe service unnecessarily.  To reduce th\nat\n risk, the time by which \nit \nmust \nbe \ndecide\nd\n whether to run a ‘snow timetable’ the \nnext \nday should be \na\ns late as possible, while still allowing the revised \ntimes \nto show \nin \njourney planning systems that evening.  The\n industry should also enhance its capability to restore the normal timetable, or elements of \nit,\n if it becomes clear the ‘snow timetable’ is not needed.\n  \n              \n2.1\n3\n              \n‘snow timetables’ – long-distance operators.  In contrast, Passenger Focus supports the position taken by some long-distance operators, e.g. \nCrossCountry\n and Virgin Trains,\n \nthat the fu\nll timetable \nshould be maintained \nwherever possible.  Infrequent, long-distance passengers are m\nore difficult to war\nn \nthat a different timetable will be in operation\n, and \nretiming the 11\n:\n00 to 11\n:\n08\n, for example,\n would cause considerable confusion – not least to those whose ticket is for the 11\n:\n00 and no other train.  \nRe-writing the timetable with fewer trai\nns taking lo\nnger than normal also risks the (reasonable) accusation that it has been done not in passengers’ interests\n,\n but purely to boost punctuality statistics.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.              Bus passengers’ attitudes and priorities &#xa0;3. 1\n              \nWhile b\nus passengers would\n \nclearly \nrather there is \nno disruption in the first place\n, they recognise that bus services will inevitably be impacted when significant snow \nand/or \nice affects the road network.  Nevertheless, bus passengers do expect that reasonable steps \nwill be \ntaken to ensure that buses conti\nnue to run\n,\n \nand as reliably as \npossible, \nwherever\n it is safe to do so.  \nWhether \npressure on \nlocal authority \n2013/14 \nb\nudgets\n will reduce the priority \na\nttach\ned\n to gritting principal bus routes\n/ \na\nccess to\n bus garages this winter remains to be seen.\n&#xa0;\n3. 3\n              \nPassenger Focus published research \nearlier in \n2013 \nlooking at \nbus passengers’ experiences of delays and service disruption\n.  Although covering experiences \nof delays \nresulting from many different causes, i.e. not just severe winter weather, \na number of \nthe\n \nfindings \nand recommendations \nare relevant to this \nInquiry\n.  The research found that improvements in two key areas would \nchange\n passengers’ experiences during disruption \n– information and driver attitude.  Passengers spoke about feeling \n‘\npowerless\n’\n standin\ng at a bus stop not knowing if a bus will come – as one \nresearch respondent \nput it “it’s mental torture sometimes at bus stops working out whether to stay or whether to go”.  Passengers also said they wanted bus drivers to \nbehave more as the bus company’s \ncustomer service representative, providing information, showing empathy and expressing regret.  \n&#xa0;\n3. 4\n              \nPassenger Focus’s recommendations in the light of this research include:\n&#xa0;\n3. \n5\n              \nIf\n there is disruption \nto bus services \ncaused by severe \nwinter \nweather, good in\nformation is key to minimising the impact on passengers.  \nI\nnformation \nthat allows passengers to m\nake an informed decision – be it \nto \nset out earlier, \nnot \nattempt to travel, find a different way to get there – \nshould b\ne a key \nobjective \nfor \nbus companies and\n/or local authorities.\n  Providing assurance that buses \nare\n running, if potentially with delays, is important as well: when it has snowed passengers have reason to doubt it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nRail.  \nThe NPS shows that for rail passengers the way disruption is managed is moving slowly in the right direction, but there \nremains \na considerable way to go.\n  It is important to ask what more could be done to improve the railway’s resilience to snow and ice.  \nWhen \ndisruption \noccurs\n \ninformation that allows passengers to make an informed choice about what they do is vital.  D\nu\nring \nwinter 2012/13 \npassenger information \nwas better, but it was \nfar from \nperf\nect\n and t\nhis \npaper \nmentions a number of areas in which furthe\nr improvement is needed.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nBus.  When bus services are disrupted, for any reason, passengers’ key requirement is for information about what is going on – and yet many feel\n \nthere is no effective means to find \nthat \nout\n.  How would a passenger working in their office find out that a bus company had decided it would suspend operations at 16:00 \nbecause heavy snow is \nforecast?   In some cases \nit\n is true\n:\n without a system tracking the location of buses in \nreal-time\n, there is\n no means to find out exactly what is happening – but in other\ns \nApps \nexist, \nbut few passengers appear to know about them.  A quick win for the bus industry would be to raise awareness about Apps and other sources of information where reliable \nreal-time\n sys\ntems are in place.\n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nHow public transport operators manage service disruption, including that caused by severe winter weather remains an important area \nof work \nfor Passenger Focus.  If snow and ice causes disruption this winter we will monitor how well \ntrain and bus companies cope, including in the vital area of passenger information.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n Passenger Focus multivariate analysis of National Passenger Survey,
