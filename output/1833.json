Specifically, are the arrangements for securing the accountability of procured services and goods to local authorities and local residents adequate and effective? More specifically, to what extent are local authorities able to provide assurance to central government that value for money (in the broadest sense of the term) is delivered?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs such, they play a vital role in examining local decision making.  \nBoth members and officers will also have regard to a series of agreed organisational policy documents, including a set of financial regulations, standing orders and scheme of delegation.   These set out clear expectations of behaviour and the decision making process in order to deliver the appropriate level of assurance.  \nIn summary, local government benefits from a clear and embedded governance framework.  There exist a number of checks and balances at the local level to ensure that decisions taken within the local authority comply with expectations of regularity, propriety and value for money. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLondon Councils and the London Procurement Strategy Board would be happy to provide further clarification on any of the information contained within this submission.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\nAnnex A: Examples of Procurement Practice in LondonCase Study One: \nLondon Big Energy Switch Project\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study Two: \nLondon Energy Project\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study Three: \nLondon Commercial Fleet Project\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study Four: \nLondon Highways Alliance Contract (LOHAC)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase Study Five: \nThe London Taxicard S\ncheme \n \nCase Study Six: \nICT – an example of Delivering a High Quality Procurement Strategy\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.competefor.com/business/login.jsp\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/best-councils-to-do-business-with-awards\n \nhttp://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/policylobbying/economicdevelopment/boroughecdev/smallbusinessboroughawards.htm\n The Regional Improvement and Efficiency Partnership (RIEP) in London\n Agency Staff, Adult Social Care, Children’s Social Care, Construction, Facilities Management and ICT\n \nBexley, Brent, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Islington, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lambeth, Lewisham, Merton, Redbridge, Richmond, Southwark, Sutton, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest.\n&#xa0;\n \nCamden, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Hounslow, Islington and Wandsworth\n \nBarnet, Brent, Ealing, Hackney, Haringey and Merton.\n"
