[[[Written evidence submitted by Richard Heaton CB,]]]

[[[Permanent Secretary and First Parliamentary Council (QPC 11)]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;When I appeared before the Committee on 31 October, I was asked whether it would be possible for Parliamentarians to see the letters from the Government to the Royal Households   seeking   Queen's   or Prince's   consent for private members'   Bills.     I undertook to write to you on this issue.&#xa0;On reflection, I perhaps should have been clearer that correspondence between the Government and the Royal Household is not usually published.&#xa0;However,  I  hope   I  can  be  more  positive  than  that  answer  at  first  appears.  The Government's role is to ensure that consent is sought when it is required by Parliament. The correspondence between Government Departments and the Royal Household is a matter of routine.  These  letters  set out a description  of the provisions  which  require consent  and by when;  they  do not set out a view on the merits  of the legislation.  A member will already have been told by the Public Bill Office whether consent is needed and in respect of which provisions, so the substance of the letter should be known to him or her, even if the letter itself is not disclosed.&#xa0;We are also able to to share with you a template of the letter we offer departments: I enclose a copy.&#xa0;&#xa0;25 November 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Notes:]]]&#xa0;Where consent is required from both The Queen and The Prince of Wales, separate letters should be sent. This document includes templates for both.&#xa0;Letters  should   be  brief  and  formal  in  tone,  and  should  identify  clearly  which provisions   in  the   Bill  are  thought   to   require   consent   and  for  which   reason (prerogative,  interest or both). The Palace must be given as much time as possible to reply and no fewer than 14 days.&#xa0;The letter and two copies of the Bill (or relevant clauses) should be sent to:&#xa0;&#xa0;The letter and a copy of the Bill (or relevant clauses) should be copied to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Departments  are responsible  for ensuring that they have received a response  before signifying consent in Parliament.&#xa0;Full  details   are   available   in  The   Guide   to   Making   Legislation,   available   at https://www.gov.uk/governmentipublications/guide-to-rnaking-legislation&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Private Secretary to The Queen, Buckingham Palace,London SW1A 1AA&#xa0;&#xa0;[DATE]&#xa0;&#xa0;
