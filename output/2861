[normal]Written evidence submitted by Christian Aid
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Myanmar has witnessed unprecedented political change in recent years and is at a critical point in its history. The international community, with the right policy responses, can play a crucial and positive role in supporting Myanmar’s transition to ensure political reform by promoting inclusive governance, downward accountability and democratic principles. Christian Aid believes that DFID, as an important and well respected development partner in Myanmar, can continue to make a significant difference to support inclusive development within the country. In order to achieve this, we believe the following key priorities should form part of DFID’s future strategy and our submission will focus on the following areas:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Strengthening Myanmar’s civil society is an urgent priority to overcome the effects of decades of restriction and to enable citizens to become agents of their own development, particularly in light of the general elections which are scheduled to take place in 2015.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst recognising the huge step forward the country has taken over the past two years, the reality is that reform is still military-led and building peace cannot be achieved rapidly. It is imperative therefore that DFID ensures continued support to peace-building and conflict transformation initiatives in order to support reconciliation and rebuilding.  Such initiatives should include grassroots efforts which are 
[normal]responsive and accountable to ethnic minority rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Programmes which use interventions such as health as an entry point to bring different actors, ethnic and state, together in discussions provide an excellent opportunity for supporting wider peace building. It is also critical that DFID commits to funding refugee assistance by working with partners and communities both within Myanmar and on its border with Thailand.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is vital that DFID plays a role in ensuring ethical and responsible foreign investment.  This needs to be directed towards local economic development and meeting people’s needs, and should not further marginalise, exploit or displace poor and vulnerable communities nor jeopardise the fragile peace process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finally, Christian Aid recommends that DFID continues to make bi-lateral aid available considering some of the disadvantages of multi-donor funding approaches.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3[bold] The strength of our work in Myanmar was evidenced during the humanitarian response to Cyclone Nargis when we were well-positioned to act through established partners and new partners to optimise the opportunity of increased space made available to civil society.  As a result Christian Aid played a key role in delivering humanitarian assistance in the form of shelter, livelihood support and trauma counselling to affected communities in partnership with key local partner organisations. At the international level Christian Aid has been instrumental in shaping approaches and policy towards Myanmar and advocating for the rights of its refugees and internally displaced people.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4[bold] Our approach has been to support the development of a nascent civil society, strengthening civil society organisations’ capacity to work for a democratic state in Myanmar that recognises ethnic diversity and the rights and aspirations of all. Our programmes aim to equip communities with skills to identify problems, design appropriate solutions and advocate for a just peace and a democratic transition informed by a tri-partite dialogue between the Government of Myanmar, national ethnic groups and pro-democracy groups. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.[bold]1[bold] 
[normal]Strengthening civil society in Myanmar is an urgent priority, to compensate for decades of restriction,[bold] to[bold] promote change from within, and [bold]to [bold]enable citizens to become agents of their own development.   [bold]The emergence of a dynamic civil society is critical for inclusive development, yet in Myanmar it has been constrained by years of military rule and restrictive registration policies. The effect has been compounded by a reluctance of many donors to provide meaningful support to local civil society organisations. Despite this, civil society has continued to find space to operate with strong examples in both humanitarian response and longer term development work.  With elections scheduled to take place in 2015 strengthening the voice of civil society will be key in ensuring good governance and a future democratic Myanmar.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.2[bold] The post-Nargis response illustrated what could be achieved as CSOs were able to successfully scale up their activities as part of relief and recovery efforts delivering vital support to affected communities in the form of shelter, livelihood support and trauma counselling. In our longer term development work, Christian Aid partners have supported increased access of poor and marginalised groups to basic health services, increased engagement of poor and marginalised groups, especially women in the political reform agenda through peace monitoring committees and awareness raising on issues of governance, human rights and accountability standards. 
[normal]2.1.[bold]3[bold] Christian Aid recognises DFID’s support, expertise and influence in this area and encourages DFID to continue to lead the donor community to invest in civil society-led interventions and approaches, championing the importance of supporting the emergence of a dynamic civil society within the sector and through multi donor funding mechanisms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2[bold] 
[normal]Bilateral aid and technical support should[bold] 
[normal]capitalise on the opportunities presented by political reform for promoting inclusive development, accountable governance and democratic principles. [bold]The current potential for reform in Myanmar presents a unique opportunity. Decision-making in some areas is shifting from being the privilege of a small closed circle of military elites to involving a broader spectrum of stakeholders including ethnic representation. The fledgling government requires technical support alongside on-going political pressure at a number of levels to assist it in the reform of its political, economic, financial and social sectors.  DFID is playing an important role in providing such technical support and should continue to do so alongside political pressure, in order to build a more conducive environment for political and economic engagement, to ensure the government is held to account and also to promote a progressive reform agenda with democratisation, pluralism and civil society participation at its core.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3[bold] 
[normal]Civil society in Myanmar also has potential to play an important role in the reform agenda and the restoration of democracy, and this should be supported and developed.  [bold]Whilst the international community needs to continue to monitor and hold the government accountable for reform, Christian Aid believes it is civil society who is best placed to influence the reform agenda and ensure that current momentum in political reform is maintained. Historically, CSOs in Myanmar were obliged to restrict their activities mainly to service delivery due to the restrictive environment
[normal],
[normal] as well as the denial of basic services provision by the military to its citizens. Decentralisation of government power provides civil society with an important opportunity to engage with government, its delivery of services and the decentralisation reforms, and to ensure citizens’ voices shape the agenda. CSOs need technical support to learn how to influence authorities around consultative and rights-based policymaking, and to hold them accountable on their obligations.  They are also best-placed to enable and educate citizens with regard to their rights.  Support for these processes can help government at all levels to improve capacity, accountability, efficiency, and responsiveness.  DFID is encouraged to channel technical and financial support to 
[normal]Myanmar
[normal] civil society to enable them to fulfil this potential.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4[bold] 
[normal]Investment in Myanmar civil society is a pathway towards long-term sustainability, but CSO’s need more support to access funding opportunities.  [bold]The success of Christian Aid support to civil society capacity building can be measured in terms of our partners’ track records in accessing institutional funds directly. An example is Metta Development Foundation’s securing of funds from the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) a multi-donor scheme established in 2009 in Myanmar, with technical support from Christian Aid, which was a major step forward for the organisation. However, according to our partners opportunities for local organisations to access DFID funds have been limited.  It has also been their experience that differential criteria are applied due to the lack of confidence in the capacities and capabilities of local organisations.  This could be remedied by initiating a dialogue with NGOs in advance of issuing calls for proposals in order to better identify needs and priorities, and by making provision for building such capacities so as to enable civil society organisations to compete on a level playing field along with other International NGOs.  However, in the interim, we recognise that until such capacities are built, civil society organisations may not in all instances be able to manage such funds. During this period INGOs can play an important role in mentoring by leading consortiums and acting as accountable grant holders, enabling the building of local skills and capabilities. 
[normal]Christian Aid
[normal] believes that DFID not only needs to recognise the critical role of civil society in enabling the voices of the poor to be heard when defining policy but that they also proactively enable the growth of civil society.  
[normal]2.5[bold] The DFID country plan for Myanmar focuses on four main areas: wealth creation, governance and security, health, education and humanitarian. While these areas are largely in line with Christian Aid’s own priorities, Christian Aid’s experience globally is that these ambitions will not be met without the emergence of a dynamic civil society, a prerequisite for transformative change. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.1[bold] 
[normal]DFID’s commitment to funding for refugee assistance remains important[bold].   DFID’s support for The Border Consortium’s (TBC’s) food, shelter and capacity building assistance in the refugee camps of Thailand has been critical in maintaining access to asylum. A recent increase in DFID funding was an important contribution to the process of building preparedness for the potential return and reintegration of refugees. While there is general agreement that the conditions in South East Myanmar are not yet conducive to the return of refugees, an overall reduction in international support for refugees is also increasingly apparent. Christian Aid calls on DFID to provide leadership within the donor community to support continued investment for refugee assistance programmes. As the peace process deepens, and with political dialogue about transitional governance arrangements eagerly anticipated, maintaining assistance levels is essential to provide the environment for refugees to be an active part of defining their own return and reintegration. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2[bold] 
[normal]C[bold]hristian [bold]A[bold]id[bold] believes that working within Myanmar[bold],[bold] as well as cross-border from Thailand[bold],[bold] [bold]should remain [bold]a key strategy[bold].  DFID’s support for civil society organisations based along the Thailand-Myanmar border has facilitated vital and life-saving assistance for conflict-affected communities in contested areas that could not previously be accessed and remain difficult to reach from Yangon. Given that only a few other governments have supported such border-based assistance, DFID is in a unique position to ensure that new opportunities for international agencies build on existing local capacities. This has potential implications not only for responding to critical humanitarian needs, but also in terms of building confidence in the conflict transformation and peace-building process.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.3 Christian Aid strongly recommends that[bold] 
[normal]DFID ensures that ethnic communities are consulted, and can participate in an informed way with equal status in the development of strategies for peace. [bold]Over the past 2 years the Thein Sein government has negotiated cease-fire agreements with a number of the ethnic non-state armed actors. It is vital however that peace-building move beyond individual cease-fire agreements that focus primarily on military interests to a national, broad-based political dialogue involving all stakeholders. The meaningful participation of communities and their organisations in this process will be essential to build a just and sustainable peace. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.[bold]4[bold] DFID’s continued funding of service delivery type interventions that provide an entry point for wider discussions around peace building and democratisation is essential. [bold]  Christian Aid has been operating a DFID-funded Emergency Health Care programme with marginalised and vulnerable populations, focusing on promoting   health sector investment in building trust, partnership and ultimately improved coordination across the range of official and unofficial health care providers in a conflict affected and still unstable area of Myanmar.  
[normal]A recent DFID review of the project recognised the value and importance of integration of the health systems as a vital entry point for broader discussions around wider peace building.  It stated that ‘health can lead the way in a transition process through practical actions aimed at delivering a neutral service.
[normal] CA strongly recommends that DFID continues to fund such work to ensure the opportunity for coalescing around a specific topic is maintained 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.5[bold] 
[normal]DFID support to grassroots peace-building efforts in Myanmar is strongly encouraged, to ensure that the current peace process and political negotiations will be increasingly responsive and accountable to ethnic minority rights in order to create conditions for long lasting peace and national reconciliation in Myanmar.[bold] Recent research, by Christian Aid and our partner Gender Development Initiative, looked at the participation of women in the peace process and highlighted that both women and men do not have the knowledge, confidence, skills or mechanisms to engage meaningfully in the peace process. Despite being disproportionately affected by the armed conflict due to prevailing social norms, women are even less likely to be consulted or invited to participate in any space that exists. As a result we are working with our partner to build capacities for peace and democratic governance at community level in order to empower people to be able to meaningfully participate in these processes. Support for such initiatives is crucial to ensure reform and political negotiations are fully inclusive and grounded in the realities of the poor and marginalised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6[bold]   
[normal]Efforts towards peace must address unresolved grievances and conflicts.  [bold]DFID’s collaboration with the FCO during the process of linking actors from Myanmar with the experiences of conflict transformation in Northern Ireland has been a good example of how political and development concerns can be jointly addressed, However, the government’s inability to implement preliminary ceasefire agreements has undermined the confidence of ethnic communities and non-state armed groups alike in the peace process. DFID’s efforts to expand humanitarian access will be adversely affected unless FCO diplomacy addresses the Tatmadaw’s (The Military Armed Forces) on-going militarisation of contested areas. Similarly, in the longer term, FCO diplomacy to highlight the links between some kind of truth and reconciliation process addressing past abuses will be important for the sustainability of the democratisation and peace-building processes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. Support for Responsible Investment[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1[bold] 
[normal]It is vital that DFID plays a role in ensuring ethical and responsible foreign investment that is people-centred and does not further marginalise, exploit and displace ethnic communities, nor jeopardise the fragile peace process. [bold]The recent political changes have opened Myanmar to foreign investment following the easing of trade and investment sanctions. Local and foreign investment is reported to have increased fivefold in 2012/13
[normal] and there is a real desire to invest in the country.  Whilst this represents significant economic development opportunities; there are also already examples of investment exacerbating existing tensions and ethnic conflict. The planned construction of dams on the Salween River in Shan State, Kayah State and Karen State from Chinese, Thai and Myanmar corporations is obstructing the peace negotiations between the KNU and the Myanmar Army
[normal]. Increased militarization by the Myanmar Army at the dam site and their neglect for the concerns of affected communities have heightened military tensions, with large scale displacement of  people in areas adjacent to the dam site, as well as human rights abuses such forced labour, illegal taxation and rape. A recent report highlights that good governance is key to ensuring new economic opportunities improve lives for all, rather than contribute to greater marginalisation of poor communities
[normal]. The UK government with DFID leadership could play an important role in supporting the development of the private sector and entrepreneurs in Myanmar, advocating for responsible and ethical investment and linking them to UK investment. In addition, DFID should ensure any UK investment in Myanmar is bound by these same standards and works in favour of the poor and marginalised.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.   Funding [bold]M[bold]odalities[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1 Christian Aid maintains that bi-lateral funding and support still remains relevant in the Myanmar context.[bold]  The shift away from bi-lateral funding towards more multi donor funding bodies poses various challenges.  While more money is made available through these schemes, they currently do not provide the same level of flexibility afforded by DFID’s bilateral funding. The 3MDG fund for example, focuses on vertical approaches to addressing diseases which evidence suggests does not produce as good an outcome as a holistic and integrated response to community health based on community need. Evidence suggests this approach is both less effective in terms of health outcomes and less efficient in terms of funding and value for money. In addition these funding streams focus solely on health outcomes, rather than a more nuanced approach which ensures service delivery interventions as an entry point to wider peace building discussions and initiatives. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2 Christian Aid believes DFID should influence multi donor funds to be more flexible and creative in the way they allocate funding.[bold] [bold]Existing multi donor mechanisms often compromise policy positions and impose certain restrictions, such as registration, as a requirement for applicants, thus excluding the excellent existing cross border work that DFID currently supports. This type of work, as highlighted earlier in this submission, has an essential role in bringing different actors together to discuss ways forward for the development of an integrated health system – thus a great example of how service delivery interventions can support groups to coalesce around an issue as a wider peace building strategy. Finally, DFID should use its influence to ensure that multi donor funding schemes to which it subscribes do not exclude support to proven successful development initiatives, enable greater flexibility and opportunities to be creative.
