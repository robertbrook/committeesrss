"&#xa0;\nDr Denise Hawkes â€“ Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEconomic growth has long been measured by the rate of growth in GDP per capita. As a starting point, this measure of growth allows for the comparisons between countries with a standard approach to the types of information collected and in general a standardised approach taken across national government statistical agencies in generating this headline value. Whilst for regulations related to the macroeconomy and things closely linked to it this measure maybe appropriate, for regulators such as the Care Quality Commission, Equality and Human Rights Commission and environmental regulators, reference to the effect on GDP per capita may not prove as useful as to other measures of economic performance and development. In this brief paper I will suggest three alternative ways to look at economic growth more broadly and why these maybe preferable to the more standard GDP per capita measure.\n&#xa0;\n1) Focusing not on Economic Growth but on the key inputs to economic growth: human capital and investment. Since Aghion and Howitt (1998) brought together the literature on endogenous growth theory, there has been more of a focus on the components of economic growth: human capital and investment. A framework that focused on these key inputs could help to reduce the spillover effects of a drive to focus exclusively at economic growth possibly at the expense of equally important measures of the quality of life and well being. Human capital could be defined broadly including measures of education and health, which would be of importance to the longer term economic growth of the economy. This would be important to reduce the overly tight straight jacket that a pure focus on GDP per capita/economic growth would impose on regulations sensitive to child development and maternal well being. It would allow the flexibility to build in a longer term view of the potential benefits of a regulation which if evaluated in the short run could have impact on economic growth if narrowly defined. Similarly a broad definition of investment could ensure a representation of environmental and social impact which would enable regulators in this area to trade off between a short term economic growth impact and potential long run growth benefits.\n&#xa0;\n2) Using the Human Development Index for non economic regulators instead. The Human Development Index includes: measures of life expectancy, education and GDP per capita and is traditionally used in development economics. As with 1) this broader measure of the development of the economy would enable non-economic regulators to include a reflection on the impacts on health and education, both of which would ensure that regulation took account of the wider impact than just pure short run economic growth and enable a longer run view to be used. For example an environmental regulation looking to increase the use of renewable energy could include a consideration of the health benefits to population would important determinant of life expectancy.\n&#xa0;\n3) Using a framework like the Australian Bureau of Statistics's, Measures of Australia's Progress. This framework takes a very wide view of the state of the Australia economy including measures of society, economy and the environment. Whilst this particular framework may be too wide to make it effective and useable by non-economic regulators when considering economic growth impacts of policies, it does show that such frameworks to consider economic growth more widely are available and designable.\n&#xa0;\nThe use of a wider framework would be desirable especially when looking at the roles of non-economic regulatory bodies especially when focused on the effects on child development and maternal opportunities. A focus on the pure economic growth without reflecting a wider framework to include measures of human capital and environment could mean too many potentially long run beneficial regulations falling by the way side as they fail this tight constraint. For example, if regulations were being considered around the ratio's of children to staff in early child care settings did not take into account the development of the children and focused only on the economic growth aspect then it is likely to over estimate the number of children a grown up can assist and therefore damage the long term growth due to a poor investment in human capital of the next generation. A wider definition of economic growth would ensure the voices of the next generation are included in the design of regulations.\n&#xa0;\nDr Denise Hawkes\nSenior lecturer in social economics\nInstitute of Education, University of London\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3 September 013\n&#xa0;\n"
