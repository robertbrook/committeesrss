[[[ June 2013]]]Thank you for your letter to the Security Service, dated 29 May, seeking further information regarding the tragic events in Woolwich on 22 May as part of the Home Affairs Select Committee's inquiry into countering international terrorism and crime.&#xa0;There has been considerable and understandable Parliamentary and media attention around this attack. For that reason the Prime Minister made a statement to the House on 3 June 2013 confirming that a thorough investigation would be conducted by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament (ISC), chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind MP. The ISC is able to receive and consider a wide range of sensitive material from Government departments and agencies, and we have recently expanded its remit and strengthened its role through the Justice and Security Act 2013. The Committee will undertake a detailed review and we would expect this to cover all aspects of this attack, including the issues you have raised and those relating to wider law enforcement and security agencies.&#xa0;The Foreign Secretary and I believe that the ISC is the appropriate forum to consider these matters, and we are confident that its investigation will be comprehensive and robust. I hope you will appreciate that we are keen to avoid opening a dual track approach to Parliamentary scrutiny, or providing a running commentary which could prejudice what is an ongoing investigation likely to result in a criminal prosecution. On this basis we have decided to decline your request for this information.&#xa0;I am copying this letter to Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Andrew Parker.Rt Hon Theresa May MPHome SecretaryJune 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
