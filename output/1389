[normal]Responses to Questions[bold]Res
[normal]ponses have been provided to questions that are pertinent to PML’s research and expertise.
[normal]What types of CCS technology are currently being developed and how do they differ from one another? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]What contribution could CCS make towards the UK’s decarbonisation targets? Are the UK Government’s expectations reasonable in this regard?
[normal]Are there any potential benefits (e.g. the ability to export CCS technology abroad) of successfully dev
[normal]eloping CCS to the UK economy and, if so, what are they?

[normal]What are the main barriers (e.g. economic, political, regulatory, scientific and social) to developing large-scale integrated CCS projects in the UK and internationally? How can they be overcome? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Are there any safety issues ass
[normal]ociated with capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide? How could they be overcome? Who should have responsibility for ensuring these activities are safe? 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? 
[normal]Is the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?
[normal]Could the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in 
[normal]this?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]What ar
[normal]e the consequences of failing to develop CCS and what alternatives are available for decarbonisation if CCS fails?
