default&#xa0;
defaultHow have other countries incentivised CCS development? How successful have they been? How do they compare to the UK’s efforts? 
defaultIs the UK Government’s approach, set out in its CCS Roadmap, likely to incentivise development of CCS in the UK?
defaultCould the successful development of CCS improve international efforts to mitigate climate change? What role could UK CCS play in 
defaultthis?
