[[[Introduction – The CPA]]]1.1&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This document is submitted to the Committee considering the Deregulation Bill on behalf of the Compulsory Purchase Association (

[[[CPA]]]). 1.2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Association’s objective is to work for the public benefit in relation to compulsory purchase and compensation in all its forms. This includes promoting the highest professional standards amongst practitioners at all levels and participating in debate as to matters of current interest in compulsory purchase and compensation. 1.3&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CPA has some 500 members practising in this field, including surveyors, lawyers, accountants, planners and officers of public authorities.   This consultation response has been formulated following discussions within the National Committee of the CPA.  1.4&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The CPA has reviewed the Deregulation Bill and the call for evidence and has no specific comment on the Bill's content.  It believes that the proposal below would meet the purposes of the long title of the Bill, namely to reduce the burdens resulting from legislation for businesses and other organisations; and to  make provision for the repeal of legislation which no longer has practical use.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Material detriment on vested land]]]&#xa0;2.1              Where an acquiring authority exercise powers by service of Notice to Treat and Notice of Entry and seeks to acquire only part of an interest, Section 8 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 gives the right for the Tribunal to require the acquiring authority to purchase the whole if part cannot be taken without material detriment to the remainder. &#xa0;2.2              The 1965 Act provides that the claimant can serve notice under Section 8 requiring the acquiring authority to acquire the entirety of the interest. &#xa0;2.3              There is no prescribed process but the acquiring authority can still take possession of the land in question and commence the scheme works.&#xa0;2.4              If the acquiring authority instead chooses to acquire land by the "modern" proves of a vesting declaration under the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting declarations) Act 1981, a different process applies. &#xa0;2.5              Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 dis-applies S8 and specifies a procedure. &#xa0;2.6              Where Notice of the Intention to make a GVD is served in respect of less than the entire interest held by a claimant, if the claimant believes that it will suffer material detriment through only the part of its interest being acquired, the Act provides that the Claimant is entitled to serve a ‘notice of objection to severance’. &#xa0;2.7              The notice of objection seeks to have the entirety of the claimant’s interest acquired instead of just the part of the interest that the acquiring authority has identified in its Notice of Intention. This notice has to be served within 21 days of the Notice of Intention, in accordance with Para 2 (1) of Schedule 1 of the Act. &#xa0;2.8              The key problem is the land proposed to be severed does not vest nor can possession be taken until material detriment is determined by the Lands Chamber of the Upper Tribunal or accepted by the acquiring authority. This can have serious consequences in terms of both cost and the timing of the delivery of the scheme.&#xa0;2.9               At the present time, and traditionally, a reference to the Lands Chamber could take a well over a year before a hearing to determine the issue is held and a decision given. In consequence, delivery of the scheme can be delayed for a year or more and that delay almost invariably results in a substantial increase in cost for the scheme under construction.&#xa0;2.10              This programme risk makes the vesting of part of an interest an unacceptable risk to acquiring authorities unless they are prepared to acquire the whole of the relevant land at the outset. &#xa0;2.11              The service of a notice of objection to severance should not prevent either the vesting of title to the land in question that is required for the scheme in the acquiring authority (or possession being taken of that interest in land by the authority so as to enable the scheme works to continue). However in the event of the claimant and the acquiring authority not being able to reach agreement as to whether or not the entirety of the interest in question should be acquired, the claimant should still have the right to refer the dispute to the Lands Chamber for determination of whether the whole of their interest should be taken in exactly the same way that Section 8 of the CPA 1965 operates.&#xa0;2.12              The proposal is that the GVD Schedule 1 process should be brought into line with the CPA 1965 Section 8 approach by repealing paragraph 3 of Schedule1 to the 1981 Act (which says land does not vest nor can possession be taken until material detriment determined by the Tribunal or accepted by the acquiring authority.) &#xa0;2.13              Minor consequential amendments to the remainder of Schedule 1 are required. &#xa0;2.14              The proposal would mean the claimant would therefore be in exactly the same position following vesting as with notice to treat/entry in so far as the timing of determination of material detriment. The claimant will suffer no disadvantage by this proposed reform whilst the project will be able to proceed as planned, and as intended by Parliament on the granting of compulsory purchase powers for the scheme in question.&#xa0;
