Thank you very much for coming. The subject of our inquiry has \ncoincidentally\n captured some media\n attention, with a piece on \nregional BBC news the night before last\n and\n on the BBC \n“\nInside Out\n” programme on TB\n \ni\nn London\n,\n and today the Wellcome Trust on Radio 4 \nwas \ntalking about antimicrobial\n resistance as well. F\nrom discussions we have had with Dame Sally Davies\n,\n we realise that t\nhis is an area of some \nconcern, so w\ne want to cover a \nnumber of aspects \nthis morning\n.\n \nJ\nust for the record\n,\n I would be grateful if the four of you would introduce yourselves very briefly.\nProfessor Kessel: \nI am Professor Anthony \nKessel\n. I am director of public health strategy and the responsible officer at Public Health \nEngland\n. I also have a chair at\n the London School of\n Hygiene and\n Tropical Medicine.\nDr Moore: \nI am Michael Moore\n. I am a general practitioner. \nI have been a GP in \nSalisbury\n for 26 years. I al\nso hold a research post at the U\nniversity of Southampton. I am here today as I am representing the Royal College of General Practitioners. I am their national clinical champion for antimicrobial stewardship.\nProfessor Holmes: I am Alison Holmes. I am \nprofessor of i\nnfectious diseases at Imperial C\nollege London\n,\n and I am also a director of infection prevention and control within the NHS.\nDr Hopkins: \nMy name is Susan Hopkins and I am a consultant in infectious diseases and \nmicrobiology at the Royal Free H\nospital in London. I also work with Public Health \nEngland\n as a healthcare epidemiologist. I am here today representing the Royal College of Physicians as chair of their HCAI working group.\n&#xa0;\nQ40 &#xa0; \nChair: Thank you very much. First of all\n, a straightforward question: w\nho is currently accountable for ensuring adherence to the Department of Health policies for reducing antimicrobial resistance? \nDr Hopkins: At an NHS level—\nfrom the p\noint of view within the NHS—\nthe Health and Social Care Act 2008\n,\n updated in 2011\n,\n clearly gives responsibility for health\n \ncare\n&#x2011;\nassociated\n infections, antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship to the chief responsible officer, the chief executive of those organisations. There is also a personal responsibility within \nthe\n Health and Social Care Act for everyone working in health\n \ncare to prevent infection spreading from one patient to the other and to make sure that they use antibiotics as prudently as possible.\nProfessor Holmes: \nWithin acute care and acute hospitals, the structure is such that the chief executive is responsible for the delivery of that\n,\n but there is a director of infec\ntion prevention and control who\n reports directly to the chief executive\n,\n with the responsibility of addressing infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship within that trust.\n&#xa0;\nQ41 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWe hear of clinician\n&#x2011;\nfocused\n initiatives like \n“Start Smart—Then F\nocus\n”\n. How effective are initiatives like that in dealing with issues like antimicrobial resistance?\nProfessor Holmes: \nWe welcome \nsuch \ninitiatives\n.\n. I particularly welcome initiatives such as that\n,\n because it actually focuses on the principles of good prescribing rather than the kind of technical expertise of which drug, what type of organism\n; \nit \nactually \nfocuses on safe and best practice\n,\n which means that it is much more amenable to all of t\nhose involved in \nprescribing\n antibiotics,\n administering antibiotics or caring for patients on antibiotics. That type of approach is extremely welcome, but we must remi\nnd ourselves that it is not a policy;\n it is a guideline\n. I\nt is a framework that can be adopted to promote best practice within acute care. I \nwelcome the fact that it emphasises best practice and p\nrinciples of good prescribing. \nWe have used it locally to promote multi\n&#x2011;\nprofessional\n engagement, so it is not just for doctors who prescribe; it is for nurses who look after\n,\n and \nit is \nfor pharmacists who are involved in the managing of drugs. \nI\nt has been a useful external reinforcement. \nDr Hopkins: O\nne of the key things is ensuring that we get the best agent to the patient up\n \nfront to reduce morbidity and mortality from sepsis, so we often start broadly. One of the key things in \n“Start Smart—Then F\nocus\n”\n is focusing down after two to three days of treatment into a n\narrow agent that has less \nimpact on both the microbiology in the individual patient \nand\n the microbiology in the environment of the hospital that can then \nlead to\n onward transmission events within hospitals. One of the things about \n“Start S\nmart\n—Then F\nocus\n”\n is that it focuses the need for good microbiology and diagnostics up\n \nfront and requires people to think about\n what they need at the start. It requires\n education and train\ning of individuals to know \nthe right tests to do when a\nn unwell\n pa\ntient comes into hospital\n. \nProfessor Holmes: \nIt is altering the message slightly, which I think is really important. This is not all about control of antibiotics; it is access to effective antibiotics\n, so \nstarting sma\nrt is a critical component\n. What we need, though, is teeth around these things. This is a \nvery useful \nguideline\n, \nbut it would be useful to have a little bit more regulation\n.\n I am speaking for acute trusts\n,\n and my collea\ngue can talk about primary care,\n but in terms of acute trusts it would be quite useful if we started to look at process indicators and best practice\n, and got a \nbit more teeth around what is good pra\nctice. A\nt the end of \n“Start Smart” there i\ns a variety of guidelines, but it would be useful if we could tell trusts that they need to deliver on this.\n&#xa0;\nQ42 &#xa0; \nChair: I\ns the message the same\n \ni\nn primary care?\nDr Moore: \nIt is complicated in primary care because you are talking about individual practitioners who are self\n&#x2011;\nemployed\n. T\nhey sit in their office\n,\n and they are the people controlling the prescription pad, as it were. They are much more distant from these kinds of \ninitiatives and regulation. I\nt is much more difficult to influence them. We have obviously made attempts with the \nTARGET\n website, which is a collection of educational tools for GPs to teach them about more rational prescribing, but we cannot force people to do these things and we cannot force them to change. It is much more difficult to influence individual GPs\n,\n and at the moment there are not\n any regulatory approaches that\n do that.\n&#xa0;\nQ43 &#xa0; \nChair: Have \nthe new structures that have been e\nstablished in the NHS \nhelped or hindered this process?\nDr Moore: I\nt has disrupted continuity and it is less clear now \non \nthe mechanisms for influence than it was before. I am sure things will sort themselves out with time, but when there were PCTs there were prescribing advisers within the\nm\n and they communicated with the GPs in their patch, whereas \nnow \nthey have b\neen made homeless; they are \nfinding themselves, I think, back in Public Health England. A big organisational change is disruptive, so I do not think at the moment we are quite clear how to influence GPs. They are contracted through the area teams, which is NHS England work\ning through the area teams. \nI anticipate that in time they will be looking at things like antimicrobial stewardship\n,\n but at the moment that is not at the top of their priority list.\n&#xa0;\nQ44 &#xa0; \nChair: \nWho has the responsibility overall to pull that together?\nDr Moore: \nI guess that resides with NHS England\n, which then contract \nGPs through the area teams.\n&#xa0;\nQ45 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nDo you think that current undergraduate medical courses focus enough on antimicrobial resistance\n, and,\n if not, what should be done about it, please?\nDr Hopkins: \nThe\n first thing to say is that \nundergraduate medical courses are at the moment both regulated and have standards applied by the General Medical Council. I reviewed the curricula for those courses recently\n,\n and what the GMC says is that they should have some training in microbiology, and microbiology obviously includes looking at micro\n-\norganisms and resistance. It also mentions that it is important to understand the principles of infection prevention and control\n,\n and antibiotic prescribing. \nW\ne know that there is variability in the \nnumber \nof hours of training that are given to medical students across the country. It is an area that has had various amounts of attention\n,\n depending on the s\nkills that the university set. \nPotentially there is an opportunity now with the AMR strategy to bring this to the fore, both with the General Medical Council and with Health Education England\n,\n \nand \ntalk to them about strengthening that area of their curriculum. Obviously every area of the curriculum fights for its support and i\nts necessary niche, but \nit i\ns an area that cross\n&#x2011;\ncuts\n all\n the delivery of medicine\n,\n \nin that\n we know that every individual who works as a doctor will prescribe an antibiotic du\nring their day\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nday life. I\nt could be \nstrengthened, but it is \nin the curriculum at \npresent\n.\n&#xa0;\nQ46 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nWho \nd\no you think should be responsible for the curriculum content of medical degrees?\nDr Hopkins: \nThe General Medical Council is a very good place to start with the curriculum content\n,\n as they are responsible for doctors and for their revalidation in the future. Health Education England\n’\ns new role of delivering an effective work\n \nforce has to start to develop what it wants undergraduate curricula to look like across the board for health work\n \nforce delivery. \nThe GMC set the standards and review\n the universities\n—attend universities and review whether\n they are meeting the minimum standards that are required\n—\nbut the question is whether those standards need to be enhanced at the moment to make sure that we bring this\n,\n as an area of patient safety\n,\n \nacross the board and improve i\nt for undergraduate health\n \ncare.\n&#xa0;\nQ47 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nMuch of the Government\n’\ns antimicrobial resistance strategy, perhaps naturally\n, focused on increasing supply—\nlooking at new ways of finding antibiotics and looking at encouraging\n drug companies to produce them.\n \nW\nould you agree that we should be looking at reducing demand much more and looking at some of the other options that are currently available, perhaps not tested as much as other drugs, such as acupuncture, herbal medicine and possi\nbly hom\neopathic medicine, which is used widely outside this country? What do you think \nabout reducing demand through looking at other options\n,\n and should more research money be spent on these topics?\nProfessor Kessel: One of the good opportunities in\n the new strategy is co\n&#x2011;\nordination around professional education and public awareness. That goes not just for doctors, both undergraduate and postgraduate\n—\nwe have only talked about undergraduate medicine here\n—\nbut across other health\n \ncare professionals who are all involved in antimicro\nbial resistance and play a part.\n Public Health England will play a big role in \nthe \nco\n&#x2011;\nordination of that improved professional education. In relation to your question about other ways of reducing demand, I think, yes, one of those includes greater public awareness\n, so that the public—patients—\nmake \nfewer\n unnecessary demands, or inappropriate demands, for antibiotics. \nI\nt is important in terms of what is prov\nided that it is evidence based—\nthat you are providing treatment or interventions that are evidence based. Some of the things that are encouraged in the strategy around alternatives to antibiotics include vaccines against bacteria and more work on diagnostics that can assist \nin \nappropriate prescribing and those kinds of things.\nProfessor Holmes: \nCould I pick up on the education questions and expand \non what my colleague was saying?\n \nT\nhe GMC is responsible\n,\n but the universities can deliver that in a \nvariety\n of ways\n,\n and some UKCRC\n&#x2011;\nfunded\n work has just demonstrated the enormous variability in the education provided in our medical schools, from a range of five hours to over 240 hours in \nthis domain. I\nt is there, \nbut \nthere is a huge amount of variability\n,\n and this \nis\n looking at antibi\notic safety and antibiotic use \nas a kind of core aspect of training that\n maybe goes across \nall people involved in health\n \ncare. We are talking about medical students here, but we should also be talking about our pharmacists and nurses as well\n,\n perhaps having some kind of core principles\n,\n and then, on top of that, different types of education depending on the profession a\nnd the type of development the \nindividual needs. There is enormous variability, but we can do a lot more \nto\n improve it\n,\n and look at innovation and how we teach as well.\nDr Moore: \nI \nwant\n to come back to the alternative treatments for symptoms. Most antibiotics in this country are prescribed in primary care\n—\n80% is the estimated amount\n—\nand most of those are for respiratory tract infections\n,\n which are self\n&#x2011;\nlimiting. It has been shown that antibiotics make very little difference to th\ne outcome from those infections. P\neople still go \nto see their doctor \nbecause they \nare very uncomfortable and \nhave distressing symptoms\n,\n which last two or three weeks\n, and a\nt the moment the \ndoctor’s \ndominant strategy is to issue \na prescription. Around 80% to \n90% of the time\n,\n a prescription for antibiotics is still issued. \nO\nbviously there are alternative things that we have looked at\n,\n li\nke using delayed prescriptions, \nbut another potential strategy is to offer somethi\nng for symptom relief. T\nhere is an urgent need to look for alternative ways of providing symptom relief. People go to their do\nctor with symptoms and they anticipate\n \ngetting \nsomething to help them. At the moment there is not much in the cupboard and people go to antibiotics, although we really are pretty sure that t\nhey do not make any difference—\nor \nvery little difference—\nto the duration of symptoms.\n&#xa0;\nQ48 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nJust to make sure I understood it correctly, the most common use of them, you said, is for respiratory infections.\nDr Moore: \nYes. \n&#xa0;\nQ49 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nEverybody knows, apparently, that they do not work, so who is prescribing them?\nDr Moore: \nThey are being prescribed by GPs in their surgeries.\n&#xa0;\nQ50 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nAre they not aware of what everybody else knows?\nDr Moore: \nIt is a complicated interaction and at the mo\nment there are few alternatives.\n \nYou might \nsay, \n“\nWhy do\nn’t people just\n stop prescribing them?\n”\n, but that does not happen\n,\n so we have to find other ways of helping that hap\npen. You can do it by saying, “T\nhere is a d\nifferent way. Wait a few days. W\ne a\nre using a delayed prescription.” W\ne can use near\n&#x2011;\npatient\n tests\n,\n which per\nhaps focus on the people who \nneed antibiotics\n,\n and we can find alternative symptom r\nelievers. \nOne of the things people worry about \nis complications;\n I think there wa\ns something in the paper today about \nsomebody who did not get antibiotics and then died as a result of pneumonia. \nWhen people\n go to the doctor\n with a bad cough,\n feeling pretty terrible\n,\n \nthey are worried\n \nthat \nthey \nare \ngoing to get pneumonia. The doctor really does not know if they are going to get pneumonia or not. It is the same if you have a very bad sore throat: are you going to get an abscess in your throat? \nO\nne of the drivers of that continued prescribing is being risk averse, worryin\ng about potential complications, so, “\nI will give you these antibiotics because I do not want you to get one of those bad complications.\n” W\ne need to get much more sophisticated about sp\notting the people who really \nneed the antibiotics and the majority who simply do not need them. \nA\nnother focus for research \nis \nto try and do that, but it is difficult. It is not as easy as you might think to spot those people.\nDr Hopkins: It is appropriate versus \ninappropriate antibiotic prescribing\n; \nwe talk about this a lot. It is very easy in retrospect to describe inappropriate prescribing\n,\n because you have seen how the patient\n has gone over a few days. I\nn a way, managing antibiotics in hospital comes under that measure\n,\n because we monitor the patient daily for a few days. That is why \n“Start Smart—Then F\nocus\n”\n works\n;\n at two days\n,\n you can make that intervention. Where the majority of antibiotics are prescribed\n,\n in general practice\n,\n you have a 10\n&#x2011;\nminute interaction\n,\n you will not see the patient again and they can potentially get much worse. It is about understanding\n,\n first of all\n,\n which patients are likely to get worse and, \nsecondly\n, delivering strategies that are acceptable to patients. Patient acceptability is quite important in all of this as well\n. The aspect\n where we need research\n, \nou\ntside of development of new drugs, is \npoint\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\ncare\n tests that are acceptable to patients that will help us diagnose a virus from a bacteria\n,\n because you cannot do that simply by looking at a patient. We know that 80\n% to \n90% are viruses, but we do not know the 10\n% to \n20% that are not\n,\n when the patient is in front of us.\n&#xa0;\nQ51 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nIs part of it to retain the confidence of the patient? They\n expect to get a prescription and \nthey get a prescription\n,\n even though it is medically dubious.\nDr Moore: \nNot all of them are expecting a prescription. In fact, one of the things you can do is to explore the expectations of the patient\n,\n and we have shown that training in communication skills is one way of reduc\ning antibiotic prescribing. T\nhere are ways of dealing with that but you have to get people to pick up and implement these things at practice level. \nChair: \nWe are going to come back to this theme in a moment.\n&#xa0;\nQ52 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nBriefly\n,\n just to go back to my suggestion that we should be looking at other options m\nore thoroughly, according to a\n briefing we have received, \n“\nP\nrimary\n C\nare\n R\nesearch\n P\nrojects on\n H\nerbal\n M\nedicine in\n I\nnfectious\n D\nisease\n,\n”\n already \n“\nA number of research projects with implications for AMR, particularly around herbal treatment, are in progress at the National School for Primary Care Research.\n”\n These include one on a herb called \nUva\n \nursi\n \nfor\n acute urinary tract infection and another relating to \nprobiotics\n and vitamin D and infections. Do you not think\n this is the big clue \nthat we should be spending more money on looking at remedies that have been with us for thousands of years\n,\n rather than spending so much money looking at new treatments? They are staring us in the face\n,\n so why do\nn’t we \ndo more research on treatments that have been available for thousands of years?\nDr Moore: \nI am the chief investigator of the \nUva\n \nursi\n study, so you are \ntrying to convince\n the wrong person really. I lead that research. \nDavid Tredinnick: \nSo you are very much\n involved\n, well recently obviously\n—\n \nDr Moore: \nYes.\nDavid Tredinnick: \nThank you very much. \n&#xa0;\nQ53 &#xa0; \nChair: \nBefore we move\n on, can I \nask how involved is Health Education England in respect of the medical curric\nulum as far as AMR is concerned, a\nnd\n,\n at the opposite end of the spectrum\n,\n are doctors coming into the NHS from other countries sufficiently well versed in dealing with our approach to AMR?\nDr Hopkins: \nI will take the second \npart \nfirst\n,\n as it is easier in my day\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nday job to understand what we do. When doctors come into the UK\n,\n they register with the General Medical Council showing that they have standard competencies to achieve that registration. Once they are within the system\n,\n every doctor starting within the NHS system in health\n \ncare\n,\n \nin \nhospit\nals or in a training programme—\nthat includes GP training programmes or any train\ning programme within hospitals—has\n a minimum\n,\n mandatory day that they have to cover\n; i\nt includes infection prevention and control\n and\n antimicrobial stewardship as a basic minimum on the day they start. The curricula for all hospital doctors \nall \ninclude basic requirements on microbiology infection control and antimicrobials stewardship\n,\n and it is required that they have this knowledge and awareness as they are progressing t\nhrough the system. All the post\ngraduate \nexams have some aspect of this\n. \nCould it be strengthened? Of course. I am speaking as an infectious diseases physician; I obviously believe it should have gr\neat priority on all the post\ngraduate curricula\n. W\ne push for that as the Royal College of Physicians\n,\n a\nnd have pushed to strengthen i\nt throughout all of the curricula at the Royal Colleg\ne of Physicians. It is there;\n it is present. I would never say it \nwas\n enough\n,\n but that is coming from the area that I am in. \nNow\n is an opportunity to make sure that we have raised awareness again with people who are not specialists in this area\n,\n to ensure that they understand why they should not prescribe, what are the unnecessary consequences and, in particular, to think about it as \na whole-\npopulation approach\n \nrather \nthan \njust the individual sitting in front of them. As doctors, we very much think about the individual in \nfront of us\n; \nantimicrobial resistance really focuses us to think about the population and the impact \na\n prescription may ha\nve on somebody down the line. \nWith respect to Health Education England, as a new organisation they have been very much focusing on postgraduate training across \nthe health care work force,\n as their remit is the NHS work\n \nforce. \nT\nhey are there to help\n to develop \nthe undergraduate curricula\n,\n and I look forward to their impact in this area.\nProfessor Kessel: \nThe education of professionals is complex and \nmultifactorial\n. On top of \nthe \neducational packages for doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others involved, there are\n—\nand the new strategy has provided\n—\na range of other educational material\ns\n being developed already\n. I\nn Public Health England\n,\n we are preparing prescribing quality guidelines for primary and secondary care. NICE\n, \nthe National Institute for Health and \nCare\n Excellence\n, \nalong with Public Health \nEngland\n,\n are already preparing new good practice guidance, clinical guidance and public healt\nh guidance—three sets of guidance—on\n antimi\ncrobial resistance. T\nhe strategy has enabled us to ramp up the priority attention that has been given to antimicrobial resistance\n, and \nprovides us w\nith an excellent opportunity. \nIn terms of Health \nEducation England and its role on \nthe professional educat\nion strand of the new strategy, \nthe overall co\n&#x2011;\nordination is falling to Public Health \nEngland\n.\n I am the policy lead for Public Health \nEngland\n,\n so \nI chair the co\n&#x2011;\nordination group, and\n Health Education England \nis\n on that group. Just \nas\n the strategy is only relatively new\n—\na few months\n—\nHealth Education England and indeed ourselves are relatively new\n,\n so we are settling down\n,\n but we\n,\n Public Health England\n,\n are absolutely dependent on working with partners like Health Education England to e\nnsure further improvements in\n prescribing education.\nProfessor Holmes: \nCould I expand on the perspective from the acute NHS trust side of things? Echoing what Susan says, acute hospitals have a framework\n, so i\nt does not matter w\nhere doctors join them from;\n they should have an infrastructure and a framework that actually supports, encourages and drives good prescribing around the principles of good prescribing. The other thing is that prescribers and doctors are not doing this in iso\nlation. \nThere is a mu\nltidisciplinary programme for\n how we look after antibiotics, monitor \nthem and\n ensure that best practice is there. \nI\nf the systems are there\n—\nthe trusts should have these systems in place\n—\nit really should not matter where doctors come from.\n&#xa0;\nQ54 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nDr Moore, you talked about the distance between initiatives and GPs. Is one way of narrowing that distance through the use of continued professional development\n—\nCPD\n—\nand how much control is there over what is studied as part of your continuous professional development\n?\n \nC\nould antimicrobial resis\ntance form a greater part of i\nt?\nDr Moore: That is the way forward. \nGPs are mandated to continue professional education. They have an annual appraisal process at which their educational attainments are discussed with an appraiser, but at the moment they are independent contractors and they choose, or choose with their appraiser, what their development needs are. I do not think at the moment that antimicrobial resistance and rational prescribing are high on the agenda. There are lots of other new thi\nngs, huge pressures and \na massive curriculum for GPs to try and keep up with\n,\n and they are probably pretty comfortable with their day\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\nday stuff. They have been in practice for 20 \nyears prescribing antibiotics; \npeople do not come back because they \nget better.\n \nT\nhey are not really thinking about looking in a critical way at their prescribing practice and \ndoing educational activities. \nO\nne of the difficulties\n is \nthat there will be \n100\n other things \nGPs will be \nasked to look at\n,\n and they will not be critically looking at their \nantibiotic prescribing. \nDame Sally Davies\n’s\n annual report highlighting antimicrobial resistance is really helpful and the strategy is helpful, but these are words on paper in Government offices and they do not \nreally filter down \nto the man or woman behind the desk with the prescribing pad.\n&#xa0;\nQ55 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: How do you change that—b\ny the assessor making it more of a priority? \nDr Moore: The mechanism for change would be \nsomehow \nto \nraise the priority level so that it is discussed in the ap\npraisal process and people \ntake up educational initiatives.\n&#xa0;\nQ56 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nWho is responsible for raising that priority?\nDr Moore: \nI do not know the mechanism, but you have someone \nhere \nwho knows the answer to that.\nProfessor Kessel: O\nne of the points being made is \nthat \nwe have, I believe, an ambitious and very important strategy, but we must not underestimate the enormity of the challenge of implementing \nit,\n and making the changes required nationally and internationally for what is a very significant problem. \nW\nhat Dr Moore has also highlighted is the gap between the strategy and its ambitions and the greater opportunity with implementation \nat ground level. \nI echo some of that as a former GP \nmys\nelf. \nT\nhe new system of revalidat\nion\n for doctors in this country that the General Medical Council introduced earlier this year\n—\nwhich \nin \nthe responsible officer part of my role I am responsib\nle for in Public Health England—\nprovide\ns \na really good opportunity\n \nto strengthen the appraisal process. A significant part of that\n—\nI am already seeing it through in the new style of appraisals that are required annually for every consultant, specialist and GP\n—\nis greater attention to continue\nd professional development. But,\n to my knowledge at the moment, there is not a way of specifying, \nwhichever specialty you are in—\npublic health ph\nysician or general practitioner—\nwhat should be in the CPD, what you should be doing. \nT\nhat is an opportunity. The \nRoyal C\nolleges and the Faculty of Public Health have a part\n to play in that, and I think i\nt is an interesting idea.\n&#xa0;\nQ57 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nBy mandating it, by making it obligatory.\nProfessor Kessel: \nOf influencing, yes.\n&#xa0;\nQ58 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: R\nevalidation, the appraisal system as it stands at the moment, will be different depending on who is carrying out that appraisal. It does not contain the same\n—\n \nProfessor Kessel: \nYes and no. The appraisal process, whichever specialty of medic\nine you are in—\nwhether you are a microbiologist, a general practitioner or \na public health physician—\ncovers the same domains of medical practice and areas of importance\n. \nWhen you go into the details of it with your appraiser, you will focus on the area\n relevant to your specialty. \nA\nntimicrobial resistance is obviously important whether you are a paediatrician, a public health physician, \nor \na GP and so forth.\nProfessor Holmes: T\nhere are enormous opportunities to use the appraisal and revalidation process\nes\n. \nW\ne are \ntalking just about medics here, \nbut \nI think \nwe can look at \nthe roles of all health professionals\n \nin \nthis\n.\n \nO\nne opportunity is also framing this in terms of patient safety and the quality of care. \nI\nt does not need to be a technical\n,\n s\neparate little bit of expertise. I\nt can be about the overall delivery of quality of care and patient safety\n,\n and you can frame that bit of the appraisal to fit in addressing antimicrobial resistance as an aspect of patient safety and quality of care\n. Y\nou can use that\n, and \nI think t\nhere are enormous opportunities.\n \nI\nn fact\n,\n that addresses one of the issues about stakeholder engagement, which is not just all about stakeholder engagement with the public\n, but \nstakeholder engagement with other health\n \ncare professionals\n. T\nhe appraisal and CPD mechanism may be a great opportunity.\n&#xa0;\nQ59 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nThank you for that. I take it, therefore, from your answers that there is at the moment no effective way of monitoring the use of ant\nimicrobials within GP practices.\n There is no national monitoring going on.\nDr Moore: \nTo some extent\n,\n there has been a policy to reduce the presc\nribing of some antibiotics that\n are associated with \nC. \ndiff infections\n—\nquinolones\n and \ncephalosporins\n. \nT\nhose things have been m\nonitored and fed back to practic\nes and there has been quite a dramatic change in \nthe \nprescribing \nof those antibiotics \nin primary care. \nI\nt is possible to specifically focus on an antibiotic and to deliver that through the quality mechanisms for primary care\n,\n and to implement change\n. I\nt is not entirely true that there is no mechanism. It is simply that general antimicrobial stewardship has not been part of one of those approaches.\n&#xa0;\nQ60 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: It works on individual specified drugs at the moment, rather than taking a wider view of use generally.\nDr Moore: \nYes.\n&#xa0;\nQ61 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nWith the examples you used \nfor\n C. diff, were \nthere \nor are there any consequences if you discovered that someone was continually overprescribing that particular antimicrobial?\nDr Moore: \nThe feedb\nack takes the form of a traffic-\nlight chart\n,\n and you are green, amber or red. I guess it is up to your professional standards\n,\n if you are persistently showing red on the traffic light\n,\n to change your behaviour or not, but there are n\not any sanctions for people who\n do not change their behaviour.\n&#xa0;\nQ62 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nDo you think there should be?\nDr Moore: T\nhe new mechanisms with CCGs are an opportunity\n,\n because they are slightly more grounded in practice\n,\n and I think that there will be greater pressures brought to bear as \na result of being in a CCG rather than a PCT\n.\n I am not a great fan of regulatory big\n&#x2011;\nstick\n approaches\n,\n but there may be a case for some kind of sanction for people \nwho\n persistently do that. \nP\neople will always say\n,\n \n“\nI did it in this instance\n,”\n and you do not know\n what the drivers are; \nyou are not the clinician in the consultation\n, and\n I think it is a mistake to have absolutes.\nProfessor Kessel: I\nt is a complex picture that you get in primary care\n—\nthe same goes for secondary care\n, to get a picture for us—\non the amount of antimicrobial resistance\n.\n \nW\ne will want to look at antibiotic prescribing\n,\n but also antibiotic usage\n,\n which might not be the same as prescribing\n.\n \nA\nlso the real end result, th\ne amount of resistance \nin infections in primary care\n,\n which will be different from secondary care\n,\n is equally important. Again, we do not have at the moment all those surveillance systems set up optimally, but the strategy provides us with the opportunity to work towards those\n,\n and we are. My experience has been that, thankfully, in this country we are not at a standing start in terms of our general surveillance systems for health\n \ncare\n&#x2011;\nassociated\n infectio\nns and antimicrobial resistance. W\ne have one of the best sets of systems in the world\n, and my experience, \ntravelling to other countries, is \nthat \noften we are the envy. But we are thinking about ways that we can share good practice. I was recently with the chief medical officer at the World Innovation Summit for Health conference. We were talking about ways that different countries could share their good practices, fo\nr instance around surveillance—\nboth high i\nncome and low income countries—\nwhich is I think something we have to do.\nProfessor Holmes: I want to raise an\n issue about the critical role of pharmacists\n.\n \nW\nith some of the changes\n,\n it is not quite so clear what their roles are now in primary care. Within secondary care\n,\n the role of our pharmacists is absolutely critical in working in a multidisciplinary way to address this issue\n,\n \nlooking at prescribing, \nmonitoring prescribing\n and \nbeing involved in the f\needback within the organisation\n so \nthat \nprescribing can be performance\n-\nmonitored at the level \nof directorate, division, unit and\n individual\n.\n \nW\ne completely rely on our pharmacists to work with us in this\n, and with the changes that\n will become clear in primary care. \nThe other thing that is going to be important \nfor us \nis that we address this as a whole health\n \ncare economy\n, so that\n we are not addressing it in acute care and primary care but really bring\ning\n it together\n.\n \nI\nt is completely artific\nial and \nnonsense to do it \ncompletely \nseparately.\n&#xa0;\nQ63 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nDr Moore, you mentioned the horror story of someone contracting pneumonia after not being prescribed antibiotics\n,\n and we know about the effect resistance is having on TB\n, \nhere in \nLondon\n, and gonorrhoea—\nthe two that we talk about. Are there other examples? Are these just horror stori\nes? I am thinking of my family. \nI am sure everyone in this room was \neither \nill or had a family member who was ill over the Christmas break\n,\n and many were running to the doctor. As a result of this inquiry, I spent a lot of time persuading my family members that they did not need to go to the doctor, and\n I even had a pharmacist\n trying to tell me to go to the doctor and get an antibiotic. \nA\nre these horror stories\n,\n or could you give us a better understanding of what the dangers are of not prescribing antibiotics?\nDr Moore: I\nf you compare areas with high and low antibiotic prescribing in England\n,\n \nthe evidence shows \nthat if you move to a lower prescribing area there are more episodes of infection \nsuch as\n quinsy, which is a throat infection \nthat\n is a complication of a sore throat. \nT\nhey are very rare complications\n, but if you prescribe less \nyou will se\ne more of those complications. \nThe same applies to prescribing for chesty coughs or bronchitis. If you do less \nprescribing, there will be a few more cases of pn\neumonia seen as a result. T\nhose complications are rare and are usually treatable rather than untrea\ntable. I\nf you move to \na lower prescribing environment, \ny\nou will see, as a result\n, a small increase in more serious infections\n. T\nhat will be a k\nind of consequence\n of that public health strategy. The positive side is that you are going to reduce antimicrobial resistance in the future\n, and t\nhe future we might be looking at in 20 years\n’\n time is that\n,\n if you develop pneumonia\n,\n you will have an untreatable infection\n,\n and that may be fatal\n. T\nhere is a kind of a pay\n&#x2011;\noff\n,\n \nbut it\n is a difficult place to be\n,\n to say, \n“\nIf we do this globally now, there will be a few more cases of pneumonia and serious infections\n,\n but in the future we will have antibiotics which still work\n.\n \nI\nf we just prescribe indiscriminately now, we will prevent a few of those infections\n,\n but in the future we\n won’t\n be able to treat people.\n”\n \nW\ne need to be honest about that in the public debate about antibiotic prescribing\n,\n and we need to be smarter about spotting\n the people who really need \nantibiotics.\n&#xa0;\nQ64 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: S\no\n so\nme of this could be mitigated with better\n or alternative treatments.\n \nDr Moore: \nThere are various approaches to doing that\n,\n and one of them, as I mentioned before, is the delayed prescription\n,\n where you say to somebody, \n“\nYou do not need an antibiotic now, but\n,\n if you do not get better in four or five days\n’\n time, you do not have to come back and see me but you can take this prescription at that point.\n”\n That reduces prescribing in sore throats, say, from 90% down to about 40%. \nY\nou get much less antibiotic uptake by using that. You ne\ned to use strategies where you have what we call a \nsafety ne\nt,\n which is \nthat \nyou say to people, \n“\nYou do not need an antibiotic now, but these are the things that you need to look out for and I would want you to re\n-\nconsult for.\n”\n In other words, if people are deteriorating or getting worse\n,\n they \nshould \nseek further medical advice. Another strategy is to use near\n&#x2011;\npatient\n tests\n.\n \nF\nor instance, in people \nwho present \nwith chest infections, there i\ns a near\n&#x2011;\npatient\n test available that\n moderately increases your ability to detect or determine who does and does not need antibiotics, although the\nre is a grey area in the middle; p\neople with very high scores almost certainly do need antibiotics and people with very low scores almos\nt certainly do not, but there are\n still a number of pe\nople in the middle, o\nn whom you are uncertain. \nW\ne can get smarter and \nwe can \nuse delayed prescribing, we can use effective safety net advice and we can use near\n&#x2011;\npatient\n tests. \nW\nith all of these things complications are rare but they are serious\n,\n and that is one of t\nhe things that worries\n the prescriber and the patient \nwith\n bad symptoms \nwho is \nseeing the doctor.\nProfessor Holmes: M\noving fro\nm primary care into acute care—\nI am sure\n Susan will support me on this—\nthis is not something way in the future; it is something we are seeing now. \nI\nt is really important that we start shifting the public debate away from MRSA \nbacter\na\nemias\n and \nC.difficile\n to looking at how we address antimicrobial resistance in our hospitals\n, \nparticularly the rise in \nE.c\noli\n infections and some of the\n other gram negative infections and the resistance rate\ns\n. \nW\ne need to \nshift\n that so that we can actually start addressing this within our health\n \ncare services and have a whole\n&#x2011;\nsystems\n approach \na\nrou\nnd it, but we really \nneed to move from looking at those two to looking at antimicrobial resistance in a more comprehensive way.\nProfessor Kessel: \nThat is absolutely right. Working in public health, we are constantly having to weigh up \nthat balance \nbetween what might be in the population\n’s\n health\n interests—\nnationally \nbut also the global population—\nwhich is undoubtedly to reduce antimicrobial resistance, which will involve reducing antibiotic prescribing and certainly reducing \ninappr\nopriate antibiotic prescribing, \nagainst the individual person\n’\ns interests. Arguably, on an individual person basis, actually not receiving an antibiotic which is of no use to you is probably a good thing anyway, but there will be cases where that does not happen, albeit thankfully rare. The near\n&#x2011;\npoint\n diagnostics \nthat could tell you in the doctor\n’\ns surgery whether the infection the patient next to you \nhas \nis viral and will not benefit from an antibiotic\n,\n or \nis \nbacterial and will\n, will\n be i\nnvaluable, hence the importance—\nit is mentioned, I think, in the \nstrategy and in our submission—\nof more research around that.\n&#xa0;\nQ65 &#xa0; \nChair: I\nn a hospital environment is there not a tension between the clinical desire to deal with every patient as an individual and the big corporate view that\n,\n \n“\nWe must n\not have our statistics look bad”\n?\nProfessor Holmes: \nThat is spot on. That is why we need these processes, structures and leadership within trusts to understand the\n risks and that tension, but i\nt is also why\n—as we were discussing earlier—\nwe should not be talking just about antibiotic control. It is about access to effective antibiotics, so we need to make sure that our sick patients get antibiotics im\nmediately when they need them. \nThere can be no blocks to that. But then we have the opportunity to review, step down, narrow the spectrum, stop, IV to oral, all those things, and they need to be part of the process. Earlier on\n,\n we were talking about the risk at the individual level in terms of antibiotic resistance and the risk at the societal level of antibiotic resistance.\nThe other issue for us within hospita\nls of course is \nC.difficile\n—antibiotics driving \nC.diff\n—and \nthe risk\n&#x2011;\nbenefit\n. W\ne have a variety of ways of making sure that we minimise the amount of antibiotics we expose people to. B\nut you are absolutely right; that is a tension and i\nt is managed every day in complex patients. It is something that has to be thought through. \nY\nou cannot walk away and think, \n“\nActually, what I\n’ll\n do is just leave this person on \nso many antibiotics that I \ncover everything. It does\nn’t\n matter that we\n’ll\n drive resistance, give the patien\nt \nC.diff\n and when they next have an infection we w\non’t\n be able to treat it.\n”\n \nY\nou have to weigh \nup all of that \nat the time you are treating the patient\n,\n with the possible collateral damage you will do to that patient then and in the future\n,\n as well as \nto \nthe society and people around the\nm.\nDr Hopkins: T\nhere is an important role for pharmacists, nurses and infection specialist\ns in hospitals. You help\n to arbitrate the individual clinician who is responsible for the patient into lo\noking at the big picture and \nbasically say, \n“Y\nes, I understand that you have treated this patient aggressively\n, but now it’\ns two days later, they are doing fine\n,\n and we could do this.\n”\n \nIt is about being able to have \nstructures in a hospital that help to bring down antimicrobial prescribing into the narrower spectrum that will treat the patient effectively\n,\n using the\n epidemiology that we know \nis occurring in the hospital and the best for the patient. \nI\nt\n is about having those external-\ninternal pe\nople, if you like, who do not, potentially,\n have the same doctor\n&#x2011;\npatient\n relationship but are looking a\nt the best for that patient and \nalso the best for the population.\n&#xa0;\nQ66 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nIn the evidence that we have received so far, and indeed you mentioned it this \nmorning, there is variation \nacross England in terms of doctors prescribing antibiotics. Could you give us an idea of how much\n—\nwhat is the ra\nnge of that variation—and,\n if any of you know\n, whether\n that variation exists across the United Kingdom as well, not just England?\nDr Hopkins: \nI will take a little bit of this, if that is okay. I have recently taken over the oversight group looking at the English surveillance programme for ant\nimicrobial use and resistance. \nAs part of that, we have been gathering information at a CCG level from primary care and also from hospitals, but as a larger grouping of hospitals together, to understand what is happening in ecological levels across the country. \nW\ne can see \nthat\n there is about a fivefold variation in prescribing across practices. Some of that can be explained by the age structure of the populations\n,\n but some of it cannot. What we are looking at is trying to understand this information better: what particular antibiotics are being prescribed across the country? Is it related to deprivation? \nT\nhere is some evidence that the more deprived populations have higher prescribing levels\n,\n and that may be related to their co\n&#x2011;\nmo\nrbidities\n and smoking and so on. \nW\ne \nalso \nknow that we can help drive down prescribing if we are\n open and transparent about the\n \ndata. We need to understand it at Public Health England \nand\n at\n prescribing levels across the country\n,\n and then we need to feed that back\n,\n to explain to people, \n“I\nf one practice can do this\n,\n can we look and see what that practice is doing to drive down prescriptions?\n”\n Very much part of our aim at Public Health England is to \nbe open and transparent in\n looking at antimicrobial prescribing data across CCGs and across hospitals over the next year\n,\n and the AMR strategy is helping to drive that.\nProfessor Holmes: T\nhe funding that has been made available to look at some of these interesting aspects\n in the strategy—\nparticularly \nto \ndevelop applied \nresearch—\nwill drive some of the research and address some of these important questions. The creation of health protection research units in this area will also help\n to\n address some of these questions.\nProfessor Kessel: It is a\ncross different countries\n. W\ne are obviously not the only country that sees this kind of variation in practice\n.\n Public Health England\n’\ns c\nounterpart in America, the CDC—\nthe \nCenters\n for Dis\nease Control and Prevention—\nproduced their report on antimicrobial resistance late last year, \nin \nautumn 2013, and one of the quite striking maps shows almost double the problem of antimicrobial resistance antibio\ntic prescribing \nbetween states in south\n&#x2011;\neast United States and the west coast and California. There are various reasons discus\nsed, but again you see \na variation in practice and in seriousness\n,\n which reminds us that the factors that influence prescribing and antimicrobial r\nesistance are complex. T\nhey are professional factors about doctors and their prescr\nibing and lots of other factors, \nbut also public awareness. I think we touched on it in the previous qu\nestion. I believe there is \na responsibility on \nthe \npublic around demands for antibiotics\n,\n and we experience this in the general practice room where you have a very short consultation and can be pressed on receiving an antibiotic. That is a real ground\n&#x2011;\nlevel\n issue, hence \nagain the importance \nin the strategy of greater improving \nof \nawareness and understanding among the public of antimicrobial resistance.\n&#xa0;\nQ67 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nProfessor, you just touched on my next point. We have discussed the variation in prescrip\ntion and the fact that in \nareas with more prescription there is some increased infection, but the Society of Biology has given us evidence that resistance is still increasing across the country\n. I\ns there variation in resistance\n,\n and do we have enough information yet to say that \nin \nareas where prescribing antibiotics has been curtailed resistance \nis \nreceding\n,\n or is it still continuing to rise at the same rate?\nDr Hopkins: \nThe first thing to say is that\n,\n predominantly in the \nUK\n and in \nEngland\n over the last 10 years, \nwe have monitored bacter\na\nemi\na surveillance, which is the tip of the iceberg, and \nb\nacter\na\nemias\n do not occur in primary care. By and large, if somebody is sick with a blood culture infection or sepsis, the\ny are in hospital. \nM\nore recently\n,\n over the last couple of years\n,\n \nwe have \ndeveloped a surveillance system to look at all microbiology samples from microbiology laboratories\n,\n and we have now almost achieved a 60% uptake of laboratories across the country reporting centrally to Public Health \nEngland\n. That is from samples such as urine, which are a really good marker for what is happening in the community\n,\n and sputum samples as well. \nT\nhat is the surveillance system that will help give us the early warning signals. In some areas, such as the west midlands\n,\n 100% of the laboratory data \nare \nbeing reported, so we know exactly what is ha\nppening in that. In other areas,\n there are resources being put in by Publi\nc Health \nEngland\n to improve \nsurveillance\n.\nU\nntil we have robust surveillance systems collecting laboratory data\n,\n we do not know where our gaps are. Our priority over the next year is to improve that\n,\n to make sure \nthat \n60% of lab\ns\n are reporting\n and\n to get that to 70% to 80%\n, so that we know we have \ngood coverage and that we have developed our early warning systems. But with that\n,\n we need hospitals and laboratories to work with us to make sure that they can give us the data\n.\n \nW\ne need hospital laboratory systems to be updated to modern IT so that they can transmit the message\n to us\n. \nWe cannot have outdated systems; i\nf we have old IT systems\n,\n they will not communi\ncate with more modern ones. I\nt is everyone working together\n,\n so \nthat \nPublic Health England can develop a surveillance sy\nstem. H\nospitals need to help us engage with that so \nthat \nwe know what is happening at the ground level.\nPamela Nash: \nThank you. That is important.\nDr Moore: \nIn primary care there is not a history of sampling. \nFor\n most people who come\n,\n we do not take microbiological samples. When you do take samples\n,\n it is when there are complicated cases, \nwhere \npeople have \nhad a course of antibiotics, \nthe infection has not improved and they have come back with a urine in\nfection, say, for a third time, \nand you send a sample off at that stage. \nThe routine samples that\n come from primary care are not representative of the global picture. One of the \nmissing \npieces of the jigsaw is a systematic sampling of all routine cases\n,\n and \nI think that is something \nwe could develop for the future so that you used a number of sites across the UK to routinely sample everybody who presented with particular conditions\n,\n which would give you a much better idea of the rates of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria isolated in the general population, whereas at the m\noment your sample is from \ncomplicated cases\n,\n so you will not get a true picture of the ant\nimicrobial resistance. T\nha\nt is a gap that could be filled.\nProfessor Kessel: M\neasuring the amount of antimicrobial resistance in primary and secondary care\n \nis complex. There are definitely gaps\n,\n and Dr Moor\ne has highlighted one. F\nrom an already good start in terms of our surveillance in this country, I am confident, because we \nhave already made a significant\n start in Public Hea\nlth England, that in \na r\nelatively short period of time—a few years—\nwe will have even stronger systems in place. They will not necessarily have answered all the questions, and this particular one may take longer, but \nthere will be \neven stronger surveillance systems\n,\n so we can speak even more clearly about the amount of the problem in this country. I do not know about the Society of Biology\n’\ns re\nport, but if you could share i\nt with us we could respond in a written manner to the Committee because I do not know what they are referring to.\n&#xa0;\nQ68 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nI think there is someone in the room who might be able to do that. Just before I move on to my last point, Professor \nKessel\n, you mentioned the \nUS\n. T\nhere was evidence that\n,\n \nwhere \nthere was a variation in areas where antibiotics, the prescription, had been curtailed\n,\n there was a reduction in resistance. Is that correct?\nProfessor Kessel: \nThere is almost a twofold difference between states in the amount of the problem of antimicrobial resistance and prescribing practice between states in the south\n-\neast.\n&#xa0;\nQ69 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: But those \ntwo\n figures \ncorrela\nte. The data where resistance exists correlate\n with prescribing.\nProfessor Kessel: \nThat is right. I have that here \ni\nn my pile of supporting material\n, and I am happy to share i\nt or send the report through afterwards. It came out as the CDC\n’\ns publication came out in the autumn \nof \nlast year.\n&#xa0;\nQ70 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: My final point \ncover\ns\n the fact that there is variation across the world, as we have touched on, in antibiotics\n; \nindeed\n,\n in many countries we can buy them over the counter.\n How will that affect us\n in the United Kingdom\n, and how significantly will i\nt undermine our efforts here in the UK?\nProfessor Kessel: \nThe scope of the problem internationally is absolutely huge. \nIt is not only our own strategy; o\nne of the things\n \nthe work of the chief medical officer over the last three or f\nour years has done, \nwh\nich has been hugely influential,\n has been to dramatically raise the profile of antimicrobial resistance as an issue internationally. Last year at the World Health Assembly\n,\n which I attended\n,\n there was a session on AMR that there had not been before. There is planned to be a new resolution at the World Health Assembly next May. There is a whole range of other international activities going on. We are doing a lot of work with Public Health England\n and \nthe CMO and her team with the Commonwealth about twinning countries\n—\nhigher income, lower income countries\n—\naround laboratory and antimicrobial resistance issu\nes. There is a huge amount of attention that\n did not exist to the degree it \ndoes\n \nnow \njust three or four years \nago, \neven when I started at the Health Protection Agency. That attention internationally was not there.\n&#xa0;\nQ71 &#xa0; \nChair: \nOn the BBC programme on regional television the night before last that I referred\n to in my introductory remarks,\n a clinician was arguing in favour of screening for the resistant form of TB from certain populations. Do you think that is a serious proposition\n—\npeople moving into the country from particular countries\n?\nProfessor Kessel: \nI might ask a colleague on that. I realise I did not quite answ\ner your question about over-the-\nc\nounter medicines; we know that i\nt is a significant\n issue in a number of countries—s\nome of the high popul\nation, lower resource countries.\n \nI\nn \nIndia\n,\n they have been doi\nng a lot of work to change over-the-\ncounter provision of medicines\n, but of course i\nt is a problem. If you can just go and get an antibiotic over the counter, it may well be an antibiotic that is not necessary. One of the huge challenges there is \nthat \nin those kinds of \nsettings that might be your only way to get a valuable treatment. So the work that needs to be done has to be done in conjunction with improving primary care infrastructure and so forth, but there is a huge amount of work going on \ninternationally to raise that in\n the agenda, which is incredibly valuable. \nProfessor Holmes: \nCould I just say one other thing about over the counter\n, and then talk about screening, b\nut bring it to the scr\neening of antibiotic resistance\n particularly in bact\nerial infections rather than TB?\n \nF\nirst\n,\n in the \nUK\n,\n we have v\nery tight regulation about over- the-\ncounter prescribing\n,\n but your question was \non the impact of over-the-\ncounter prescribing around the wor\nld when it is a global problem. W\ne are\n talking locally and nationally\n but it is a global problem. There has been a huge amount of work done on this, particularly in \nIndia\n with the Chennai D\neclaration. Their first proposal for antibiotic control was \nunpragmatic\n and not deliverable\n,\n because of the is\nsue about tight control of over-the-\ncounter antibiotics. When we actually talk about access to antibiotics, that might be the only place people can access antibiotics\n, s\no the more pragmatic approach was a step\n&#x2011;\nwise\n progression of the antibiotics that had to be regulated and the ones that were still over the counter\n,\n and that has now been introduced. I think it was introduced in August. \nT\nhe work in Ind\nia has been quite extraordinary.\nI\nn terms of the question about screening\n, \nwe are particularly concerned about severe antibiotic resistance being brought in\n;\n indeed there is a document that has been released\n recently \nadvising hospitals what best to do about screening. We are ve\nry conscious of the issue \nwhen patients come in from intensive care units from other places, from hospitals from other places, or even \nwhen they are just \ninvolved in health\n \ncare in other places\n, and the need to screen \nis being recommended, but Susan may want to say a bit more about the policy.\nDr Hopkins: \nYes. Public Health \nEngland\n has generated screen\ning guidelines for \ncarbapenem\n resistance\n,\n which is really important for people coming from overseas\n, \nseeking health\n \ncare \nhere, \nor after having health\n \ncare abroad \nin\n one form or another\n.\n \nThose \nare the patients \nwho \ncan transmit\n and cause an epidemic of multi\ndrug resistant bacteria within a hospital setting\n,\n and that is where we have been focusing \na \nlot of our attention\n,\n because obviously that would be a new transmission event and a very dangerous form of in\nfection—gram negative infections—\nwithin hospitals\n,\n rapidly developing resistance to, essentially, all first, second and third\n&#x2011;\nline\n available \nantibiotics, leaving us with old and\n poor available drugs. \nYou also mentioned TB. \nI think tuberculosis has had a long history in \nthe UK of slow, simmering rates,\n and higher rates in London where there are higher populations from overseas, so we have about 3,500 cases \na year \nin London\n,\n and about \n1.5% to 1.7% of those are multi\ndrug resistant, so resistant to two of our major first\n&#x2011;\nline\n drugs. That has not changed that much over\n the last 10 years actually; \nwe have had a slow, steady rate\n,\n between 1% and 2%\n,\n of drug resistance. It is important that we ensure that patients with symptoms are screened as necessary\n.\n \nPort health screening \nis organised for individuals who have symptoms of TB coming \nin\nto the \nUK, and there is a questionnaire for those from \ncountries that are\n high risk.\n It is important that we have good microbiology services\n,\n so that if people present\n we diagnose multi\ndrug resistant TB fast and accurately\n.\n \nT\nhat is available through Public Health England\n’\ns tuberculos\nis national reference lab\n to any laboratory in the country\n,\n so any laboratory can request that test for a fast turnaround on any patient \nwith \nsuspected\n \ntuberculosis.\nChair: \nWe are running a tad behind time, so can colleagues speed things up a bit?\n&#xa0;\nQ72 &#xa0; \nDavid Morris: \nI think a lot of what you have already said has probably answered \nthis, but, in relation to \nantimicrobial resistance, are existing diagnostics tests used effectively across the NHS? If not, why not? Do you think t\nhat the diagnostic tests used for\n looking into diseases are actually pertinent to what we are doing to dish out antibiotics\n, or do you \nthink we are \nnot \ndoing a good enough job of the diagnostics in the first place?\nDr Hopkins: \nThere are two elements of diagnostics. Once a sample gets to th\ne microbiology department, \nwe can say that the microbiology departments are accredited to p\nerform the microbiology tests. \nThey have minimum standards \nso \nthat they can do it\n. If they are unsure about the \nresu\nlt\n, they can send it to a national reference laboratory. The question is if there is no sample\n sent; as we have heard\n already, 80% of prescribing happens in primary care where the majority of patients have no samples performed at all\n,\n and actually even if they did have a sample sent it would have little impact on that patient\n’\ns antibiotic prescription because the result would take three to five days to get back to the general practitioner. \nThere needs to be new development of easier\n point\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\ncare\n testing—testing \nthat will give rapid results. Some of that is happening to diagnose viral infections. For example, we know that there are now tests that we can use\n where we \ntake a nose swab and see if someone has a virus\n, and if they have a virus \nyou can say that they do not ne\ned an antibiotic. \nWe need to develop it such that the GP can do that quite easily\n,\n at a cheap cost that is not goin\ng to massively influence health care costs across this country,\n and deliver that at a p\nrimary care level. A lot of development work is required on that. F\nrom a hospital level, once the sample gets into the laboratory, and it is an approved, accredited\n laboratory in a hospital, \nwe can be pretty sure that that laboratory is performing the right tests.\n&#xa0;\nQ73 &#xa0; \nDavid Morris: \nIs there a central database that these tests can be fed into\n,\n to give you a mapping of where and when antibiotics should be used, or certain treatments?\nDr Hopkins: A\nntibiotics are used according to the clini\ncal syndrome about the patient—\nwhen the patient presents\n,\n what signs and symptoms they have. The microbiology helps focus our treatments down to narrow treatments\n,\n or widen them as necessary, so it helps us in \n“Start Smart—Then Fo\ncus\n,”\n but it does not change what\n happens to the patient and the\n patient\n&#x2011;\ndoctor\n interaction on the front line.\nProfessor Holmes: \nThe issue about the point of care is not just one for primary care. With the centralisation of microbiology laboratories\n,\n it is becoming more and more important sometimes that we get the diagnosis at the point of care, particularly in intensive care. \nP\noint of care is very important in acute care as well as primary care\n,\n so that we can get the results fast, rapidly, where we are looki\nng after the patient. I\nnvesting in research in this technology is absolutely critical. \nIt shapes how we treat patients and\n improves outcome\ns,\n and there is a lot more we could do there. \n&#xa0;\nQ74 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nMost of the focus \nso far has been on the clinical and\n on the professional side\n, but Professor Holmes, you \nmention\ned\n there was a need for public debate. Do you, as a panel, think that \nUK\n patients understand the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance and how their own actions contribute towards it?\nProfessor Holmes: \nI think some of them do. \nW\ne have touched on some of the issues\n,\n and perhaps we need to consider the issue about heal\nth literacy and be a little \nmore analytical about that in its broader sense, not just about the antimicrobial resistance issue. I mentioned before that there is a lot of work \na\nround public engagement. We may need to look more critically at how we measure whether it is effective enough, but I also think we need to look at not just public engagement but engagement across everybody who is involved in delivering health\n \ncare. \nWe still need to work on \nengagement within health\n \ncare\n,\n as well as looking at\n public engagement. \nI think we are looking more and more in\nto\n aspects of qualitative research and social science\n and so on,\n to get the messages right and\n to calibrate them a little \nmore effectively\n. T\nhat is taking place now.\n&#xa0;\nQ75 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nWhenever anyone says\n,\n \n“\nWe need to look at doing this,\n” \nI ask more spe\ncifically what needs to be done.\nProfessor Holmes: \nI will start with what I was saying about people within h\nealth care. We need to make sure as technical experts\n that we are not just talking to each other. We need to engage with our clinical \nand\n professional colleag\nues. I\nt is really important\n that we recognise the effect of\n the power of hierarchies within specialities, \nand \nwork with leaders\n across a range of specialities and\n work with our professional bodies. We must include nurses here. There needs to be much more talk about the role of nurses in the delivery of antibiotic safety. There needs to be much more talk about the critical role of pharmacists\n; \nquite a bit of wo\nrk has been done already with \nthe development of a \nmasters\n pro\ngramme for pharmacists\n. I think Anthony might be able to say a bit more about the work that is being done critically and academically looking at behavioural change strategies and\n getting the message right. T\nhere is investment in research to do this\n,\n but there is also a programme of work that Public Health England is involved in.\n&#xa0;\nQ76 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nIt is the public awareness side of things that I am particularly interested in.\nProfessor Kessel: \nI think the answer is yes\n; in my view,\n there is a need for fur\nther \npublic engagement or public awareness. Again it is not straightforward\n: how do you raise public awareness?\n One could say we will run an awareness\n&#x2011;\nraising\n campaign\n,\n but it is very important, in so doing, that you run something that is effe\nctive. They cost a lot of money and\n they take time. One does not want to do something that is not effective in terms of raising the public\n’\ns knowledge, understanding\n,\n or even, most importantly, their behaviours in terms of going to a GP and asking for antibiotics. \nWe in Public Health \nEngland\n have from \n1 \nApril this year taken from the Department of Health the team responsible for running those kinds of campaigns\n,\n and I and my team have been asked to look at whether we can run a broader public health campaign around antimicrobial re\nsistance in this country. W\ne have started to look at how we can do that in a targeted way that is effective and cost\n&#x2011;\neffective\n. T\nhe research\n \ndraws on some of the work that the World Health \nOrganisation has done, called \nTAB, which is about targeting app\nropriate antimicrobial resistance\n strategies around, first of all, doing some qualitative work to find out where such a ca\nmpaign might be most effective—\nwhich \ngroups, so it could be age groups;\n which sectors\n, whether it is schools or \nresidential\n sectors, and those kind of things—\nand then \nrunning a tailored campaign accordingly. \nYou ask what should be looked at, and t\nhat is something we are looking at\n,\n b\nut we have just started doing i\nt\n. T\nhat is very much part of the s\ntrategy in terms of raising the\n level of discussion and debate. \nDr Hopkins: This is a\nn important release, I think, to start us ha\nving those conversations\n. \nEurobarometer\n, which is a European\n&#x2011;\nwide\n survey, has just released the results of the 2013 survey\n,\n which focused on antimicrobial resistance because obviously this is a big attent\nion area throughout Europe. That survey \nshowed that one in three people in the UK, and roughly the same across Europe, had an awareness of some antibiotic cam\npaign in the previous year. T\nhere are campaigns out there that people are becoming aware of. Interestingly, one in two people in the \nUK\n knew that antibiotic\ns were not right for colds, flu\n and viruses\n,\n but that means 50% do not, so we still have a lot of work \nto do \nout there to convince people that viruses do not need antibiotics. \nW\nhat I thought was really important in those results was to know t\nhat actually the main place where\n people seek advice and where they will get advice that they believe in is from health professionals. \nT\nhat comes back to the engagement of health professionals\n,\n and look\ning\n at health professional strategies rather than just looking at all\n&#x2011;\nencompassing\n campaigns. \nW\nhen people are ill and seek health advice\n, that\n is the moment whe\nn \nthey will listen to the important piece of advice that can change their behaviour, not only for this episode but potentially for the next episode and the one thereafter. \nI\nt is about resources\n,\n education campaigns and interventions that can be rolled out across GP practices that can change those behaviours in the future, not just for now.\n&#xa0;\nQ77 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nWe \nhave \nfocused on the prescribing of medicines. It is also important that once a member of the \npublic has these medicines \nthe\ny complete the course and use them\n properly. How can medical p\nrofessionals make sure that \npatients actually complete the course they are given\n? People go to the doctor\n, get given the antibiotics and then that is the end of the story as far as that connection with the GP is concerned. How can you make sure t\nhat the link continues and \nthey complete the course?\nDr Hopkins: \nThere are two things that are quite important. The first thing is that a lot of the research about the length of course happened a long time ago\n; \noften \nit \nw\nas\n predefined 30, 40 or 50 years ago. Actually we need research about what i\ns the shortest length of course.\n Can we let the courses be shorter so that people do not take antibiotics on day 7 when they are better\n,\n because they do not need them? \nWe also know that\n,\n if people do not have an infection in the first place\n,\n they do not need antibi\notics. If they were in hospital,\n they would have stopped antibiotics on day 2 when we decided they did not have an infection, so perhaps we need to reinvent this a bit and get better at understanding when patients do not need them\n.\n \nT\nhat is about stopping the prescriptions in the first place\n,\n but it is als\no about trying to see if \nwe \ncan \ncome up with a way that we can shorten the durations of courses so that they do not take them\n for such a long time. I\nf they are feeling\n better after two days, and it wa\ns thought \nto\n be a virus at the beginning \nbut\n it was a delayed prescription, perhaps they should stop it at that point. I would like to turn that on its head a bit\n; \nwe need to look at that in the future in a different way\n,\n because the more antibiotics people tak\ne, the more the microbiology \ninside their body will change.\nProfessor Kessel: I\nf a patient ultimately decides when they have a five\n&#x2011;\nday treatment that they are feeling better after three or four days and they want to throw the rest in the bin or not continue, it is quite \nhard\n to influence that\n. The way we do i\nt is by awareness raising, public debate\n,\n discussion with the public\n,\n but also with professionals about how they convey the importance of those messages. I\n was just \nreminded by a note about a very good educational material called e\n&#x2011;\nBug\n, electronic bug, which is an online tool that we developed in the Health Protection Agency\n—\nnow Public Health England\n—\nwhich has\n won awards and is used multiply\n in schools across this country\n. I\nndeed\n, it\n has been used in a number of countries overseas, having been tran\nslated into different languages.\n \nI\nt covers areas pertaining to that understanding\n—\nwhich bugs respond to antibiotics, why antibiotics should be used and for what duration and so forth.\n&#xa0;\nQ78 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nI think all of you have made reference during the course of the morning to the \ndifferences and \ndiscrepancies\n, or \nthe different ways matters are treated in\n \nsecondary as opposed to primary care. I want to look briefl\ny at the antimicrobial resistance\n \nstrategy, the five\n&#x2011;\nyear plan for 2013-\n18. It has been criticised from a number of quarters for being far too concerned with the cl\ninical environment, principally\n the secondary acute sector, at the expense \nof \nprimary care\n,\n and\n not mentioning \nt\nhe environment in nursing homes\n at all. I wo\nnder \nif any of yo\nu would care to respond to that.\nDr Moore: \nI can talk to that. I have recently done some work looking at antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes\n; it\n is not yet published\n,\n but it shows that if you take into\n account the other co\n&#x2011;\nmorbidities\n—\nthe othe\nr illnesses that people have—\nthe rate of antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes is around double what you would expect for that population. \nT\nhere is a problem with antibiotic prescribing in nursing homes and it is, I think, often misdirected\n.\n \nT\nhis \nis \na high\n-\nrisk population\n;\n these are very frail, elderly people usually\n,\n who are at high risk of bacterial infections and serious infections\n. M\nanaging that risk in primary care is difficult because you are worried that people may h\nave more serious infections, b\nut there is still overtreatment\n.\nM\ny particular focus has been on urinary infections\n.\n \nI\nt is very common for people in nursing homes to carry bacteria in their urine. Probably about a third of people, if you do a random sample, would have bacteria in their urine\n;\n there is a kind of a paradigm\n,\n where somebody becomes more unwell and then somebody \nelse \nwill dip their urine and show that there is protein and blood in it\n,\n which suggests an infection\n,\n and then they will get an antibiotic, but actually the link between the bacteria in the urine and the illness is very tenuous\n.\n \nT\nhat is one of the driver\ns of antibiotic prescribing, so i\nt is an area that I have been looking at and will be focusing on to try and intervene and get better targeting. Again, it is about identifying the people that really need the antibiotics\n,\n but we are talking about a high\n&#x2011;\nrisk environment with the frail elderly.\n&#xa0;\nQ79 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: Y\nour \nview would be that the resistance\n strategy is seriously deficient in this area.\nDr Moore: I\nt is an area which warrants more attention\n,\n and I thi\nnk it has not been an area that\n has been looked at. There are high levels of prescribing, probably greater than you would expect even for the frail elderly population who are in there\n,\n and I think more work needs to be done, yes.\nProfessor Kessel: A\ns I mentioned earlier, I think this is an amb\nitious and important strategy; i\nt \nis an overarching strategy. W\ne talked earlier about the enormity of the challenge and the fact that implementation at ground\n level has other elements, \nwhich cannot be, and would not be, covered in an overarching strategy. The issue around community settings is vitally important for all the reasons that have been mentioned. I cannot recall whether that i\ns specifically mentioned,\n but I can be absolutely sure that it does not stop Public Health England, as part of our work on surveillance and our r\noles and responsibilities there—\nroles on sur\nveillance, education and practice—\nfrom attending to co\nmmunity settings, nursing homes and\n residential homes. In fact only last year\n—\nDr Hopkins might correct me if I get the date wrong, but I think it was last year or the year before\n—\nwe produced an important pack \non \ncommunity nursing home\ns\n, residential care settings and advice for practitioners on health\n \ncare\n&#x2011;\nassociated\n infections an\nd antimicrobial resistance. I\nt is an area that is already being addressed.\n&#xa0;\nQ80 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nBut the huge increase in recent years in \nresistance, and attention\n \ngiven to \nresistance\n,\n has been in the community rather than in clinical environments. The position in hospitals, \nin \nthe acute sector, has not really changed that much over\n time. \nInfection levels are effectively under control and now reducing, but the huge explosion in this has taken place in the community sector. Should that not be where the attention is being placed?\nDr Hopkins: \nWe can say that we have seen a rise\n in \nE.coli\n \nbacter\na\nemia across the country. We know that you are more likely to have resistance if you have had a health\n \ncare setting intervention in\n the previous three months. T\nhe infection may start in the community\n,\n but it is more likely to have been related to your previous health\n \ncare event. \nN\nursing homes are really important. There are more than 30,000 nursing and residential homes across England\n,\n and they have a very vulnerable population. I do not think they are excluded from the strategy\n,\n because the strategy encompasses the whole health\n \ncare economy and primary and secondary care\n,\n and nursing home residents are involved\n. T\nhe delivery of their care \nis \nvia primary care\n, so \nthei\nr prescriptions that we gather—\nthe resistance that we g\nather—are\n being gathered by the same mechanisms a\ns everything else. A\ns something that could be strengthened\n,\n explicitly stating what is requir\ned in long\n&#x2011;\nterm care facilities would be beneficial. L\nong\n&#x2011;\nterm facilities are also covered by the Health and Social Care Act. They are also regulated by \nthe \nCQC. \nT\nhey fall under everything else that we have talked about in primary and secondary care as well, so they are not excluded by any means by what it says in the strategy, though it does not, I agree, explicitly state\n, “This applies to long\n&#x2011;\nterm care,” but \nprimary and secondary care physicians and nurses\n \nare the same people who deliver care in long\n&#x2011;\nterm care facilities.\n&#xa0;\nChair: That was\n an extremely informative session. We are extremely grateful for the contributions you have made. I realise there will be one\n or two follow\n&#x2011;\nup documents—\nthe ones yo\nu referred to, Professor \nKessel\n.\n Dr Moore, if you are able to flesh out a little more about the paper you are about to publish\n—\nI recognise the sensitivity of that in the science environment\n—\nthat would be helpful\n, and a\nlso\n \nif there are any further bits of information the rest of you would like to add as well. Thank you very much for your attendance this morning.\nExamination of WitnessesWitnesses: \nJohn Hardcastle, Chief Executive Officer, \nNovolytics\n, \nDr David McIntosh, Global Scientific Affairs Senior Expert, Novartis, \nProfessor George Lewith, Professor of Health \nResearch, University of Southampton Medical School, and \nDoris-Ann Williams, Chief Executive, British In Vitro Diagnostics Asso\nciation\n, gave evide\nnce.\n&#xa0;\nQ81 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThank you very much for attending this morning. It would be helpful if you could introduce yourselves.\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nI am Doris\n&#x2011;\nAnn\n Williams. I am chief executive of the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, the industry association representing manufacturers and distributors of diagnostic products in the \nUK\n.\nProfessor Lewith: \nI am George \nLewith\n. I am a professor in the department of primary care. I work very closely with Mike Moore on a number of studies\n,\n which David \nTredinnick\n just mentioned. I am a GP and a consultant physician. I have 30 years of experience in researching herbal medicines and hold a variety of roles. One of the things I have been involved with\n very recently is getting the \nNational Sc\nhool for Primary Care Research—part of the NIHR—\nto develop a really powerful working group looking at alternatives to antibiotic prescribing both in care homes and in primary care\n,\n using a variety of nutritional and herbal approaches, particularly in relation to urinary and lower respiratory tract infections. I do not re\npresent anybody other than the U\nniversity of Southampton and the NIHR.\nDr McIntosh: \nI am David McIntosh. I am a paediatric infectious disease specialist. I am also an honorary clinic\nal senior lecturer at Imperial C\nollege in London. I act as the global scienti\nfic affairs senior expert for Novartis V\naccines\n,\n and I teach at a number of universities around the world.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nI am John \nHardcastle\n. I am the chief executive of \nNovolytics\n, which is a\nn SME company in \nDaresbury\n; \nwe research into \nbacteriophage\n therapeutics. Prior to that, most of my career has been spent in the venture capital industry.\n&#xa0;\nQ82 &#xa0; \nChair: \nIn different ways\n,\n you all propose alternatives to antibiotics. Could you each \noutline what your approach is? \nLet us go down the line again.\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nThe diagnostics industry sees the tools that our products produce as a way of appropriately differentiating patients\n’\n treatment. \nI\nn primary care the\nre are simple tests, as we \nheard in the last session, which are in common use in the Nordic countries, Germany and Switzerland and also in the USA, to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections\n,\n and allow a debate or a discussion between the primary care physician and the patient as to whether an antibiotic is appropriate\n for that condition or not. I\nn secondary care\n,\n it is a way of targeting antibiotic therapy to make sure that the correct antibiotic is used for the correct infection. Increasingly, there are products available \nthat\n will look at more than one parameter in one sample type\n,\n and \nthey \nare reducing the length of time to get the results. \nIn\n the trad\nitional microbiology lab, \nit would take five to 14 day\ns to culture up micro\n&#x2011;\norganisms;\n you can now \ndo it within five hours using \nmolecular technology.\nProfessor Lewith: \nMy background is as a clinician, a GP, so I can add to some of the comments made by Dr Moore and I can certainly expand any that may be relevant to this part of the meeting. As a primary care physician, you a\nre in a very difficult position;\n you are in a one\n&#x2011;\nto\n&#x2011;\none situation with a patient who may \nwant or demand\n an antibiotic. Education works \nto a point\n, and we \ndiscussed the strategies in the previous part of the meeting, but GPs very much feel they need alternatives. The evidence we have from the research is that they would look at things like herbal and nutritional medicines if they were t\nhoughtfully evidence based. W\nithin the EU, particularly in Germany, 20\n% of the \nOTC prescriptions are for herbal medicines. There is a real good track record of herbal medicines \nbeing\n better produced and us getting better quality herbal medicines in the \nUK\n,\n and better herbal practitioners, particularly since the 2001 House of Lords report. \nMy main approach would be to try and see how we can use these kinds of approaches\n,\n looking at good science but perhaps understanding that we are not after a magic single chemical. Herbals work differently. They work synergistically and often through several different \ni\nmmuno\n&#x2011;\nmodifying\n mechanisms. O\nne herbal, which may have 40 or 50 different biologically active chemicals, may be working through several different systems\n,\n and nutritionals may be as well. They modify many different systems in the body, so it is a different kind of approach\n,\n which requires a slightly different understanding of science. I think we can use those approaches to manage symptoms and mitigate antibiotic prescribing in primary care very effectively when we know that there is good preliminary evidence and we do not need to make many of the antibiotic prescriptions that we are making. \nChair: \nThank you. We are go\ning to pursue that a little \nfurther later on.\nDr McIntosh: \nAntibiotics are used for treatment generally\n,\n and vaccines are used for prevention. We have had a golden age of antibiotic development\n,\n and I believe that golden age is coming to an end. I believe we are at the beginning of a golden age of vaccination and discovery of vaccines. Vaccination has the potential to prevent patients \nfrom \nbeing admitted to hospital, thereby preventing their exposure to organisms in the hospital. Vaccination also has the potential to preven\nt disease in the community; \nin fact\n,\n vaccination can prevent large epidemics. Vaccination can prevent the long\n&#x2011;\nterm consequences and \nsequelae\n of infections. I believe that vaccination is now the best approach for looking at organisms, both resistant and multi\n&#x2011;\nresistant\n and susceptible in that fashion, by targeting multiple targets on these organisms. Antibiotics just target one aspect of the organism. Vaccines have the potential to target multiple targets on the organism. I also believe that with effective vaccines against community and healthcare\n&#x2011;\nassociated\n pathogens, \nand \neffective implementation, we have the potential to reduce antibiotic resistance by up to 50%.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nWe are trying to develop \nbacteriophage\n therapeutics. \nPhages\n are viruses that kill bacteria\n,\n and you will be drinking them as you drink your water. They have been around for longer than bacteria. They are used regularly in the eastern bloc\n,\n but they are not used here yet because we have not done clinical trials that are to western standards. Our belief is that they will form a complementary approach to the use of antibiotics\n. T\nhey are very narrow spectrum. Typically, any one phage will only kill a number of strains withi\nn a bacterial species, s\no you need to know what bug you are dealing with before they are effective.\n&#xa0;\nQ83 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThat response, from your point of view, answers one o\nf my next questions: a\nre other countries ahead in your particular fields and are the procedures for adopting alternatives in the NHS easy ones to deal with?\nDr McIntosh: \nWith vaccination\n,\n the United Kingdom has set an extraordinary example over many years of introducing new, innovative vaccines. We \nhave now \nnot completely \nconquered, \nbut are getting towards conquering\n,\n the great killers of the 20th century\n,\n and before that. We now face somewhat rarer infections in the community\n,\n such as meningococcal infecti\non, and in the hospital, such as S\ntaph and \nE.coli\n. With \nits\n \nextraordinary \ntrack record of vaccinati\non, \nthe United Kingdom is in fact right at the sharp end of being able to develop new vaccines. Of course, other countries are using variou\ns vaccines, and t\nhe United Kingdom is using those and other vaccines, so it does depend somewhat, but my point is that the United Kingdom is really very advanced with the implementation of most vaccines.\nProfessor Lewith: My response\n is that you need all of us in a co\n-\nordinated way. You need \nphages\n when you have rea\nlly bad infections in hospital. You need \nvaccinations for prevention\n. You need \nsimple primary care approaches that stop over\n-\nprescription and you need near\n&#x2011;\npatient\n testing\n,\n so you need the technology. You need to implement the near\n&#x2011;\npatient\n testing by making private contractors in general practice do it so that it is feasible\n,\n so \nthat \nthey do not lose money. At the moment\n,\n they would be paying for the tests themselves out of their own wages. You need better research for symptom\n&#x2011;\nrelieving\n remedies\n,\n and we need a better structure to manage that research within the NIHR. We need the vaccinations prevent\nat\nively\n,\n and we need better strategies when we have serious overwhelming infections in secondary and tertiary care environments. \nY\nou cannot have one of us without the other. I am sorry I am in the middle. I am the GP, you see, \nand \nI am always in the middle.\nDoris-Ann Williams: I \nagree that we are not talking about one of our approaches against all of them. There is room for everything to fit into the health\n \ncare pictu\nre. One of the problems, \nwhich George just alluded to\n,\n was the cost of doing testing in primary care. It is an added cost, but there are ways around it. Outside of antimicrobial infection, GPs have started doing simple tests\n,\n which stop referring to secondary care\n,\n and the money is recouped in other ways. Companies are quite innovative at doing risk\n&#x2011;\nsharing\n projects on costing\n,\n so I do not think that is beyond the wit of us to do. Much \nmore important, I think, is \nawareness among GPs of what tests\n are available commonly and\n are being used in northern Europe and in the US.\n&#xa0;\nQ84 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nI wanted to discuss vaccinati\nons in particular, so I guess this\n is \nmainly aimed at Dr McIntosh\n, but if anyone has any comments, please add in. In your initial answer\n, you \ncover\ned the broad areas and\n I want to be a bit more specific. We \nhave had recent news \nin the London press abo\nut TB and the incidence, or \nrates\n,\n of TB in London in particular. The current TB vaccinations that we all ha\nd\n as teenagers are 70 years old now. I think you said that we are entering a golden age of vaccination. How can that be so when the vaccines are so old?\nDr McIntosh: \nOf course, we have had an unfortunate failure of the developmen\nt of a new tuberculosis vaccine\n from the Jenner Institute\n,\n and this was sad because we do need to replace the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis. The approach that has been used for\n the \nBexsero\n meningococcal \nsero\ngroup\n B vaccine is called reverse \nvaccinology\n,\n and this is what I mean by a new golden age of vaccine development. By looking at the genetics of the organism\n,\n we now have the pot\nential to identify targets that\n ca\nn be used for vaccine. The \nserogroup\n B meningococcal vaccine—the Novartis \nBexsero\n vaccine—\nwas developed along those lines. For the \nnosocomi\nal\n infections—to be specific, S\ntaphylococcus \naureu\ns\n—\nt\nhere has also been a failure, or two failures, of vaccines.\n \nE.coli\n, \nAcinetobacter\n, \nEnteroba\ncteriaceae\n, \nKlebsiella\n and so on:\n \nw\ne need to use this new sort of technology to\n develop specific vaccines for Staph, \nE.coli\n, Staph \nepi\n and so on. W\nhen I \nsay \ngolden age, we are going to have great difficulties in developing new antibiotics unless the\nre are some miracles. But we \nhave the potential now to \nuse genetics, looking at these very resistant organisms, to develop vaccines, not necessarily to use them throughout the whole community\n for \neveryone, like we generally do\n, \nbut \nto use these new vaccines \nin a more targeted approach, especially \nfor \npeople going into hospitals, people who are at risk of these serious infections.\n&#xa0;Q85 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: Is one of the problems \ny\nou face—going back to the BCG—\nthat it only protects against certain \nstrains of the TB virus, or \nbacteria? Is there a problem that\n,\n if you are just vaccinati\nng against certain strains, \nactually you can encourage the other strains to develop?\nDr McIntosh: \nThe beauty of this new approach is that one can attack or prevent as many potential strains as possible, and again I refer to the meningococcal \nserogroup\n B. Until\n now we have had a vaccine in \nC\nó\nrdoba, a vaccine in Normandy\n and\n a vaccine in New Zealand\n,\n \nbecause that is where there have\n been particular strain\ns\n of this organism. But in fact there are hundreds of different strains of this organism around the world, the meningococcal B, and now we have the potential to have a vaccine which can cover the majority of\n those strains. Similarly with S\ntaph, similarly with tuberculosis\n; \nin fact\n,\n what I would also like to mention\n—\nthis might come as a surprise to you\n—\nis the role of viral vaccines in preventing antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance. For example, influenza may result in secondary super\n-\ninfection, bacterial infection, and this is why the influenza vaccine has the potential to prevent antibiot\nic usage. \nI think we should be talking about bacterial vaccines\n and\n about viral vaccines as well.\n&#xa0;\nQ86 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nWhy is vaccine development so much behind an\ntibiotic development? Again with TB, \nit is 70 years since it was developed. There must be some sort of failure in the system.\nDr McIntosh: With \nvaccine devel\nopment we have been using, let’s call them,\n old\n&#x2011;\nfashioned approaches, \nmushing\n up the organism or breaking up the organism, using bits of the organism\n,\n intuitively trying them out. Now we have the potential to look at the genetics of the organism, do various tests after that\n, using bio\ninfo\nr\nmatics and computer systems\n,\n and reall\ny identify the targets that \nwill be successful vaccine targets. \n&#xa0;\nQ87 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nWhy has\nn’t that \ncome along in the past? Is it a technology thing or is it because of the market situation\n?\n \nD\nrugs companies have a vaccine on the market, it does 90% of the job\n,\n so, hey, it is not really worth the\nir\n econom\nically developing a new vaccine.\n Is that the case\n?\nDr McIntosh: \nNo.\n&#xa0;\nQ88 &#xa0; \nStephen Mosley: \nWhy has it taken 70 years?\nDr McIntosh: \nIt is a long process to develop a new antibiotic. It is also a long process to develop a new vaccine. It is very expensive. Once you have done that particular process of discovery of an antibiotic or a vaccine, then you have to run it through human clinical trials, \nyou \nh\nave to get it approved and so on\n, so it is very costly. I think that the process of reverse \nvaccinology\n will reduce the costs of developing new vaccines. I do not see any new techniques available for developing new antibiotics. I think the discovery process there is fixed. \nW\ne now have a flexible, new approach to developing n\new vaccines.\n&#xa0;\nQ89 &#xa0; \nDavid Morris: M\ns Williams, you said you wanted Government action to ensure existing diagnoses were taken up more widely in the NHS. Is there ready evidence that this would be cost\n&#x2011;\neffective?\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nThere is some\n evidence. T\nhere ar\ne studies done on certain tests. There are international audits;\n there is an audit on a C\n&#x2011;\nreactive\n protein, which is a test to show \nrise in infection. T\nhere are some studies\n,\n with co\nst\n&#x2011;\neffectiveness\n related,\n ava\nilable from a global study\n. Cost savings within the NHS are hard. There is never a bag of cas\nh that is released. W\nith diagnostics, \nit is more \nthat you are shifting resources to be used elsewhere\n,\n or releasing capacity\n,\n much more than actually turning up with money at the chief executive\n’\ns door\n,\n and it is quite hard to track that through the s\nystem. It is not quite as clear; it is not as simple \nas taking a pill and someone gets better\n, or they don’t,\n and they release a bed. Diagnostic tests produce information which is used\n,\n but it is\n only one step in the pathway. I\nt is quite complex. \nProfessor Lewith: \nIf we use a CRP, which is C\n&#x2011;\nr\neactive\n protein, you can use i\nt as a near\n&#x2011;\nbedside\n test. That is what GPs can use. It is reasonably effective at differentiating between viruses and bacteria. It is something that is used outside the \nUK\n quite widely. We do not use it here, as I \nsaid, because it costs the GPs three \nquid each time they do it\n,\n and t\nhey might be spending a lot of three \nquids\n in a\n winter. We are about to pilot a large study in Southampton\n—\nMike Moore is running that\n. It will be piloted through our \nclerk and we will look at the cost\n&#x2011;\neffectiveness\n of offering that remuneratio\nn within primary care. T\nhat is a process that is in the planning stages at the moment. It is a very good question\n,\n and it is one we need to answer for the NHS\n, but w\ne need rigorous evidence\n,\n which we do not have yet.\nDr McIntosh: T\nher\ne is \ngreat potential for synergy between diagnostics and vaccination\n. I \nrefer to the previous session in terms of the fear of medical practitioners that the patient could have some underlying serious infection\n,\n and therefore \nthe wish\n to prescribe antibiotics. With diagnostics and successful vaccination\n, we can reduce the fear level—\nnot only in the medical practitioners b\nut also in the public—that the\n patient w\nill have a severe infection. \nI think there is a great potential for synergy between diagnostics and vaccination. \nWe \nmentioned influenza diagnostics. We should mention the great success of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\n,\n which has really reduced the fear of people having pneumonia\n,\n because it has reduced pneumococcal pneumonia\n,\n and the great success obviously of measles, mumps \nand \nrubella, measles being associated with pneumonia as well. \nT\nhe synergy between effective diagnostics and effective vaccination can certainly impact on compliance, \nthe \nnumber of prescriptions, \nthe \nfear of patients that there is a serious infection and also \non\n this public debate about whether or not antibiotics should be used.\nProfessor Lewith: \nDavid, I agree with you that it could impact, but it is not\n,\n because it is not getting into primary care. It is not happening. The science is right, but the dissemination and the activity \nare\n not happening from the GP\n’\ns seat. \nWe have real issues—\nMike Moore and some of the ot\nher guys were talking about it this morning—\nabout a co\n-\nordinated process of making this happen in primary care where the prescriptions are happening.\n&#xa0;\nQ90 &#xa0; \nDavid Morris: \nPresumably information on the incidence of infection and resistance would be useful to companies producing diagnostic tools. Should these companies be doing more to facilitate gathering the information\n,\n to aid their product\n’\ns production?\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nAccess to that sort of information is quite tricky. As an industry\n,\n we are small with limited resources\n,\n and it is a bit of a vicious circle to drive production of a product when you have limited resources to pay for the data and the information. But companies are quite happy to work in combination with the NHS wherever possible to produce that sort of data.\n&#xa0;\nQ91 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: T\nhis is really to Mr \nHardcastle\n and Professor \nLewith\n first and foremost\n. What advantages \ndo your approaches have over other tradit\nional antimicrobials\n?\nJohn Hardcastle: \nThe thing that gets me about this discussion is \nthat \nthere is lots of talk about \n“\npotential\n”,\n and the thing that Dame Sally Davies keeps emphasising is that we are running out of time. \nT\nhe critical thing for us i\ns that we know that \nphages\n work; i\nt is just that we cannot make them available in this country. The reason we cannot make them available in this country is \nthat \nwe have more rigorous regulatory standards. \nFirst, \nwe know \nthat \nthere is evidence that they work. \nS\necond\nly,\n they are harml\ness in man and they are inert; t\nherefore, the rate at which you can bring them through the regulatory regime should be quicker. \nT\nhird\nly,\n there are lots of them. One of the issues that the antibiotic development arena has is that there are lots of possible candidates and very few of them actually get thro\nugh to being useful drugs. F\nrom our perspective, we have a lot of good putative candidates already.\nProfessor Lewith: \nI think that the nutritional and herbal approaches have some preliminary eviden\nce behind them. We need \nsome further investment in research, so we need some harder studies to demonstrate that they really do control symptoms, \nand \nthat they can be prescribed by GPs\n,\n or over the counter and made available by pharmacists, so that the GPs can feel they are doing something. It is very difficult when somebody comes to ask you for help\n to say,\n \n“\nGo away and put up with it for five days.\n”\n We do not have that kind of culture.\nWe need to be able to do something that is safe and does not actually load up antimicrobial resistance for the future. There is huge potential with herbal remedies, but I think we need to move away a little bit from the drug\n&#x2011;\nmining\n element of herbal remedies, where we are looking for the wonderful chemical in the way they lo\noked for the new malarial with A\nrtemisia. We need to see them in a slightly different context\n,\n as more complex mixtures of chemicals. We need to understand much more about herbal safety, because herbs generally are much safer than conventional medicines\n—\nthe evidence is pretty overwhelming around that\n—\nand we need to have thoughtful levels of regulation with t\nhe MHRA. \nI share with John that we need a better process within our regulatory and safety processes\n,\n to take account of things which are not standard pharmaceutical agents\n,\n and a process which allows us to have\n good, critical and \nthoughtful scientific review \nthat\n is relevant to the disciplines\n, so\n that these new and old medications may be reviewed properly and scientifically.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nOur dealings with the MHRA have been pretty good\n,\n but\n,\n as far as I am aware, we are the only company on the planet that has regulatory approval in the way we make our product\n,\n and that is where most of\n our money has gone to date. I\nt is not that the \nMHRA are difficult\n,\n or the FDA or any of the rest of them for that matter, but the mentality makes it very difficult to bring new antimicrobials through quickly.\n&#xa0;\nQ92 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: \nThe UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance St\nrategy 2013 to 2018 states that \nthe development of novel therapies is an important element of the mult\nifaceted approach to tackling \nAR\nM\n. Do you then feel that more resources should be dedicated to your work\n,\n and that this falls into the category so described here?\nJohn Hardcastle: \nIt certainly falls into that category. I get very nervous about suggesting that more money from Government should be placed behind our company or our initiative, but what you should think about is changing the landscape so that both big \npharma\n and the venture capital community will put private money behind potential new antimicrobials.\nProfessor Lewith: \nThe answer to that, I would add, \nis \nthat t\nhe MHRA has been really helpful,\n but they are surroun\nded by a regulatory system that\n makes it sometimes difficult for them. \nT\nhe situation with herbals is very difficult because herbals are not easily patentable\n,\n and \nalso \nmany nutritionals, which may equally be effective\n. W\ne have a big trial that is in debate at the moment about using nu\ntritionals in care homes—\nvitamin D and \nprobiotics\n—\nto diminish or cause antibiotic prescribing. \nY\nou have talked about care homes\n,\n and \ni\nt could have a big impact if we could \ndo \nthat. They \nare \nvery simple, cheap supplements, but they are not\n patentable, so it is very difficult for us to \ncombine with industry to do that\n.\n \nW\ne need to do that with Government\n&#x2011;\nfunded\n research boards\n,\n and that is difficult with the present structure.\n&#xa0;\nQ93 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: D\neveloping this theme for a second, accor\nding to a submission from the Chinese Medical Institute, \nresearch in China tells us that the \n“\nimmunomodulatory\n actions of \ntraditional Chinese medicine formulations have a stimulatory effect on immune cells, immune organs,\n cytokine production\n as well as inhibitory effect on in\nflammations, allergies and auto\nimmune diseases. Studies on acupuncture have shown that this treatment can increas\ne the release of endogen \nopioid\n peptides—”\nProfessor Lewith: Endog\ne\nn\nous opiates.\nDavid Tredinnick: Thank you, Professor. “—t\nhat affect the immune system. Indeed, acupuncture can strengthen the immune system\n.\n \nT\nhe effect can \nbe \nfurther enhanced with acupuncture when combined with Chinese herbal medicine\n”—and w\nestern medicine.\n \nIs this not something that we should be looking at more carefully? They have a body of knowledge there that has been developed over thousands of years. \nProfessor Lewith: \nWe are. First, we are looking at it. Secondly, that is a bit of a claim, and I will just leave it at that. Thirdly, you are unlikely to go to your GP in \nLondon\n and get acupuncture for your chest infection. That is not going to be cost\n&#x2011;\neffective. That is not a reasonable thing to expect the NHS to pay for. But, for instance, we are currently doing a study in \nSouthampton\n on recurrent urinary tract infections in older women\n,\n which is a big problem for a significant minority of older women\n,\n in which we are using Chinese herbal medicines instead of antibiotics. We think that they act in several ways. Interestingly, they act to block the cell membrane pumping the antibiotic out\n.\n \nO\nne of the ways that the body becomes resistant to antibiotics is that \nit\n get\ns\n rid of \nthem\n from the bacterial cells very quickly\n; \nsynergistically\n,\n the herbs appear to stop that membrane transport pump\n,\n so the antibiotics can stay in the cells for longer. \nO\nne of the actions of the particular concoction of herbal medicines we are using does that. It also has direct \nantibacterial effects. The whole point of this process is \nthat we can do this, \nand \nwe can do it very scientifically\n and very thoughtfully, b\nut we cannot do it in an easily patentable way\n,\n and commercialisation is difficult.\nDr McIntosh: O\nne needs to remember that there is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence in favour of immunisation and vaccination\n,\n and that immunisa\ntion and vaccination is preventa\ntive. \nT\no crystallise your point, do you want to go down the path of treatment or do you want to go down the path of prevention? I think prevention is, ultimately, in the short term and the long term\n,\n going to be the way to combat antibiotic resistance.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nI am a big fan of vaccines, but all I would point out again is the time line. Traditionally, vaccines work better against viruses than bacteria\n,\n and I am not sure it makes commercial sense to develop vaccines against all bacteria that cause problems, simply because not everyone gets infected.\n&#xa0;\nQ94 &#xa0; \nDavid Tredinnick: I have j\nust one more question. I think I am right in saying that none of you a\nre qualified as homeopaths, but,\n Professor \nLewith\n, \nI think \nyour submissi\non was in conjunction with Dr Peter Fisher\n, who is the Queen\n’\ns physician\n.\nProfessor Lewith: \nHe is.\nDavid Tredinnick: He\n also runs the \nLondon h\nospital for integrated \nmedicine\n. He draws attention in your submission\n—\nI assume it is him\n—\nto a health technology a\nssessment commissioned by the Swiss Federal G\novernment which found that \n“29 clinical trials of hom\neopathy for upper respiratory tract\n infection or allergies found 29 clinical studies\n of which 24 were positive for\n hom\neopathy.\n”\n He also refers to a study supported by the Indian Minis\ntry of Health, which “involved \ncollaboration between conventional ear, nose and throat specialists and homeopathic doctors in a randomised control\nled trial of hom\neopathy versus conventional treatment in acute \notitis\n media\n.”\n \nI\nt suggests that the numbers of antibiotic presc\nriptions in the \nhomeopathically\n \ntreated group were much lower. Although this is not particularly your field, would it not be sensible for us to make further investigations in this field to establish whether its usage is effective?\nProfessor Lewith: \nThere are two things. First, I agree that vaccinations are very important preventatively\n,\n but you are not going to stop every virus or bacteria with vaccinations. We need some interventions. Secondly, as far as homeopathy is concerned, this Committee has been around the corner very publicly with homeopathy previously and I do not want to get involved in that. The biggest impact a general practitioner has in a consultation is the consultation\n. W\nhen you consider that we \nhave\n an ageing population with multi\n&#x2011;\nmorbidity\n, pain, arthritis, hypertension, irritable bowel, headaches and all sorts of things, \nfor \nthe vast majority of those chronic illnesses, except perhaps hypertension, the biggest response is \nto \nthe consultation, not the medicine. If you go to a GP and get a homeopathic medicine, it may well be a placebo\n,\n but you may go away without using your antibiotics. That happens quite a lot in \nFrance\n and it seems to be quite an effective way of minimising antibiotic prescribing. If you wanted to know whether homeopathy really worked for these infections, then you would need to do more clinical trials\n,\n because the trials are promising but small. T\nhere are about 80,000 medically qualified hom\neopaths, mainly in France and Germany, who use homeopathy \nin this situation quite regularly\n,\n and the evidence is that they use many fewer antibiotics. Whether that is all placebo or real effect, we do not know yet.\n&#xa0;\nQ95 &#xa0; \nChair: B\nefore we move on, to help my understanding, could micro\n&#x2011;\norganisms develop resistance to either the \nbacteriophage\n approach or indeed the herbal approach?\nProfessor Lewith: \nResistance in micro\n&#x2011;\norganisms is very interesting. If you go back to the genome of the micro\n&#x2011;\norganism\n,\n you note that they evolved with fungi. Most of our antibiotics a\nre fungi. There is \nan interesting theory that quite a lot of the current antimicrobial resistance is the reawakening of old evolutionary genes\n.\n \nI\nf you remember Fleming\n’\ns experiment \nin \nSt Mary\n’\ns, the fungi flew in from the window, sat on his plate and the penicillin \nfungus killed the bacteria. O\nur antibiotics largely come from fungi \nthat\n have co\n&#x2011;\nevolved\n with bacteria.\n&#xa0;\nQ96 &#xa0; \nChair: \nSo the answer to my question is yes.\nProfessor Lewith: \nYes. The argument here around vaccination and stimulating the immune system becomes ve\nry powerfully preventative\n if you look at the evolutionary context of antimicrobial resistance.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nJust for a bit of background, \nphages\n have been around for about 3 billion years an\nd bacteria just afterwards. T\nhere has been, for want of a better expression, an arms race going on between the pair of them for a long time. Every day about a quarter of all bact\neria are killed by \nphages\n world\nwide. \nT\no be clear, the way they apply them is as a cocktail\n,\n so that you do not get that concern practically.\n&#xa0;\nQ97 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nFurther research seems to be key to finding future developments. Who should be the main funders\n,\n or who are the main funders of the various types of research that are going on?\nDr McIntosh: \nT\nhis is obviously relevant to a\n big question for vaccination\n,\n because vaccine\n&#x2011;\ndeveloping\n companies invest hundreds of millions of dollars and pounds in developing new vaccines.\n Universities and \nbiotechs\n \nare \noften involved\n at very early stages\n,\n but then you get to the very expensive part of doing the big clinical trials, which we have all referred to\n. T\no get these products approved one has to do clinical trials. The question then comes on to the val\nue that the particular product—\nthe phage\n,\n \nthe \nhomeopathic\n,\n \nthe \nvaccine\n,\n obviously, or \nthe antibiotic for that matter—\nwill have to the NHS in reducing cost. The balance is the amount of i\nnvestment being put in and the cost-benefit to the national health service that will come out—\nthe reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, the reduction in antibiotic resistance. My quick answer really is that in appraising vaccines\n—\nI am not going \nto comment on the \nphages\n or hom\neopathy\n—\nwe now need new ways of appraising using health technology assessment to assess the cost\n&#x2011;\neffectiveness\n of vaccines, not only in the community but also within the hospital setting.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nStephen, did you mean as in who should be picking up the tab for the development of new antimicrobials?\nStephen Metcalfe: \nNo, non\n&#x2011;\nchemical\n antibiotics. Who is funding the research that is going on at the moment?\nJohn Hardcastle: \nI would say that any antimicrobial\n—\nit does not really matter whether it is a vaccine, a phage or a new drug\n—\nfor the most part should be funded by the private sector. The reason I say that is that you need to ensure that everyone is appropriately incentivised. The reason there are few new antibiotics coming along is that it is not worth big \npharma\n’\ns\n while to put their effort there. That is why\n,\n if you look at the top selling drugs, they are antidepressants, cholesterol reducers and the like. \nW\nhat you need to do is change the landscape to encourage those with very deep pockets to take advantage of the good work that is done in academic centres already. It is not an issue about a lack of good ideas. The real issue is when it gets expensive and you have to make it \nworth\n \nwhile\n for those with deep pockets to make a turn.\nProfessor Lewith: I \nagree with that completely.\n&#xa0;\nQ98 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nI was just going to use you as an example of why you may not agree with that.\nProfessor Lewith: Thank you. W\ne can always turn the arguments round the other way. I think what John is saying is \nthat \nwe need different kind\ns\n of processes to incentivise companies. There are \nlots of \nbig herbal companies\n in Europe—\nunfortunately not in this country because we seem to be in the process of destroyi\nng that industry at the moment—that\n produce very good quality products and want to work with us\n,\n and we need to make that easier and more feasible\n.\n \nW\ne need to understand tha\nt if they are going to invest \n£1 million in a clinical trial they need to have something out of that\n.\n \nT\nhat then comes back to the process of patenting and how we manage that insti\ntutionally. People are willing; \nwe \njust \nneed to create the right environment for that to happen.\n&#xa0;\nQ99 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nThat was my point. You were saying how difficult it was to patent herbs. \nC\nan you give us some direction that we should go in\n,\n to try and resolve this\n,\n rather than saying \n“This is the problem”\n? We can all see that. What is the resolution to that problem?\nProfessor Lewith: \nThe resolution is to have commitment from both public and private joint ventures\n that \nwo\nrk well, because if you incentivise\n people they work harder and they do not sit on their bums and expect the Government to pay. I think that is really important. The other thing is \nthat \nwe \ncan \ncreate\n \npatented remedies around two or three herbals \nthat\n might do this\n,\n and they might be very effective mechanisms of symptom control\n; \nsome of the big Chinese companie\ns are really interested in this\n. \nW\ne need to reach out to them\n and\n get our MHRA inspectors going \nin\nto \nChina\n to make sure that these products are produced to good manufacturing practice. We need to be more open in our universities and incentivise \nthem\n to set up joint ventures\n,\n and \nwe need \nto have facilities within the MHRA so that they\n can understand and facilitate—not drop standards—\nand bring in the skilled people who understand these processes and can let us work. I think if we can do that\n, it is not expensive: it needs legislation \nand a few people.\nDr McIntosh: \nCould I give you a concrete example of why big \npharma\n might not want to invest in antibiotics or vaccines? The concrete example is the vaccine I referred to before, \nBexsero\n, the meningococcal B vaccine\n,\n which has had a huge amount of investment and approval in \nEurope\n but rec\nently got knocked back by the \nJCBI. Now of course the JCBI is reviewing that decision and putting some new inputs into their model, but for big \npharma\n, let us say, the investment that one has to make in a vaccine such as \nBexsero\n, or a vaccine for S\ntaphylococcus \naureus\n,\n \nE.coli\n or \nAcinetobacter\n,\n is huge\n,\n and the tools we have for measuring the potential benefit for the NHS and the health system in general are not the best tools\n. That is a concrete example\n \nwhere I think \na big \npharma\n company may think twice about investing huge amounts of money in any intervention if there is not more of an as\nsurance of it being recommended—\nwhether it be a phage, homeopathy or a vaccine such as \nBexsero\n, which is now available to prevent the most common cause of childh\nood infectious death in the UK\n. \nO\nne thinks\n,\n \n“T\nhis is a huge investment, but is this product or vaccine going to be recommended?\n”\n&#xa0;\nQ100 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: It strikes me that\n barriers to the resear\nch are the regulatory framework and\n the tools that are used to work out that cost\n&#x2011;\nbenefit\n analysis. Funding is an issue because of some of that. Are there any other barriers to people investing? The will? Is there a will to research?\nProfessor Lewith: \nThere may not be a will to research certain things \nlike \nphages\n or herbal medicines; t\nhere may not be enough investme\nnt academically to do that. S\netting up one or two centres of excellence would be really helpful and can be done relatively cheaply in joint ventures with specific universities \nthat\n express interest. \nS\nmall amounts of money can be used to seed things. \nI\nf you get the academic interest and get people on side\n, in\n the clinical professions, you can begin to make things change.\nJohn Hardcastle: My experience on this has been that\n we have had to go outside the UK to tie up with centres of excellence in our business, but really there are three things you need to think about. \nFirst, you \nneed to think about changing when the patent time starts ticking\n. R\nather than \nit being \nwhen you apply for a patent, you need to tie it to whe\nn you can sell the medicine. S\necond\nly,\n you need to think about why \nit \nis that those folk who set the drug tariffs believe it is worse to die of cancer\n than it is to die of pneumonia,\n because right now you can get a heck of a lot more mon\ney for a new drug against, let’\ns say, bowel cancer than you can against a new antibiotic or antimicrobial. \nT\nhird\nly,\n you might think about supercharging \nE\nIS relief\n,\n which should be relatively straightforward. You are not going to be able to pick winners\n,\n so what you should be thinking about is saying \nthat \nthose folk who are prepared to back companies in our situation need to be encouraged to divert more of their spare cash \naway from, let’s say, a bricks and \nmortar deal or a software development company into antimicrobials.\n&#xa0;\nQ101 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nThank \nyou. There is a proposal for a D\niagno\nstics and Stratified Medicine Catapult C\nentre. Do you think that is the right approach\n,\n or do you think we should have one that specialises in antibiotics research and things associated with that\n—\ndiagnostics?\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nWe were delighted in the diagnostics industry that the TSB recogni\nsed the importance of having a C\natapult to get diagnostics used\n,\n and\n that\n stratified medicine is \nacross the whole heal\nth care continuum, \ndiagnosing, ruling out, monitoring and managing disease as well. I would be highly in favour of that continuing along the plans that they have got going at the moment.\n&#xa0;\nQ102 &#xa0; \nStephen Metcalfe: \nDoes anyone else have a comment on that?\nJohn Hardcastle: \nIt would probably be no bad thing to align those \nkinds of initiatives with the \nimport \nthat Dame Sally gives, b\nut I would say \nthat \nthe diagnostic aspect is absolutely critical.\n&#xa0;\nQ103 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nYou have covered quite extensively the barriers to research in the UK. Could you tell us a bit more about barriers to introducing new techniques to the market\n,\n apart from research?\nDr McIntosh: \nFirst, I will make a broad comment,\n not necessarily about vaccines.\n \nW\ne do value more, I think, interventions for the elderly end\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\nlife\n type of approaches which may extend life perhaps by a few months or improve quality of life in older people and the elderly\n,\n and there is nothing wrong with that at all.\n&#xa0;\nQ104 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nI am sorry, Dr McIntosh, when you say \n“\nwe\n”,\n who are you referring to?\nDr McIntosh: \nI am saying \n“\nbroadly speaking\n”\n.\nProfessor Lewith: \nAre you making a comment about the age of politicians now?\nDr McIntosh: \nI am speaking as a paediatrician\n;\n we could spend more investment and resources at the beginning\n,\n in\n childhood, in paediatrics. \nI am speaking, I guess, as a paediatrician more than anything, again not devaluing what is done for elderly \npeople \nand \nolder people, but \nI think we could perhaps start to transfer the focus to earlier times i\nn life, childhood, paediatrics and \neven neonato\nlogy, with vaccines coming in for\n that area as well\n,\n where we can really improve not only the quality of life but the length of life by preventing childhood infections. Secondly, preventing childho\nod infections with vaccines has\n been shown to have a benefit for adult and elderly population\ns as well;\n the pneumococcal and influenza vaccination programmes are cases in point where an intervention in childhood has an extreme benefit in the a\ndult and elderly population. \nI think we can start to link up a little bit the beginning\n of life\n and \nthe \nend of life.\n&#xa0;\nQ105 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nI would be quite interes\nted to hear, M\ns Williams, about the barriers that BIVDA feel are prevalent in the \nUK\n, particularly within the NHS.\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nOne of the barriers is the financial flows around the NHS systems in both \nEngland\n and the developed nations. Pathology generally has a budget to provide the testing \nfor all of the hospital care and \nlocal community care as well\n,\n and that means that there is a restriction on the amount of testing that can be done.\n O\nne of the things we would like to see\n,\n wherever tests ar\ne specific to a patient pathway, is\n \nthat \nthe relevant department actually \npicks up the costs of that\n,\n because, as we have said, the cost of a diagnostic test is relatively cheap on the whole and the value it provides is much higher. But if you\n have a restricted silo budget for \nnumerous tests on respiratory infections\n—\nrespiratory infections are the second of the main \ncauses of admission to hospital—and \nif you have an old\n&#x2011;\nfashioned microbiology lab\n,\n \nwhich\n will very effectively pick\n up the cause of the infection but \nwill take t\nime to culture those plates up,\n it is very difficult to \nintroduce a new technology that\n will be slightly more expensive\n but \nmeans that the patient could get the right antibiotic therapy within five hours of being admitted.\n&#xa0;\nQ106 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: I know we are running short of\n time, but I am interested in everyone\n’\ns view \non this, particularly yours:\n do you think that the new structure\ns within NHS England are\n going to be a help or a hindrance to getting new techniques through?\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nAt the moment\n,\n it does not look like the situation for us has changed significantly. Maybe it will and commissioning may help in that, but one of our problems is the lack of awareness as well\n;\n \nwe need \nto make physicians aware \nof the tests that are available.\n \nW\ne have talked about CRP, but there are simple swab tests that could be used in primary care \nthat\n are routinely used el\nsewhere, which just give a colour-\nchange reaction in the same \nway\n as a pre\ngnancy kit. They take seconds to do and \nco\nst\n maybe £1 or £2\n.\n \nW\ne have to find a way of financing that, but it is \nabout \neducating GPs. I even thought that having a biomedical scientist working in the c\nommunity would be a way to support \nGP\ns’ workload\n for that sort of point\n&#x2011;\nof\n&#x2011;\ncare\n testing.\nProfessor Lewith: \nWe have a uniquely refined primary care research structure in the UK which is probably the best in the world\n,\n and it is really well funded. It has not been dramatically affected by the NHS changes\n,\n becaus\ne it is mainly an academic and\n NIHR\n&#x2011;\nfunded\n structure\n.\n \nT\nhere is a huge amoun\nt that we could do if we took \nco\n&#x2011;\nordinated and\n thoughtful action on this. I\nt is very attractive to large \npharma\n to do that kind of work in the UK\n,\n because they know it will be hig\nh quality. W\ne could do a lot of these things here\n,\n within the community\n,\n very ef\nfectively and earn money from them\n.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nYou asked about the barriers\n, a\ns I understood it, in relation to the NHS. The issue for us is cultural. There is a real familiarity with using antibiotics to sort out infectious disease\n,\n and it is not necessarily easy for cli\nnicians to have to deal with a\n number of different approaches to killing a troublesome bug\n,\n so there is going to be a cultural issue.\n&#xa0;\nQ107 &#xa0; \nPamela Nash: \nWhen you say a \n“\ncultural issue\n”\n, who is this affecting? \nI\nt is the same with what you \nwere saying about \nBIVDA\n; \nthere is a high recognition within this place, for \ninstance, about what BIVDA does.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nSay, for example, \nthat \nsomeone comes in and they have an infection, the typical response would be a broad spectrum antibiotic, initially. If you have rapid diagnostics and you know exactly which version of a bug is causing you difficulty, you could apply a narrow spectrum treatment\n,\n which would give you a better outcome\n,\n but it would require a different approach by the clinicians treating the patient.\nProfessor Lewith: \nThe medical culture, not the culture in the House of Commons.\n&#xa0;\nQ108 &#xa0; \nChair: \nCan we pin this down a bit more? There is a UK antim\nicrobial resistance strategy \n2013\n&#x2011;\n18. Does that strategy encompass fully the approaches that each of you \nis\n adopting? If not, what amendments would you recommend\n?\n I will just go down the table and ask that.\nJohn Hardcastle: \nI know \nphages\n are mentioned on page 18, so yes is the short answer. The key issue is the funding.\nChair: \nDr McIntosh? \nDr McIntosh: \nThe strategy is a good document but it does not explicitly or implicitly state that vaccination has had a role in reducing \nantibiotic \nc\nonsumption or\n antibiotic resistance\n,\n and does not implicitly or explicitly state that in the future vaccination has a role in reducing antibiotic resistance.\nChair: \nCan we leave Professor \nLewith\n till last\n?\nDoris-Ann Williams: \nI think the strategy is excellent. It does mention diagnostics. I was quite surprised in the earlier session to hear that GPs are not considering prescription of antibiotics. When you think that must be the most common prescription they write, you would think they would look for a tool and that that would still be at the forefront of their mind.\n&#xa0;\nQ109 &#xa0; \nChair: \nThe reason I left you \ntill\n last, Professor \nLewith\n, is that I want to split the answer in two from you, one in respect of what you said about herbal and the other in response to David \nTredinnick\n’\ns\n question, your response on hom\neopathy\n,\n because I guess there mu\nst be two separate answers\n.\nProfessor Lewith: \nYes, there are.\n&#xa0;\nQ110 &#xa0; \nChair: \nProfessor Davies is on record to this Committee and talking to the Lords as saying that \n“\noutwith\n the placebo effect\n, hom\neopathy has no impact\n.\n I am very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try \nand\n peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious diseases. I am quite clear \nabout where \nI believe the evidence is.\n” \nI am presuming you might have two separate answers.\nProfessor Lewith: Let’\ns answer the difficult one first. I do not t\nhink you should be using hom\neopathy with malaria; I think that is outrageous. In dealing with acute infections, the actual evidence, if you look at it, is unclear \nas to \nwhether it is a placebo or not. With the greatest respect, I do not think Dame Sally Davies has perhaps studied that evidence in any detail, but I think the jury is very much out on that. I do not think it is conclusive. I would support that by saying that you can look at \nthe same data in two separate \nLancet\n systematic reviews about hom\neopathy and come to entirely opposing conclusions\n,\n which, to me, me\nans there is not enough data. \nAs to t\nhe second\n,\n in terms of herbal medicine, I agree that the policy is a great policy. I have read it and I think it covers most of the issues. I think that the issues around herbal medicine are around regulatory issues and facilitating expertise in the \nUK\n,\n and within that context, with \nvery small changes, we could do some quite interesting things in the same way as they are doing in continental \nEurope\n.\nChair: \nI thank the panel for their presentations this morning\n.\n It has been a very interesting morning all round. If you have any additional information you would like to submit, please feel free.\n&#xa0;\nQ111 &#xa0; \nJim Dowd: \nI have one brief question, if I may, Chair. If \nphages\n are killing a quarter of all the bacteria in the world every day, how come there is still so much of it about?\nJohn Hardcastle: \nIt is those pesky bacteria\n that go and\n breed the next day.\nChair: \nOn that point, thank you very much for your attendance. \n              \nOral evidence: Antimicrobial resistance\n, HC \n848\n              \n              \n37\n"
