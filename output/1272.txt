&#xa0;Written evidence from Appleby Town Council (TIC 010)This submission comes from Andy Connell, who is mayor of Appleby-in- Westmorland, and Peter Smith, who is a vicechairman of the Heart of Eden Trust, an umbrella organisation for a cluster of parishes, including Appleby.  Both have long-standing interest in, and knowledge of public transport issues.&#xa0;1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Appleby is historic market town with a population of less than 3,000; but approved housing developments are expected to increase its population by c. 20% in the next few years.  It is surrounded by a scattering of villages, typically two or three miles apart, with populations of a few hundred.  Appleby and Bolton one of villages are the only settlements designated a service centres.&#xa0;2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Appleby lies on the Settle-Carlisle railway line, and has a manned station.  There are seven Monday-Saturday services in each direction and four (three in winter) on Sundays.  Services are much better than in the 1980s, when the line was threatened with closure, and patronage much greater, helped by the introduction of a local railcard.   As well as local work, education and shopping journeys from Appleby, the railway also brings tourists into the town.   &#xa0;3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The main scheduled bus service is the 563 from Kirkby Stephen to Penrith via Appleby and the A66, six times a day Monday-Saturday (no Sunday or Bank Holiday service).  There is also the Tuesday only 625 from Appleby to Penrith and back via several villages, the Wednesday only 561 from Appleby to Kendal and back, and the Friday morning only 573 from surrounding villages into Appleby and back out at mid-day.   Only the 563 is timed to get people in and out of work; the others are primarily shopper services.Bolton has a bus service to Penrith on a Friday which is provided by Fellrunner, a charity which uses volunteer drivers. All are subsidised by county and parish councils.  &#xa0;4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is not clear what is meant by ‘isolated communities’; if this means settlements without scheduled public transport, the first concern is that service cuts do not create any more of them.  Public transport is a key part of the process of managing ageing populations.  Not only does it give people mobility without having to resort to wasteful and potentially hazardous journeys by car, it also provides a regular community event to which they look forward, with benefits to physical and mental health.  People who do not want to be car-dependent, particularly as they get older, will sometimes move into Appleby so that they can access public transport.  &#xa0;5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is not reasonable to move to, or choose to remain in, a village and demand scheduled bus services; and, indeed, this rarely happens.  The Rural Bus Grant of a few years ago was largely wasted because of an insistence that it must go to new routes rather than enhancing existing ones; the result was short-lived services that were little used.  New services can succeed, but only if a quite specific demand and  ridership has been identified in advance.  It follows therefore that government and authorities must do the research in order to identify demand for passenger transport: it is not enough to have vague assurances of support from parish councils and voluntary organisations.  There must be a known core of committed users of a rural service, which may grow once it is up and running.&#xa0;&#xa0;6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our view of Community Transport services and is that they are a potentially valuable enhancement to scheduled public transport, but not a replacement.  Demand-responsive services like Cumbria’s Rural Wheels are appropriate and important for those in isolated locations, but should not be seen as a justification for cutting a bus service.  Older people like the security of a regular event in company; if they have to book something days in advance, they will stay at home, and their health will suffer.&#xa0;7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Funding of rural public transport is obviously a problem.  The best answer is for councils and community groups to encourage usage so that seats are generally filled.  However the majority of potential passengers will have a bus pass and therefore to remain viable a meaningful payment must be provided to the company providing the service based on usage by bus pass carrying passengers.  This payment has been cut to 58% of the fare payable as part of austerity measures, with hints of further reductions to come; it is vital that the payment is stable and realistic if the bus services currently operating are to remain viable.&#xa0;8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Subsidised shopper services can be more viable if they are integrated with school bus services for 39 out of the 52 weeks.  Too often local authority contracting departments appear to ignore one another.  For example, until a few years ago, an Appleby-Kendal passenger service ran twice daily Monday-Friday without a subsidy because the operator did school runs at either end of the shift.   But the school contract was awarded to a different firm, and the operator withdrew the passenger service entirely.   All that was eventually salvaged was one subsidised weekly service (10% of what there had previously been) and even that was threatened with the axe, not on grounds of numbers but of new criteria for subsidy which the County Council approved but ultimately did not fully implement.&#xa0;August 2013&#xa0;
