default&#xa0;defaultIntroduction
default&#xa0;
default1.1 I worked for 10 years as a postdoctoral research scientist in astrophysics in British universities. I worked 
defaultmore recently as an academic on short-term contracts for nearly 5 years and was included in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise. During these times I observed how the career system in British universities affected female (and male) scientists.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 As a 
defaultman, I make comments here on issues affecting women's careers in science within British universities, and emphasise those particular issues where the Committee has requested evidence. I do not here consider STEM careers outside universities.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 I contend
default:
default   (i)
default              
defaultthe academic careers system is fundamentally over-competitive, with large numbers of
default              
defaultscientists chasing a small number of long-term jobs;
default  (ii) 
default              
defaultwomen suffer disproportionately through the need for junior researchers to have patronage 
default              
defaultfrom estab
defaultlished academics to advance their careers;
default (iii)
default              
defaultthere can be no solution to the participation of women in academic science without a
default              
defaultfundamental reform to the research careers system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe academic research careers system and its failures
default&#xa0;
default2.1 There hav
defaulte been repeated complaints about the character of the academic research careers system. These were articulated recently by the 
defaultScience is Vital
default campaign.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 The research careers system is extremely competitive in the sense that large numbers of postdoct
defaultoral scientists on fixed-term contracts chase a small number of permanent university positions, mostly permanent academic positions. This is a direct consequence of research councils funding very large numbers of PhD students compared with the number of lo
defaultng-term jobs available. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 I estimate that the imbalance in the number of PhD positions to the number of long-term jobs in my academic discipline (astronomy) is about 15 to 1. Consequently, only about 5-10% of people who are awarded PhDs will continue i
defaultn university research in the long term. All others will have to leave academia for industry, business or the public sector. Some will leave 
defaultimmediately after completing a PhD; others will leave after one, two or three three-year research assistantship posi
defaulttions, or after the expiry of fellowships. Ageism excludes many researchers who do not obtain lectureships by their late 30s from further employment in academic research.
default&#xa0;
default2.4 People who attempt to achieve research careers will usually be employed on a 
defaultnumber of three-year fixed-term contracts, often moving university (and hence city, even country) to take up new contracts. This uncertain lifestyle is difficult to reconcile with a family life.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 The extreme imbalance between the number of early-career
default researchers employed on short-term contracts and the number of long-term university positions leads to an expectation of career failure for a large majority of researchers. Those researchers who do not obtain permanent lectureships are expected to find em
defaultployment in business, industry or the public sector, and are expected not to engage in university research again: they are expected to leave universities and most are expected not to be heard of again. Established academics in particular tend to accept tha
defaultt a majority of junior researchers will not progress to a long-term university career.
default&#xa0;
default2.6 There is a very strong hierarchy within university research structures, the result of attitudes within universities and research councils, and of research council p
defaultractice. These make support from established academics of critical importance in the career opportunities available to junior researchers. Practical examples of these hierarchies include: 
default  (i) 
default              
defaultApplications for fellowships generally need to be approved b
defaulty universities, giving university 
default              
defaultdepartments decisive roles in determining which individuals are able to apply for fellowships. 
default              
defaultSome research councils, such as the Science and Technology Facilities Council, even apply 
default              
defaultstrict quotas on the number of app
defaultlicants individual departments can put forward. 
default  (ii) 
default              
defaultResearchers on fixed-term contracts are unable in practice, or in very many cases prohibited, 
default              
defaultfrom applying themselves for research grants, even modest sums for equipment. Some 
default              
defaultestablished academic
defaults are willing tosubmit grant applications written by fixed-term staff 
default              
defaultunder the name of the established academic; many, perhaps most, established academics do 
default              
defaultnot even do this. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7 Junior researchers are dependent on the support and patronage of establ
defaultished academics in other ways, including the following. 
default  (i) 
default              
defaultPhD students and research assistants are normally granted access to data and to facilities 
default              
defaultthrough established academics. Academics make decisions as to which individuals are given 
default              
defaultaccess to
default the best data, the best facilities and the best projects. 
default  (ii) 
default              
defaultMuch competitive research is carried out today within collaborations and teams. Entry into 
default              
defaultcollaborations is often dependent on nomination by established academics who are already 
default              
defaultmember
defaults. Entry of researchers into collaborations is consequently dependent on established 
default              
defaultacademics taking positive action to support them. 
default (iii) 
default              
defaultJunior researchers normally require grant holders - established academics - to release funding 
default              
defaultfor the researc
defaulthers to travel to conferences at which they might get themselves noticed by 
default              
defaultpotential future employers.
default&#xa0;
default2.8 Consequently, fixed-term research staff have little ability to control their own careers unless they are given active support to do so by establis
defaulthed academics. This creates a strong need for 
defaultsupport or patronage from established academics to continue a career. 
default&#xa0;
default2.9 This need for support and patronage can lead to an unconscious bias in favour of individuals similar in character, manner and backgrou
defaultnd to established academics. This can lead to a selection in favour of certain individuals, and a selection against women, ethnic minorities and people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
default&#xa0;
default2.10 Pushy, loud or articulate individuals are more likely
default to be noticed by established academics, and consequently may be more likely to receive essential career support. Conversely, junior researchers who are quiet, shy, reticent or polite can be denied opportunities regardless of their abilities as researchers
default. In my own case, I feel that I, as somebody (and a man) who attempts to be polite at all times, tended to be overlooked for support at times. 
default&#xa0;
default2.11 Academics frequently assume a standard career trajectory for all researchers. This conventionally involves
default a PhD, followed by one or two postdoctoral research assistantships, and then a fellowship, with the publication of a few or several research publications at each of these stages. There is little allowance for career paths that do not conform to this patte
defaultrn, which may include a career break to raise a family. In my own case, time spent on project support reduced my early research publication rate. 
default&#xa0;
default2.12 Established academics tend to under-appreciate the deficiencies in the academic careers system. In some
default cases this is because established academics feel that they managed to obtain permanent jobs and therefore assume that the system cannot be too bad. Many others fail to recognise that support that was given to them that proved critical in them getting perm
defaultanent positions.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultFactors that particularly affect women
default&#xa0;
default3.1 An unconscious bias by academics preferentially to support people like themselves is likely to disadvantage women, given the much greater numbers of male than female academics in many scientifi
defaultc fields. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 While it is dangerous to generalise about personality types and gender, it is clear that some characteristics are more common among men than women. An aggressive pushiness may be more common among men than women, which may help some types o
defaultf men to get essential career support from established academics. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3 Women may choose to take time out of research to have children. This may leave gaps in their publication records and it may mean they lose their up-to-date knowledge of fast-changing research fields. Consequently, women scientists may find it difficult
default to return to research after career breaks. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4 Women are very conscious of the need to start families before their fertility declines with age. Women who do not succeed in obtaining a permanent job before their mid-thirties may feel it necessary to aban
defaultdon science for more secure employment.
default&#xa0;
default3.5 I have witnessed occasional instances of positive discrimination in favour of young women at the time of appointments to lectureships. These actions have helped to lessen gender imbalances among academic staff. 
defaultHowever, there does appear to be an element of luck which can disadvantage women who happen not to be in the right place at the right time. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6 Selecting some women for academic jobs through positive discrimination could lead to an under-performance of t
defaulthese women later in their academic careers. It would also discriminate against more talented women who are not lucky enough to receive such selective support.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNecessary reforms 
default&#xa0;
default4.1 Fundamental reforms to the academic careers system are needed to reduce
default the disadvantages that affect most researchers and which particularly disadvantage women. These include: 
default   (i) 
default              
defaultChanges to lessen the importance of patronage from established academics in developing the 
default              
defaultcareers of junior researchers. 
default  (ii) 
default              
defaultGiving ju
defaultnior researchers greater opportunities to control their own careers. 
default (iii) 
default              
defaultReducing the extreme imbalance between numbers of people trained to PhD standard and the 
default              
defaultnumber of long-term positions in universities and research institutes. 
default  (iv) 
default              
defaultReducing
default the influence of ageism in determining the opportunities available to fixed-term 
default              
defaultstaff. 
default   (v) 
default              
defaultDeveloping a greater acceptance of diversity in the backgrounds of researches and greater 
default              
defaultawareness of different career paths, including career breaks to ra
defaultise families. 
default(vi) 
default              
defaultA greater willingness by academics to promote without favouritism the careers of junior 
default              
defaultresearch staff.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 Reforms would need dedicated action by research councils, universities, university departments, research groups and individua
defaultl academics. A much greater awareness is needed at all levels of the failings of the academic careers system and how it disadvantages many researchers, including women, ethnic minorities and people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 Research staff should
default initiate a new campaigning organisation dedicated to lobbying for improvements to academic research careers, including issues that particularly affect women. The trade union recognised by universities to represent fixed-term staff – the University and Col
defaultlege Union – should strongly improve its representation of research staff and attempt to understand  the problems affecting women researchers.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 I recommend that the Select Committee on Science and Technology holds a dedicated inquiry into the general i
defaultssue of academic research careers. 
default&#xa0;
