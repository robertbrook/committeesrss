&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by Disabled People Against Cuts (JRR 0004)[bold]Who we are:[bold]DPAC is a grass roots campaign body. It was formed by a group of disabled people after the first mass protest against the austerity cuts and their impact on disabled people held on the 3rd October in [bold]Birmingham 2010[bold], [bold]England[bold]. It was led by disabled people [bold]under the name of The Disabled Pe[bold]oples’ Protest. DPAC has over 15[bold],000 members and supporters and works with many [bold]of our own local groups, other [bold]anti-cuts groups, Universities, Disabled Peoples’ Organizations, and Unions[bold]. We are involved with the Justice [bold]Al[bold]liance[bold] campaign to save legal aid. [bold]Prepared and submitted by Disabled People against Cuts (DPAC) November 2013[bold]Introduction
[normal]DPAC believes that access to legal aid is vital for disabled people to be able to have access to justice and to challenge through 
[normal]our judicial system violations of disabled people’s human rights. We feel strongly that the judiciary play a vital role in liberal-democratic states to provide a way in which the power of the state is lawful and regulated.
[normal]The judicial review process is a 
[normal]vital tool in allowing disabled people to challenge – often through public interest cases rather 
[normal]then
[normal] just in relation to individual circumstances - situations where the decisions, acts or omissions of public bodies may not be lawful. These types of cases 
[normal]in particular are invaluable in ensuring disabled people’s human rights are upheld.
[normal]DPAC made a joint submission to the consultation on Judicial Review with Inclusion London and agree with the view that several of the proposals set out will erode basic hum
[normal]an rights of disabled people to access justice, particularly the proposals to change the rules on ‘standing’, the proposal to use methods other than judicial review for resolving Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) disputes and several of the proposals unde
[normal]r ‘
[normal]Rebalancing Financial Incentives’
[normal]. 
[normal]Being able to enforce the upholding PSED is vitally linked to disabled people’s rights guaranteed under UNCRPD in particular articles 
[normal]art.4.1 a, b, c, d, e, 4.2,and 3: art 5.2. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The tests which apply to being able to seek a Judicial reviews are already stringent and the process of  gaining access to legal aid to get legal representation is also stringent. DPAC believes that to make access to 
[normal]justice any more difficult would seriously erode disabled people’s human rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government have said that the Judicial Review process is unmeritorious and being used by activists to attack government policies. We would argue that government policy mu
[normal]st meet PSED outlined in the Equalities Act, rights established in UNCRPD, 
[normal]EcHR
[normal] and HR Act and be open to challenge legally if policy and legislation fail to meet these criteria. 
[normal]Unfortunately
[normal] public bodies as well as the government do make unjust decision
[normal]s that do not take into account reasonable adjustments for disabled people and judicial reviews are one of the few avenues disabled people have to correct these unjust decisions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Below are examples of successful or on-going challenges in key areas for dis
[normal]abled people:
[normal]Council care services: A successful challenge was made to the decision by Birmingham City Council to cut care service so that only individuals with ‘critical’ needs received social care.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]WCA: A judicial review case was recently won against t
[normal]he Department of Work and Pensions on the inadequacy and discriminatory nature of the Work Capability Assessments for those with mental health conditions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Size Criteria In Local Housing Allowance and Bedroom Tax: The Court of Appeal decided that the local
[normal] housing allowance size criteria discriminated unlawfully. The government then changed the criteria so that some disabled children now do not have to share a room and withdrew its Supreme Court appeal.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ten more cases are challenging the 
[normal]bedroom tax through judicial reviews, five on behalf of disabled children and five by disabled adults. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]As the examples above show, judicial reviews are extremely important because they allow disabled people 
[normal]to challenge public bodies, and help ensure that public bodies fulfil their duties and act within the law, as Michael Fordham QC stated:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘It (judicial reviews) constitutes a safeguard which is essential to the rule of law: promoting the public interest; p
[normal]olicing the parameters and duties imposed by Parliament; guiding public authorities and securing that they act lawfully; ensuring that they are accountable to law and not above it; and protecting the rights and interests of those affected by the exercise o
[normal]f public authority power’.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are also extremely concerned about plans to limit third party interventions as these are most often made by EHRC who intervene in cases where the government or other public body have failed to meet their PSED or other duties
[normal]. EHRC’s interventions are designed to guide both the court and the others involved in JR pro
[normal]cesses in how best these 
[normal]duties
[normal] should be met
[normal]. 
[normal]Other third sector interventions are often made by well –respected organisations working in a particular area of con
[normal]cern to support not only individual cases but whole groups of people being disadvantaged by any changes being put forward. 
[normal]We can see no justification in changing the rules about this and again feel that to do so would result in grave violations of disable
[normal]d people’s human rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The recent court case around the closure of the Independent Living Fund where the way in which the minister for disabled people, Esther McVey, was condemned by the Court of Appeal for failing to meet her PSED and where the decisio
[normal]n to close the fund was quashed is one example of how important an intervention by EHRC can be in the judicial process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DPAC is opposed to the proposal to only pay lawyers for work on judicial reviews if a case is granted permission to proceed to a full hearing, for the following reasons: 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Judicial revi
[normal]ews are a crucial mechanism that enable disabled people to challenge the policies, decisions and actions of public bodies, for example a public body may be challenged because of the failure to consider the impact of a law or a decision on disabled people a
[normal]nd their human rights or because they have failed to consult properly regarding changes to a service.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Lawyers prepare cases in discussion with claimants so it can go to court. Once at court a judge will decide whether the case has sufficient merit to proc
[normal]eed further, giving 
[normal]‘permission’ [bold]for the case
[normal] [bold]to proceed to a final hearing. The judge makes this decision based on the papers or oral evidence prepared by lawyers. However, when lawyers threaten to bring legal action or begin proceeding, public bodies oft
[normal]en settle before a judge has made a decision on whether to grant a case permission to continue to a full hearing.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]R
[normal]esearch by the Public Law Project (PLP), suggests that thousands of cases are settled with a positive outcome for the claimant but before 
[normal]a full hearing: 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]after the claim was issued but before the permission application was determined 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]after permission was refused on the papers but before the oral renewal was heard 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]after permission was granted but before the substantive hearing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If this 
[normal]proposal goes ahead lawyers have said:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These changes will be disastrous for disabled people who need legal aid to challenge public bodies.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The government says that there are two overarching reasons for their proposals: the need to cut costs; and to restore what it describes as ‘public confidence’ in legal aid.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]These proposals will not cut costs because if legal aid is restricted disabled p
[normal]eople will 
[normal]have no other option but to 
[normal]represent themselves in court. This will be more time consuming, the backlog of cases will increase and ultimately this will be more costly.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given the high number of legal challenges made by disabled people in attem
[normal]pts to protect their human rights there does not seem to be any evidence that disabled people have lost confidence in the use of legal aid for the type of challenges that disabled people have brought against public bodies e.g. legal challenges to the bedro
[normal]om tax.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DPAC believe that this proposal in particular would have a disastrous impact on disabled people’s human rights and their access to justice. It is of immense importan
[normal]ce that public bodies can be forced to meet their PSED legally. We believe replacing the court mechanism for this by a non-judicial mechanism would water down the legislation to the point where it would be useless as a means of upholding disabled people’s 
[normal]human rights. Again the recent court case regarding the Independent Living Fund ruling 
[normal]illustrates the importance of this legal process. We already have EHRC who are supposed to regulate human rights but who in actual fact have little statutory power to do
[normal] so. We know from experience that when EHRC express concern to the government about their actions that without legal backup from the courts this is ignored and no action to redress any problems is taken by government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To leave the right to challenge publi
[normal]c bodies who fail to meet their PSED to EHRC or any similar kind of non-judicial mechanism would we believe be disastrous for disabled people.
