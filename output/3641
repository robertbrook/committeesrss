It was led by disabled people defaultunder the name of The Disabled Pedefaultoples’ Protest. DPAC has over 15default,000 members and supporters and works with many defaultof our own local groups, other defaultanti-cuts groups, Universities, Disabled Peoples’ Organizations, and Unionsdefault. We are involved with the Justice defaultAldefaultliancedefault campaign to save legal aid. defaultPrepared and submitted by Disabled People against Cuts (DPAC) November 2013defaultIntroduction
defaultDPAC believes that access to legal aid is vital for disabled people to be able to have access to justice and to challenge through 
defaultour judicial system violations of disabled people’s human rights. We feel strongly that the judiciary play a vital role in liberal-democratic states to provide a way in which the power of the state is lawful and regulated.
defaultThe judicial review process is a 
defaultvital tool in allowing disabled people to challenge – often through public interest cases rather 
defaultthen
default just in relation to individual circumstances - situations where the decisions, acts or omissions of public bodies may not be lawful. These types of cases 
defaultin particular are invaluable in ensuring disabled people’s human rights are upheld.
defaultDPAC made a joint submission to the consultation on Judicial Review with Inclusion London and agree with the view that several of the proposals set out will erode basic hum
defaultan rights of disabled people to access justice, particularly the proposals to change the rules on ‘standing’, the proposal to use methods other than judicial review for resolving Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) disputes and several of the proposals unde
defaultr ‘
defaultRebalancing Financial Incentives’
default. 
defaultBeing able to enforce the upholding PSED is vitally linked to disabled people’s rights guaranteed under UNCRPD in particular articles 
defaultart.4.1 a, b, c, d, e, 4.2,and 3: art 5.2. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe tests which apply to being able to seek a Judicial reviews are already stringent and the process of  gaining access to legal aid to get legal representation is also stringent. DPAC believes that to make access to 
defaultjustice any more difficult would seriously erode disabled people’s human rights.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government have said that the Judicial Review process is unmeritorious and being used by activists to attack government policies. We would argue that government policy mu
defaultst meet PSED outlined in the Equalities Act, rights established in UNCRPD, 
defaultEcHR
default and HR Act and be open to challenge legally if policy and legislation fail to meet these criteria. 
defaultUnfortunately
default public bodies as well as the government do make unjust decision
defaults that do not take into account reasonable adjustments for disabled people and judicial reviews are one of the few avenues disabled people have to correct these unjust decisions.
default&#xa0;
defaultBelow are examples of successful or on-going challenges in key areas for dis
defaultabled people:
defaultCouncil care services: A successful challenge was made to the decision by Birmingham City Council to cut care service so that only individuals with ‘critical’ needs received social care.
default&#xa0;
defaultWCA: A judicial review case was recently won against t
defaulthe Department of Work and Pensions on the inadequacy and discriminatory nature of the Work Capability Assessments for those with mental health conditions.
default&#xa0;
defaultSize Criteria In Local Housing Allowance and Bedroom Tax: The Court of Appeal decided that the local
default housing allowance size criteria discriminated unlawfully. The government then changed the criteria so that some disabled children now do not have to share a room and withdrew its Supreme Court appeal.   
default&#xa0;
defaultTen more cases are challenging the 
defaultbedroom tax through judicial reviews, five on behalf of disabled children and five by disabled adults. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs the examples above show, judicial reviews are extremely important because they allow disabled people 
defaultto challenge public bodies, and help ensure that public bodies fulfil their duties and act within the law, as Michael Fordham QC stated:
default&#xa0;
default‘It (judicial reviews) constitutes a safeguard which is essential to the rule of law: promoting the public interest; p
defaultolicing the parameters and duties imposed by Parliament; guiding public authorities and securing that they act lawfully; ensuring that they are accountable to law and not above it; and protecting the rights and interests of those affected by the exercise o
defaultf public authority power’.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also extremely concerned about plans to limit third party interventions as these are most often made by EHRC who intervene in cases where the government or other public body have failed to meet their PSED or other duties
default. EHRC’s interventions are designed to guide both the court and the others involved in JR pro
defaultcesses in how best these 
defaultduties
default should be met
default. 
defaultOther third sector interventions are often made by well –respected organisations working in a particular area of con
defaultcern to support not only individual cases but whole groups of people being disadvantaged by any changes being put forward. 
defaultWe can see no justification in changing the rules about this and again feel that to do so would result in grave violations of disable
defaultd people’s human rights.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe recent court case around the closure of the Independent Living Fund where the way in which the minister for disabled people, Esther McVey, was condemned by the Court of Appeal for failing to meet her PSED and where the decisio
defaultn to close the fund was quashed is one example of how important an intervention by EHRC can be in the judicial process.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDPAC is opposed to the proposal to only pay lawyers for work on judicial reviews if a case is granted permission to proceed to a full hearing, for the following reasons: 
default&#xa0;defaultJudicial revi
defaultews are a crucial mechanism that enable disabled people to challenge the policies, decisions and actions of public bodies, for example a public body may be challenged because of the failure to consider the impact of a law or a decision on disabled people a
defaultnd their human rights or because they have failed to consult properly regarding changes to a service.
default&#xa0;
defaultLawyers prepare cases in discussion with claimants so it can go to court. Once at court a judge will decide whether the case has sufficient merit to proc
defaulteed further, giving 
default‘permission’ defaultfor the case
default defaultto proceed to a final hearing. The judge makes this decision based on the papers or oral evidence prepared by lawyers. However, when lawyers threaten to bring legal action or begin proceeding, public bodies oft
defaulten settle before a judge has made a decision on whether to grant a case permission to continue to a full hearing.  
default&#xa0;
defaultR
defaultesearch by the Public Law Project (PLP), suggests that thousands of cases are settled with a positive outcome for the claimant but before 
defaulta full hearing: 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultafter the claim was issued but before the permission application was determined 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultafter permission was refused on the papers but before the oral renewal was heard 
default-
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultafter permission was granted but before the substantive hearing. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf this 
defaultproposal goes ahead lawyers have said:
default&#xa0;
defaultThese changes will be disastrous for disabled people who need legal aid to challenge public bodies.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe government says that there are two overarching reasons for their proposals: the need to cut costs; and to restore what it describes as ‘public confidence’ in legal aid.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThese proposals will not cut costs because if legal aid is restricted disabled p
defaulteople will 
defaulthave no other option but to 
defaultrepresent themselves in court. This will be more time consuming, the backlog of cases will increase and ultimately this will be more costly.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGiven the high number of legal challenges made by disabled people in attem
defaultpts to protect their human rights there does not seem to be any evidence that disabled people have lost confidence in the use of legal aid for the type of challenges that disabled people have brought against public bodies e.g. legal challenges to the bedro
defaultom tax.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDPAC believe that this proposal in particular would have a disastrous impact on disabled people’s human rights and their access to justice. It is of immense importan
defaultce that public bodies can be forced to meet their PSED legally. We believe replacing the court mechanism for this by a non-judicial mechanism would water down the legislation to the point where it would be useless as a means of upholding disabled people’s 
defaulthuman rights. Again the recent court case regarding the Independent Living Fund ruling 
defaultillustrates the importance of this legal process. We already have EHRC who are supposed to regulate human rights but who in actual fact have little statutory power to do
default so. We know from experience that when EHRC express concern to the government about their actions that without legal backup from the courts this is ignored and no action to redress any problems is taken by government.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo leave the right to challenge publi
defaultc bodies who fail to meet their PSED to EHRC or any similar kind of non-judicial mechanism would we believe be disastrous for disabled people.
