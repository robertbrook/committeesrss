defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area;default1.1 
defaultPreventing crime is the first priority of the Police and Crime Plan.  We are working with other Police and Crime Commissioners, Welsh Government, Probation, Local Authorities, voluntary organisations and businesses to this end.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 The effectiveness Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) on reducing crime will be decided by voters 
defaulti
defaultn May 2016.  Delivering on this requires attention to the context in which crime occurs – “the wider social mission” of crime reduction, to use a recent phrase.  That does not mean the police have to do it all.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 PCCs commissioning powers allow the police to focus on policing and other experts to help prevent crime, tackle offending, encourage reporting, protect the vulnerable, address mental health and substance misuse issues and reduce anti-social behaviour. 
default&#xa0;
default1.4 In Dyfed-Powys we are emphasising neighbourhood policing, improving public access and confidence in police services.  This requires services that are more public focussed, responsive, cost effective and professional.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultWe have (1) brought forward the recruitment of 30 officers as a result of better management; (2) reduced the cost of the three top salaries (Chief Constable, Chief Finance Officer and Chief of Staff) from £420,000 to £330,000; (3) responded to public demand with “when we’re in, we’re open” (this mean
defaults
default rural stations are more accessible); 
defaultand 
default(4) introduced a Commissioner
default’
defaults Fund that puts money at the disposal of frontline officers for crime reduction in their neighbourhoods.  We have reviewed our use of cautions with external input and an assurance panel.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 Commissioning will begin in earnest in 2014/15.  We have appointed a Director of Commissioning, responsible for community safety, local justice, and victims
default’
default services.  This post will be responsible for building capacity and working with voluntary organisations in areas such as, restorative justice, domestic and sexual violence, and antisocial behaviour reduction.  We have piloted the use of mediation and intend to expand this and other innovative crime prevention services such as mentoring, education, counselling and youth interventions.
default&#xa0;
default1.7 
defaultCovering
default the most rural 
defaultpolice force
default in England and Wales, local accountability allows us to respond to local need in a thoughtful and flexible way.  Geography is a huge challenge.  We are developing relationships with local universities to enhance our evidence base and polic
defaulty
default making to meet that challenge.

defaultThe role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account;default2.1 
defaultTo allow the 
defaultDyfed-Powys 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioner and the Chief Constable to exercise their roles in a transparent
default and aligned
default manner a Policing Board has been e
defaultstablish
defaulted.  Th
defaulte
default Board consists of 
defaultthe PCC, his D
defaulteputy, the Chief Constable and Chief Finance Officer 
defaultwho 
defaultmeet on a weekly basis
default.
default 
defaultA
defaultn extended Board meeting
default is held
default once a month
default.
default This extended Board is a critical element in the 
defaultCommissioner’s
default scrutiny role. 
default 
defaultIt enables early identification of core issues and tracks progress against the priorities contained within the Police and Crime Plan
default.
default 
default 
defaultThe monthly meetings are open and available for the public to attend.  The terms of reference and working arrangements for the Board are outlined in 
defaulta
default 
defaultPolicing Board Charter
default and are available on our website.
default  Weekly meetings 
defaultfocus
default 
defaulton core issues effecting policing and crime, whereas monthly meetings are 
defaultcentred 
defaulton a predetermined Police and Crime Plan priority.  The minutes of all Policing Board meetings are published on the O
defaultffice of the 
defaultP
defaultolice and 
defaultC

default website.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 The Commissioner holds informal Personal Development Reviews (PDR) with the Chief Constable
default (CC)
default. These meetings feed into the formal annual PDR
default. 
default 
defaultThe annual PDR holds the Chief Constable to account for his performance against set criteria, identifies the key challenges for the year ahead and agrees the 
defaultkey performance indicators
default for the next PDR.
default3.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account;default3.1 
defaultThe relationship between the PCC and the Panel is developing well. As awareness and acceptance of the separate and distinct roles of the 
defaultPCC
default and Police and Crime Panel develop, so too does the relationship
default between the two bodies
default.  The Panel were able to offer some constructive observations in relation to the development of the Police and Crime Plan and accepted the proposed budget and precept proposals in 2012.  
defaultThe panel also considered the recommendations of the PCC in appointing his Deputy (after an open selection and appointment process) and Chief of Staff. The Panel interviewed both appointees robustly before confirming the appointments. The Panel has been equally robust in reviewing the Commissioner’s reports to them and in 
defaultquestioning the information contained within those reports.
default  
default&#xa0;
default3.2 
defaultThe Panel will 
defaultbe informed of the budget considerations 
defaultand proposed precept 
defaultat the earliest given opportunity
default.  
defaultHowever
default, given that the government’s 
defaultAutumn statement is not expected until the 5
defaultth
default December and the Policing Settlement until the 18
defaultth
default December, 
defaultlegislative constraints mean that this allows limited time for in-depth Panel considerations.
default 
default 
defaultHowever
default,
default to facilitate matters, a
default meeting has been arranged for the Panel to consider matters relating to the budget in early January, in advance of the meeting where they will be asked to formally consider the Commissioner’s precept proposal.

defaultTdefaulthe division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011;default4.1 
defaultWithin Dyfed-Powys the Stage 2 transfer plan is being approached as a step in a joint pr
defaultogramme of reform in the organisation
default. This approach has been branded the ‘Public First’ change programme. The aim is to redesign services to ensure they are value for money, flexible and responsive to community needs.  Success will require a cultural as well as an organisational change. The focus is to ensure that front line policing services are prioritised in the light of the fina
defaultncial challenges posed by the Comprehensive Spending Review.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultUnder the proposal submitted to the Home Secretary all operational and operational support police staff will be transferred to the employment of the Chief Constable at midnight on 31st March 2014. This means that 792 members of staff
default, based on current staffing levels 
defaultwill transfer to the employment of the Chief Constable.
default&#xa0;
default4.3 
defaultThe PCC is in the process of employing a Director of Resources who will be responsible for all business support staff. 
default 
defaultThe Director of Resources and business support staff, totalling 219
default (based on current staffing levels)
default, will remain employed by the Commissioner but answerable to the Chief Constable for the timeliness, quantity and quality of services he requires. They will also deliver support to the Commissioner and commissioned services. This is intended to be an interim arrangement that will not last beyond September 2015. 
default&#xa0;
default4.4 
defaultDuring this transitional period, in accordance with the provisions of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, the opportunity to enter into agreements with other policing bodies and local partners to support front-end service delivery will be explored and taken forward. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5 
defaultInnovation will be key to 
defaultthe successful delivery of ‘Pub
defaultl
defaultic First’
default. The PCC
default and CC are 
defaultconfident that this phased approach will deliver the best structure for Dyfed-Powys and will provide adequate, appropriate and agile support services. Discussions for implementing such arrangements are beginning now but will not be concluded for transfer by the 31 March 2014.  All final transfers to the Chief Constable and/or other local partners will take place no later than September 2015
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 At the time of writing this submission, the Dyfed-Powys Stage 2 proposal is being considered by the Home Secretary.

default  
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultDuring 
defaulthis
default first year in office
default,
default 
defaultthe Commissioner
default had little time to 
defaultmake budget and precept decisions.  Decision making for the second year of 
defaultbudget and 
defaultprecept setting 
defaulthas been more strategically and operationally focused
default. 
default 
defaultThe Commissioner has to manage a predicted overall budget decrease of £9
default 
defaultmillion over the next four years. 
defaultThere is therefore a strategic balance to be struck between cost reduction, precept setting and safeguarding operational policing. 
default 
defaultThe Commissioner has committed to protecting Community policing and to minimising precept rises.
default 
default 
defaultWhilst no final decision can be taken until we receive our budget settlement from the Home Office
default the 
defaultCommissioner has indicated that the 
defaultprecept 
defaultfor 2015
default 
defaultwill 
defaultrise
default by 
defaultno more than 
default3.1%, in comparison to 3.9% in 2013/14, and 5% under the Police Authority in 2012/13.  
defaultThe Commissioner’s 
defaultintention is to keep future rises 
defaultin line
default with inflation.
default&#xa0;
default5.3 
defaultIn terms of budget setting the Chief Constable has been tasked with outlining organisational requirements moving forward.  There

defaultThey

defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities;default6.1 
defaultFor police 
defaultand crimedefault defaultpriorities
default 
defaultto be delivered, buy
default-
defaultin is needed across criminal justice agencies.  
defaultThis has been achieved within Dyfed-Powys by ensuring that the PCC has representation on appropriate Boards.  Whilst it has taken some time for some agencies
default’
default to 
defaultadapt to
default PCCs, we now have local representation on the All Wales Criminal Justice Board, the Local Criminal Justice Board, the 
defaultArea Planning Boards, Local Service Boards and Community Safety Partnerships.  This has given the opportunity to not only drive forward delivery of police and crime priorities, but also ensure that partner agencies priorities are aligned and complement service delivery across 
defaultorganisations
default.
default  Such partnerships allow for mutual problem solving 
defaultsuch as 
defaultmaking better use of resources 
defaultthrough 
defaultcommissioning, or joint collaboration
default, 
defaultthereby resulting in services being delivered smarter and 
defaultin a way that is 
defaultmore accessible to users.   
defaultWe 
defaultare exploring ways in which the Dr
defaultug Intervention Programme
default can be
defaultst be delivered
default.  This will result in the availability of drug rehabilitation treatment being widened by pooling monies available and sharing 
defaultcontract administration costs.  We are also exploring opportunities with our Local Authorities 
defaultto
default establish 
defaultjoint front counter services.
default&#xa0;
default6.2 
defaultKey to promoting 
defaultPolice 
defaultand 
defaultCrime Plan 
defaultpriorities 
defaultis 
defaultestablishing effective working relationships with other agencies on a person to person basis.  This approach has facilitated enhanced working with the private and third sector
default agencies
default that have skills and experience to deliver local priorities more efficiently and at a reduced price. 
defaultThis will be a key part of the ‘Public First’ initiative.
default&#xa0;
default6.3 
defaultIn an area such as Wales where many agencies that have a responsibility 
defaultfor preventing crime and promoting safety are devolved, PCCs act as the link between national, regional and local
default policy
default.  It is essential that effective relationships are maintained with both central and devolved administrations.
default  To facilitate this regular meetings are held with 
defaultthe 
defaultSecretary of States (Wales)
default, 
defaultHome Office
default, and 
defaultboth the Health
default,
default and 
defaultLocal Government and Government Business
default 
defaultWelsh 
defaultMinisters.
default&#xa0;
default6.4 
defaultThe PCC will
default work with other commissioning bodies such as the Community Rehabilitation Companies (under 
defaultthe 
defaultTransforming 
defaultRehabilitation agenda).  This will promote local priorities to all those that are co
defaultnsidering bidding for this work
default.  It 
defaultalso facilitates 
defaultfuture discussion for possible co-commissioning of services.
default&#xa0;
default6.5 
defaultWe have held regular surgeries and events over 2012/13.  This will be widened into a ser
defaulties of local listening days.  This involves holding a 
defaultnumber of days 
defaultlocated 
defaultthroughout the 
defaultforce 
defaultarea during the year.  Each day 
defaultfeature
defaults
default public surgeries with private appointments for individuals and small groups.  The day also involve
defaults
default visits to schools, community groups, organisations and police stations.  These engagement opportunities have mutual benefits to all involved.  The Commissioner promote
defaults
default his local priorities
default and
default individuals, groups and organisations are given the opportunity to influence decision making.
default&#xa0;
default6.6 
defaultOur office has a strong social media presence on 
defaultFacebook
default, 
defaultand Twitter
default.  We also send out regular e-newsletters to those who have subscribed for updates via our website
default, informing them of what the Commissioner has achieved during the previous quarter
default.

defaultProgress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policingdefault organisations and partnersdefault7.1 
defaultDyfed-Powys is currently engaged in a number of collaboration agreements both with neighbouring forces and with a Local Authority.  The agreements entered into by the Police Authority have continued under the leadership of PCCs in Wales.  
defaultExpanded collaboration is a stated aim of the Police and Crime Plan and the Chief Constable’s PDR process.
default&#xa0;
default7.2 Joint 
defaultscrutiny 
defaultarrangements 
defaultof current 
defaultcollaboration
default agreements
default are currently being established
default albeit later than the PCC would have liked
default.  The forum that will be used to facilitate this will be the All Wales Policing Group which consists of the four Welsh Chief Constables and PCCs.  A draft memorandum of understanding to facilitate this has been drafted by the Dyfed-Powys PCC and circulated for 
defaultagreement 
defaultto the Welsh Commissioners and Chief Constables
default.  
defaultJoint scrutiny arrangements are expected to 
defaultproceed on a more formal basis 
defaultat the All Wales Policing Group scheduled for January 2014. 
default&#xa0;
default7.3 
defaultWelsh Chief Constables with the consent of their PCCs have recently met to discuss further collaboration opportunities.  These discussions have identified a number of possible areas for future collaboration.  These will now be explored in further depth to determine their feasibility.
default  The PCC supports this and would like it expanded.
default&#xa0;
default7.4 
defaultUnder the initiative of ‘Public First’ we 
defaultare 
defaultscoping opportunities to collaborate with other public services and private and third sector organisations.  The PCCs view is that the Police need to concentrate on policing.  Other opportunities need to be explored to ascertain who can best deliver other services.
default&#xa0;
default7.5 The Commissioner and his Deputy h
defaultold regular
default meetings with the Chief Executives and Leaders of the four Unitary Authorities contained within the Force area. These meetings have focused upon collaborative opportunities. We are currently 
defaultscoping
default potential projects 
defaultthat allow 
defaultshared back office functions, shared estates and multi-agency team approaches.

defaultTransparency of and reporting by commissioners to date.default&#xa0;
default8.1 
defaultIn a recent (November 2013) survey undertaken by CoPACC (Compares Police and Crime Commissioners), the 
defaultOPCC
default Dyfed-Powys was rated in the top three of 
defaultOPCCs
default in the country
default, and the most transparent in Wales
default.  
default8.2 There is a 
defaultpresumption in favour of transparency.  
defaultThis incorporates conforming with legislation requirement
defaults
default in respect of publishing information
default and more
default.  I
defaultt also relates to the way in which that information is published.  It needs to be accessible in a format that is easy for the user to access, analyse, understand, and use.  It is these principles that we have applied to our approach to ensuring transparency within 
defaultPolice and Crime Commissioner
default’
defaults Office in 
defaultDyfed-Powys, and one that we are promoting within the police service.
default  Our approach is being continuously reviewed to build on the good work that has already been established.
