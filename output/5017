[normal]Written evidence from 
[normal]Christopher Salmon
[normal], 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner for 
[normal]Dyfed-Powys
[normal] [PCC Progress 09]
[normal]1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area;[bold]1.1 
[normal]Preventing crime is the first priority of the Police and Crime Plan.  We are working with other Police and Crime Commissioners, Welsh Government, Probation, Local Authorities, voluntary organisations and businesses to this end.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 The effectiveness Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) on reducing crime will be decided by voters 
[normal]i
[normal]n May 2016.  Delivering on this requires attention to the context in which crime occurs – “the wider social mission” of crime reduction, to use a recent phrase.  That does not mean the police have to do it all.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 PCCs commissioning powers allow the police to focus on policing and other experts to help prevent crime, tackle offending, encourage reporting, protect the vulnerable, address mental health and substance misuse issues and reduce anti-social behaviour. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 In Dyfed-Powys we are emphasising neighbourhood policing, improving public access and confidence in police services.  This requires services that are more public focussed, responsive, cost effective and professional.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5 
[normal]We have (1) brought forward the recruitment of 30 officers as a result of better management; (2) reduced the cost of the three top salaries (Chief Constable, Chief Finance Officer and Chief of Staff) from £420,000 to £330,000; (3) responded to public demand with “when we’re in, we’re open” (this mean
[normal]s
[normal] rural stations are more accessible); 
[normal]and 
[normal](4) introduced a Commissioner
[normal]’
[normal]s Fund that puts money at the disposal of frontline officers for crime reduction in their neighbourhoods.  We have reviewed our use of cautions with external input and an assurance panel.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6 Commissioning will begin in earnest in 2014/15.  We have appointed a Director of Commissioning, responsible for community safety, local justice, and victims
[normal]’
[normal] services.  This post will be responsible for building capacity and working with voluntary organisations in areas such as, restorative justice, domestic and sexual violence, and antisocial behaviour reduction.  We have piloted the use of mediation and intend to expand this and other innovative crime prevention services such as mentoring, education, counselling and youth interventions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7 
[normal]Covering
[normal] the most rural 
[normal]police force
[normal] in England and Wales, local accountability allows us to respond to local need in a thoughtful and flexible way.  Geography is a huge challenge.  We are developing relationships with local universities to enhance our evidence base and polic
[normal]y
[normal] making to meet that challenge.
[normal]2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account;[bold]2.1 
[normal]To allow the 
[normal]Dyfed-Powys 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner and the Chief Constable to exercise their roles in a transparent
[normal] and aligned
[normal] manner a Policing Board has been e
[normal]stablish
[normal]ed.  Th
[normal]e
[normal] Board consists of 
[normal]the PCC, his D
[normal]eputy, the Chief Constable and Chief Finance Officer 
[normal]who 
[normal]meet on a weekly basis
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A
[normal]n extended Board meeting
[normal] is held
[normal] once a month
[normal].
[normal] This extended Board is a critical element in the 
[normal]Commissioner’s
[normal] scrutiny role. 
[normal] 
[normal]It enables early identification of core issues and tracks progress against the priorities contained within the Police and Crime Plan
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]The monthly meetings are open and available for the public to attend.  The terms of reference and working arrangements for the Board are outlined in 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]Policing Board Charter
[normal] and are available on our website.
[normal]  Weekly meetings 
[normal]focus
[normal] 
[normal]on core issues effecting policing and crime, whereas monthly meetings are 
[normal]centred 
[normal]on a predetermined Police and Crime Plan priority.  The minutes of all Policing Board meetings are published on the O
[normal]ffice of the 
[normal]P
[normal]olice and 
[normal]C
[normal]rime 
[normal]C
[normal]ommissioner’s (OPCC)
[normal] website.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 The Commissioner holds informal Personal Development Reviews (PDR) with the Chief Constable
[normal] (CC)
[normal]. These meetings feed into the formal annual PDR
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The annual PDR holds the Chief Constable to account for his performance against set criteria, identifies the key challenges for the year ahead and agrees the 
[normal]key performance indicators
[normal] for the next PDR.
[normal]3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account;[bold]3.1 
[normal]The relationship between the PCC and the Panel is developing well. As awareness and acceptance of the separate and distinct roles of the 
[normal]PCC
[normal] and Police and Crime Panel develop, so too does the relationship
[normal] between the two bodies
[normal].  The Panel were able to offer some constructive observations in relation to the development of the Police and Crime Plan and accepted the proposed budget and precept proposals in 2012.  
[normal]The panel also considered the recommendations of the PCC in appointing his Deputy (after an open selection and appointment process) and Chief of Staff. The Panel interviewed both appointees robustly before confirming the appointments. The Panel has been equally robust in reviewing the Commissioner’s reports to them and in 
[normal]questioning the information contained within those reports.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 
[normal]The Panel will 
[normal]be informed of the budget considerations 
[normal]and proposed precept 
[normal]at the earliest given opportunity
[normal].  
[normal]However
[normal], given that the government’s 
[normal]Autumn statement is not expected until the 5
[normal]th
[normal] December and the Policing Settlement until the 18
[normal]th
[normal] December, 
[normal]legislative constraints mean that this allows limited time for in-depth Panel considerations.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]However
[normal],
[normal] to facilitate matters, a
[normal] meeting has been arranged for the Panel to consider matters relating to the budget in early January, in advance of the meeting where they will be asked to formally consider the Commissioner’s precept proposal.
[normal]4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T[bold]he division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011;[bold]4.1 
[normal]Within Dyfed-Powys the Stage 2 transfer plan is being approached as a step in a joint pr
[normal]ogramme of reform in the organisation
[normal]. This approach has been branded the ‘Public First’ change programme. The aim is to redesign services to ensure they are value for money, flexible and responsive to community needs.  Success will require a cultural as well as an organisational change. The focus is to ensure that front line policing services are prioritised in the light of the fina
[normal]ncial challenges posed by the Comprehensive Spending Review.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 
[normal]Under the proposal submitted to the Home Secretary all operational and operational support police staff will be transferred to the employment of the Chief Constable at midnight on 31st March 2014. This means that 792 members of staff
[normal], based on current staffing levels 
[normal]will transfer to the employment of the Chief Constable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 
[normal]The PCC is in the process of employing a Director of Resources who will be responsible for all business support staff. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Director of Resources and business support staff, totalling 219
[normal] (based on current staffing levels)
[normal], will remain employed by the Commissioner but answerable to the Chief Constable for the timeliness, quantity and quality of services he requires. They will also deliver support to the Commissioner and commissioned services. This is intended to be an interim arrangement that will not last beyond September 2015. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 
[normal]During this transitional period, in accordance with the provisions of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, the opportunity to enter into agreements with other policing bodies and local partners to support front-end service delivery will be explored and taken forward. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 
[normal]Innovation will be key to 
[normal]the successful delivery of ‘Pub
[normal]l
[normal]ic First’
[normal]. The PCC
[normal] and CC are 
[normal]confident that this phased approach will deliver the best structure for Dyfed-Powys and will provide adequate, appropriate and agile support services. Discussions for implementing such arrangements are beginning now but will not be concluded for transfer by the 31 March 2014.  All final transfers to the Chief Constable and/or other local partners will take place no later than September 2015
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6 At the time of writing this submission, the Dyfed-Powys Stage 2 proposal is being considered by the Home Secretary.
[normal]5.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of commissioners in budget and precept setting;[bold]5.1 
[normal]Within Dyfed-Powys precept setting arrangements have been simplified
[normal] 
[normal]under the leadership of the PCC.
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]consultation process 
[normal]has 
[normal]also 
[normal]been 
[normal]widened, allow
[normal]ing
[normal] for faster decision making that has ultimately resulted 
[normal]in lower 
[normal]precept increases
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 
[normal]During 
[normal]his
[normal] first year in office
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the Commissioner
[normal] had little time to 
[normal]make budget and precept decisions.  Decision making for the second year of 
[normal]budget and 
[normal]precept setting 
[normal]has been more strategically and operationally focused
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Commissioner has to manage a predicted overall budget decrease of £9
[normal] 
[normal]million over the next four years. 
[normal]There is therefore a strategic balance to be struck between cost reduction, precept setting and safeguarding operational policing. 
[normal] 
[normal]The Commissioner has committed to protecting Community policing and to minimising precept rises.
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]Whilst no final decision can be taken until we receive our budget settlement from the Home Office
[normal] the 
[normal]Commissioner has indicated that the 
[normal]precept 
[normal]for 2015
[normal] 
[normal]will 
[normal]rise
[normal] by 
[normal]no more than 
[normal]3.1%, in comparison to 3.9% in 2013/14, and 5% under the Police Authority in 2012/13.  
[normal]The Commissioner’s 
[normal]intention is to keep future rises 
[normal]in line
[normal] with inflation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3 
[normal]In terms of budget setting the Chief Constable has been tasked with outlining organisational requirements moving forward.  There 
[normal]are 
[normal]also
[normal] occasional
[normal] away day
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]led by the Commissioner and 
[normal]attended by the most senior staff and police officers from both the Force and OPCC.  Th
[normal]ese
[normal] provide further discussion on what is needed and what can be delivered within the current budget constraints.  
[normal]They
[normal] also provide an opportunity to discuss 
[normal]investment priorities that will effect 
[normal]longer term budgetary decisions
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities;[bold]6.1 
[normal]For police 
[normal]and crime[bold] [bold]priorities
[normal] 
[normal]to be delivered, buy
[normal]-
[normal]in is needed across criminal justice agencies.  
[normal]This has been achieved within Dyfed-Powys by ensuring that the PCC has representation on appropriate Boards.  Whilst it has taken some time for some agencies
[normal]’
[normal] to 
[normal]adapt to
[normal] PCCs, we now have local representation on the All Wales Criminal Justice Board, the Local Criminal Justice Board, the 
[normal]Area Planning Boards, Local Service Boards and Community Safety Partnerships.  This has given the opportunity to not only drive forward delivery of police and crime priorities, but also ensure that partner agencies priorities are aligned and complement service delivery across 
[normal]organisations
[normal].
[normal]  Such partnerships allow for mutual problem solving 
[normal]such as 
[normal]making better use of resources 
[normal]through 
[normal]commissioning, or joint collaboration
[normal], 
[normal]thereby resulting in services being delivered smarter and 
[normal]in a way that is 
[normal]more accessible to users.   
[normal]We 
[normal]are exploring ways in which the Dr
[normal]ug Intervention Programme
[normal] can be
[normal]st be delivered
[normal].  This will result in the availability of drug rehabilitation treatment being widened by pooling monies available and sharing 
[normal]contract administration costs.  We are also exploring opportunities with our Local Authorities 
[normal]to
[normal] establish 
[normal]joint front counter services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 
[normal]Key to promoting 
[normal]Police 
[normal]and 
[normal]Crime Plan 
[normal]priorities 
[normal]is 
[normal]establishing effective working relationships with other agencies on a person to person basis.  This approach has facilitated enhanced working with the private and third sector
[normal] agencies
[normal] that have skills and experience to deliver local priorities more efficiently and at a reduced price. 
[normal]This will be a key part of the ‘Public First’ initiative.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3 
[normal]In an area such as Wales where many agencies that have a responsibility 
[normal]for preventing crime and promoting safety are devolved, PCCs act as the link between national, regional and local
[normal] policy
[normal].  It is essential that effective relationships are maintained with both central and devolved administrations.
[normal]  To facilitate this regular meetings are held with 
[normal]the 
[normal]Secretary of States (Wales)
[normal], 
[normal]Home Office
[normal], and 
[normal]both the Health
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]Local Government and Government Business
[normal] 
[normal]Welsh 
[normal]Ministers.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4 
[normal]The PCC will
[normal] work with other commissioning bodies such as the Community Rehabilitation Companies (under 
[normal]the 
[normal]Transforming 
[normal]Rehabilitation agenda).  This will promote local priorities to all those that are co
[normal]nsidering bidding for this work
[normal].  It 
[normal]also facilitates 
[normal]future discussion for possible co-commissioning of services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5 
[normal]We have held regular surgeries and events over 2012/13.  This will be widened into a ser
[normal]ies of local listening days.  This involves holding a 
[normal]number of days 
[normal]located 
[normal]throughout the 
[normal]force 
[normal]area during the year.  Each day 
[normal]feature
[normal]s
[normal] public surgeries with private appointments for individuals and small groups.  The day also involve
[normal]s
[normal] visits to schools, community groups, organisations and police stations.  These engagement opportunities have mutual benefits to all involved.  The Commissioner promote
[normal]s
[normal] his local priorities
[normal] and
[normal] individuals, groups and organisations are given the opportunity to influence decision making.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6 
[normal]Our office has a strong social media presence on 
[normal]Facebook
[normal], 
[normal]and Twitter
[normal].  We also send out regular e-newsletters to those who have subscribed for updates via our website
[normal], informing them of what the Commissioner has achieved during the previous quarter
[normal].
[normal]7.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Progress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policing[bold] organisations and partners[bold]7.1 
[normal]Dyfed-Powys is currently engaged in a number of collaboration agreements both with neighbouring forces and with a Local Authority.  The agreements entered into by the Police Authority have continued under the leadership of PCCs in Wales.  
[normal]Expanded collaboration is a stated aim of the Police and Crime Plan and the Chief Constable’s PDR process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2 Joint 
[normal]scrutiny 
[normal]arrangements 
[normal]of current 
[normal]collaboration
[normal] agreements
[normal] are currently being established
[normal] albeit later than the PCC would have liked
[normal].  The forum that will be used to facilitate this will be the All Wales Policing Group which consists of the four Welsh Chief Constables and PCCs.  A draft memorandum of understanding to facilitate this has been drafted by the Dyfed-Powys PCC and circulated for 
[normal]agreement 
[normal]to the Welsh Commissioners and Chief Constables
[normal].  
[normal]Joint scrutiny arrangements are expected to 
[normal]proceed on a more formal basis 
[normal]at the All Wales Policing Group scheduled for January 2014. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3 
[normal]Welsh Chief Constables with the consent of their PCCs have recently met to discuss further collaboration opportunities.  These discussions have identified a number of possible areas for future collaboration.  These will now be explored in further depth to determine their feasibility.
[normal]  The PCC supports this and would like it expanded.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4 
[normal]Under the initiative of ‘Public First’ we 
[normal]are 
[normal]scoping opportunities to collaborate with other public services and private and third sector organisations.  The PCCs view is that the Police need to concentrate on policing.  Other opportunities need to be explored to ascertain who can best deliver other services.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5 The Commissioner and his Deputy h
[normal]old regular
[normal] meetings with the Chief Executives and Leaders of the four Unitary Authorities contained within the Force area. These meetings have focused upon collaborative opportunities. We are currently 
[normal]scoping
[normal] potential projects 
[normal]that allow 
[normal]shared back office functions, shared estates and multi-agency team approaches.
[normal]8.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Transparency of and reporting by commissioners to date.[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1 
[normal]In a recent (November 2013) survey undertaken by CoPACC (Compares Police and Crime Commissioners), the 
[normal]OPCC
[normal] Dyfed-Powys was rated in the top three of 
[normal]OPCCs
[normal] in the country
[normal], and the most transparent in Wales
[normal].  
[normal]8.2 There is a 
[normal]presumption in favour of transparency.  
[normal]This incorporates conforming with legislation requirement
[normal]s
[normal] in respect of publishing information
[normal] and more
[normal].  I
[normal]t also relates to the way in which that information is published.  It needs to be accessible in a format that is easy for the user to access, analyse, understand, and use.  It is these principles that we have applied to our approach to ensuring transparency within 
[normal]Police and Crime Commissioner
[normal]’
[normal]s Office in 
[normal]Dyfed-Powys, and one that we are promoting within the police service.
[normal]  Our approach is being continuously reviewed to build on the good work that has already been established.
