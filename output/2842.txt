[[[&#xa0;]]]2.1              Analysis of the National Passenger Survey (NPS) shows that by far the greatest ‘driver’ of passengers’ overall satisfaction with a rail journey is whether the train is punctual.  At 42% it dwarfs all other factors.  The largest ‘driver’ of overall dissatisfaction, however, is how well a train company deals with delays – 51%.  This gives a good indication of passengers’ requirements during bouts of severe weather, which can be summarised as:&#xa0;

[[[Minimising disruption in the first place]]]2.2              In recent years there have been a number of initiatives to ensure that the railway is less susceptible to snow and ice than it has been in the past, some led by train operators and some by Network Rail.  For example, modifications to prevent snow damaging electric traction motors and heating the third rail at key locations to prevent icing.&#xa0;2.3              It is impossible for Passenger Focus to judge whether what has been delivered so far is sufficient.  However, it is worth noting that train performance (as measured by the Public Performance Measure) in winter 2012/13 was worse than 2011/12 – although factors other than the weather may have been involved.  We therefore support the Office of Rail Regulation’s requirement for robust weather resilience proposals in Network Rail’s Control Period 5 (2014-19) Delivery Plan.              Period 8 (mid Oct to mid Nov)Period 9(mid Nov to early Dec)Period 10 (early Dec to early Jan)Period 11(early Jan to early Feb)Period 12(February)2011/1289.388.488.891.491.62012/1388.985.488.387.391.0              Source: Office of Rail Regulation online data portal&#xa0;2.4              In terms of what more should be done, it would perhaps be helpful if, route by route, Network Rail and train companies were explicit about what further measures they could take to make the railway more resilient to severe weather (i.e. over and above those already in-hand and required to achieve Control Period 5 2014-2019 punctuality targets).  Then the industry, stakeholders and government could consider what further improvements would represent value for money.  A similar approach could be used to identify what more could be done to improve resilience to flooding, high winds, lightning strikes and exceptionally high temperatures.&#xa0;

[[[Effective handling of disruption when it does happen]]]2.5              The NPS question which tracks opinion in this area asks passengers to rate the handling of delay.  The long-term trend shows improvement, albeit modest and starting from a low base.  The proportion of passengers saying that their delay was handed “well” was 38% in the Spring 2013 NPS.&#xa0;              &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Source: National Passenger Survey, 1999-20132.6              Passenger Focus research suggests that various factors contribute to how passengers rate the handling of disruption, including:&#xa0;2.7              Information at times of disruption is heading slowly in the right direction.  Many more train companies now have ‘rainbow boards’ on their websites giving ‘at a glance’ status of the service; passengers following most train companies on Twitter receive markedly better information than in the past; and it is now possible for pre-prepared ‘snow timetables’ to show through electronic journey planners the evening before.  However, we continue to see inaccuracies, inconsistencies and ambiguities at times of disruption, whether the cause is winter weather or not.  A remaining weakness is the inability to give an accurate estimate of how long a disruption will last, even some hours into an incident, let alone an indication of how long knock-on delays will continue to affect journeys.&#xa0;2.8              

[[[Information.]]]  After observations over winter 2012/13, Passenger Focus highlighted – via the rail industry’s National Taskforce – four areas of continuing weakness in information provision during disruption:as necessary&#xa0;2.9              

[[[Empathy and practical action.]]]  The tendency of train companies to sometimes give the impression that they do not “treat me with respect [as a paying customer]” is a particular problem at times of service disruption, whether caused by winter weather or anything else.  Passengers also get the impression that the rail industry can be slow with practical action to minimise their inconvenience.  Passenger Focus continues to highlight specific areas that contribute to these impressions, including:&#xa0;2.10              

[[[Welfare of passengers.]]]  Occasionally, the way disruption is handled gets close to the line between poor customer service and failure to safeguard the welfare of passengers.  Incidents at Kings Cross on 19 February (200 passengers forced to ‘sleep’ overnight on a train in the station; at Virginia Water on 9 May (passengers arrived home around midnight having left Waterloo at 1720 after a tree fell across the railway); and at Pewsey on 4 August (Penzance to Paddington train stuck for 5 hours).  Incident reviews often find a culture of “don’t worry, this problem will sort itself out in half an hour”, with no parallel “but what about the passengers if it doesn’t?”  Since the Kings Cross incident, Passenger Focus has written to all train companies about late-night service disruption, and most have replied that their arrangements would have prevented a similar incident.  Nevertheless, incidents keep happening which, if they had coincided with extreme winter weather (or extreme heat), could have led to serious passenger welfare issues.2.11              

[[[Information needs – extreme weather.  ]]]Passengers’ information requirements during disruption caused by winter weather are largely the same as during any other disruption.  However, when snow has fallen passengers have an extra requirement – because they have reason to suspect that trains may be affected.  Train companies still have more to do to help passengers answer the initial “can I get there?” question when they open their curtains to snow, or hear about it on the radio.  This is as much about reassurance that all is well as it is about warning of disruption.  For commuters, the question “and will I get home again?” will also be in their mind.&#xa0;2.12

[[[ – commuter networks]]]

[[[.]]]  Passenger Focus is in principle persuaded by the argument that, faced with a horrendous weather forecast it is in passengers’ interests if commuter train companies run a timetable they are confident can be delivered despite the weather.  Attempting to deliver the impossible and failing spectacularly does not help anybody.  With effective communications it should be possible for train companies to get the message to commuters that a ‘snow timetable’ will run tomorrow, with full details of what that means made available quickly.  However, ‘snow timetables’ must still meet the needs of passengers – in terms of continuing to run trains from all stations wherever possible and providing enough coaches that passengers do not get left behind.  Passenger Focus felt that South West Trains did not quite get this right when they implemented a ‘snow timetable’ in January 2013 and they have undertaken to review arrangements for the coming winter.  There is always the potential that the forecast snow does not materialise and passengers conclude that the train company has reduced the service unnecessarily.  To reduce that risk, the time by which it must be decided whether to run a ‘snow timetable’ the next day should be as late as possible, while still allowing the revised times to show in journey planning systems that evening.  The industry should also enhance its capability to restore the normal timetable, or elements of it, if it becomes clear the ‘snow timetable’ is not needed.                2.13              

[[[‘snow timetables’ – long-distance operators.]]]  In contrast, Passenger Focus supports the position taken by some long-distance operators, e.g. CrossCountry and Virgin Trains, that the full timetable should be maintained wherever possible.  Infrequent, long-distance passengers are more difficult to warn that a different timetable will be in operation, and retiming the 11:00 to 11:08, for example, would cause considerable confusion – not least to those whose ticket is for the 11:00 and no other train.  Re-writing the timetable with fewer trains taking longer than normal also risks the (reasonable) accusation that it has been done not in passengers’ interests, but purely to boost punctuality statistics.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]3. 1              While bus passengers would clearly rather there is no disruption in the first place, they recognise that bus services will inevitably be impacted when significant snow and/or ice affects the road network.  Nevertheless, bus passengers do expect that reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that buses continue to run, and as reliably as possible, wherever it is safe to do so.  Whether pressure on local authority 2013/14 budgets will reduce the priority attached to gritting principal bus routes/ access to bus garages this winter remains to be seen.&#xa0;3. 3              Passenger Focus published research earlier in 2013 looking at bus passengers’ experiences of delays and service disruption.  Although covering experiences of delays resulting from many different causes, i.e. not just severe winter weather, a number of the findings and recommendations are relevant to this Inquiry.  The research found that improvements in two key areas would change passengers’ experiences during disruption – information and driver attitude.  Passengers spoke about feeling ‘powerless’ standing at a bus stop not knowing if a bus will come – as one research respondent put it “it’s mental torture sometimes at bus stops working out whether to stay or whether to go”.  Passengers also said they wanted bus drivers to behave more as the bus company’s customer service representative, providing information, showing empathy and expressing regret.  &#xa0;3. 4              Passenger Focus’s recommendations in the light of this research include:&#xa0;3. 5              If there is disruption to bus services caused by severe winter weather, good information is key to minimising the impact on passengers.  Information that allows passengers to make an informed decision – be it to set out earlier, not attempt to travel, find a different way to get there – should be a key objective for bus companies and/or local authorities.  Providing assurance that buses are running, if potentially with delays, is important as well: when it has snowed passengers have reason to doubt it.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1              Rail.  The NPS shows that for rail passengers the way disruption is managed is moving slowly in the right direction, but there remains a considerable way to go.  It is important to ask what more could be done to improve the railway’s resilience to snow and ice.  When disruption occurs information that allows passengers to make an informed choice about what they do is vital.  During winter 2012/13 passenger information was better, but it was far from perfect and this paper mentions a number of areas in which further improvement is needed.&#xa0;4.2              Bus.  When bus services are disrupted, for any reason, passengers’ key requirement is for information about what is going on – and yet many feel there is no effective means to find that out.  How would a passenger working in their office find out that a bus company had decided it would suspend operations at 16:00 because heavy snow is forecast?   In some cases it is true: without a system tracking the location of buses in real-time, there is no means to find out exactly what is happening – but in others Apps exist, but few passengers appear to know about them.  A quick win for the bus industry would be to raise awareness about Apps and other sources of information where reliable real-time systems are in place.&#xa0;4.3              How public transport operators manage service disruption, including that caused by severe winter weather remains an important area of work for Passenger Focus.  If snow and ice causes disruption this winter we will monitor how well train and bus companies cope, including in the vital area of passenger information.&#xa0;&#xa0;October 2013&#xa0; Passenger Focus multivariate analysis of National Passenger Survey, Spring 2013               Information: rail passengers’ needs during unplanned disruption (September 2011)              Rail passengers’ experiences during the snow (March 2011)              Delays and disruption Rail passengers have their say (December 2010)               Short and Tweet: how passengers want social media during disruption (June 2012)&#xa0;               Passenger Focus letters to the Office of Rail Regulation and Department for Transport regarding East Coast disruption on 19 February 2013               Bus passengers’ experience of delays and disruption (April 2013)&#xa0;
