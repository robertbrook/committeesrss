"&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Asylum Aid (LAI 002)&#xa0;&#xa0;\nAsylum Aid is gravely concerned about the government’s proposed \nLegal Aid\n reforms. \n&#xa0;\nThese changes are likely to impact the human rights of some of Asylum Aid’s most vulnerable clients, including:\n&#xa0;\nA\nt the same time as removing access to justice from our clients, the proposals would immunise the government from challenges against its decisions. \n&#xa0;\nThis will have deep, worrying and lasting implications for human rights in the UK.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposed introduction of a residence test for civil Legal Aid claimants, so as to limit Legal Aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UKAsylum Aid is very concerned that the proposed ‘residence test’ \n– generally understood as one year’s legal residence in the UK – \nis \nincompatible with human rights.\n&#xa0;\nIt will directly affect our clients whose applications for asylum have been refused, but who rely on \nLegal Aid\n to bring new information about their situati\non (or ‘fresh claims’) before the Home Office. This right is essential, given that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1. Fresh asylum claims and destitute asylum seekers It is unclear from the consultation document whether the Ministry of Justice proposes to grant access to \nLegal Aid\n as soon as a fresh claim for asylum has been submitted or, as it appears from the consultation\n proposals, whether \nLegal Aid\n will only be granted once an application has been accepted by the Government as amounting to a fresh claim. This needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency. \n&#xa0;\nIf it is the latter, then in a situation where a person submits a\n fresh claim but the government refuses to treat it as such, the applicant would not have a \nright of appeal. Under the present system the only legal remedy open to a person in t\nhis situation would be to seek J\nudicial \nR\neview – but under these proposals, whe\nre a person has no right to reside, access to \nLegal Aid\n for \nJ\nudicial \nR\neview would also be curtailed. This has the potential to deny access to justice for vulnerable asylum seekers and is therefore incompatible with human rights legislation. \n&#xa0;\nAsylum Aid’s work advising destitute asylum seekers consistently finds that at least 50% of the clients advised have legitimate merits for accessing \nLegal Aid\n to reopen their cases. This could be to undertake fresh asylum claims or to commence judicial rev\niew proceedings as a result of the Home Office not following their own established policies and procedures.\n This vulnerable client group already faces extreme barriers accessing \nLegal Aid\n for further advice on \ntheir cases. This is why Asylum Aid has devel\noped outreach advice surgeries to undertake this work, outside the scope of \nLegal Aid\n. Once we have established the merits of the case, we use this as evidence to persuade legal providers to take these people on because – despite the barriers they have fac\ned – they should be entitled to access \nLegal Aid\n. This can then also assist to resolve destitution problems. \n&#xa0;\nThe \nMinistry of Justice \nproposals \nwould\n establish further barriers for this vulnerable client group, making it more difficult for them to access \njustice and exacerbating their destitution. Moreover, preventing access to justice for people with legitimate human rights claims in this way may well be incompatible with human rights legislation to which the government has signed up. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.2. Fresh asylum claims and women Making it harder to get \nLegal Aid\n for fresh claims has a disproportionate impact on women asylum seekers. This is because there are a range of factors that can make it harder for women to disclose their experiences at the time of their a\nsylum claim and appeal. \n&#xa0;\nThese factors include: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI would also d\nraw your attention to the situation described by the campaign group Save Justice, whose client was recognised as a refugee and was able to access \nLegal Aid\n to apply for a non-molestation order against her violent and dangerous ex-husband.\n This potentially\n life-saving provision would be lost under these proposals.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2. Separated Asylum-Seeking Children Asylum Aid works to ensure separated asylum seeking children are kept safe from harm.\n We are therefore deeply concerned about the potential impact that the\n residence test could have on t\nhis extremely vulnerable \ngroup\n of young people, and about the potential breaches of the \nConvention on the Rights of \nthe Child, \na\n \nlegally binding international agreement w\nhich the UK has ratified and \nwhich is applicable to all\n children present in the United Kingdom.\n&#xa0;\nAsylum Aid is particularly concerned \nthat the introduction of a residence test would breach\n Articles \nof the Convention, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Assessing the Residence Test Asylum Aid believes that the ability to assess a client under the proposed residence test will be an extremely complicated process and that, as such, only specialist immigration lawyers would be competent to undertake this work. If this reform is implement\ned, it would be necessary to grant \nLegal Aid\n to advise on this process. \n&#xa0;\nNotwithstanding this concern, this is a complex area of law with significant scope for wrongful interpretation, particularly in the absence of concrete evidence to prove or dis\nprove \nthe right to reside. I\nt is highly likely that people will be denied access to justice due to a misunderstanding of their eligibility.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid for work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceedThe proposed changes to access to Judicial Review (JR) are likely to impact asylum seekers and refugees, as well as the charities who work with the\nm, far beyond that anticipated in the consultation.\n&#xa0;\nWork to research, prepare and present a JR is often substantial, especially to address concerns in the handling of the most complex asylum claims. If implemented, this proposal would act as a \ndisincentive for providers to undertake JR work even where merits are established, as any work prior to permission being granted by the court would have to be undertaken pro bono. This will make it very difficult for people facing destitution to access JR,\n particularly to apply for urgent injunctions. It will also make it far more difficult to undertake strategic litigation work to test and develop the law, which by definition is work carried out at risk, with border line potential for success.\n&#xa0;\nThe govern\nment has emphasised that funding will remain in place for meritorious JRs, to be paid after the decision on merits; but few organisations will have the cash-flow resources to prepare a JR appropriately knowing that this work will not be recompensed for man\ny months. As \nthe \nI\nmmigration \nL\naw \nP\nractitioners’ \nA\nssociation\n \n(ILPA) has argued recently\n, after a succession of cuts many \nLegal Aid\n providers “cannot assume any more financial risk in their businesses”.\n In practice, it will become a lasting challenge to fun\nd upfront the work needed to file a JR, even where the merits of the case are immediately evident. \n&#xa0;\nIn addition\n, the underlying motive to sav\ne public expenditure is \nquestionable when one takes into account the fact that weak cases are already refused perm\nission to proceed. This mechanism is already in place to protect the public purse and strikes a fair balance. In urgent cases the merits of the case need to be kept under ongoing assessment, but the final decision on whether to grant \nLegal Aid\n always rests\n with the \nLegal Aid\n Agency, not the provider. \nRestricting access to JRs would have the effect of limiting essential access to justice, even where there is an overwhelming need to correct an error in a previous decision. Some of the most vulnerable asylum \nseekers and refugees would be left without recourse to help to which they are entitled, including: \n&#xa0;\nAsylum Aid is deeply concerned at this prospect. \n&#xa0;\nHaving borne witness over many years to the flaws and shortcomings in asylum decision-making, and the regularity with which the Home Office acts in breach of its own policies and procedures, the use of JR is paramount where there are legitimate concerns th\nat the government has acted illegally or irrationally. \n&#xa0;\nThe government can maintain access to justice and more effectively save money by ensuring the Home Office takes a fair and competent approach to asylum claims earlier in the system. If the operation \nof the asylum system is aligned with the policies already in place, recourse to an expensive JR process will rightly become an exceptional occurrence.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe proposal that Legal Aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of successThere is a very real risk that, by removing \nLegal Aid\n from cases which meet the ‘borderline’ criteria, the human rights needs of some asylum seekers will not be met. \n&#xa0;\nW\ne share the concerns raised by ILPA in their response to the government’s consultation paper, where ILPA stated:\n&#xa0;\n[\nLegal Aid\n practitioners]\n are frequently in the position of challenging cases that they know will be hard to win, for example because there is\n settled law in the higher courts against them. It is frequently impossible fairly to judge the merits of a case before it has been prepared, which is why the borderline category is important.\n&#xa0;\nThis is true of many of the complex asylum cases in which Asy\nlum Aid specialises, where particular expertise and time is required to identify the protection needs that ensure a case meets at least the ‘borderline’ criteria. If these cases are no longer funded, \nsuch vulnerable clients\n will not enjoy access to justice\n. This is also the case for strategic litigation, which necessarily tests the law in areas which remain under development.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, it is our experience that some legal representatives are unable or unwilling to take on the most complex appeals and Ju\ndicial Reviews because of the unfunded hours of work required to demonstrate that they meet at least the ‘borderline’ criteria. In our 2011 \nUnsustainable\n research into women’s asylum claims, for example, half the women in our sample from Cardiff did not ha\nve legal representation on appeal, something likely related to the complexity of many gender-related asylum claims.\n&#xa0;\nDespite this, women’s claims are disproportionately likely to be overturned on appeal, indicating that \nsome\n work at first assumed not be m\neet ‘borderline’ criteria is nonetheless necessary to overturn poor initial Home Office decisions.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5 August 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;8\n On the existing \nLegal Aid\n system and its impact on asylum work, see The Runneymede Trust (2012), \nJustice at Risk: Quality and Value for Money in Asylum \nLegal Aid\n \nhttp://www.asylumaid.org.uk/data/files/publications/208/Justice_at_Risk_Report.pdf\n  \n These issues and more are outlined in Asylum Aid’s submission to the H\nome Affairs Select Committee inquiry into asylum in 2013: \nhttp://www.asylumaid.org.uk/data/files/publications/217/HomeAffairsCommittee_AsylumAid.pdf\n \nAn alternative approach, built on more consensual relations between officials and asylum legal representatives, is outlined in Asylum Aid (2013), \nRight First Time\n \nh\nttp://www.asylumaid.org.uk/data/files/publications/210/RightFirstTime_V3.pdf\n \nAsylum Aid has run a dedicated destitution project since 2009, working in co-ordination with the British Red Cross and the Notre Dame Refugee Centre.\n \nBögner\n et al (2007) ‘Impact of sexual Violence on disclosure during Home Office interviews’, \nThe British Journal of Psychiatry\n, London: Royal College of Psychiatrists, Online.
