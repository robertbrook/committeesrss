[normal]Written Submission by JUSTICE VEP 0027[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Draft Bill 
[normal]has been published in response to the line of European Court of Human Rights case-law which concludes that the absolute ban on prisoners voting in section 3 Representation of the People Act 1983 (“RPA”) is incompatible with the right to participate in full and fair elections. The UK is required by the European Convention on Human Rights to repeal the bar on all prisoners voting. The extended controversy over the UK’s failure to execute the judgment of the European court and the political reluctance of successive Governments to tackle this legally simple, but politically uncomfortable issue is well rehearsed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The right to vote is the very basis of democracy, is recognised in most national constitutions and international human rights instruments and has been called the ‘right of rights’. JUSTICE’s view is that, as a general rule, prisoners should be entitled to vote. Any specific restriction, if justifiable, should be considered distinct from sentence. We recognise that this is not the only option legally open to the UK. However, we regret that the options presented in the draft Bill are disappointing and contentious. Two of the options – do nothing or ban prisoners serving longer than 6 months from the ballot box – are unlawful and not rationally open to the UK.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The third – disenfranchisement of all prisoners sentenced to over four years – bears the hallmarks of a general and automatic blanket rule which will require careful justification. While we accept that this option is most likely to be considered acceptable on review by the domestic and European Courts, we stress that it is for Parliament to consider on an evidence-based analysis whether the restriction of the franchise presents a tangible benefit for civil responsibility and the prevention of crime. We express some scepticism.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We recognise that a range of strong, sincerely held convictions about the scope of the franchise have been expressed. We hope that the publication of these legislative proposals will lead to a resolution which recognises this spectrum of opinion and the implications for the UK’s reputation of maintaining the ban, but which respects the UK’s international obligations and maintains the rule of law.
[normal]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The D[bold]raft Bill[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The right to vote, blanket bans and proportionality 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws it promulgates.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Exclusion of any groups or categories of the general population must accordingly be reconcilable with the u
[normal]nderlying purposes of Article 3 of  the first Protocol
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There is no question…that a prisoner forfeits his Convention rights merely because of his status as a person detained following conviction.  Nor is there any place under the Convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for 
[normal]automatic disenfranchisement based purely on what might offend public opinion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]W
[normal]hile the Court reiterates that the margin of appreciation is … wide, it is not all-embracing.  Further, although the situation was somewhat impovoved by the 2000 Act which for the first time granted the vote to persons detained on remand, section 3 of the 1983 Act remains a blunt instrument.  It strips of their Convention right to vote a significant category of persons and it does so in a way which is indiscriminate.  The provision imposes a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners in person.  It applies automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances.  Such a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It does not appear, however, that anything has occurred or changed at the European and Convention levels since the Hirst … judgment that might lend support to the suggestion that the principles set forth in that case whould be reexamined.  On the contrary, analysis of the relevant international and European documents…and compartative law information…reveals the opposite trend, if anything, towards fewer restrictions on covicted prisoners voting rights.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and the rule of law and cannot be lightly set aside.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Limits on it require not deference, but careful examination.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] This is not a matter of substituting the Court’s philosophical preference for that of the legislature, but of ensuring that the legislature’s proffered justification is supported by logic and common sense. …  The 
[normal]Charter 
[normal]distinguishes between two separate issues: whether a right has been infringed, and whether the limitation is justified.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] The complainant bears the burden of showing the infringement of a right (the first step), at which point the burden shifts to the government to justify the limit as a reasonable limit under s. 1 (the second step).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] These are distinct processes with different burdens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] Insulating a rights restriction from scrutiny by labeling it a matter of social philosophy, as the government attempts to do, reverses the constitutionally imposed burden of justification.
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Rule of Law (Article 46 ECHR)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The [European] Convention ... was initiated ... to deal with the ... terrible persecution of minorities in Germany ... If we believe in the rule of law, we are just as much bound to observe the decisions of the European Court on matters within their competence as we are to obey the decisions of our own courts in matters within their competence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would just like to say that our country has embraced the rule of law for many, many generations and it still is bound by the rule of law. Therefore, when we have taken on legal obligations, as we have under the Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in Europe, the rule of law requires us to obey the courts that are set up under that Convention whose judgments are binding. I do not myself regard politics and law as, in any way, in conflict because politics in our country should be carried on under the rule of law.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The responsibility under Article 46 of the Convention includes the responsibility to remove the risk of future, repeat violations. In our view, the Government's decision to purposely "push the envelope" in this case creates the risk of further violations of the Convention and fails to satisfy its obligations under Article 46. In any event, even if the Government is able to persuade its colleagues on the Committee of Ministers to accept its approach, we consider that there is a significant risk that the proposals in the Crime and Security Bill would lead to further litigation both at home and at the European Court of Human Rights and a significant risk of further violations of the right to respect for private life by the United Kingdom.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The Options[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]A continuing violation (Option (c))
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Removing the franchise for all prisoners according to minimum sentence
[normal] (Options (a) and (b))
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]the legal provisions in Italy defining the circumstances in which individuals may be deprived of the right to vote show the legislature’s concern to adjust the application of the measure to the particular circumstances of the case in hand, taking into account such factors as the gravity of the offence committed and the conduct of the offender. It is applied only in connection with certain offences against the State or the judicial system, or with offences which the courts consider to warrant a particularly harsh sentence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Six
[normal] months
[normal] (Option (b))
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Four
[normal] years
[normal]: Option (a)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A fear that the public may misunderstand the government’s true attitude to crime and criminals provides no basis for depriving prisoners of fundamental rights that they retain despite their incarceration.
[normal] It could hardly be suggested that the government is entitled to disenfranchise prisoners in order to enhance its image; nor could it reasonably be argued that the government is entitled to deprive convicted prisoners of valuable rights that they retain in order to correct a public misconception as to its true attitude to crime and criminals.

[normal]Hirst (No2), 
[normal]para 69.  The recognition of the rights of prisoners beyond the limitations on the right to liberty is clear in the common law as distinct from the 
[normal]Strasbourg
[normal] jurisprudence.  
[normal] 
[normal]Hirst, 
[normal]para 69-71.  This recognition of the retained rights of prisoners during incarceration is reflected in domestic law.  As Lord Bingham explained:  Any custodial order inevitably curtails the enjoyment, by the person confined, of rights enjoyed by other citizens. He cannot move freely and choose his associates as they are entitled to do. It is indeed an important objective of such an order to curtail such rights, whether to punish him or to protect other members of the public or both. But the order does not wholly deprive the person confined of all rights enjoyed by other citizens. Some rights, perhaps in an attenuated or qualified form, survive the making of the order. And it may well be that the importance of such surviving rights is enhanced by the loss or partial loss of other rights. Among the rights which, in part at least, survive are three important rights, closely related but free standing, each of them calling for appropriate legal protection: the right of access to a court; the right of access to legal advice; and the right to communicate confidentially with a legal adviser under the seal of legal professional privilege. Such rights may be curtailed only by clear and express words, and then only to the extent reasonably necessary to meet the ends which justify the curtailment.  See

[normal] 
[normal] We are aware that the Attorney General is currently arguing before the Supreme Court that this line of case law should be ignored, in light of the domestic political approach to the history of the franchise of prisoners in the cases of Chester and McGeogh.  This is the first opportunity which the Supreme Court has had to consider this issue in over a decade, since Hirst itself.  We understand that the Government case encourages the Court to “take into account” the Strasbourg jurisprudence and then depart from it, in keeping with Section 2, Human Rights Act 1998.   We have supported a dialogue between the domestic and Strasbourg courts in the past; and this approach is envisaged by the framework of the Human Rights Act 1998.  However, it remains our view that the current law cannot support a conclusion that the original decision in Hirst is good law, or that despite the case-law in Greens and Scoppola, the current bar on prisoners voting is viable.  
[normal] See for example, S and Marper v United Kingdom [2008] ECHR 1581, paras 118-9, 125 and Gillan and Quinton v. UK [2010] ECHR 28, paras 76 – 79.

[normal]Even if some prisoners access to legal aid is further restricted, as proposed by the Government in 
[normal]Transforming Legal Aid
[normal], there is no requirement (at least before the ECHR) that for the purposes of pursuing a challenge that the individual must be represented.  In any event, JUSTICE reads the Government’s current proposals as subject to the exceptional funding provision in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which specifically allows for funding to be within scope for challenges which engage Convention rights.
