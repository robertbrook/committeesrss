"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence by the International Primate Protection LeagueMy name is Shirley McGreal and I have been working for the protection of primates for 41 years and directing a primate sanctuary.  I am writing your committee \non behalf of the International Primate Protection League and its 14,000 members around the world, including \nmany in \nthe United Kingdom. \nSummary: The International Primate Protection League has opposed the pet trade in primates since its founding in 1973, \nwherever the practice occurs. The trade is \nappalling and \nspecies-destructive if the animals sold as pets are wild-caught and cruel if they are born in captivity. \nWe urge your committee to bring the UK pet trade in primates to an end.\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBab\ny monkeys\n destined \nfor the pet trade, when born in captivity, are removed from their mothers soon after birth. I have video of the removal of a baby gibbon from his mother at a facility in Texas. First the father was separated from his mate and baby. Next the owner of the pl\nace started shooting darts at the mother who flew around the cage defecating in panic. Finally a dart hit the mother and the next thing one saw was the baby, wrapped in an orange blanket, being paraded around at a shopping mall. \n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis action was cruel and\n it’s the same with other primate species. From the moment of being removed from his or her mother, the baby monkey\n is \nsold \nby animal dealers \nto humans who think that having a baby monkey will be fun. \nMany of the purchasers call themselves “monkey moms” as\n if the monkey emerged from their bodies! Baby monkeys\n attract attention when taken out. \nA person carrying a baby monkey around changes from a “nonentity” to an “entity” and draws a crowd.3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBaby monkeys have a terrible time \nconforming \nto human expectations.\n They often \nare forced to \nwear diapers with holes cut for their tails and some even have their tails removed. As infants they delight their owners\n who often befriend each other\n.\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMost purchasers have no clue about primate nutrition with a frequent result be\ning rickets or other sicknesses, including stress. Many due young. \n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe fun for the human being dwindles as the \n“cute” pet grows up and develops canine teeth that can inflict serious injuries on “owners” and anyone they can get close to. \nLast week, in Ohio\n, \nUSA, \na two year old baby spider monkey was killed after biting a human who put his hand through the window of the car the owner was driving. \n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen the “owner” wearies of his once-cute pet, he/she often tries to find sanctuary space which is hard to find \nas most primate sanctuaries are over-crowded and under-funded.\nFor all these and other reasons, the International Primate Protection League hopes that the UK trade in pet primates will be brought to an end. Thank you for your consideration of our input. \nDr\n. Shirley \nMcGreal\n OBE, Founder, IPPL\n26 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
