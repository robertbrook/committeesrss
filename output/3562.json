"&#xa0;\nLetter to the Chair of the Committee from Dr Jane Martin, Local Government OmbudsmanCLG Committee Inquiry on the work of the Local Government OmbudsmanIn previous submissions to the Committee we have shared information on how the organisation has developed over the last 12 months and I look forward to exploring those issues in December. \nG\niven the importance of leadership to the future success of LGO, I a\nm taking this opportunity to give my own reflections as Chair of the Commission for Local Administration and, since Anne Seex’s absence from November of last year, the sole Local Government Ombudsman. \nOperational performanceThe new caseworking arrangemen\nts introduced in Apri\nl this year as a result of the transformation p\nlan have been successful in helping us to deliver a swifter service to the public. Our previous submission contained detailed information about our performance which showed that since the \nintroduction of the new approach we have exceeded our time targets each month. Our performance also meets or exceeds the speed of decision making of other public \nsector ombudsmen. However, the\n arrangements are still new \nand\n we will \nclosely monitor\n them to \nensure we sustain those levels of performance.\nThe public not only want to receive a decision within a short timescale but also want to know that the decisions we make are accurate and fair. Our Annual Report for 2012-13 showed that both complaints about o\nur service and requests for reviews of our decisions have decreased by 38% and 19% respectively. \nIn particular, I am pleased that we have a much better picture to report on cases which have taken over 52 weeks to conclude\n.\n \nA number of these are \njoint inve\nstigations with the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO). We recognise that we need to do better and have been working with PHSO to more closely harmonise our approach so that investigations can proceed more smoothly and swiftly. We will short\nly be publishing a new protocol\n \nthat \nclarifies our\n approach.\nMost of the joint investigations are complaints about health and social care and we will continue to work with PHSO to make the current statutory arrangements work as well as possible. However, a\ns health services become more closely integrated with \nsocial care at the local government level\n, Parliament may need to consider whether a new legislative approach is needed to deliver a more joined up ombudsman landscape across English public services, as is currently the case in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. \nPublic confidence in the OmbudsmanPublic confidence in LGO is primarily driven by the quality of the service we provide. The External Evaluation of LGO concluded that our decision making procedures meet the Ombudsman Association’s principles for fairness, openness and transparency and\n that our new performance management and quality framework is appropriately robust and effective. The report of the External Evaluation, along with the data we have previously submitted on our performance, show that the public can have confidence in LGO. W\ne have to continue to \nearn that confidence by sustaining consistently high standards. Our newly introduced quality\n standards\n framework is designed to provide that assurance.\nIt was clear from submissions to the Committee’s previous inquiry that public conf\nidence is also affected by perceptions of the independence and impartiality of our investigations. The publication of all of our decisions, the first public sector ombudsman \nto \ndo so, will help the public to better understand the reasons for our decisions \nand the evidence on which they are based. In response to recommendations made by the External Evaluation\n,\n our policy and guidance on avoiding conflicts of interest are published on our website and we also now publish details of the number of staff who have\n previously worked for a local authority. \nWe now need to measure how successful we have been in increasing confidence and identify areas where we have further work to do. Our business plan identifies two clear actions that will help us to measure this; cu\nstomer satisfaction research and the establishment of an advisory forum. As set out in our previous submission, both of these are progressing well and by the end of the business year we will have clear data to establish how confident service users are in o\nur work. We will share those results with the Committee and on our website once they are available.\nRelationship with staffThe 2012 staff survey highlighted a number of issues for the leadership and management of the LGO to address.  In support of the cha\nnges we have made I have clarified my role as Ombudsman to ensure clear leadership on casework and promote an open and accountable culture. I am accountable for my performance against objectives through a 360 degree appraisal process led by the independent\n chair of our remuneration committee \nGreater staff involvement has also been encouraged and earlier this year we established a Casework Policy Forum which I chair\n,\n to provide a vehicle through which decisions about our policy on casework related issues ar\ne determined.\n \nMy role in approving every report that we publish also ensures that I have a clear view of the significant issues arising in our casework\n and give clear direction to investigators\n.  \nImproving feedback channels and communication with our staf\nf has also been central to a more open and accountable culture. Staff have told us that they most value face to face communication from their direct line managers. Earlier this year we introduced a new method of feeding back from our Leadership Group meeti\nngs that better meets those communications preferences of staff. A ‘Talking Points’ briefing note is produced immediately following the Leadership Group which is then discussed in all team meetings the following week. This approach ensures that everyone re\nceives contemporaneous information face to face with an opportunity to discuss and feedback to their manager.\nWe have \nsuccessfully \nmanaged the most significant organisational change in LGO’s forty year history.  \nUndoubtedly, this has been a very unsettling\n time for many people\n in the organisation\n. \nWe recognise that it is our capable and committed workforce that will \nenable\n LGO to continue to deliver an effective service and we will continue to support them as the organisation develops. \nThe futureThrough stronger \nleadership and a dedicated work\nforce we have transformed the LGO into a more effective, cost efficient and responsive ombudsman scheme. The changes we have made place us in a strong position to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing pub\nlic services landscape.\nWe must now ensure that the organisation is resilient in order to meet future challenges. We have had some difficulty recruiting to posts required in the transformation plan and must ensure we have sufficient investigative capacity \nto meet future \nbusiness \nneeds. This will be a key consideration \nin\n \nthe rationalisation of \nfuture office accommodation. We also need to be able to maximise public awareness of our service especially in relation to social care.\nOur business plan for 2014-15 \nwill focus on\nThe next business year is also likely to see a wider debate about the role that LGO and other public sector ombudsmen should play in the future. The inquiry into complaints by the Public Administration Select Committe\ne (PASC), along with the review of the ombudsman landscape by Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin MP, provides an opportunity to ensure that the experiences of local government complaints and the changing face of local service delivery informs the future\n direction of any reforms.\nThe complaints system \nfor\n \npublic services \nincluding route to independent redress from the ombudsma\nn\n,\n need\ns\n to reflect increasingly locally delivered and accountable\n public services\n. \nT\nhe existing complaints system may no longe\nr me\net the needs of the citizen\n as a consumer of public services. \nAt LGO, our main purpose and focus will continue to be ensuring that our operating model delivers a quality service; that we maintain a sustainable workforce and that we remain an authoritative\n voice that engenders public trust and confidence.\n&#xa0;\n1 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
