[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Written evidence from the Whittington and Lichfield District Stop HS2 Action Group (HS2 004)&#xa0;

[[[Report Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;.£50 Billion.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[1.   Total Journey Times were not taken into account by KPMG.]]]1.1 Currently if you are travelling to London from The West Midlands, your local train will stop at   Birmingham New St for your connection to London Euston.In future, you and your luggage will have to leave New St and travel by foot or public transport to Curzon St to catch  HS2.&#xa0;1.2 If you are travelling from the Coventry area, currently all Birmingham to London Euston trains stop at Coventry, HS2 will not, and so there will be less trains per hour from Coventry to Euston.&#xa0;1.3 If you are currently travelling from The West Midlands to Derby or Nottingham, your local train will stop at Birmingham New St for your connection to the centres of Derby or Nottingham.In future, you and your luggage will have to go to Curzon St, where the train will take you to Toton/East Midlands Interchange, from where you will transfer to new rail links to existing conventional lines which go to the centres of Derby or Nottingham.These links have not been costed as part of the HS2 Project.HS2 quote the travel time to Derby as 12 minutes and Nottingham 15 minutes but omit the average waiting time between HS2 and the local train.&#xa0;

[[[2.   Conventional Train time improvements were not considered by KPMG.]]]2.1 There are 3 pinchpoints on the WCML which restrict the speed at which conventional trains can travel. These would take 5 or 6 years to re-engineer, not 17 years as stated by the Minister of Transport.&#xa0;2.2 Network rail are planning to introduce In-Cab signalling which will allow conventional trains to travel faster.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3.   The KPMG was biased.]]]3.1 It only considered a philosophy that was biased towards its paymaster, HS2 Ltd.&#xa0;3.2 What is required is a totally independent report (Not from KPMG)..&#xa0;

[[[4. There is no Capacity Problem on The West Coast ]]]

[[[Main Line]]]

[[[.]]]4.1 There are four simple tests to help us understand whether there is a capacity problem.&#xa0;4.2 

[[[Seats Occupied. ]]]The official figures show that WCML Intercity trains are only c59% full atpeak times (Ref. a).Lower seat loadings than all other domestic long distance routes into any London Terminus.(Ref. b).&#xa0;4.3 

[[[Train Configuration.  ]]]There are four first class carriages, which are a third full at peak (Ref. c). &#xa0;4.4 

[[[Train Length. ]]]At present, trains are a mix of 9 and 11 carriages. 12 Carriage trains could be run to all destinations except Liverpool.&#xa0;4.5 

[[[Train Paths]]]

[[[. ]]]Could more trains per hour be run at peak times?Re-engineering 3 pinch points, and introducing In-Cab signalling will increase train speeds and therefore enable there to be more trains per hour.&#xa0;4.6 51M have shown that by reducing first class carriages to 3 per train and increasing train length to 12 per train, the number of seats per train will be 693, over four times the current average for the route of 164 per train. Network Rail has agreed these figures..It more than meets the Dft’s forecast of passengers doubling by 2037.In addition by dealing with the 3 pinchpoints on the WCML and implementing In-Cab signalling, extra trains per hour can be run.  &#xa0;4.7 So the above proves that there is no Intercity Capacity problem.&#xa0;4.8 Commuter capacity to Milton Keynes and Northampton is currently a problem.&#xa0;4.9 There are simple solutions:In the short term allow travellers to Milton Keynes to get off Virgin Trains at Milton Keynes. Currently the trains stop there but only to pick up passengers.

[[[ ]]]

[[[ ]]]In the medium term spend £260 million on a flyover at Ledburn Junction and use faster commuter trains to increase the number of trains per hour. This could be completed in 5 years time.&#xa0;4.10 Longer term, commuter services to Hemel Hempstead and Watford to Euston need to be resolved, but a £50 Billion National Rail Service cannot be promoted as a sensible solution. &#xa0;

[[[5. The Strategic Case has not considered alternative options for The ]]]

[[[United Kingdom]]]

[[[ to spend £50Billion.]]]5.1 The Financial Times, The Economist, The Spectator and The Sunday Telegraph all reject the HS2 Project as a sensible way to spend £50 Billion.&#xa0;5.2 Only 5% of UK travel is by train. There are so many other significant projects outstanding that would generate wealth in the North of England. Widening the M6, building new Motorways, getting rid of traffic jams that increase travel time to and from work on a daily basis.&#xa0;5.3 Significantly more Capital Spending on Schools and Hospitals is required, but not available.&#xa0;5.4 Upgrading all UK conventional rail services is necessary.  &#xa0;

[[[6. The numbers quoted by HS2 are grossly incorrect.]]]6.1 The Financial Times proved that the Peak Time Travel figures were incorrect by 50%.&#xa0;6.2 Wider benefits of £15 billion are now claimed by HS2. 25 times the value implied in the January 2012 Analysis.Passenger forecasts include an additional 45,000 return trips daily, generated by the introduction of HS2.Dividing £15 billion by 45,000 and by 300 effective days per annum provides £1,100 for each generated return trip. As only business travel will generate income, that equates to £3,700 per business trip.Worse still, the benefit of a generated trip is usually only 50% of a pre-existing trip, and therefore each pre-existing  trip is generating £2200, and each pre-existing business trip is generating £7400 per annum. Multiply 730 Million round trips per annum (Quoted by Network Rail) by £2,200 and it implies that £1,600 Billion will be generated, which is greater than our Nation’s GDP. (Ref.d).&#xa0;6.3 The most appropriate comparator for Dft passenger forecasts is HS1 which has produced just 38% of its business case forecast; this throws considerable doubt on HS2 forecasts.&#xa0;6.4 Communication Technology Improvements will reduce the need for business travel.British Telecom Plc. is already demonstrating a very sophisticated version of 3D Conferencing.&#xa0;6.5 Jobs created by HS2 relate to the construction and maintenance of the HS2 Lines and Rolling Stock, and at Retail Outlets at the new stations. When asked, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce replied they had no idea what sort of additional jobs would be created by HS2.&#xa0;6.6 HS2 will not create more freight capacity on the WCML, during the 10 years it will take to build Stage 2, HS2 will virtually demolish the current freight capacity between Lichfield and the North. (Ref. e)&#xa0;6.7 HS2 cost/benefit ratio falls in the bottom 25% of Dft Intercity  Schemes and in the bottom 10% of their projects overall ( Ref. f ).&#xa0;
