"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) (RaD0017)Médecins Sans Fronti\nères is an international \nmedical humanitarian organisation which provides medical assistance to those affected by armed conflict, epidemics, exclusion from health care and natural disasters. In 1999 in the wake of Médecins Sans Frontières\n \n(MSF) being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\n MSF launched the Access Campaign. Its purpose has been to push for access to, and the development of live-saving and life prolonging medicines, diagnostic tests and vaccines for patients in MSF programmes and beyond. \nMSF welcomes this opportunity to comm\nent on the NAO’s review of R&amp;D funding, and to suggest future inquiries for the committee to undertake. Our response is driven by the strategic importance of pharmaceutical sector R&amp;D as highlighted by the review. Our principal concern is that Government s\ntrategy does not include sufficient safeguards to protect the public investment made in R&amp;D \nfor health \nand to ensure affordable access to the fruits of innovation. We have focused our submission on the following areas:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe special case of R&amp;D funding for health1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResearch and development spending serves a clear economic purpose, encouraging innovation, increasing economic competitiveness and thereby fuelling economic growth. The pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, as the review notes, are significant contributors t\no R&amp;D spending in the \nUK\n with a 28% share of the total \nUK\n spend. As such, they play an important role as a potential source of economic growth and GDP. However where research and development spending supported by the \nUK\n government is for healthcare technol\nogies it has a dual purpose, to improve healthcare both in the \nUK\n, and abroad, as an integral objective of international development strategy. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is an inherent tension between the desire to encourage and stimulate growth in the highly profitable \npharmaceutical sector on the one hand, and the need to ensure a public return on investment in terms of public health improvements on the other. Government funding for healthcare R&amp;D should aim to achieve a balance between these two objectives. In the cont\next of a reduction in the amount of money the government spends on undertaking R&amp;D itself, and the increase in direct (grants) and indirect funding (tax credits) it provides to UK business\n, it is vital that the public health perspective remains \nin focus. We are concerned that without sufficient safeguards in place, government funding is not being used to leverage sufficient health benefits for the public. The investment of public money in medical innovation should consider patient benefit and affordable access.\n&#xa0;MSF experience on access and affordability of new medical technologies2.1\n&#xa0; \nMSF works in nearly 70 countries delivering healthcare in challenging, resource limited settings. Every day MSF field operations are confronted with the lack of access to adequate or affordable medical tools. There are two major challenges: the high cost of existing medicines, and the absence of appropriate or effective treatments for many of the diseases affecting our patients.\n \nThe system for health R&amp;D is flawed in that it is predominantly driven by commercial rewards rather than health priorities. It is founded on the idea that companies should be able to recoup their R&amp;D investments through charging high prices made possible by patent monopolies. Granted a patent, a company is able to operate as a monopoly and charge high prices, which are considered to cover the cost of research and development and generate substantial profit thus serving as an incentive for more R&amp;D.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0; \nAs a result, research is steered towards areas that are the most profitable, leaving many fundamental medical needs and public health priorities unaddressed. \nThis system fails to \nincentivise research and development if patients cannot afford to pay high prices, either because they are too poor or too few. That is why, despite accounting for 11.4% of the global disease burden, only 1.3% of all new drugs were developed for tropical diseases and TB between 1975 and 2004\n. A 2013 study revealed that only 3.8% of new drugs approved between 2000 and 2011 were indicated for neglected diseases even though the global burden of disease is estimated to be 10.5%\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0; \nOn the ground, this means that MSF field workers are frequently forced to use products that are ill-adapted to the resource limited environments, such as vaccines requiring cold chain storage, and delivery by a trained health professional. When treating drug resistant TB, MSF doctors are forced to administer drugs with severe and debilitating side effects, and low efficacy. Treatment requires patients to \ntake a course of up to six different antibiotics – as many as 20 pills per day for up to two years, plus, for the first six months, a painful daily injection. \nThe side effects of such treatment range from persistent nausea to psychosis and total deafness.\n Some patients find these side effects too difficult to bear and interrupt or stop treatment altogether, placing them in a dangerous position of potentially developing further resistance, and limiting their treatment options further. New, shorter and less toxic treatment regimens are desperately needed, but the incentive \nto invest in developing these drugs, compared to more lucrative drugs for a high income market, is limited. As a result of such an incentive mechanism, important public health priorities are often neglected. \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0; \nThese unaddressed medical needs affect the communities in which MSF works, but increasingly the R&amp;D gaps impact on developed countries. The dearth of new antibiotics, for example, is of global concern. Whilst ad hoc funding arrangements, including targeted calls and grants directed at both public institutions and industry and the proliferation of Product Development Partnerships (PDPs), have to an extent helped to focus R&amp;D investment on priority health needs, no sustainable alternative system of rewarding R&amp;D has been explored. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0; \nMoreover, no solution has been found to guarantee that innovation funded by public money will be affordable and accessible to a global population once developed. The current system means that some drugs remain completely out of reach for many health care systems and patients even in high income settings as pressure on economic resources grows, and decisions on clinical value must be made. The frequency with which NICE is unable to introduce new cancer therapies, due to a cost benefit analysis that deems that although introducing the new therapy could bring health gains, the high price does not justify doing so, reflects this growing pressure. In the context of 11 of 12 recently approved cancer drugs being priced above $100,000 per patient per year\n, this is unsurprising. \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0; \n The \nUK\n adoption of value based pricing recognizes the chasm between the clinical value of medical products and their price. Yet whilst \nvalue based pricing moves towards orientating R&amp;D to areas of greater health needs, it does not address long term affordability at all. The need to address high price monopolies is of urgent concern as healthcare spending becomes increasingly unsustainable. At a time when pressure on limited public resources is at a peak, any contributions to R&amp;D made by the \nUK\n government must be fully leveraged to ensure a fair and appropriate return on our public investment in terms of achieving sustainable access and affordability. \n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0; \n From a global perspective the preferred tiered pricing strategy, which is structured on the assumption that prices paid for medicines are on a sliding scale related to GDP, is also problematic. Prices paid in high income countries are, as described, unsustainable, whilst populations of many middle income countries with great wealth inequalities struggle to access lifesaving medicines. The market for ARV medicines to treat HIV highlights this persistent lack of affordable access, particularly in middle income countries excluded from preferential pricing strategies, and across the board with innovative medicines. Third line HIV treatments, which are a last resort for patients who have exhausted all other treatment options, are priced at a minimum of $2000 per patient per year\n \nin the poorest countries, with middle income countries paying substantially more. This lack of affordable access is a significant barrier to scaling up treatment of HIV, and to \nmaximizing the effectiveness of international development programs and targets\n for scale up which the UK government supports. \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0; \nMSF feels that in order to balance the dual objectives of investment in health R&amp;\nD of achieving public health benefits as well as encouraging economic growth, affordable access to innovation must be more systematically taken into account. MSF would encourage the committee to consider mechanisms which prioritize patient needs, and entre\nnch patient access requirements as a condition to public financing of medical R&amp;D. Pricing and access cannot be considered unimportant details to be negotiated at the later stages, but must be addressed from the beginning.  \n&#xa0;&#xa0;Intellectual Property as a barrier to innovation and affordable access&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0; \nThe emphasis in the review on investment in R&amp;D as a source of economic growth alone highlights the continued failure to consider research and development of healthcare technologies as a ‘special case’. Citing pat\nents filed as an indicator of a healthy R&amp;D environment has significant weaknesses. In addition, it fails to recognize the potential negative consequences of exploitation of intellectual property rights. Such consequences include:\n&#xa0;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLimiting patient access.\n Granting exclusive rights removes all competition from the market, allowing high prices to be set and extremely high profits to be earned. These high profits are intended to act as an incentive for a firm to invest in R&amp;D. Maintaining these artificially h\nigh prices, however,  comes at the expense of patient access and the potential to provide life-saving and life prolonging treatment on a large scale. \n&#xa0;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe creation of patent thickets which impede, rather than encourage, research and development\n. Medical a\ndvances are slowed and even halted when researchers, in both public and private industry, must obtain multiple licenses from multiple parties in order to continue their research. Accumulated costs and time wasted obtaining these licenses represent a barrie\nr to innovation and an obstacle to medical progress.\n&#xa0;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEncouraging protectionism and secrecy surrounding important medical knowledge and innovative technologies, which results in poorly used resources as research efforts are duplicated, and common knowledge\n that drives future research is not accumulated. Although collaborative projects are formed occasionally, particularly when developing low profit treatments for diseases which affect developing countries, competition, not collaboration, is the norm. \n&#xa0;\n—\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInce\nntivising patent ‘ever-greening’ and overspending on developing ‘me too’ drugs rather than truly novel breakthroughs. Evergreening allows companies to artificially extend patents, and therefore protect profits, whilst providing little in terms of medical a\ndvances and patient benefit.  The structure of incentives within the patent system means that companies have very little incentive to invest in novel technologies.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0; \n \nWe believe that \npublic money should reward innovation that improves health outcomes, \nand \na\nccess to knowledge, data and technology. It should not encourage legal monopolies, \nor inhibit future medical advances. R&amp;D outcomes and intellectual property rights should be managed in a manner that promotes open sharing of knowledge, protects the public \ninterest in access to knowledge and health related innovation, and ensures freedom to operate and build on discoveries. \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0; \n We recommend that the committee explores the impact of increased exploitation of intellectual property rights on health related innovation. It would be valuable to consider incorporating IP provisions into health R&amp;D financing agreements undertaken with g\novernment funds. It would be beneficial to explore the potential for making favorable taxation policies, and other financial R&amp;D incentives, contingent on access IP policies that are in the public interest. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTransparency and access to knowledge&#xa0;\n4.1 It is of concern that transparency is not a condition of public financing of industry research. As such it is difficult to effectively evaluate whether resources are being effectively and appropriately used, and whether the innovative outcome of R&amp;D ha\ns true clinical value. Accountability for publicly funded research should be a central principle. \n4.2 Currently there is no obligation to publish results of unsuccessful trials. Access to this information would allow the true return on investment to be mo\nre transparent, as clinical value to the patient will be more fully evaluated. \n4.3 Currently there is no requirement to openly disclose the full, itemized cost of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry justifies high prices with reference to the high risks and \ncosts of R&amp;D, but is unwilling to publish data which would verify this. Publishing such data would assure that costs which industry attributes to R&amp;D and for which it receives financial benefits can be independently verified, and that inefficient spending \ncan be reviewed. \n4.4 Norms and measures that could be adopted include:\n— \nRequirements for disclosure of the costs of R&amp;D inputs.\n— \nRequirements for disclosure of prices and revenues of products fully or partially funded through government grants, to furth\ner analysis of the performance of varying funding mechanisms. \n― \nStandards for disclosures of information regarding clinical trials that are  appropriate and beneficial, including all results and information on Safety, Quality and Efficacy, in publicly and\n easily accessible registries.\n― Requirements for \ndisclosure of the terms and conditions of licensing agreements, particularly those between public institutions and the private sector. \n4.5\n \nWe would recommend that the committee considers how transparency c\nould be built into health R&amp;D financing agreements, and how the goal of access to publicly funded knowledge is being achieved consistently through the current system. \n&#xa0;\n              Questions for future inquiries5.1 MSF would recommend that the committee undertake a comprehensive review of what policies are or should be in place to protect the public interest in government funding of biomedical and health technology research. This review should consider government\n funding through private industry and public institutions, and focus on ensuring that the public return on investment is being considered alongside the objective of economic growth, and in particular that access and affordability are being sufficiently lev\neraged both for the UK and developing countries. \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n P.4, National Audit Office, Memorandum for the House of Commons Science and \nTechnology Committee, June 2013,  \nhttp://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Research-and-development-funding-for-science-and-technology-in-the-UK1.pdf\n \n&#xa0;\n \nPécoul B, Chirac P, Trouiller P, Pinel J.
