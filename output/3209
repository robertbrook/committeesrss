defaultPACT 
defaultwas incorporated in May 2007 as the Portree Area Community Company. PACT’s key objectives are to stimulate and coordinate the economic, cultural and environmental regeneration of the Portree area in response to community-iden
defaulttified priorities. The key and major such priority for PACT is the regeneration of the Portree Harbour area. As it stands, the latter has been identified to have a number of key deficiencies which are both curtailing potential socio-economic benefits for P
defaultortree itself but also the wider Skye community and, indeed, the Highlands and Islands Area.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe main deficiencies are, inter alia: the lack of a sheltered area from the prevailing south-westerly wind generating a real need for the construction of an app
defaultropriate breakwater which would protect moorings, provide a better all weather environment for both commercial and leisure users of the harbour, such as trawlers and fish farmers, sailors and other boat users along with providing the RNLI a sheltered area 
defaultto build a purpose built boat house; the original pier structure was built alongside the historic Telford Quay (circa 1819) in the 1960’s and is a long established facility and little investment has been undertaken in the pier since then and it is no longe
defaultr regarded as fit for purpose by any of the users.

default);
default 
defaultf
defaulturthermore, BP no longer land fuels at the pier and this now comes into Portree by road tanker which has considerable socio economic costs not least the damage that is being done to the Telford quay and th
defaulte pier area has to be closed to other users when deliveries are being made. 
defaultBecause of access issues the pier also has to be closed to users when Ocean going ships moor in 
defaultPortree
default bay.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultHighland Council acknowledges the 
defaultdeficiencies of the current pier structure and the existing access and have included harbor development and a new access road in The West Highlands and Islands Local Development Plan.
default 
defaultThe vision for Portree in the West Highland and Island Local Plan is 
defaultdes
defaultcribed 
defaultas a “burgeoning sub-regional centre”, but it is clear that the lack of facilities and poor infrastructure in the harbour area are hindering this objective in a number of key ways. For example, Portree faces a continuing downturn in fishing opportun
defaultities (both fish farmers and the fishing fleet) due to increasing legislation, a lack of incentive for young people to enter the industry and a history of underinvestment and neglect of harbour facilities. Tourism is fast becoming the mainstay of the local
default economy and it is therefore highly reliant incoming visitors. Improved marine infrastructure will encourage more visitors to the island and the village, helping to support existing business, establishing opportunities for new ventures in fishing, aquacult
defaulture and water- based activities such as tours and sailing and to crea
defaultte new training and employment 
defaultopportuniti
defaultes in marine related activities
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAdditionally, it is well known that that a substantial proportion of tourist expenditure comes from leisure, r
defaultetail and impulse buying. To generate the right conditions for such buying, UK marketing experience indicates the need to create ‘Destination Complexes’; i.e. localities containing a concentration of retail, catering and services products with overall attr
defaultactiveness and interest to create stay times of 2-3 hours at least. Only Portree offers this potential but this would require the regeneration of the harbour area, which is central to the whole of Portree, in addition to the existing centres of interest, n
defaultamely Wentworth Street and the Square. Todd Asscociates have calculated that the net increase in visitor expenditure as a result of creating such a tourist destination centre be regeneration of the harbour would be in the region of £6m (in today’s money) p
defaulter annum and this would generate 130 direct and indirect jobs throughout the island.
default&#xa0;
defaultLeisure sailing (that is non-industrial marine activity) is worth around £2bn to the UK economy, creates a total of 70,000 jobs in the UK and Scotland is considered one o
defaultf the top 6 sailing destinations in the world. There is a large boating fraternity in continental Europe and it is estimated that there are 600,000 craft in Europe capable of sailing to Scotland and there is also the untapped North American market. We beli
defaulteve that the sailing conditions around the Hebridies are unrivalled in the world but at present the potential for marine tourism in the area has not yet been exploited. Skye with its iconic scenery, history, geology, wildlife and a malt whisky distillery w
defaultould be bound to attract a large slice of this potential market. However, the success of such marine tourism will largely depend on provision of safe mooring, berthing and landing facilities of sea borne visitors. For example, we understand that the creati
defaulton of 24 pontoons equates to an expenditure increase in the local community of £150,000. Since a marina of 150 pontoons would not be unrealistic as a longer term objective for Portree, that would generate approximately a further £1m per annum, with the con
defaultsequent knock on effects for employment.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summary, it is anticipated that future growth from marine leisure will come from: more ‘home port’ resident berths of Scottish boat owners; more ‘home port’ facilities for boat owners from outside Scotland; hi
defaultgher demand for visitor berthing facilities, especially from holiday-makers; more overnight berths for Scottish boat owners on short trips; demand for holiday boat charters; demand for sailing training courses. 
default&#xa0;
defaultScotland’s cruise industry has grown from a
defaultpprox 45,000 cruise passengers in 2000 to more than 240,000 in 2010. However, the number of cruise liners visiting Portree has stayed static over the last 10 years at 20 -30 per year. And indeed the quality of the liners visiting has decreased (for example
default, ‘The World’ liner visited some 10 years ago but has not returned). The head of harbours of the Highland Council has indicated to PACT that he has been reliably informed that if the Portree harbour area is properly refurbished on average there could be, o
defaultn average, a liner coming to Portree every day of the year. In addition to the mooring charges for a liner, which are approx £4000, there would be a considerable increase in the expenditure for the community. For example, from a study conducted in Orkney i
defaultt has been established that over 90% of passengers go ashore and the average spend in Kirkwall is £50. As well as passengers, approximately 38% of crew members come ashore and spend £23 in Kirkwall. Additionally, there is increase demand for coach hire and
default tourist guides etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn 2010, Sailing Tourism in Scotland designated Portree as a strategic port. Given the considerable deficiencies of the current harbour area and given the potentially huge benefits that a refurbishment process could bring to Portree a
defaultnd the wider community, how can the above-noted benefits be achieved? PACT has proposed the following three-phased regeneration for Portree harbour. This proposed regeneration has the support of all of the users of the harbour area and of local and nationa
defaultl politicians.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe proposed development and regeneration of Portree harbour has been broken down into 3 distinct phases:
default&#xa0;
defaultPhase 1. 
defaultConstruction of a Breakwaterdefault. This would involve the reclamation of land and the creation of a breakwater. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPhase 2. 
defaultPier Rdefaultefurbishment, Marina and RNLI Boat Housedefault. Currently there are no basic facilities, such as toilets and showers, for any of the harbour users and the refurbished pier head would address this along with the creation of a laundry and other facilities such as 
defaultstorage and working space An onshore Station for the RNLI; at present the Portree RNLI is the only station that has its boat on a swing mooring with the implications this has for safety. Creation of a marina through the installation of a pontoon system.
default&#xa0;
defaultPhase 3 
defaultLinking Road and Deepwater Docking.default An access road would need to be created around the lump and we are aware that the Highland Council already have plans in place for this. Deepwater docking point for shallow draught ocean-going cruise liners and o
defaultil supply vessels. Reclamation of land for creation of marine engineering services and boat storage/ potential development.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultSince becoming a
defaultn active 
defaultmember of Pact in 
default2009, 
defaultwe as an organization have held many meetings with the Highland Council, Highla
defaultnds and Islands Enter
defaultprise, 
defaultand politicians 
defaultand although there has been interest and support for our project we were unable to focus this support in terms of moving the process forward until the CE took an interest and w
defaultithout doubt t
defaulthe breakthrough in kic
defaultk
default 
defaultstarting 
defaultthe harbour r
defaulte
defaultgeneration 
defaultin Portree 
defaulthas been the involvement of the CE.
default 
defaultThe CE have been involved with the Portree Moorings association for some time and it was that connection that led the CE to meet with all the key bodies involved in Portree
default harbour
default in May 2012
default, namely the Portree Moorings association, PACT and the Portree Sailing club.
default Subseq
defaultu
defaulte
defaultnt to that meeting the CE commissioned Jura consultants to prepare a business plan for the regeneration of 
defaultthe Portree harbour area and that plan was 
defaultinstrumental in assisting the Portree sailing club in obtaining significant funding
default from the Coastal Communities Fund to provide improved facilities for
default the sailing fraternity. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI
defaultn taking the wider harbour regeneration project forward, members of the CE h
defaultave held numerous meetings with Pact’s harbour group and also with myself. In the summer of this year we su
defaultccessfully completed a 
defaultseabed survey of Portree harbour to determine what can be done 
defaultin terms of the creation of a breakwater. This survey would hav
defaulte been impossible without both the financial and knowledge based support of the Crown. At the moment PACT is working closely with the CE to move to the next phase of work which would be to instruct a firm of engineers to produce an options appraisal for th
defaulte harbour area based on the seabed survey.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGive
defaultn the above backdrop, 
defaultit is with some considerable disquiet and concern that we read the recommendations in the 
defaultSelect Committees briefing paper, viz: ‘The CE
default’s responsibilities for the seabed, the foreshore and other ancient rights in Scotland should therefore be devolved then decentralized as far as possible. Devolution to Holyrood should be conditional upon an agreement between the Secretary of State for Sco
defaulttland and the Scottish Government on how such a scheme of subsidiary to local authority and local community levels should be implemented’ 
default&#xa0;
defaultClearly if the CEs responsibilities were to be devolved the agreement mentioned in the last sentence would be crucia
defaultl. However, the present SNP government has demonstrated very clearly that it, paradoxically, is against further devolution of powers to local authorities and has indeed strongly resisted such in terms of the funding of Councils. It is our concern that even
default if such an agreement could be reached the practicalities would be such that control would remain with Holyrood which mean that the whole issue of how the seabed around Scotland 
defaultis used 
defaultwould become a political football rather being a new policy that benef
defaultited local trusts
default,
default such as our own.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, 
defaulteven if such devolution of powers could be achieved 
defaultit is our view that 
defaultthere remain significant problems with this approach. First
default,
default the devolution of such powers would have to be overseen to by the various Cou
defaultncils. This would be inefficient since there would be presumably a repl
defaultica
defaulttion of posts and positions across the various Councils and it would be interesting to know what the budgetary spend would 
defaulthave to be compared to the CE’s current
default 
defaultbudget for 
defaultmanaging
default t
defaulthe devolution of powers through
default its local management schemes. 
defaultSecond
default,
default the CE contains a huge knowledge base on harbour redevelopments and the running of marinas and associated infrastructure. How would this knowledge base be replicated and replaced in th
defaulte new proposed set up? Thirdly
default,
default in our experience the CE is taking a Scotland/ UK wide approach to marine leisure and this surely is the way forward in unlocking the potential of harbours like Portree. It is unclear how the proposed devolved system would a
defaultchieve
default this
default. Finally
default,
default and as noted above
default,
default 
defaultalthough 
defaultour local council 
defaulthas been supportive of our attempts 
defaultto improve Portree harbour area
default we do not believe they can match the CE in terms of their financial and knowledge-based support
default. 
defaultIt is for these reason
defaults that we strongly support the current devolution of the seabed to local groups, such as our own, through the Local Management Agreements initiated by the Crown Estate.
