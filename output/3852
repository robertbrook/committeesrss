Written evidence submitted by Scope (JRR 0019)default&#xa0;defaultAbout Scopedefault&#xa0;
default1.1 Scope exists to make this country a better place for disabled people and their families. We do this
default by running a range of services, raising awareness of the issues that disabled people face and influencing change across society.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe provide support, advice and information for more than a quarter of a million disabled people and their family members every
default year.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 Scope
default’s
default submission focuses on the questions relating to the proposed changes to the costs of judicial review
default and the 
defaultability of
default disabled people to challenge 
defaultlocal authorities around 
defaultsocial care decisions
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultBackgrounddefault&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultScope recognises that 
defaultjudicial review is, and should
default,
default continue to be a remedy of last resort. 
defaultT
defaulthe pursuit of a judicial review case has meant that disabled people have been able to challenge decisions by public bodies which adversely affect their lives across a range of areas –
default such as seeking redress against unlawful reduction in the support they get to live an independent life or against treatment that may result in arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 In some circumstances, notably in the absence of a statutory right of ap
defaultpeal, judicial review may be the only route through which a range of crucial statutory duties that local authorities have – such as, for instance, the duty to assess a disabled person who may be in need of community care services – are 
defaultsafeguarded
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultA
default recent example of this was the use of judicial review by five disabled people to challenge the Government’s decision to close the Independent Living Fund (ILF). The ILF provides financial support to 
defaultover 
default19,
default000 disabled people which enables
default them to live 
defaulti
defaultndependently 
defaultin the community rather than move into residential care. In November of this year, the court of appeal ruled in 
defaultfavour of 
defaultthe five ILF cl
defaultaimant
defaults and stated that 
defaultthere was insufficient evidence that the 'very grave impact' on some of those affe
defaultcted by the closure of the ILF was properly brought to the Minister's attention, despite officials having been clearly informed of the possible impacts not only by service users but also by local authorities
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4 
defaultAs a result of 
defaultthe ruling, the 
defaultDepartment for Work and Pensions (DWP) confirmed that it had accepted the court’s decision and would not seek leave to appeal, and stated
default that
default 
default“ministers will be invited to make a new decision on the future of the Independent Livin
defaultg Fund based on further a
defaultdvice…to 
defaultmake sure the equality duty is ade
defaultquately adhered to”.
default&#xa0;
default2.5 Given the vital importance of judicial review in preserving basic fundamental rights,
default as demonstrated in the above case,
default Scope would 
defaulttherefore 
defaultstrongly oppose any proposals whose effect would be to make it more difficult for disabled people to bring such claims. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6 The importance of judicial review should also be viewed in the context of the Governments
default 
defaultproposed reforms to social care. T
defaulthe Gov
defaulternment have committed to 
defaultradically 
defaultreforming the social care system, setting out the first legislative framework for adult social care in England through the Care Bill
default which is
default 
defaultcurrently 
defaultpassing 
defaultthrough 
defaultParliament. 
defaultAt a time of considerable change in the 
defaultsocial care system,
default 
defaultit is likely that j
defaultudicial review 
defaultwill be a crucial last resort for working age disabled people
default 
defaultin ensuring the new care system works as the Government intends. 
default&#xa0;
default2.7 With regards the Government’s proposal to 
defaultprovide
default an alternative, non-judicial mechanism for resolving disputes about whether public bodies have complied with the 
defaultPublic Sector Equality D
defaultuty, 
defaultScope
default endorse
defaults
default the
default views of the
default Equality and Diversity Forum
default (of which we are a member)

defaulto
defaultn this issue which are s
defaultet out in a separate submission to this 
defaultinq
defaultuiry.
default&#xa0;
defaultCostsdefault default&#xa0;
default3.1 
defaultThe government 
defaultis proposing
default 
defaultthe 
defaultrebalancing of financial incentives so that providers are only paid for work carried out on judicial review cases where permission is granted, or exceptionally in the Legal Aid Agency’s discretion. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 This would mean that if a lawyer has started a 
defaultjudicial review claim, but it settles or is withdrawn before of a judge grants permission to carry on to a hearing
default, they should not be paid for the work they’ve done. A
defaultccording to the Ministry of Justice’s own impact assessment on the
defaultir proposed
default reforms
default to
default judicial review
default,
default 
defaultin 2012 over 40% of all applications
default 
defaultare withdrawn before a permission decision is made
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.3 Lawyers will therefore be deterred from bringing judicial review claims generally, even those with good prospects for success. Disabled people
default will find it impossible to get legal advice and find someone to represent them in judicial review challenges and will therefore be left with no recourse to challenge unlawful decisions, leaving public authorities shielded away from legitimate challenges.
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4 It is also important to note that even unsuccessful review applications can serve important functions: 
default&#xa0;
default“A good example is the recent Supreme Court decision in R (KM) v Cambridgeshire City Council. While the claimant failed in his challenge to the 
defaultCouncil’s decision, the case provided the Supreme Court with the opportunity to set out detailed guidance for local authorities, building on earlier case law, in respect of the requirements of section 2(1) of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1
default970, which is a provision of singular importance in the field of community care.” 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 Furthermore, p
defaultroposals contained in the draft Care Bill
default will mean that judicial review will be an even more crucial mechanism for disabled people to ensure they receive the support 
defaultthey need to live independently, as enshrined in Article 19 of the UNCRPD.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.6 
defaultT
defaulthe explanatory notes accompanying the Care Bill 
defaultstate that the
default 
defaultgeneral duty of a local authority, in exercising a function in the case of an individual, is to promote that individual’s well-being.
default 
defaultW
defaulthere a local authority fail
defaults
default to have regard to this principle, they may be challenged through judicial rev
defaultiew.
default&#xa0;
default3.7 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe Government’s proposals to reform judicial review would essentially insulate public authorities 
defaultfrom any legitimate challenges from disabled people who feel 
defaultlocal authorities are not adequately promoting their “well-being” through the
default social care system. 
default&#xa0;
default3.8 
defaultIt
default is 
defaultof course 
defaultvital that the regulations accompanying the Care Bill around who is eligible for social care support are as clear and consistent as possible. 
defaultAs with any regulations, the eligibility criteria will be open to 
defaultinterpretation and therefore it
default will be down to case law - not the Care Bill 
default- to clarify the meaning of the 
defaultcriteria. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9 
defaultWith regards the Government’s draft eligibility criteria, there is 
defaultcurrently
default 
defaultsignificant 
defaultuncertainty about what the regulations act
defaultually 
defaultrepresent. In the 
defaultGovernment
default’s consultation document regarding the regulations
default, it
default 
defaultstates 
defaultthe 
defaultregulations 
defaultare the equivalent of ‘substantial’ under
default the current
default FACS
default criteria
default, whereas many local authorities believe the regulations are closer to ‘mode
defaultrate’
default FACS
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.10 
defaultEstablishing new
default regulations will therefore
default 
defaultlikely result in 
defaulta significant number of legal challenges
default from disabled people who need support to live independently 
defaultbut are deemed ineligible for care. If the proposed changes to legal aid f
defaultor judicial review cases go ahead, the burden of such legal uncertainty would largely be borne by disabled people who would find themselves being faced with even greater barriers in bringing such challenges.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultRecommendation:default Scope therefore calls on the Government not to proceed with any reforms to judicial review which would reduce the ability of disabled people to bring about such legal challenges against decisions by public bodies.
