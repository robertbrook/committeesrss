Written evidence submitted by Scope (JRR 0019)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]About Scope[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1 Scope exists to make this country a better place for disabled people and their families. We do this
[normal] by running a range of services, raising awareness of the issues that disabled people face and influencing change across society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We provide support, advice and information for more than a quarter of a million disabled people and their family members every
[normal] year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 Scope
[normal]’s
[normal] submission focuses on the questions relating to the proposed changes to the costs of judicial review
[normal] and the 
[normal]ability of
[normal] disabled people to challenge 
[normal]local authorities around 
[normal]social care decisions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Background[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 
[normal]Scope recognises that 
[normal]judicial review is, and should
[normal],
[normal] continue to be a remedy of last resort. 
[normal]T
[normal]he pursuit of a judicial review case has meant that disabled people have been able to challenge decisions by public bodies which adversely affect their lives across a range of areas –
[normal] such as seeking redress against unlawful reduction in the support they get to live an independent life or against treatment that may result in arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 In some circumstances, notably in the absence of a statutory right of ap
[normal]peal, judicial review may be the only route through which a range of crucial statutory duties that local authorities have – such as, for instance, the duty to assess a disabled person who may be in need of community care services – are 
[normal]safeguarded
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3 
[normal]A
[normal] recent example of this was the use of judicial review by five disabled people to challenge the Government’s decision to close the Independent Living Fund (ILF). The ILF provides financial support to 
[normal]over 
[normal]19,
[normal]000 disabled people which enables
[normal] them to live 
[normal]i
[normal]ndependently 
[normal]in the community rather than move into residential care. In November of this year, the court of appeal ruled in 
[normal]favour of 
[normal]the five ILF cl
[normal]aimant
[normal]s and stated that 
[normal]there was insufficient evidence that the 'very grave impact' on some of those affe
[normal]cted by the closure of the ILF was properly brought to the Minister's attention, despite officials having been clearly informed of the possible impacts not only by service users but also by local authorities
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 
[normal]As a result of 
[normal]the ruling, the 
[normal]Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) confirmed that it had accepted the court’s decision and would not seek leave to appeal, and stated
[normal] that
[normal] 
[normal]“ministers will be invited to make a new decision on the future of the Independent Livin
[normal]g Fund based on further a
[normal]dvice…to 
[normal]make sure the equality duty is ade
[normal]quately adhered to”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 Given the vital importance of judicial review in preserving basic fundamental rights,
[normal] as demonstrated in the above case,
[normal] Scope would 
[normal]therefore 
[normal]strongly oppose any proposals whose effect would be to make it more difficult for disabled people to bring such claims. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6 The importance of judicial review should also be viewed in the context of the Governments
[normal] 
[normal]proposed reforms to social care. T
[normal]he Gov
[normal]ernment have committed to 
[normal]radically 
[normal]reforming the social care system, setting out the first legislative framework for adult social care in England through the Care Bill
[normal] which is
[normal] 
[normal]currently 
[normal]passing 
[normal]through 
[normal]Parliament. 
[normal]At a time of considerable change in the 
[normal]social care system,
[normal] 
[normal]it is likely that j
[normal]udicial review 
[normal]will be a crucial last resort for working age disabled people
[normal] 
[normal]in ensuring the new care system works as the Government intends. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.7 With regards the Government’s proposal to 
[normal]provide
[normal] an alternative, non-judicial mechanism for resolving disputes about whether public bodies have complied with the 
[normal]Public Sector Equality D
[normal]uty, 
[normal]Scope
[normal] endorse
[normal]s
[normal] the
[normal] views of the
[normal] Equality and Diversity Forum
[normal] (of which we are a member)
[normal] 
[normal]o
[normal]n this issue which are s
[normal]et out in a separate submission to this 
[normal]inq
[normal]uiry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Costs[bold] [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1 
[normal]The government 
[normal]is proposing
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]rebalancing of financial incentives so that providers are only paid for work carried out on judicial review cases where permission is granted, or exceptionally in the Legal Aid Agency’s discretion. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 This would mean that if a lawyer has started a 
[normal]judicial review claim, but it settles or is withdrawn before of a judge grants permission to carry on to a hearing
[normal], they should not be paid for the work they’ve done. A
[normal]ccording to the Ministry of Justice’s own impact assessment on the
[normal]ir proposed
[normal] reforms
[normal] to
[normal] judicial review
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]in 2012 over 40% of all applications
[normal] 
[normal]are withdrawn before a permission decision is made
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 Lawyers will therefore be deterred from bringing judicial review claims generally, even those with good prospects for success. Disabled people
[normal] will find it impossible to get legal advice and find someone to represent them in judicial review challenges and will therefore be left with no recourse to challenge unlawful decisions, leaving public authorities shielded away from legitimate challenges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 It is also important to note that even unsuccessful review applications can serve important functions: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“A good example is the recent Supreme Court decision in R (KM) v Cambridgeshire City Council. While the claimant failed in his challenge to the 
[normal]Council’s decision, the case provided the Supreme Court with the opportunity to set out detailed guidance for local authorities, building on earlier case law, in respect of the requirements of section 2(1) of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1
[normal]970, which is a provision of singular importance in the field of community care.” 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 Furthermore, p
[normal]roposals contained in the draft Care Bill
[normal] will mean that judicial review will be an even more crucial mechanism for disabled people to ensure they receive the support 
[normal]they need to live independently, as enshrined in Article 19 of the UNCRPD.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6 
[normal]T
[normal]he explanatory notes accompanying the Care Bill 
[normal]state that the
[normal] 
[normal]general duty of a local authority, in exercising a function in the case of an individual, is to promote that individual’s well-being.
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]here a local authority fail
[normal]s
[normal] to have regard to this principle, they may be challenged through judicial rev
[normal]iew.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 
[normal]However, 
[normal]the Government’s proposals to reform judicial review would essentially insulate public authorities 
[normal]from any legitimate challenges from disabled people who feel 
[normal]local authorities are not adequately promoting their “well-being” through the
[normal] social care system. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8 
[normal]It
[normal] is 
[normal]of course 
[normal]vital that the regulations accompanying the Care Bill around who is eligible for social care support are as clear and consistent as possible. 
[normal]As with any regulations, the eligibility criteria will be open to 
[normal]interpretation and therefore it
[normal] will be down to case law - not the Care Bill 
[normal]- to clarify the meaning of the 
[normal]criteria. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.9 
[normal]With regards the Government’s draft eligibility criteria, there is 
[normal]currently
[normal] 
[normal]significant 
[normal]uncertainty about what the regulations act
[normal]ually 
[normal]represent. In the 
[normal]Government
[normal]’s consultation document regarding the regulations
[normal], it
[normal] 
[normal]states 
[normal]the 
[normal]regulations 
[normal]are the equivalent of ‘substantial’ under
[normal] the current
[normal] FACS
[normal] criteria
[normal], whereas many local authorities believe the regulations are closer to ‘mode
[normal]rate’
[normal] FACS
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10 
[normal]Establishing new
[normal] regulations will therefore
[normal] 
[normal]likely result in 
[normal]a significant number of legal challenges
[normal] from disabled people who need support to live independently 
[normal]but are deemed ineligible for care. If the proposed changes to legal aid f
[normal]or judicial review cases go ahead, the burden of such legal uncertainty would largely be borne by disabled people who would find themselves being faced with even greater barriers in bringing such challenges.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation:[bold] Scope therefore calls on the Government not to proceed with any reforms to judicial review which would reduce the ability of disabled people to bring about such legal challenges against decisions by public bodies.
