"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Medical Schools Council and Association of UK University Hospitals response (AMR0006)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Medical Schools Council (MSC) represents the interests and ambitions of UK medical schools as they relate to the generation of national health, wealth and knowledge through biomedical research and the profession of medicine. The membership of the Medical Schools Council is made up of the Heads or Deans of the 33 UK undergraduate medical schools, plus the postgraduate London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Association of UK University Hospitals (AUKUH) is the key leadership body across the UK promoting the unique interests of University Hospitals. Its purpose is to represent the unique role and interests of UK University Hospital Trusts in the tripartite mission of service, teaching and research in partnership with other national bodies. There are currently 44 member Trusts.\n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to the Science and Technology Committee inquiry into antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In summary, we believe that:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere has been a significant rise in the problem of resistance in recent years, primarily among Gram negative bacteria (we would note that the problem in Gram positive bacteria has diminished slightly).  The principal explanation is the unrestricted use of antibiotics in hospitals, in the community and in animals. This is a result of a “vicious cycle” of increasing resistance needing the use of ever-more powerful antibiotics, which in turn drive the emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria.\n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreased globalisation has had a significant impact. Just as we are familiar with the idea that the huge increase in international travel can quickly spread transmissible infections around the world (witness the SARS outbreak as one of many examples), exactly the same thing happens at the level of antibiotic resistant bacteria. International travel (of people, animals and even foodstuffs) and issues such as “medical tourism” can easily spread Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) bacteria around the world.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOther drivers include:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are many fundamental questions that remain unanswered, in several domains:\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would note that in recent years there has been renewed interest in basic microbiology and immunology. There is much good work in these areas and more investment would be welcome to continue this. Similarly, there has been investment in research into the use of whole-genome sequencing to track the spread of resistant organisms, which has placed the UK at the forefront of such efforts globally. However, continued investment is needed before such approaches can become routine and there is scope for additional research into more effective molecular epidemiological and ecological approaches to track the emergence and spread of resistance, including culture-independent approaches and the transmission of resistant organisms through asymptomatic patients and the environment.\n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn contrast, the evidence base in intervention science (as noted above) is much weaker. Therefore, it is likely that there would be a bigger impact from increased resource in this area.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFundamental questions about clinical practice remain. For instance, how does duration of antibiotic therapy impact the emergence of resistance? Further emphasis on non-antibiotic based approaches would be very valuable. This would include anti-virulence or anti-pathogenicity approaches, and of course vaccine development.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important to acknowledge that a tension exists in the commercial development of new antibiotics. The pharmaceutical industry is often reluctant to commit the very considerable resources required to develop and launch a new antibiotic when:\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe indications are likely to be highly restricted because academia will insist that “new” antibiotics are reserved for a small number of difficult-to-treat or MDR organisms, and;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ninfections are usually relatively short lived so that the financial returns available from long term use of new drugs are not available.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf this difficulty is to be circumvented, then some innovative ideas will be necessary. It may be beneficial to consider the approach beginning to emerge in oncology, whereby costs are shared between the public and private sector. It is no coincidence that the number of novel antibiotic classes developed in recent years has slowed considerably. Stimulating academic/industrial consortia or collaborations in drug development in this area would be valuable.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe antibiotic stewardship and education are the key over-arching measures required. Together they describe a series of interventions which include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is unambiguously a global problem. There is clearly a major role for trans-national organisations such as European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organization, and we believe that they recognise the challenge.\n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK (in part through the prominent position taken by the Chief Medical Officer) has taken a leading role, but there is considerably more to do.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe advantages that we have in the UK as a result of a national health service have provided us with much experience and expertise that could usefully be “exported” to other countries that currently have a much less regulated (and therefore less tractable) system of health care. This includes many developed as well as less developed nations.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe credit the Government’s acknowledgment of the scale of the problem and the high priority that this issue has been given.\n&#xa0;7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe “7 key areas” for future action correctly identify the major elements of a strategy that must encompass both basic science as well as education.\n&#xa0;7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that the majority of the points identified in the 2013-18 strategy have been picked up in the comments above. However, we would argue that greater focus on ‘implementation science’ would be worthwhile. This is often of less interest to both academia and to funders because it rarely involves fundamental insights or novel hypotheses. However, experience shows that simple questions about how best to use antibiotics, when and for how long they should be given, how to incentivise doctors (and educate patients) to restrict antibiotic use and the like can often yield substantial benefits. A greater steer from Government to the National Institute for Health Research to prioritise these types of studies might pay significant dividends\n.&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nDavey P, Brown E, Charani E, Fenelon L,\n \nGould IM,\n \nHolmes A, Ramsay CR,\n \nWiffen PJ,Wilcox\n \nM.\n (2013)\n \n‘\nInterventions to improve\n \nantibiotic prescribing pr\nactices for hospital inpatients’\n \nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews\n, Issue 4.
