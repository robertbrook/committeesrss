"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Christopher Jessop (HOT14)&#xa0;\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nUK\n policy re \n“\nHeat\n” cannot be sensibly formulated \nunless it is co-ordinated from the start \nwith \npolicies relating to electricity generation and distribution\n; the \nUK\n cannot achieve its stated aims \nfor Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction \nunless the electricity grid is in \nfuture operated for the public good \nrather than run for maximum profit.\n  Furthermore, unless better prices are offered for electricity exported by \nhomes or businesses \ngenerating green electricity\n, more and more green electricity will end up being converted\n into heat, and not being “fed in”.\n  Biomass is probably best used as a petrochemical feedstock; \nany process which burns biomass and rejects significant quantities of waste heat should have its claimed carbon savings \nfactored downwards.  \nAll new houses sho\nuld have solar hot water systems installed.  \nAs ever, building \nfabric energy efficiency \nis \nthe weakest link.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
