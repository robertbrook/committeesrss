[normal]Written evidence from East Sussex Rail Alliance (TWR0002)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]House of Commons Transport Committee One-off evidence session on transport’s winter resilience: Christmas 2013 7th January 1440 Westminster.  About East Sussex Rail Alliance ESRA is an umbrella group comprising the four main volunteer operated rail user gr
[normal]oups in East Sussex. These are:
[normal]The group also works in close partnership with West Sussex Rail 
[normal]Users Association, Employers in Crawley and Brighton Line Commuters, East Sussex County Council, Eastbourne Borough Council, Rother District Council, Hastings Borough Council and the Local Chamber of Commerce across the area, representing over 50,000 rail 
[normal]users across the region. 
[normal]Agenda Subject 1: Select Committee Evidence[bold]: 
[normal]First up this week on our East Sussex Rail Alliance Agenda is the Evidence being sought by the Parliamentary Select Committee for Transport into the over-Christmas Gatwick Airport and 
[normal]Rail Services disruptions crisis. 
[normal]You maybe aware that Hastings and Bexhill which has a population of 140,000 combined when nearby rural areas are included was cut off for rail users for many days over Christmas. 
[normal]On behalf of ESRA and its East Sussex rai
[normal]l travelling stakeholder groups (from Brighton through to Rye), we wish to draw the attention of the Committee to the major disparity between Rail Franchise holders for the South East region, in particular Southern who responded well to the emergencies and
[normal] SouthEastern who failed to the point of complacency. www.eastsussexrail.org.uk 1 
[normal] East Sussex Rail Alliance Putting Sussex back on the map 
[normal]Here is a recap of what occurred over the late December and Christmas period -
[normal]22nd [bold]December[bold]: The SouthEastern Tra
[normal]in service from Hastings to London Charing Cross line became blocked to a landslip at Wadhurst 
[normal]24th December[bold]: Many services did not run but local bus operator Stagecoach Sussex ran their services across the county. Significantly however tickets were not t
[normal]ransferable from rail to bus as no reciprocal ticket arrangement had been set up. National Express also ran their two a day coach service to London. The Hastings line remained closed due to the landslip at Wadhurst. 
[normal]26th December[bold]: We contacted rail operat
[normal]ors to advise on their plans, taking into account the warning weather forecast 27th December. Southern Trains suggested services would be running after safety checks had taken place. However Network Rail took the decision to close South Eastern Train netwo
[normal]rk services until midday on 27th December. 
[normal]27th December Operations - SouthEastern Trains - Hastings-London [bold]1. This train operator did not make had failed to organise bus replacements even though Southern trains had booked buses for the Hastings to Ashfo
[normal]rd service. This is a much less used service in contrast to the Hastings to London services. 
[normal]2. This train operator did not make any effort to contact Stagecoach Sussex who did operate buses between Hastings and Tunbridge Wells on this day. Therefore dive
[normal]rted Rail Passengers travelling on their buses had to rebuy bus tickets. Then subsequently make Delay Repay Claims. 
[normal]Significant Planning Factor 1:[bold]It was the Southern Trains and South West Trains network that was most hit by the storms so it was something
[normal] of a surprise that Robin Gisby, Board Operations Director of Network Rail, closed the South Eastern Trains network until 1200, despite South Eastern Trains being the least affected. This was considered a huge misjudgment as many travellers and workers wer
[normal]e stranded in East Sussex and areas of Kent when many of their train lines were actually clear for safe running. 
[normal]Significant Planning Factor 2: [bold]Considering the Hastings line had been closed since 22nd December. SouthEastern Trains has failed to explain w
[normal]hy a fleet of buses had not been on standby as part of their Disaster Recovery Plan. 
[normal]Communications failure 1: [bold]South Eastern trains were showing on realtimetrains.co.ukand nationalrail.co.uk that services were running between Ashford International and Lo
[normal]ndon St Pancras at 0700 despite Network Rail's decision to keep that part of the network closed until 1200. 
[normal]Communications failure 2: [bold]The Twitter system and the resources working for South Eastern Train seemed unaware that there were trains running between Ashford International and London St Pancras until a passenger tweeted they were on board one of these trains. 
[normal]Rail Service resumptio[bold]n: [bold]The first South Eastern train to leave Hastings for Charing Cross was at 1231 hours on 27th December after no services for 5 days. 
[normal]ESRA experience of previous failures: [bold]This is not the first time South Eastern trains have been discovered not to have 
[normal]a working Disaster Recovery Plan. On several occasions during snow periods the train service between Hastings and London has not been operational, even cut off for weeks at a time, without bus replacements over extended period, despite Stagecoach Sussex ru
[normal]nning their buses. There appears no evidence of reciprocal arrangements between SouthEastern Trains and Stagecoach buses in East Sussex - in contrast to other areas such as Crawley with Metrobus and Brighton with the local bus firm and West Sussex with the
[normal] Stagecoach 700 Coastliner service. 
[normal]ESRA conclusions: [bold]We are unclear as to how this operator can be permitted consistently not to provide a Disaster Recovery Plan. Because of this deficiency Hastings and other areas of East Sussex and Kent were without r
[normal]ail transportation for days and sometimes weeks. 
[normal]While the train operator has an acclaimed performance on the High Speed services between Ashford International and London St Pancras, it appears that the whole performance of this train operator is aggregat
[normal]ed as one. Therefore we would request that the performance over this franchise is 
[normal]retrospectively analysed to deliver the real time and on time performance for the Hastings to London via Tunbridge Wells line so we can understand the seriousness of the serv
[normal]ice provided. 
[normal] 27th December Operations - Southern trains - Ashford-Hastings-London [bold]This train operator could not run a train service between Ashford and Hastings very early morning, but had replacement buses in place. The rail service was able to recomm
[normal]ence at 0700hours. This was also communicated through the Southern trains website, twitter and nationalrail.co.uk 
[normal]Southern Trains also started running from start of service from Hastings, Bexhill to Three Bridges where they had a fleet of buses to take cu
[normal]stomers to Coulsdon Town for connecting trains to London Victoria. 
[normal]Wadhurst landslip evidence [bold]We note that Network Rail does not have emergency access to the railway track along the Hastings Line.

[normal]House of Commons 
[normal]Dear Mr. He
[normal]ndry 
[normal]Re: Hastings Line services 
[normal]I’m writing to ask a small favour. I did leave a message with your office,but appreciate that its the holiday season. 
[normal]In brief, you will know that services have been disrupted on the Hastings Line since before Christmas as a result of a landslip near Wadhurst. 
[normal]Network Rail has worked hard to clear this but work has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions 
[normal]As a res
[normal]ult, I’m afraid a five mile per hour emergency speed restriction applies on the “up” line for around 150 metres and a 20 mph emergency speed restriction applies on the “down” line. This is causing a time loss of up to seven minutes (more on longer trains).
[normal] And on a busy network like ours, any delay of more than a few minutes can have a domino effect on other lines and services. 
[normal]Clearing the landslip requires extensive work but unfortunately, access to the site is being frustrated by the local land owner. N
[normal]etwork Rail is seeking legal powers to gain access, which unfortunately, takes time. 
[normal]Via Network Rail, we can give contact details for the landowner, and if you would be willing to have a quiet word, to emphasise the importance of our being able to operat
[normal]e punctual services once commuters return to work from 6 January, this would be much appreciated. 
[normal]If you need to discuss, please ask your office to give me a call. 
[normal]I have copied this email to other Hastings line MPs whose constituents will also be affect
[normal]ed by the landslip and to local rail user groups. 
[normal]Yours sincerely 
[normal]Mike Gibson 
[normal]Public Affairs Manager 
[normal]Southeastern 
[normal]ESRA - Proposed Questions [bold]              [bold]1/ South Eastern Train Operator and Network Rail should be asked to deliver specific on time statistics and real time statistics for the Hastings to London Charing Cross Line for the period of the current Franchise since inception. 
[normal]2/ Network Rail should 
[normal]be asked to explain their decision to close the South Eastern Network (and not South West or Southern Trains network) until 1200 on 27th December when the forecasts for weather highlighted that the storm pattern was more acute in Hampshire and West Sussex.
[normal] 
[normal]3/ Why did South Eastern Trains not provide any bus replacements on 27th December when other operators such as Southern, South West Trains, and Virgin Trains did. 
[normal]4/ If South Eastern Trains and Network Rail knew that Wadhurst had a landslip why did they
[normal] not have a replacement service buses on standby when Southern were able to resource buses in the same area for a train services on the Hastings to Ashford line that carries less passengers than the Hastings to Tunbridge Wells. 
[normal]Agenda SUBJECT 2: Failure t[bold]o uncover Real Time Performance [bold]ESRA is concerned that it appears that a smoke screen is being employed to prevent full transparency and therefore understanding of how punctuality of specific rail routes is accountable to the public. 
[normal]We now provide evide
[normal]nce (
[normal]item 2[bold]) by the ORR and Network Rail that suggests that a Freedom of Information request cannot be answered relating to the performance of the Hastings Lines. This appears to be hidden by Acts that overly prote
[normal]ct "
[normal]sensitive" commercial data. This respo
[normal]nse is to the detriment of passengers using the Hastings line who over the last four years have suffered poor weather disruption,even though fares on this line have increased hugely to pay for the High Speed line from Ashford that provides these same passe
[normal]ngers no benefit. 
[normal]Furthermore the neighbouring Wealden line in East Sussex which has an efficient performance operated by Southern Trains has commuter fares 30% cheaper for the equal distance from London. This Wealden line is suffering increasing overcrow
[normal]ding due to passengers migrating from the poor performing Hastings Line. This is compounded by the journey time from Hastings to London is over 1 hour 45 minutes for a 66 mile journey, affected by infrastructure constraints. 
[normal]Example Frant to London Bridge [bold]£106.50 (Hastings Line) per week versus Eridge to London Bridge £68.70 per week (Wealden Line)[bold] – exact same distance from London yet same distance from London Bridge and less than five miles apart. 
[normal]Item 2 [bold]REQUEST FOR INFORMATION REAL TIME DATA OUR REF Fo[bold]I 13-14/144 [bold]Freedom of Information request of ORR/Network Rail [bold]Real time Performance statistics of Hastings-Tonbridge-London and Hastings via Brighton lines - 2013 [bold]Further to our request to understand the performance in financial and operating terms of 
[normal]the franchise holders Southern and SouthEastern in particular, we make the further request to identify the performance over the past year on individual routes - specifically London-Tonbridge Hastings and London Victoria-Hastings (via London-Brighton Main L
[normal]ine) - as these are hidden in a blanket coverage of South East performance measures. 
[normal]ESRA evidence suggests that service performance in parts of each franchise area are being used to cover a wide disparity in the averages quoted. 
[normal]Thank you for your respo
[normal]nse thus far.

[normal]On behalf of East Sussex Rail Alliance 
[normal]From: contact. Date: Thu, 5 Dec 2013 15:56:34 +0000 
[normal]Dear Mr Tilden Smith 
[normal]I write further to your e-mail of 7 th November, requesting real time data for the current Southern and 
[normal]South Eastern train franchises and details of compensation payments paid by Network Rail to these franchises. 
[normal]I am handling your request under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FoIA 2000). 
[normal] From reading your request we suspect that you ac
[normal]tually require “right time data”, which is the number of trains arriving early or within 59 seconds of the planned arrival time. Real time refers to the information provided through station display boards, websites and apps, which give passengers informati
[normal]on on when trains are due to arrive/depart at the station. 
[normal]Right time data is published annually by ORR at a national level and by sector (London and South East, Long Distance and Regional), details can be found on our data portal at http://dataportal.orr
[normal].gov.uk/displayreport/report/html/2deb842d-35a2-464f-a076-090d54f02a1c 
[normal]Whilst we do hold right time data at a Train Operator and sub-operator level, I am sorry but I am unable to release the data. This information has been supplied by Network Rail and the
[normal] train operating companies, obtained through our economic functions and considered to be exempt from disclosure under s.44 of FoIA 2000 – prohibitions on disclosure. The s.44 exemption is an absolute exemption and is by virtue of the prohibition on disclos
[normal]ure of such information set out in s.145 of the Railways Act 1993. In broad terms ORR cannot publish information about a business (e.g. Network Rail, a TOC etc) that has been obtained in the exercise of our functions as an economic regulator. Indeed it is 
[normal]a criminal offence if such information is disclosed. 
[normal]Network Rail do however publish a right time moving annual average by individual train operator the end of each monthly operating period which can be found at http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about/performa
[normal]nce/. I would suggest that you contact Network Rail who may be able to supply you with more data for Southern and South Eastern: 
[normal]Mark Farrow 
[normal]Head of Transparency&amp; Business Ethics 
[normal]ORR does not hold information on compensation payments paid by Network Rail to train operators, and even if we did this information would be covered by the s.44 exemption. We would suggest contacting Network Rail for this information. 
[normal]Should you have any 
[normal]further queries regarding your request please contact me. If you are unhappy in any way in how I have handled your request, you have the right to ask for an internal review. Internal review requests should be submitted within two months of the date of this
[normal] e-mail and should be addressed to the Board Secretariat, at: 
[normal]Office of Rail Regulation 
[normal]One Kemble Street 
[normal]London 
[normal]If you are not content with the outcome of the review or how we have handled your request, you may apply directly to the Information Commissioner (IC) for a decision. Generally the IC cannot make a decision unless you have exhausted the complaints procedur
[normal]e provided by ORR. The IC can be contacted at:

[normal] As a key representative passenger/sta
[normal]keholder representative body, East Sussex Rail Alliance seeks your assistance in our uncovering particular Train Operators finances. 
[normal]As part of our research and investigation of the financial management of the existing Southern and Southeastern Trains fra
[normal]nchises ahead of the bids for the new ThamesLink/Great Northern/Southern franchise and the extension of the Southeastern Trains franchise, we are concerned to uncover the the Real Time Data for Current Performances. 
[normal]In view of the need for investment in t
[normal]he key routes -Brighton-London, Hastings-London, Hastings via Ashford- London - we are aware that Network Rail pays compensation to these Train Operators. However, we wish to establish the pattern of annual difference in cash terms that the Train Operators
[normal] are compensated by Network Rail and that paid over to the Travelling Public who suffer the delays to their travel. 
[normal]We are building the Business Case for the re-investment into these routes of a section of monetary resources which otherwise, we suspect, a
[normal]re merely added to the income stream of each the Train Operator. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Your assistance in helping us to the source this data will be much appreciated.
