[[[&#xa0;]]]1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; On 22 December 2010, the Work and Pensions Select Committee published the report ‘Changes to Housing Benefit announced in the 2010 Budget’. This set out the Committee’s recommendations in relation to the implementation of the reforms.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government provided its response to the report in March 2011, which the Committee published at:http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmworpen/845/84504.htm1.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The written evidence provides an update to the Committee on progress with the implementation of the Department’s reforms to support for housing costs. It seeks to address the individual lines of enquiry in which the Committee is particularly interested. &#xa0;2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are currently 5.1 million people in Great Britain in receipt of housing benefit. The housing benefit bill increased significantly over the past decade, by around 50 per cent in real terms. In 2012/13, estimated expenditure was £24 billion. If unreformed, expenditure on housing benefit would have been over £26 billion by 2014/15.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; As part of its fiscal consolidation programme, the Government has introduced a number of changes to housing benefit, which save over £2 billion by 2014/15. The first sections of this written evidence provide updates on:2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The next section covers the replacement of council tax benefit by council tax reduction schemes, designed and administered locally.2.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is then an update on the structural changes that replace housing benefit with the housing costs element of Universal Credit and a reformed scheme for pensioners. This includes the plans to protect vulnerable groups through managed payment of rent to landlords, and special arrangements for claimants in supported and temporary accommodation.2.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Finally, there is a section on support for home owners. This gives an update on support for mortgage interest and sets out the treatment of home owners in Universal Credit and the reformed scheme for pensioners.&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Reforms to Local Housing Allowance (LHA) introduced from April 2011 included setting the rates at the 30th percentile rather than the median of market rents, capping the maximum LHA rates, removing the 5-bed rate and no longer allowing claimants to retain any excess of up to £15 a week between their actual rent and the LHA rate.  From January 2012, the upper age limit for the LHA shared accommodation rate for single people without dependent children was raised from 25 to 35.3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For all these reforms, claimants had up to nine months’ transitional protection from their anniversary date, so only started to be affected between January 2012 and December 2012.  The Department is providing £40 million in Discretionary Housing Payments in 2013/14 to help people make the transition to the LHA reforms.3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department has commissioned an independent evaluation of the reforms, by a consortium led by Sheffield Hallam University. The interim report was published in May 2013:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monitoring-the-impact-of-changes-to-the-local-housing-allowance-system-of-housing-benefit-interim-report-rr-8383.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In April 2013, following the announcement made in the June 2010 Budget, increases in LHA rates were limited using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) of September 2012. Rates have been increased either by CPI inflation or to the 30th percentile of market rents, whichever is the lower.3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Chancellor announced in his Autumn Statement of 2012 that increases in LHA rates would be limited to 1 per cent in 2014/15 and 2015/16. As a result, most LHA rates will be increased in April 2014 and April 2015 either by 1 per cent or to the 30th percentile of market rents, whichever is the lower.  3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Chancellor also announced that 30 per cent of the forecast savings from this measure would be used as Targeted Affordability Funding to increase the LHA rates in some areas by more than 1 per cent, where rent increases are causing a shortage of affordable accommodation.3.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department intends to announce in the autumn how the funding will be targeted. This will take account of responses to the call for evidence that took place in July.&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Since April 2013, the removal of the spare room subsidy means that working-age tenants in the social sector receive housing benefit for the number of bedrooms their household needs, bringing the rules into line with the private sector.4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In December 2011, the Department announced the provision of £30 million per annum in Discretionary Housing Payments for 2013/14 and 2014/15 to help people make the transition to the change. Of this, £25 million per annum is specifically to help those living in significantly adapted accommodation who are affected by the measure.4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In July 2013, the Department announced further in-year funding of £35 million, again to help claimants with the transition to the change. This comprised:4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In total, the Department is providing £180 million of Discretionary Housing Payment funding in 2013/14 to cover all the welfare reforms, including ‘core’ funding of £20 million p.a.4.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department has commissioned an independent evaluation of the policy across Great Britain. The consortium is led by Ipsos MORI and includes the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report is due in 2015.&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Non-dependants are people who live in a benefit claimant’s household who are not dependant children, for instance adult children, other relatives and friends. It is a long-established principle of the benefit system that they should be expected to contribute towards the claimant’s housing costs. 5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the June 2010 Budget, the Chancellor announced a three-year staged increase in the rates of non-dependant deductions in housing benefit from April 2011. By April 2013, these increases brought the deduction rates to the level they would have been had they been increased each year since 2001 to broadly reflect growth in rents. 5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The housing benefit non-dependant deduction scheme is based on the age and circumstances of the non-dependant, and deductions are based on standard income-bands. The gross income of the non-dependant determines into which income band the non-dependant falls, and therefore the deduction that should be applied. There are a range of exemptions whereby a deduction does not apply. 5.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department estimates that around 350,000 non-dependants are living in households where deductions are made. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Government believes there has to be a limit to the amount of benefit entitlement for people who are not in work. 6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Phased implementation of a cap on benefits started on 15 April 2013 in Croydon, Bromley, Enfield and Haringey. National rollout in other local authorities began in July and August, with the expectation that all appropriate households will be capped by the end of September 2013. 6.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Applying the cap through housing benefit is an interim measure. In the longer term the Department will administer the cap as part of the Universal Credit system.6.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Latest figures show around 40,000 households are likely to be affected.6.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The most vulnerable, including war widows, those in the support group for Employment Support Allowance, and those with severe disabilities are exempt, as are households claiming Working Tax Credit. Those in supported exempt accommodation will have their housing costs disregarded from the cap calculation. 6.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There is a 39 week grace period for those who have been in work for 50 of the previous 52 weeks immediately preceding their last day of work.6.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department is working with local authorities to provide a wide range of labour market, housing and budgetary related support to help people adjust to the changes. It has contacted those likely to be affected well in advance of any change taking place so that they can access this support in good time. 6.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department is providing £65 million in Discretionary Housing Payments in 2013/14 to help those affected by the benefit cap. 6.9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An evaluation of the benefit cap operating under housing benefit will be published in autumn 2014.&#xa0;7.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Council Tax Benefit was abolished in April 2013 and replaced with council tax reduction schemes, designed and administered locally. Localisation means that authorities make decisions as to how they raise revenue through council tax, and gives them a bigger stake in delivering economic growth.7.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Council Tax reduction schemes will not form part of Universal Credit, and the award of a reduction will have no impact on a claimant's Universal Credit entitlement. However, the Department recognises that there are important interactions including impacts on work incentives.7.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department has worked with the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to ensure that local schemes in England can support improved work incentives. It has set out the key features of Universal Credit and how local authorities can apply a sensible means test to Universal Credit claimants in guidance and in the default scheme. The Department and DCLG are also working to deliver data sharing so that claimants do not have to provide the same information to local authorities that they have already provided to the Department for their Universal Credit claim.&#xa0;8.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For social sector renters, the housing costs element of Universal Credit  comprises rent and eligible service charges, less any impact from the removal of the spare room subsidy, less any housing cost contributions from non-dependants. For private sector renters, the housing costs element is the lower of actual rent and service charges or the appropriate Local Housing Allowance, less any housing cost contributions from non dependants.8.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Universal Credit contains a significant change of approach to the treatment of a contribution to their housing costs by non-dependants.  Instead of the current complex scale of deductions that rise with the non-dependant’s income there is a single flat rate of housing cost contribution which will apply, irrespective of income, to non-dependants aged 21 and over, where the person is either in work or there is an expectation that they should be working or can return to work.   A contribution will not be expected if the person is a carer, is responsible for a young child, or is in receipt of certain disability benefits.&#xa0;9.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Universal Credit will help claimants prepare for work. The Department has designed the payment arrangements to reflect those that apply to working people. Supporting people to manage their finances including paying their rent will ease the transition into paid work.  9.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are advantages in paying the housing costs element of Universal Credit direct to claimants, rather than as managed payments to landlords, the approach currently operating for most housing benefit claimants in the social rented sector. Direct payments encourage people to manage their own budget in the same way as other households. However, the Department also recognises the importance of stable rental income for social landlords, which supports them to deliver new homes. It has developed Universal Credit in a way that protects landlords’ financial position.9.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In summer 2012, the Department established six direct payment demonstration projects to test how monthly payments of support for housing costs paid directly to most claimants will work in Universal Credit. They will run until the end of 2013.9.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Evidence from the projects indicates that most people will be able to cope with managing a monthly budget and paying their rent. However, the Department recognises that this is a significant change and that some people will need support, including budget management. A proportion of claimants will require alternative arrangements, including managed payment of rent to the landlord.9.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Managed payments to landlords are part of the personal budgeting support process at three ‘touch points’ within the Universal Credit claim:9.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Working closely with the housing sector, the Department will continue to feed learning from the demonstration projects and the Universal Credit Pathfinder into the development of Universal Credit and the support frameworks that claimants may need. The Department will consider what else might be done to address persistent underpayment of rent, balanced against the importance of keeping the system simple and efficient to administer. One of the main emerging messages is that social landlords need to engage as early as possible with their tenants in order to help prepare them for the change. &#xa0;10.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the short term, the Department will continue to provide help towards the housing costs of those living in supported exempt accommodation outside Universal Credit, through housing benefit. As a result, support for housing costs will remain as a managed payment to the landlord. The Department has made regulations giving powers to pay housing benefit and Universal Credit together.10.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For the longer term, the Department is discussing with stakeholders the feasibility of a localised solution. This is a challenging reform but the Government is committed to supporting vulnerable, older and disabled people to lead independent and active lives in the community rather than their living in more institutionalised care. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]11.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Universal Credit claimants housed in temporary accommodation will receive their housing support as part of their Universal Credit. It will be based on the appropriate Local Housing Allowance rate for the household and will be subject to the benefit cap. 11.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It is unlikely that there will be significant numbers of claimants on Universal Credit entering temporary accommodation in the current financial year. The Department does not therefore intend to issue additional guidance or funding to local authorities for 2013/14.11.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For 2014/15, the Department is developing guidance for the treatment of Universal Credit claimants in temporary accommodation, which it intends to publish later this year. 11.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department intends to contribute to the extra costs of providing temporary accommodation for Universal Credit claimants in 2014/15. There will be a single national rate of payment for management fees of £45 a week.&#xa0;12.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For the time being, housing benefit claimants who have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit will continue to receive housing benefit, and those who receive the Guarantee element of Pension Credit will continue to receive maximum support with their rent, subject to any deductions for non-dependants. 12.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Welfare Reform Act 2012 allows for the introduction of a new element of Pension Credit, the Housing Credit, to provide support for rent. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]13.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Chancellor announced in his Autumn Statement of 2012 that the support for mortgage interest (SMI) temporary measures of a shorter 13 week waiting period and a higher £200,000 capital limit for working age claimants will be extended until the end of March 2015.13.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Universal Credit retains the principle of protecting home owners from repossession as far as practicable. The housing costs element for owners is a standard rate of interest on the outstanding loan up to a set capital limit. There is a qualifying period before claimants are entitled to help.13.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There are some changes in Universal Credit from the scheme for legacy benefits:13.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department will continue to make managed payments of support for mortgage interest to the lender if the lender is part of the Mortgage Interest Direct (MID) scheme.13.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Department envisages that the reformed scheme for meeting the housing costs of pensioners will treat home owners in a broadly similar way to Universal Credit.13.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the longer term, the Department intends to move to a system of loans rather than non-recoverable benefits for supporting the housing costs of home owners.20 September 2013&#xa0;
