What can be done?\n              \n6\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.  Overall summary \n&#xa0;\nIt is clear that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has (quite predictably) led to a significant expansion of the scope of matters subject to EU law and a corresponding diminution of the autonomy of Member States, to the \njudicialisation\n of matters which are properly the subject of decision by democratically elected and accountable politicians, and to increased unpredictability in the law. The so-called “opt-out” Protocol No 30 relating to the UK and Poland is (again predictably) not worth the paper it is written on.\n&#xa0;\n2.  Legal effects of the Charter \n&#xa0;\nIt is claimed that the Charter did not give rise to any new rights. It is true that many (but not all) Articles of the Charter were based on pre-existing provisions; either Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights or its Protocols, or individual subordinate measures such as (for example) the Data Protection Directive.\n&#xa0;\nHowever, the Charter has significantly enhanced the effective force of these rights and elevated their status. First, it has collected them together and labelled with the special status of “fundamental rights”.  Secondly, in \nconsequence of Art 6(1) TEU as amended by the Lisbon Treaty giving the Charter “the same legal value as the Treaties”, the rights under the Charter are far more readily deployable in particular when they are used to strike down or invalidate legislative measures both at the EU level and at national level.  Since the content of the rights is generally extremely vague, the effect of this is a very substantial expansion of discretionary and effectively political decision-making by judges.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Effect of the Charter on EU instruments \n&#xa0;\nThe most obvious and direct effect of the Charter is on decisions of EU institutions, and in particular on legislation (directives and regulations).  It is wrong to assume that the effect of the Charter in this context is merely to inhibit EU organs: it demonstrably can have effects on Member States by expanding the scope of EU law and thereby diminishing the autonomy of Member States.\n&#xa0;\nIn Case C-236/09 \nAssociation \nBelge\n des \nConsommateurs\n Test\n&#x2011;\nAchats\n ASBL and Others v \nConseil\n des \nministres\n (Grand Chamber, 1st March 2011) the Court ruled that it would become unlawful as from 21 Dec 2012 for insurance companies to charge different premiums to customers based on gender.  Many categori\nes of insurance were affected, \nbut amongst those most obviously adversely affected were young women drivers who in general have a lower accident rate than young males, and male annuitants who will receive a lower annuity rate than previously if their death risk must be \"pooled\" with that of female annuitants.\n&#xa0;\nDirective 2004/113 \"implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services\" was adopted under Art 13(1) of the EC Treaty.  This Treaty Article required the unanimous consent of \nall\n Member States in order for the Directive to be adopted.\n&#xa0;\nThe Directive required in general terms that there should be no direct or indirect discrimination in pricing of\n goods and services.  However, \nin the case of insurance premiums, the general provisions of the Directive were subject to a specific derogation in Article 5(2), which provided that Member States \"may decide before 21 December 2007 to permit proportionate differences in \nindividuals' premiums and benefits where the use of sex is a determining factor in the assessment of risk based on relevant and accurate actuarial and statistical data.\"\n&#xa0;\nAs a result of a challenge brought by a Belgian consumer organisation\n, the\n \nECJ ruled that the derogation contained in Art 5(2) is invalid, because:\n&#xa0;\n\"32.      Such a provision, which enables the Member States in question to maintain without temporal limitation an exemption from the rule of unisex premiums and benefits, works against the achievement of the objective of equal treatment between men and women, which is the purpose of Directive 2004/113, and is incompatible with Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter [of Fundamental Rights].\"\n&#xa0;\nIn consequence,\n the ECJ voided Art 5(2) with effect from 21 Dec 2012. The decision is based on the fact that the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Before Lisbon,  the ECJ could (and did) use the Charter as an interpretative tool but its use to strike down a provision of EC legislation such as Art 5(2) of this Directive is based on the fact that the status of the Charter was elevated to Treaty level by Lisbon.\n&#xa0;\nThis is an infringement of the sovereign rights of the Member States who agreed the Directive.  Directive 2004/113 was agreed to as a package by all Member States.  To some, the inclusion of the derogation in Art 5(2) was an essential precondition to agreeing to the Directive.  However, the effect of the ECJ's judgment is to strike out part of the agreed package, so fundamentally altering the balance in the insurance sector from what was agreed and imposing one particular view point on Member States who did not agree to it. Removing the derogation has the effect of extending the scope of the other provisions of the Directiv\ne, so extending the scope of EU\n law.\n&#xa0;\nThis is an example of unbridled judicial policy-making at the expense of democratic processes.  It cannot be said that it is \na priori\n obvious that a general principle against discrimination on the grounds of sex is violated by the provision of insurance services where premiums are adjusted on a statistical basis to reflect the sex of the insured among other factors.  Indeed, it can validly be argued that the cross subsidisation of higher risk individuals (such as young \nmale drivers) by lower risk individuals caused by a prohibition on premiums differentials is itself unfair and discriminatory.\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of the specific policy argument, the remarkable effect of this judgment is the transfer of the power to take the decision from democratically accountable politicians to judges.\n&#xa0;\nIt cannot now be assumed that successfully negotiating an opt\n&#x2011;\nout\n or derogation within EU legislation will be the end of the matter.  What can be successfully agreed at the political level can be undone by the ECJ.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. Effect of the Charter on the Member States \n&#xa0;\nArticle 51(1) of the Charter states that it applies to the Member States “only when \nthe are\n implementing Union law.” This means that it cannot be invoked when no element of EU law or policy at all is involved.  However, EU law now covers a very broad field of activities indeed and (again predictably) this phrase has been expansively rather than restrictively interpreted.\n&#xa0;\nAs other witnesses have already noted, the Supreme Court in \nRFU v Consolidated Information Services Ltd (formerly \nViagogo\n Ltd)\n [2012] UKSC 55 indicated that the Charter is applicable when a court in the UK makes an order involving the disclosure of personal data.  The proceedings themselves need have nothing to do with the EU or EU law, and the gateway for the application of the Charter is the Data Protection Directive which applies to almost any disclosure of “personal data”, defined as any data about a living individual who can be identified.\n&#xa0;\nIn my evidence to this Committee on 13 September 2004 I expressed the concern that “\nunder existing ECJ jurisprudence it is likely that the Charter will be applicable to member states not only when they are actually applying Union law but also when they are seeking to take advantage of an exception or derogation from the scope of a generally applicable principle or rule.\n”\n&#xa0;\nI think that this concern has been fully borne out by the way in which Article 51(1) of the Charter has been interpreted.  Indeed, the presence of even a peripheral or tangential element of EU law is quite sufficient to justify the \napplication of the Charter, as demonstrated in Case C\n&#x2011;\n617/10 \nÅklagaren\n v Hans \nÅkerberg\n \nFransson\n 26 February 2013.  The fact that some elements of substantive tax law are harmonised by VAT directives in my view in no way justifies the expansion of EU law to cover the general procedures by which Member States enforce the payment of taxes.  This case in my view is nothing short of a naked grab of territory by the ECJ.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. Protocol No 30 \n&#xa0;\nI regret that I am not in the least surprised by the total \ninutility\n of this Protocol.  The only surprising\n thing is the extent to which it\n was apparently thought in some circles that this Protocol would have some substantive effect in curtailing the way in which the Charter would affect the UK and Poland.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6. What can be done? \n&#xa0;\nCurtailing the effects of the Charter, once the judges of the ECJ (and indeed national courts) have got used to using it as an instrument, is an extremely difficult task.  As part of its renegotiation of terms of membership with the EU, the UK could request that the Charter cease to apply in respect of the UK at all.  \nHowever,\n and even making the assumption that other Member States would agree to this course, it would probably be necessary also to adopt flanking measures to prevent its indirect application via judicial doctrines such as that of general principles which are common to the Member States.\n&#xa0;\nThis leads to the conclusion that the only effective way of curtailing the use of the Charter as an instrument for expanding EU competences is to ensure that the courts of the United Kingdom, and those courts alone, are responsible for ensuring the compliance of the authorities with fundamental rights.  In this regard, it should not be an excuse or a defence to say that the authorities are acting in pursuance of an obligation arising from EU law.  This outcome might be effectively achieved by a restructuring of the European Communities Act 1972.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2013\n5"
