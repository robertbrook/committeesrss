default 3. defaultWhat should defaultthe BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?default&#xa0;defaultPublic service broadcasting refers to TV programmes that are broadcast for the public benefit rather than for purely commercial purposes.
default (Ofcom)
defaultThe BBC’s founders believed that broadcasting could make the world a better place. Public intervention would ensure that its astonishing creative power– to enrich individuals with
default knowledge, culture and information about their world, to build more cohesive communities, to engage the people of the UK and the 
defaultwhole globe in a new conversation about who we are and where we are going – would be put to work to the sole benefit of the pu
defaultblic.
default4. defaultHow well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?default&#xa0;
defaultIn 
defaultdeveloping (and reviewing) the purpose remit for bringing the UK to the world and the
default 
defaultworld to the UK, the Trust must, amongst other things, seek to ensure that the BBC—
defaultmakes people in the UK aware of international issues and of the different culturesdefault defaultand defaultviewpoints of people living outside the UK through news and current affairs anddefault defaultother outputs such as drama, comedy, documentaries, educational output and sportsdefault defaultcoverage; defaultand
default 
defaultbrings high-quality international news coverage to international audiences.
default 
default5.  defaultAre the public purposes in the current Charter thedefault right ones? How might they change?default&#xa0;default6.  defaultWhat scope, scale and remit should the BBC have? default7.default   defaultShould the BBC’s output and defaultservices be provided to any greater or lesserdefault defaultdegree for particular audiences? default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default‘politicians and the public decided very early on that broadcasting should be plac
defaulted in the public sphere of our national life. They believed that everyone has a right to high quality broadcast services, regardless of income, age, sex, race, religion or where they live. This is why the BBC was founded according to three public principle
defaults which are common to many other staples of the nation’s public life – the UK’s public health and education systems, our public parks, our museums and libraries
default.
default 
default8.  defaultWhat balance should be struck in what the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally adefaultnd leaves entirely to others to create?default&#xa0;default9.   defaultHow have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an adequate return for defaultlicence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?default10.  defaultWhat role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of distributing content?defaultPaying for vulnerable users to switch to digital TV appears to us to be the responsibility of government rather than the BBC. It is part of the nation’s social and cultural policy rather than a responsibility of a single broadcaster. 
defaultNot only will other b
defaultroadcasters, including those with very limited public service obligations, benefit from such schemes; but it will also mean diverting licence fee income, contributed by citizens to run the BBC, rather than using general taxation, which is paid in order to 
defaultsupport, among other things, infrastructure development and social welfare.
default&#xa0;default11. defaultHow should the BBC be funded beyond 2016? default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default12. defaultIs there a case for distributing funding for public service content moredefault defaultwdefaultidelydefault?default13. defaultWhat comparisons can be made with the provision of public service content in other countries? defaultThis is 
defaultwhy PBS, the sole American public service television
default 
defaultbroadcaster, is a marginal broadcaster showing minority programmes in which
default 
defaultcommercial television has no interest. It achieves a primetime viewing share of less
default 
defaultthan 2%1. US television is essentially com
defaultmercial, funded either by advertising or by
default 
defaultsubscription.
default&#xa0;
default14. defaultHow should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?default15. defaultIn a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for tdefaulthe BBC?defaultIBT supports the constitutional framework of a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary of State.
