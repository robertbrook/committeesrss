[[[Summary]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]The Royal Consent procedures currently operating in the legislative process have become an anachronism today and redundant of any practical public purpose beyond royal ceremony. Over time a number of negative attributes associated with the procedures have arisen, among them time and cost factors for officials and legal advisers, and press speculation over unjustified royal intervention in the legislative process. It is in everyone's interests that the Royal Consent procedures are withdrawn.&#xa0;

[[[The ]]]

[[[rules and procedures]]]

[[[ of the Royal Consent]]]&#xa0;01              The consent of the Queen or the Prince of Wales where applicable must be sought, granted and communicated to both Houses of Parliament, whenever a matter touching on the royal prerogative or Crown property is affected, most notably the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.&#xa0;02              The substance of the Royal Consent is an agreement to the proposed legislation being considered and debated in each House of Parliament, not that the Queen or the Prince of Wales's where applicable necessarily agrees or supports the content of the measure itself.&#xa0;03              The Royal Consent is exercised automatically on the advice of ministers.  &#xa0;04              Current practice is that the Private Secretary of the Bill's sponsoring Minister sends a letter to the Private Secretary of the Queen or Prince of Wales as appropriate setting out how the prerogative or their property interests would be affected, together with copies of the Bill.  In the preparation of this letter the advice of Parliamentary Counsel is taken who in turn takes advice from the Public Bill offices in the House of Commons and House of Lords.&#xa0;05              Under Cabinet Office guidelines, copies of this letter are sent to the Queen's solicitors, Messrs Farrer &amp; Co. in Lincoln's Inn, who advise the Royal Household, the Clerk to the Council of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Secretary to the Duchy of Cornwall on the implications of relevant Bills affecting royal interests.&#xa0;06              The Royal Consent is then communicated back to the sponsoring department by letter, and is communicated onwards to the Commons and Lords by a minister in each House respectively who is also a member of the Privy Council at an appropriate stage of the Bill.  &#xa0;

[[[The legal authority for the Royal Consent]]]&#xa0;07              The legal authority for the requirement for Royal Consent is simply parliamentary usage existing since time immemorial.  It is part of "the law and custom of Parliament", not common law or statute.  This means that it is within the power of each House to determine the existence and process of the Royal Consent.  &#xa0;08              This legal fact is commonly misunderstood or tends to be obscured because the bulk of the communications involved are carried out by or for Ministers of the Crown and the Royal Household.  No doubt government and royal officials may feel some sense of ownership of the whole process, because it is they who are doing much of the work and it is a Privy Counsellor who communicates the Royal Consent to Parliament. &#xa0;09              Whether or not the content of a Bill does in fact affect the royal prerogative or the property interests of the Crown or Duchies of Lancaster or Cornwall is a matter for the ultimate judgement of the House authorities in Parliament, meaning in practice the Public Bill offices in the Commons and Lords acting in collaboration.&#xa0;10              Similar processes for Royal Consent operate in the legislative proceedings of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales. In each case this operates under the authority of standing orders required by the Scotland Act 1998 and Government of Wales Act 2006. &#xa0;

[[[Arguments for and against repeal]]]&#xa0;11              The case for maintaining the Royal Consent is simply ceremonial, forming part of the public theatre surrounding the monarchy today, enjoyed by many.  It is part of the wide-ranging conventional courtesies owed to the Queen and Prince of Wales, supporting their dignity and national memories of the historical traditions of monarchy from centuries past when they presided over the operation of the state in all its forms, executive, legislative, and judicial.  Politically, the Royal Consent could be viewed as a harmless anachronism.&#xa0;12              However, there are negative aspects to the Royal Consent.  Firstly, there is an apparent conflict of interest in the Queen and Prince of Wales being involved in legislative decisions affecting the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall respectively, since they derive benefits from these Crown properties.  This is not to suggest that in reality they ever do seek to influence or block any such legislative measures, but the fact that the present situation provides the opportunity for them to do so creates the public appearance of bias in the law-making process and feeds criticism of the monarchy and cynicism about its neutrality in our public life.&#xa0;13              Secondly, there is a cost factor in maintaining this system of Royal Consent.  It is difficult to quantify this in terms of time taken or financial calculation of the support services provided, but it involves an extensive reading of documentation and letter writing by officials in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, the Clerks of Legislation in both Houses of Parliament, the Queen's Private Secretary at Buckingham Palace, and liaison with the Queen's Solicitors, Messrs Farrer &amp; Co. &#xa0;14              Thirdly, the requirement for Royal Consent is a procedure that can be manipulated by the government to sabotage a Private Members' Bill of which is disapproves.  A government is perfectly capable of killing off any legislative proposal of which it disapproves, by using its majority to vote down the measure at second reading, or more likely by depriving it of the necessary parliamentary time to make progress.  But to use the Royal Consent as a procedural device for this end, perhaps to circumvent government intra-party dissent that might embarrass ministers, could be seen as an unconstitutional misuse of process.  &#xa0;15              There is also an inherent danger that a misguided future Monarch or Prince of Wales holding strong moral views on the subject-matter of a Bill covered by the Royal Consent procedure might believe he or she is entitled to impose his opinion on the matter.  No one imagines the Queen would intervene in this way, but constitutional arrangements governing hereditary public offices should provide for whatever types of personality might succeed by accident of birth. &#xa0;

[[[Royal Consent and Royal Assent contrasted]]]&#xa0;16              It is instructive to compare and contrast the Royal Consent taking place during the legislative process with the Royal Assent taking place after the Bill has completed all its parliamentary stages.  The Royal Assent as a requirement before a Bill becomes law is a common law prerogative power, and its personal exercise is unchallengeable judicially or otherwise.  It is therefore a formidable legal power in the hands of the Monarch personally.  However, as it well known, there has been no withholding of such Assent (otherwise known as a Royal Veto) since 1707 when Queen Anne refused the Scotch Militia Bill.  In practice, this power has become obsolete, and its exercise today would be tantamount to a rejection of parliamentary authority, together with the government, and would almost certainly precipitate a forced abdication and/or the monarchy's replacement by a presidency.  &#xa0;17              By contrast the Royal Consent has no common law or statutory basis, and is essentially a matter of parliamentary custom.  But despite its minimal status as law, it carries potentially much greater political significance than Royal Assent.  This is because it provides the Monarch and Prince of Wales with advance notice of what is being proposed by the government, and therefore the opportunity to express an opinion on the matter and exert pressure on the government in the event that he or she disagrees.  Even though the Queen's and Prince's spokesmen have rebutted press speculation that any such pressure has been brought in the past, the existence of the Consent procedure is bound to continue arousing unwelcome suspicions of Prince Charles' involvement in matters of public policy and government affairs.&#xa0;

[[[Keeping the Queen and Prince informed]]]&#xa0;18              It is a principle of natural justice and good governance that bodies affected, or likely to be affected, by government legislative proposals should be consulted and given the opportunity to express opinions.  There is nothing objectionable per se about the Queen or the Prince being consulted on matters affecting the interests of the Crown and royal family, and indeed ministers should welcome their views.  &#xa0;19              However the privileged and formal process of Royal Consent forming an essential element in parliamentary proceedings is unnecessary for this. There are already national processes of public consultation where property matters affecting the public at large, including the royal Duchies, are concerned.  It might be courteous for a government department to give the Queen's or Prince's offices notice of pending policy decisions that significantly affected the Crown estates or the royal Duchies, but this does not justify what is effectively a scrutiny reserve and power of veto over parliamentary proceedings on a Bill.  And on matters of state where the prerogative might be concerned, it is already generally accepted that the royal Head of State "has, under a constitutional monarchy as ours, three rights - the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn", and a dialogue of this kind takes place every week at the Queen's prime ministerial meetings.  &#xa0;

[[[Conclusion: implementing the change]]]&#xa0;20              If agreement were reached that the Royal Consent should be abolished, then so far as the UK Parliament is concerned, because the existing requirement is founded on parliamentary usage, not common law or statute, removal of the need for Consent could be implemented by a simple motion put and resolution passed to this effect in each House of Parliament.  &#xa0;21              The statutory provisions and standing orders providing for the Royal Consent in the legislative proceedings of the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly of Wales are expressed to apply to "a Bill containing provisions which would, if the Bill were a Bill for an Act of Parliament, require" such Consent.  The effect of this is that were the UK Parliament to remove the requirement for Royal Consent, the similar requirements in these two devolved legislatures would lapse.&#xa0;1 November 2013&#xa0;* PhD, LLD, Professor of Constitutional Law, King's College London; author of The Crown and Royal Family in Halsbury's Laws of England (vol. 12(1), 1998), King and Country: Monarchy and the Future King Charles III (2006), "The Royal Assent to Legislation and a Monarch's Fundamental Human Rights" in Public Law (2003, p.205), "Monarchy and the Personal Prerogatives" in Public Law (2004, p546), and "Queen Elizabeth II and the Evolution of the Monarchy" Ch. 10 in The British Constitution: Continuity and Change (ed. Qvorup, 2013).  In this memorandum, the Queen's and/or Prince of Wales' Consent to legislation is referred to as the Royal Consent. The need for the Prince of Wales' consent is limited to provisions affecting the Duchy of Cornwall of which he is Duke, his role as Prince and Steward of Scotland, and matters arising that affect his titles or interaction with the Royal Household: see Office of Parliamentary Counsel, Queen's or Prince's Consent, 2012, chapter 3.  This is endorsed by recent public statements: "It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by Parliament to provide consent to those Bills which Parliament has decided would affect Crown interests. The Sovereign has not refused consent to any Bill affecting Crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers" (Buckingham Palace spokesman); "In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any Bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, unless advised to do so by ministers.  Every instance of the Prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record" (Clarence House spokesman): quoted in the Guardian, 15 January 2013. Generally see the guidelines on the Queen's and Prince's consent published by the Cabinet Office: Guide to Making Legislation (2013) and Queen's or Prince's Consent (Office of Parliamentary Counsel, 2012). It is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this private firm of Solicitors. In current practice, this is normally at Third Reading in the House of Commons, and at Second Reading in the House of Lords.  Although in practice it is usually the minister who announces the Royal Consent, any Member of the Commons or Peer in the Lords may communicate the Royal Consent so long as they are a member of the Privy Council. On the nature of parliamentary procedure, see Robert Blackburn &amp; Andrew Kennon, Parliament: Functions, Practice &amp; Procedures (2nd ed., 2003), pp. 247-253. This legal fact is recognised by the senior legal adviser in the process, the office of Parliamentary Counsel, whose guidance states, "The decision on whether consent is required is for the House authorities" (p.1, para. 1.3) and "The issue of consent is entirely a matter of House procedure" (p.17). Section 22, paragraph 7 of schedule 3 of the Scotland Act 1998 and section 111(4) of the Government of Wales Act 2006. It is unclear who underwrites the legal fees charged for the involvement of this private firm of Solicitors. Procedurally such backbench Bills can be introduced on a motion without first going through Royal Consent though subsequently they need normal approval to progress: an example of this where Consent was refused was the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill, 1998-99, Commons Hansard, 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147 (Tam Dalyell). An apparent example of this was the withholding the Royal Consent to the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill, 1998-99, Commons Hansard, 26 January 1999, cols. 145-147, presented by Tam Dalyell. Except in the case of Scottish and Welsh legislation: see para. 10 above. "It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by Parliament to provide consent to those Bills which Parliament has decided would affect Crown interests.  The Sovereign has not refused consent to any Bill affecting Crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers" (Buckingham Palace); "In modern times, the Prince of Wales has never refused to consent to any Bill affecting Duchy of Cornwall interests, unless advised to do so by ministers.  Every instance of the Prince's consent having been sought and given to legislation is a matter of public record" (Clarence House): quoted in the Guardian, 15 January 2013.
