[normal]1.
[normal]              
[normal]After a significant career break to bring up three children I anticipated that it would be unlikely I could secure a new position
[normal] wit
[normal]hin the chemical industry which would be both flexible enough to fit with my family, but also at 
[normal]a similar level
[normal] to that
[normal] which
[normal] I had previously achieved. However, whilst considering my options I became aware of the 
[normal]Daphne Jackson Trust[bold], which aims to help 
[normal]scientists return to their careers following a break, at an appropriate level, and with flexible part-time working.

[normal]              
[normal]After investigating this enormously valuable opportunity more fully, I approached Huddersfield University as a potential host, and submit
[normal]ted a full application. After submitting a peer reviewed proposal and interview,   I was delighted to be appointed a Daphne Jackson Research Fellow earlier this year. The Trust secured funding on my behalf, partly from the University of Hu
[normal]ddersfield, and p
[normal]artly from
[normal] the
[normal] EPS
[normal]RC.

[normal]I would like to submit evidence to this Government 
[normal]inquiry into women in STEM careers because I want to emphasise how valuable the Daphne Jackson Trust has been to me. Without this opportunity, it would have been highly unlikely I 
[normal]would have returned to a career i
[normal]n s
[normal]cience, partly because of the decline in the Pharmaceutical Industry of late
[normal] (and thus the number of positions for chemists has reduced significantly)
[normal], and partly because after such a long career break I would not be con
[normal]fident of applying for a position for which I am qualified. In addition, the flexibility in working and part time hours
[normal] 
[normal]means that I can fit my career around my personal life. Fellows are given support in their return to work, in the form of (re)- training
[normal] courses, and by being given a mentor. The position is for two years and I am confident that on completion of the Fellowship I will be in a position to return to my STEM career.
