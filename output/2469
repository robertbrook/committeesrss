[normal]Written evidence submitted by the [bold]National Housing Federation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]We support the 
[normal]concept of 
[normal]Universal Credit and 
[normal]its 
[normal]potential 
[normal]to
[normal] ensur
[normal]e
[normal] that people are better off in work by reducing benefit withdrawal rates. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]the 
[normal]National Housing 
[normal]Federation has several concerns 
[normal]regarding the reforms
[normal], primarily because households do not have a genuine choice to have the housing element of 
[normal]U
[normal]niversa
[normal]l 
[normal]C
[normal]redit paid directly to their landlord. Many tenants would elect to do this to avoid going into 
[normal]arrears
[normal]. We are also concerned that the 
[normal]cumulative impact of 
[normal]benefit cuts 
[normal]means that households 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]cannot afford 
[normal]to 
[normal]cover the most basic costs of 
[normal]feeding their family
[normal], 
[normal]keeping their home warm
[normal] and paying their rent at the same time
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Our response focuses on the case for abolishing the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Our recent ComRes poll shows that public opinion is shifting against the social 
[normal]sec
[normal]tor 
[normal]size criteria with 59% in support of Bedroom Tax repeal, up from 51% in April
[normal]. In addition, 87% agree that those who need a spare room for sick or disabled family members should be exempt from the policy. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]We also outline a number of 
[normal]measures tha
[normal]t 
[normal]w
[normal]ould 
[normal]ensure the 
[normal]roll out of Universal Credit 
[normal]reduces the risk of tenants going into 
[normal]debt 
[normal]and protects social 
[normal]landlord
[normal]s’ revenue streams
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]To ensure we have information on the
[normal] long-term
[normal] impact of 
[normal]the Government’s welfare reforms
[normal], the Federation 
[normal]has 
[normal]commissioned Ipsos MORI to survey housing associations in autumn 2013 with a large scale tenants’ survey in 
[normal]early 
[normal]2014. 
[normal]We would be happy to share the 
[normal]results with the Committee in due course. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2[bold]              [bold]The best way to get [bold]the [bold]housing benefit bill down[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]rise in the housing benefit bill
[normal] in recent years
[normal] is a result of higher unemployment, stagnating 
[normal]low 
[normal]wages and rising rent levels in the private rented sector. The consequence is that, of every £1 of government expenditure on housing, 95p is spent on housin
[normal]g benefit and only 5p on building new homes
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: the 
[normal]most effective way of redressing the balance and reducing the housing benefit bill is 
[normal]to 
[normal]build more affordable homes. Government investment in new affordable homes not only helps tackl
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]our growing housing crisis, but also has a fundamental role to play in:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3[bold]              [bold]Impact o[bold]f welfare [bold]reform o[bold]n rent arrears [bold]and empty homes[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]In 
[normal]autumn
[normal] 2012, 84% of housing associations believed that their rent arrears would increase 
[normal]as a direct result of 
[normal]the 
[normal]welfare changes
[normal] (taking into account direct payments, 
[normal]the social size criteria and the benefit
[normal] cap)
[normal]. The average increase 
[normal]in arrears 
[normal]expected was 51%
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]At the end of 2012, 
[normal]housing association arrears stood at 5.1% (£572m)
[normal]. If a 51% increase in arrears was realised
[normal] across the sector
[normal], actual arrears levels would rise to 7.7% (totalling £865m).
[normal] 
[normal]This loss in revenue translates into a loss of financial capacity within housing associations to manage and maintain their properties
[normal]; 
[normal]deliver wider community services and build new homes. If all these losses were 
[normal]diverted away from 
[normal]financing new homes, the country would see 17,480 less affordable homes built in a year. 
[normal]Any impact 
[normal]on h
[normal]ouse b
[normal]uilding 
[normal]may be more 
[normal]likely to
[normal] 
[normal]be felt 
[normal]in the next Spending Review period, as 61% of associations
[normal] 
[normal]did not think welfare reform 
[normal]would m
[normal]ake it harder
[normal] to deliver on their commitments under the existing Affordable Homes Programme
[normal]. Though 26% say it 
[normal]would to 
[normal]a fair amount or great deal
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]The impact on tenants and communities would also be significant. For individual working-age tenants on housing be
[normal]nefit, th
[normal]e predicted 
[normal]impact 
[normal]would mean outstanding arrears increasing by £250 (up from £492) to £743 on average
[normal] by year end
[normal]. 
[normal]Policis
[normal], in a separate study for the Federation, 
[normal]found that 
[normal]50% of social housing tenants were not confident they would be able to keep up rental payments with a switch to monthly payments in arrears within a Universal Credit. 
[normal]Policis 
[normal]identified 
[normal]families with children, 
[normal]those who 
[normal]juggled their finances through 
[normal]weekl
[normal]y cash budgeting and were already under financial stress
[normal] as most at risk in this move
[normal]. 
[normal]Policis 
[normal]also 
[normal]found that 
[normal]32% of social housing tenants had problematic credit use and it was amongst this group that rent arrears were already concentrated
[normal] and risks to b
[normal]e foun
[normal]d
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: 
[normal]that households are given a genuine choice to have their 
[normal]housing element of Universal Credit 
[normal]paid direct to their landlord
[normal] given the level of risk to rent arrears
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: 
[normal]w
[normal]e 
[normal]welcome the measures the DWP are trialling in the North West pathfinder areas to identify tenants who are vulnerable and at risk of arrears who will 
[normal]have 
[normal]the opportunity to have direct payments to their landlords
[normal]. However, 
[normal]we 
[normal]recommend that the DWP
[normal] 
[normal]accept 
[normal]individual referrals 
[normal]from housing associations as to whom should be placed
[normal] on 
[normal]direct payments from the outset
[normal],
[normal] or when fall
[normal]ing
[normal] into rent arrears
[normal] before the arrears trigger comes into play and gives effect to this
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]n autumn 2012, 
[normal]82% of associations expected the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria to result in a fall of rental income. Our snapshot survey of 
[normal]51
[normal] associations suggests this has been born out, as by the end of June 2013, 71% of them were reporting that their rent arrears levels
[normal] had gone up
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]his took place when Universal Credit had reached only a handful of tenants in the North West so could not be said to be a contributing factor. 
[normal]In 
[normal]the first three months to the end of June
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]first three months 
[normal]does not necessarily 
[normal]indicat
[normal]e 
[normal]what might happen 
[normal]over 
[normal]the 
[normal]longer-
[normal]t
[normal]erm
[normal]. 
[normal]Some households 
[normal]may 
[normal]get deeper 
[normal]into arrears as they find it difficult to make up the shortfall in their rent week after week, or because D
[normal]iscretionary Housing Payments 
[normal](DHP) 
[normal]awarded for a short time c
[normal]ome 
[normal]to an end. Some households may find ways of meeting the extra call on their budgets, by cutting back on expenditure, or boosting their income, for example by taking in lodgers or increasing the number of hours they work. 
[normal]However
[normal], no
[normal]t all
[normal] of these options a
[normal]re 
[normal]open to 
[normal]every household. 
[normal]T
[normal]he Local Government Association 
[normal]has found that
[normal] people’s ability to move or find work to mitigate the impact of welfare reform is constrained by local housing and job markets
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8
[normal]              
[normal]The impact on rent arrears may be limited by 
[normal]people 
[normal]downsizing
[normal], but landlords will suffer 
[normal]a loss in 
[normal]rental income 
[normal]whilst they wait for 
[normal]new tenants 
[normal]to move in
[normal]to empty properties. O
[normal]n 
[normal]average
[normal] -
[normal] before the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria came in
[normal] -
[normal] 
[normal]properties remain
[normal]ed
[normal] vacant for 14 
[normal]d
[normal]ays
[normal]. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]some landlords are reporting that they 
[normal]are finding it difficult to 
[normal]le
[normal]t
[normal] larger family homes due to the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria
[normal],
[normal] resulting not only in an extended 
[normal]period of 
[normal]rental 
[normal]income 
[normal]loss
[normal], 
[normal]but also a waste of a home that a family 
[normal]w
[normal]ould welcome. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4[bold]              [bold]Impact o[bold]f welfare reform on [bold]housing association[bold]s[bold]’[bold] [bold]costs[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Housing associations are changing their rent collection and arrears management systems in the face of welfare reform and providing additional support for tenants
[normal]. Both have 
[normal]a cost. In autumn 2012
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]F
[normal]or the 60 
[normal]largest associations (representing 49
[normal]% 
[normal]of properties in the sector) the average predicted additional spend up to 2013 was £193,000
[normal]. This is
[normal] expected to rise to over £456,000 
[normal]in 
[normal]2013-14. This suggests for just the largest associations taken together
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]there 
[normal]will be around
[normal] £30 million 
[normal]of 
[normal]additional costs in 
[normal]the first year
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]S
[normal]ome of the costs of investing in new management systems and ways of working will be 
[normal]greater
[normal] 
[normal]in the earlier years. 
[normal]A
[normal]ssociations 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]also 
[normal]adjust the
[normal]ir
[normal] expenditure plans upwards as the i
[normal]mpact of the 
[normal]social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria 
[normal]and new payment arrangements via Universal Credit unfold. 
[normal]While
[normal] it is not possible to predict how 
[normal]this will 
[normal]pan out
[normal], 
[normal]it 
[normal]is safe to
[normal] say 
[normal]that this will take resources away from services and new homes delivery as illus
[normal]trated above in connection with increasing rent arrears levels.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: 
[normal]DWP agrees to
[normal] 
[normal]data sharing arrangements 
[normal]f
[normal]or the housing association sector to ensure that arrangements are put in place to 
[normal]reduce fraud, errors and administrative costs.
[normal] 
[normal]For example
[normal], to ensure the 
[normal]DWP 
[normal]has 
[normal]timely 
[normal]information on changes in rent levels and that associations have information on who is moving onto Universal Credit and in and out of direct payment to their landlord
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: that the DWP work
[normal]s
[normal] in p
[normal]artnership with housing associations, as well as local authorities, 
[normal]to put
[normal] in place local support service frameworks to ensure claimants have ready access to financial inclusion and other services to support them through their claim 
[normal]as
[normal] needed.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5[bold]              [bold]Support[bold]ed housing[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Universal Credit rules and payment model is unsuitable for people living in short
[normal]-
[normal]term supported housing
[normal],
[normal] such as a homeless hostels
[normal]. The 
[normal]Government is to make proposals for alternative arrangements for exempted 
[normal]supported housing
[normal],
[normal] having
[normal] stress
[normal]ed 
[normal]it is not a cost 
[normal]cutting exercise. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: the 
[normal]supported housing 
[normal]definition 
[normal]must be fit for purpose to ensure that the right people are exempted from claiming housing costs through Universal Credit and directed towards the al
[normal]ternative system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: any new system for determining support for housing costs for people in supported housing 
[normal]should 
[normal]retain the principle of nationally set 
[normal]entitlement and be piloted
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6[bold]              [bold]Impact [bold]of the social [bold]sector [bold]size criteria [bold]on [bold]people’s [bold]wellbeing[bold] and [bold]public services[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]On average, t
[normal]he social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria will reduce the housing benefit payments of 660,000 people by 
[normal]£728 per year
[normal]. 
[normal]Many
[normal] individuals are
[normal] already
[normal] reporting that they are finding it extremely hard to cope with 
[normal]the 
[normal]e
[normal]ffects
[normal]. In their survey of
[normal] social housing tenants in 2012
[normal] Policis found:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]Having to make up the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria shortfall in the rent and make contributions to council tax will add to financial pressures
[normal] on
[normal] households
[normal]. Th
[normal]is 
[normal]will take 
[normal]its 
[normal]toll on 
[normal]people
[normal]’s wellbeing 
[normal]and 
[normal]could 
[normal]lead 
[normal]to greater demands on public services
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]people
[normal]: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]An estimated
[normal] 100,000 
[normal]British 
[normal]households 
[normal]living in social 
[normal]housing 
[normal]with aids and adaptations are also
[normal] 
[normal]affected by the 
[normal]social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria
[normal]. It is likely that many of 
[normal]them 
[normal]would seek their re-provision if they had to mo
[normal]ve
[normal]. Sometimes it will be possib
[normal]le to move existing adaptation
[normal]s. O
[normal]n other occasions new ones will need to be specified and fitted to match the design of the new home. In either scenario there are costs involved 
[normal]including
[normal] assessments by occupational therapists
[normal],
[normal] the labour for removing or fitting the 
[normal]aids and adaptatio
[normal]ns
[normal] and 
[normal]the costs of the equipment. Existing adaptations may become redundant 
[normal]if 
[normal]it is not appropriate for them to be moved, or left for the incoming tenant. This represents a waste of historical investment and an environmental cost. The costs of re-providi
[normal]ng aids and adaptations represents an extra demand on the disabled facility grant (DFG) budgets of local authorities who have duties to assess the needs of disabled people and to meet the costs of appropriate facilities irrespective of their tenure
[normal]. 
[normal]The a
[normal]verage DFG award is £6,500
[normal]. 
[normal]In turn, this puts pressure on central government which allocates funding to local authorities for DFG. 
[normal]H
[normal]ousing associations 
[normal]aim
[normal] to offer people a move to a home which has been built, or already adapted for 
[normal]their 
[normal]needs. However, because of the limited supply of smaller properties this is far from possible in many cases. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.4
[normal]              
[normal]The cost to the tax
[normal]-
[normal]pa
[normal]y
[normal]er is not the only factor to consider. 
[normal]Many households affected will find it
[normal] difficult to find a suitable property to move to, or may face additional stresses in trying to co-ordinate moving with the successful and timely re-provision of aids and adaptions. 
[normal]Many will have to choose
[normal] between 
[normal]making up
[normal] the shortfall in their rent
[normal] whi
[normal]ch would
[normal] 
[normal]reduce their weekly household budget
[normal], 
[normal]and
[normal] moving to a less suitable property 
[normal]which would put
[normal] limitations on going about their daily lives. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]Government spokespeople repeatedly refer to DHPs as ameliorating the effect of changes to housing bene
[normal]fit, including the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria
[normal]. [bold]D
[normal]uring the passage of the Welfare Reform Act, Lord Freud allocated an additional £30 million to DHP for 2013/14 because of the 
[normal]social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria
[normal],
[normal] aimed at disabled people living in significantly adapted properties and foster carers. 
[normal]The Government 
[normal]also 
[normal]allocated an additional £35 million in year for 2013/14 to ameliorate the impact of the 
[normal]social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria
[normal]. 
[normal]This is 
[normal]part of a wider allocat
[normal]ion for 2013/14 which is now up to £190 million against allocations for previous years of £20m. 
[normal]Though this falls well short of the £480 million savings 
[normal]in the first year 
[normal]the DWP predicts tenants affected by the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria will make up in 
[normal]rental payments
[normal], it 
[normal]is still an additional cost to the tax payer. 
[normal]In addition, 
[normal]an administrative error in the allocations to Scotland has resulted in the Government spending a further £800,000
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.6
[normal]              
[normal]It is entirely possible that the Government will continue to allocate further funds to the DHP 
[normal]pot 
[normal]as the 
[normal]impacts unfold
[normal]. However, individual household
[normal]s
[normal] can
[normal]not
[normal] rely on DHP payments 
[normal]and 
[normal]local authorities have to make very difficult decisions on how to ratio
[normal]n their pot 
[normal]over the
[normal] year
[normal] 
[normal]across 
[normal]people
[normal] in 
[normal]properties owned by private landlords, local authorities and housing associations. Federation research shows that only 21% of local authority DHP awards from April 2013 to end of June 2013 were for six months or 
[normal]longer
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7[bold]              [bold]Does the social [bold]sector [bold]size criteria meet its [bold]own [bold]policy objectives?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact on savings[bold]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Government claims that the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria will 
[normal]save
[normal] 
[normal]the tax
[normal]-
[normal]payer 
[normal]£480 million
[normal] 
[normal]in its first year
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Whether or not this is realised depends on the extent to which people downsize into the more expensive private rented sector and who subsequently moves into their 
[normal]vacated 
[normal]home. 
[normal]Riverside, Affinity Sutton, Gentoo and Wigan and 
[normal]Leigh Housing
[normal],
[normal] with support fr
[normal]om the Centre for Housing Policy University of York
[normal],
[normal] have run their own data through the DWP’s 
[normal]cost 
[normal]impact model and this suggests that the savings may be considerably less than 
[normal]a
[normal]ssumed 
[normal]by the DWP. 
[normal]Their modelling is based 
[normal]on their 
[normal]observed level of moves 
[normal]by tenants affected by the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria into the private rented sector
[normal]. 
[normal]Anal
[normal]ysis from the Federation shows 
[normal]that
[normal] families under-occupying two bedroom homes who move to a one-bed flat in the private rented sector would end up claiming an aver
[normal]age of £1,500 more per year in housing benefit – even though they’ll be living in smaller properties
[normal].
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Government’s projected savings also 
[normal]fail to take into 
[normal]account 
[normal]the 
[normal]subsequent
[normal] costs to public services 
[normal]and the 
[normal]costs incurred by landlords 
[normal]as 
[normal]explored above
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact on overcrowding[bold] and [bold]best use of [bold]stock[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]The social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria 
[normal]is not a
[normal]n effective
[normal] way of tackling overcrowding given the geographical mismatch between households who are under-occupying and high levels of overcrowding
[normal]. It is also not a good way of making the best use of 
[normal]the 
[normal]affordable housing 
[normal]stock 
[normal]given the limited opportunities for people to move to smaller properties
[normal] within the sector. 
[normal]For example, a
[normal]nalysis from the Federation shows: 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4
[normal]              
[normal]Recommendation: the Government should 
[normal]repeal
[normal] the social 
[normal]sector 
[normal]size criteria.
