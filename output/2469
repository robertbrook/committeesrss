default that people are better off in work by reducing benefit withdrawal rates. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultthe 
defaultNational Housing 
defaultFederation has several concerns 
defaultregarding the reforms
default, primarily because households do not have a genuine choice to have the housing element of 
defaultU
defaultniversa
defaultl 
defaultC
defaultredit paid directly to their landlord. Many tenants would elect to do this to avoid going into 
defaultarrears
default. We are also concerned that the 
defaultcumulative impact of 
defaultbenefit cuts 
defaultmeans that households 
defaultincreasingly 
defaultcannot afford 
defaultto 
defaultcover the most basic costs of 
defaultfeeding their family
default, 
defaultkeeping their home warm
default and paying their rent at the same time
default. 
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultOur response focuses on the case for abolishing the social 
defaultsector 
defaultsize criteria
default.
default 
defaultOur recent ComRes poll shows that public opinion is shifting against the social 
defaultsec
defaulttor 
defaultsize criteria with 59% in support of Bedroom Tax repeal, up from 51% in April
default. In addition, 87% agree that those who need a spare room for sick or disabled family members should be exempt from the policy. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultTo ensure we have information on the

default impact of

defaulthas 
defaultcommissioned Ipsos MORI to survey housing associations in autumn 2013 with a large scale tenants’ survey in

default              
defaultThe 
defaultrise in the housing benefit bill
default in recent years
default is a result of higher unemployment, stagnating 
defaultlow 
defaultwages and rising rent levels in the private rented sector. The consequence is that, of every £1 of government expenditure on housing, 95p is spent on housin
defaultg benefit and only 5p on building new homes
default. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultRecommendation: the 
defaultmost effective way of redressing the balance and reducing the housing benefit bill is 
defaultto 
defaultbuild more affordable homes. Government investment in new affordable homes not only helps tackl
defaulte
default 
defaultour growing housing crisis, but also has a fundamental role to play in:
default 
default&#xa0;
default3default              defaultImpact odefaultf welfare defaultreform odefaultn rent arrears defaultand empty homesdefault&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultIn 
defaultautumn
default 2012, 84% of housing associations believed that their rent arrears would increase 
defaultas a direct result of 
defaultthe 
defaultwelfare changes
default (taking into account direct payments, 
defaultthe social size criteria and the benefit
default cap)
default. The average increase 
defaultin arrears 
defaultexpected was 51%
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultAt the end of 2012, 
defaulthousing association arrears stood at 5.1% (£572m)
default. If a 51% increase in arrears was realised
default across the sector
default, actual arrears levels would rise to 7.7% (totalling £865m).
default 
defaultThis loss in revenue translates into a loss of financial capacity within housing associations to manage and maintain their properties
default; 
defaultdeliver wider community services and build new homes. If all these losses were 
defaultdiverted away from 
defaultfinancing new homes, the country would see 17,480 less affordable homes built in a year. 
defaultAny impact 
defaulton h
defaultouse b
defaultuilding 
defaultmay be more 
defaultlikely to
default 
defaultbe felt 
defaultin the next Spending Review period, as 61% of associations
default 
defaultdid not think welfare reform 
defaultwould m
defaultake it harder
default to deliver on their commitments under the existing Affordable Homes Programme
default. Though 26% say it 
defaultwould to 
defaulta fair amount or great deal
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultThe impact on tenants and communities would also be significant. For individual working-age tenants on housing be
defaultnefit, th
defaulte predicted 
defaultimpact 
defaultwould mean outstanding arrears increasing by £250 (up from £492) to £743 on average
default by year end
default. 
defaultPolicis
default, in a separate study for the Federation, 
defaultfound that 
default50% of social housing tenants were not confident they would be able to keep up rental payments with a switch to monthly payments in arrears within a Universal Credit. 
defaultPolicis 
defaultidentified 
defaultfamilies with children, 
defaultthose who 
defaultjuggled their finances through 
defaultweekl

default as most at risk in this move
default. 
defaultPolicis 
defaultalso 
defaultfound that 
default32% of social housing tenants had problematic credit use and it was amongst this group that rent arrears were already concentrated
default and risks to b

default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultRecommendation: 
defaultthat households are given a genuine choice to have their 
defaulthousing element of Universal Credit 
defaultpaid direct to their landlord
default given the level of risk to rent arrears
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultRecommendation: 
defaultw
defaulte 
defaultwelcome the measures the DWP are trialling in the North West pathfinder areas to identify tenants who are vulnerable and at risk of arrears who will

defaultwe 
defaultrecommend that the DWP

defaultfrom housing associations as to whom should be placed

default,
default or when fall

default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultI
defaultn autumn 2012, 
default82% of associations expected the social 
defaultsector 
defaultsize criteria to result in a fall of rental income. Our snapshot survey of 
default51
default associations suggests this has been born out, as by the end of June 2013, 71% of them were reporting that their rent arrears levels
default had gone up
default. 
defaultT
defaulthis took place when Universal Credit had reached only a handful of tenants in the North West so could not be said to be a contributing factor.

defaultRecommendation: that the DWP work

default6.4
default              
defaultThe cost to the tax

defaultMany households affected will find it

default6.5
default              
defaultGovernment spokespeople repeatedly refer to DHPs as ameliorating the effect of changes to housing bene
defaultfit, including the social 
defaultsector 
defaultsize criteria
default. defaultD
defaulturing the passage of the Welfare Reform Act, Lord Freud allocated an additional £30 million to DHP for 2013/14 because of the 
defaultsocial 
defaultsector 
defaultsize criteria
default,
default aimed at disabled people living in significantly adapted properties and foster carers. 
defaultThe Government 
defaultalso 
defaultallocated an additional £35 million in year for 2013/14 to ameliorate the impact of the 
defaultsocial 
defaultsector 
defaultsize criteria
default. 
defaultThis is 
defaultpart of a wider allocat
defaultion for 2013/14 which is now up to £190 million against allocations for previous years of £20m. 
defaultThough this falls well short of the £480 million savings 
defaultin the first year 
defaultthe DWP predicts tenants affected by the social 
defaultsector 
defaultsize criteria will make up in 
defaultrental payments
default, it 
defaultis still an additional cost to the tax payer. 
defaultIn addition, 
defaultan administrative error in the allocations to Scotland has resulted in the Government spending a further £800,000
default. 
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default              
defaultIt is entirely possible that the Government will continue to allocate further funds to the DHP 
defaultpot 
defaultas the 
defaultimpacts unfold
default. However, individual household
defaults
default can

default

default.
default 
defaultWhether or not this is realised depends on the extent to which people downsize into the more expensive private rented sector and who subsequently moves into their
