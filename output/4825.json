"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence \nfrom the \nPolice and Crime Commissioner \nfor \nCumbria\n [CST0055]\nSummary: \nThis submission responds to the 2 \nareas of interest raised in the Chairman’s letter of 6\nth\n December. It covers how I, as Police and Crime Commissioner, gain assurance about the accuracy of crime figures in Cumbria\n and\n \nthe range of methods I use to\n monitor performance. \n \nAs\n Police and Crime\n Commissioner, I am acutely aware of the importance of t\nhe public having \nconfidence i\nn the information provided to them about crime in their area. \nAccurate crime data is also vital for planning the best use of resources.  \nThis is not unique to Cumbria and\n,\n \nindeed, \nthis issue has\n attracted interest nationally.\n T\nhis is why I decided that it would only be appropriate to check on the quality and accuracy of data recording by Cumbria Constabulary. \nTh\ne approach\n has included using our internal audit function to carry out a check of data quality and continued monitoring of Constabulary work and action plans to \nensure a high level of\n data recording accuracy\n \nfollowing changes to the internal crime and incident recor\nding checking function\n. \nThere is an on-going programme of independent checks in place, both through us\ne of audit and HMIC inspections, whose findings will inform my areas of focus with the Constabulary. \n \nWe know that official recorded crime figures only r\nepresent a proportion of the crime experienced by the public in Cumbria\n and we need to be clear for the public that we are talking about \nrecorded\n crime\n. \nThere are a variety of reasons why victims may choose not to report a crime to the police, however impr\noving the victim’\ns experience and \nproviding a range of pathways for reporting crime are priorities for me\n,\n to ensure that more victims come forward and can receive \nsupport if they require it.\n \nIndeed, increasing reporting of domestic abuse and hate crimes a\nre priorities within my Police and Crime Plan and the measure\ns\n used to monitor performance in these area\ns\n reflect this.\n \n&#xa0;\nMy Police and Crime Plan, ‘Making Cumbria an Even Safer Place’ sets out my priorities for the Constabulary and \nit therefore\n forms the cornerstone of holding the Chief Constable to account for performance of his force. I have in place a number of performance measures\n, which include\n priority crime types, to enable me and, indeed the Police and Crime Panel and the public, to keep\n track of the Plan and crime levels in the county. \nMy regular engagement with \nDistrict Councils often focusses on the level of crime in their area and so this crime and other data also provides information of use to local Councils. \nThese \nmeasures f\norm par\nt of a number of methods through which I monitor police performance. \nThey\n include feedback from the public on quality of service, such as via my engagement events, correspondence and surveys. I also receive reports from the Constabulary at my Executive Boa\nrd on other aspects of value for money, such as sickness, overtime costs\n and\n complaints and\n the Constabulary provides\n bi-monthly updates on priority theme\ns\n in the Police and Crime Plan, such as road safety \nor\n use of out of court disposals. Internal audits \nallow me to gain assurance on the robustness of internal controls and data quality. \nOverall, th\nis approach aims to provide and drive a balanced and rounded picture of performance \nwithout over-\nemphasis on meeting targets.\n \nAs an issue of continued national i\nnterest, I \nwould\n welcome \nfurther proposals \nnational\nly\n to continue to promote accuracy of crime data\n. I will also \nlook forward to the findings of your inquiry. \n \nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
