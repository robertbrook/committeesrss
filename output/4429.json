"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT) &amp; the Planning Officers Society (LTD0021)SummaryIntroductionThe \nAssociation of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT) represents local authority county, unitary and metropolitan Directors who manage some of the most pressing issues facing the UK today. \n \nOperating at the strategic tier of local government, we are respons\nible for delivering public services that primarily relate to the physical environment and the economy, but which have a significant impact on all aspects of the nation’s well-being.\nAt the local level, ADEPT members, with our wide-ranging responsibilities \nand cross-cutting professional knowledge, have a unique understanding of the opportunities and barriers facing their respective places. \n \nBecause we start from a place-based approach, we automatically join up policy areas that in Whitehall are spread across\n a number of different Departments.\n&#xa0;\n We therefore see ourselves as having a key role in supporting and helping to deliver sustainable economic growth and quality of life and are keen to work with Government, business and the voluntary sector to make the mo\nst of the opportunities available.\nAlthough our members are predominately from English authorities, we are closely affiliated with CSS Wales, the Society of Chief Officers of Transport in Scotland (SCOTS) and the Northern Ireland Road Service\n: S\nenior figures from these organisations \nplay\n an active role on the ADEPT management board\n. \n&#xa0;\n \nThe Planning Officers Society was formed in April 1997 by the amalgamation of the former County Planning Officers Society, District Planning Officers Society and t\nhe Metropolitan Planning Officers Society. With the formation of a single Local Government Association it was decided by the constituent societies that a single voice for local authority planning \npractitioners would be the most effective way of pursuing go\nod and effective planning practice within local government. In March 2011 POS became a Registered Charity.\nThe Society's aim is to ensure that planning makes a major contribution to achieving sustainable developments, from national to local level, in ways,\n which are fair and equitable and achieve the social economic and environmental aspirations of all sectors of the community.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal highway and transport authorities are publicly accountable\n bodies\n and recognised by their communities \nas being responsible for the roads and transport \nsystems within the areas.  They are best placed to understand the problems and make decisions on behalf of their communities.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe allocation and bidding mechanisms for local transport expenditure have been undergoing change for many years.  Annual bids fo\nr funding using Transport Policies and Programmes submissions were replaced from 2001 by five-yearly Local Transport Plans which bid for five year allocations of block funding for Integrated Transport and Maintenance, while retaining a separate bidding rou\nnd for major schemes over £5\n \nmillion.  Subsequently\n,\n in December 201\n0\n, the bidding process for block allocations was replaced by an indicative allocation\n based on calculated formulae\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe benefits of these changes in relation to block funding\n to \nlocal authorities \nhave been:\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhen the Department for Transport announced their decision to devolve decision-making on local major transport schemes in September 2012 their stated reasons were \nthat it will:\n \n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authorities generally welcomed \nthe principle of \ndevolving \ndecision-making and accountability to the local level, and finding ways of delivering schemes which minimise the administrative burden and costs on both central and local government\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, many \nfelt that the \narrangements proposed in the consultation pa\nper fell far short of the optimum means of achieving this.  The (then) proposed Local Transport Bodies created further layers of unnecessary bureaucracy, which would complicate decision making and inevitabl\ny\n lead to additional costs\n.  \n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSubsequently, the d\necision to allocate large amount\ns\n of transport funding via the Single Local Growth Fund \nto\n Local Enterprise Partnerships has created considerable complexity\n in terms of how Local Transport Bo\ndies\n work\n.  W\ne believe \nthis \nhas \nthe capacity to \nundermine the \noriginal\n rationale by which decision-making for local major transport schemes was to be \ndevolved\n \nas real power is not being handed to local communities\n.  \nIn addition, apart from the already confirmed figures for\n each LTB area (which represents only \na small\n proportion of the total funding\n demand\n), we understand that the initial funding announcement in July 2014 will only confirm a funding allocation for 2015/16, which does not provide the certainty that authorities need to deliver major schemes whose constru\nction is likely to span financial years, or indeed the impetus to expedite preparation of schemes when there is no certainty of future funding.\n&#xa0;\n1.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \ncompetitive element of the \nSingle \nL\nocal Growth Fund came as something of a surprise to autho\nrities\n \nand \ndoes not provide long-term certainty compared to \na formulaic allocation of funding via Local Transport Bo\ndies\n.  G\niven the importance of this funding to the local economy, we believe that the short timescales which have been given for the preparation of Str\nategic Economic Plans will not produce an optimal result in ensuring that \nallocated\n fundin\ng does align properly with need.\n&#xa0;\n1.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe creation \nof new\n organisations, Local Transport Bodies, to administer devolved local major transport scheme funding created \nunnecessary\n bureaucracy.  \nThe allocation of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships means that since local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of most schemes, three organisations are \nnow involved in what would now seem\n to be an unn\necessary and con\nvoluted decision-making process with accountability still \nlying\n with the Local Highway authority as part of their statutory duties.\n&#xa0;\n1.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that a far more effective model would be to follow the original proposal for devolution of fundi\nng via a formulaic process (perhaps amended to encompass wider priorities), but with funding allocate\nd directly to local authorities who are the Highway and Transport Authorities. Associated with this should be\n a requirement for local authorities to\n demons\ntrate meaningful engagement with \ntheir local business communities\n and LEPs\n, instead of the heavy-handed evaluation process\n that is being recommended by\n the Department for Transport\n.\n \nL\nocal authorities are publicly accountable bodies\n with formal scrutiny arr\nangements and engagement with local communities and businesses is now second nature.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiving responsibility for spending decisions to the LEP does effec\ntively engage stakeholders from\n&#xa0;\nthe business community.\n&#xa0;\n However, it risks decision making being based \non a narrow viewpoint without the full understanding of the evidence base or of competing policy objectives.\n&#xa0;2.1\n              \nMost\n upper-tier local authorities \nmaintain \nor can call on \na professional team of highway and transport \nofficers with a wide breadth of experience across the field and a deep knowledge of the transport issues facing the\nir localities\n.  \nThe capacity of any authority with respect to major transport schemes is heavily linked to the level and certain\nty\n of funding\n which is available for delivery of such schemes.  When funding is short, there is inevitably a vicious circle in that local authorities will not maintain capacity at a level beyond that which they can reasonably expect to be justified.  However, the struc\ntures are already in place which would allow that capacity to be easily expanded to meet the needs of increased funding, but an element of up-front pump-priming is need\ned\n to allow short-term expansion or a long-term \nfunding commitment so that local authori\nties can have confidence to expand their capacity.  \n2.2\n              \nLocal Transport Authorities have spent decades through the TPP and LTP process analysing\n and understanding local transport issues and through evidence based policy determining the transport measures appropriate to the needs of local people and businesses. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n The most efficient means for LEPs and LTBs to undertake these functions is to engage \nwith existing expertise within their constituent Local Authorities.\n2.3\n              \nThe \nprofessional\n team supports and advises elected \nCouncillors\n who are able to directly reflect the views and \npriorities\n of their constituents in their decision making.\n  E\nlected member\n structure\ns included either an elected Mayor or a Cabinet portfolio structure \nwith executive responsibility and established scrutiny mechanisms.  Budget and consultation processes are well established, and engagement with the private sector takes place thr\nough the Local Enterprise Partnerships and more directly\n when needed\n.\n2.4\n              \nTogether, the professional officers and elected members are already responsible for local major transport schemes from problem identification through to delivery, with the only decis\nions which are taken elsewhere being the statutory processes (such as Side Roads Orders and Compulsory Purchase Orders) and the allocation of funding which are \nboth \nundertaken \nby the Department for Transport. However,\n local authorities are \nincreasingly \nexp\nected to procure or provide a significant amount of the funding and to bear risk of cost-over runs.\n2.\n5\n              \nLocal Enterprise Partnerships will maintain a similar team of \nprofessional officers with knowledge of \nstrategic leadership, ambition and vehicles for \nidentifying clear investment priorities and interventions necessary to stimulate private sector led economic growth\n.  \nHowever, very few Local enterprise Partnerships have \nspecialised\n knowledge of the assessment, prioritisation and delivery of local transpo\nrt schemes, relying on \ntheir local highway/transport authorities \nfor advice in this area\n.\n2.\n6\n              \nWe believe that the optimum delivery body already exists – i\nn the shape of local highway and transport authorities\n – \nwho \nalready possess all the skills and democr\natic accountability to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes.\n3.1\n              \nLocal authorities have dealt with schemes c\nrossing their boundaries for many years without the need to establish \ncomplicated \narrangements.  The usual arrangement has been to reach agreement that one authority acts as lead for promotion and delivery of the scheme.  This has worked well on many occas\nions and there is no need to establish bureaucratic structures to enable such schemes, particularly if funding mechanisms – such as formulaic allocations \n–\n \nencourage local authorities to work in partnership rather than competition with each other.\n3.2\n              \nWe therefore believe that funding should be allocated to local authority level, and where a cross-border \nissue \nexists it should be funded jointly by those authorities affected as, if it is a major issue, it will\n already\n be recognised as such by all those i\nnvolved.\n3.3\n              \nAn over-arching regional body is likely to be in a position to determine wider benefits but is unlikely to prioritise schemes with primarily local impacts.\n4.1\n              \nViewed nationally, the relationship is obviously mixed, reflecting different histories and priorities.  Engagement between local authorities and the business community (including Local Enterprise Partnerships) will be str\nonger in some areas than others.  \n4.\n2\n              \nW\ne believe that \noverlapping LEPs create \nfrequent \ntensions and unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing priorities and common delivery agendas.\n4.\n3\n              \nWe also believe that there are frequent examples of government \ndepartments not supporting common agendas, such as past actions by the Highways Agency, whether due to policy or pursuit of performance indicators with respect to congestion on their network, which have tended to inhibit development.  The over-proscriptive\n regime laid down by the Department for Transport for Local Transport Bodies\n does not encourage true localism and the principles of\n devolution.\n5.1 \n              \nThe local authority road network represents 98% of England’s roads by length and carries two-third of all road traffic, and we do not believe that the importance of this network is recognised in\n the amount of funding made available for investment.  While we are aware that there has been significant variation in the funding \navailable\n over time\n, \nwe have not been able to find clear figures to demonstrate this point, and would suggest that it would b\ne useful for the Select Committee to ask the Department for Transport to produce their spending figures on local major transport schemes over the last 30 years, to show both the relative changes and the frequent changes in funding levels.\n5.2 \n              \nLocal Major \nTransport Schemes are complex and time-consuming projects.  Choosing the most appropriate route requires extensive \nconsultation and\n environmental analysis.  In addition, statutory orders are required, which mean that for most schemes the preparatory proces\ns will take a \nperiod\n of years, and cost a seven-figure sum.\n  \nAn\ny\n funding stream which includes a bidding process therefore \nmeans that local authorities must expend \nconsiderable\n time and cost in preparing schemes with no \ncertainty that they will be funded, \nparticularly where an advanced state of scheme preparation means that a scheme will have a greater chance of success in bidding.\n5.\n3\n              \nIn more recent \ntimes\n, the much reduced level of funding available for \nmajor schemes\n,\n \ntogether with the uncertainty of the bidding process \nhas meant that if a scheme is unsuccessful in \nreceiving \nfunding the\nn\n delay\ns\n running into a period of years\n \nw\nould occur\n or\n \nthe scheme \nmight not \nbe delivered at all.  This means \nthat any statutory orders \nobtained in expectation of funding are likely to expire and\n, therefore, \nadditional costs\n will be incurred\n in obtaining them again.\n  Substantial abortive costs are incurred in scheme preparation if the bid is unsuccessful. \n  \n5.\n4\n              \nThis has placed much m\nore e\nmphasis in recent years \nfunding\n larger or\n major transport schemes through other sources\n and Government funding pots\n.  However, \nmany \nfunding streams have often been announced at short-notice and the funding has usually had time limitations meaning that a \nscheme\n has to be at a very advanced stage of preparation to be deliverable within such a time period.  \n5.\n5\n              \nThe announcement of a much increased level of funding allocated for local major transport schemes over an extended period of years earlier this year\n was therefore very welcome.  However, \nthe formulaic allocation meant that it was in many cases insufficient to deliver larger schemes.  A\ns outlined in our response to other questions, the allocation of this funding via a \ncompetitive process with\n LEPs \nand \nwith \nonly \nshort-term\n confirmed funding (beyond the initial allocation to LTB areas) \ncreates considerable complications \nand means that there \nwill not be the \ndegree of funding certainty \nnecessary to ensure effective\n preparatory\n \ninvestment in major schemes\n.\n Consideration should be given to the establishment of a funding stream to allow local highway and transport authorities to undertake the preparatory works for major schemes in order to get them to a state of readiness for when funding is eventually forthc\noming.\n \n5.6\n              \nLTP has been very successful in delivering smaller scale schemes, particularly safety schemes and schemes promoting sustainable transport.\n&#xa0;\n This is a mature process which local authority structures have adapted to.\n&#xa0;\n Recent reduction in LTP fund\ning has in many ways been offset by the introduction of LSTF.\n&#xa0;\n LSTF programs have comprised specific packages of LTP schemes designed to meet LSTF criteria.\n&#xa0;\n The delivery timing of LPPF schemes and the requirement to deliver immediate impact on growth has \nlimited the potential to access this funding stream, particularly for smaller and more rural authorities.\n6.1\n              \nAs far as \nwe understand the process, Local Transport Bodie\ns no longer have a defined role in the process given that f\nunding is being devolved to \nLocal Enterprise Partnerships. At present,\n it is not evident \nas to how \nLEPs \nwill be\n required to involve LTBs.  Although w\ne suspect that most will do\n so, the lack of clarity\n \nhas caused confusion, especially given \nthe extensive work that local authorities an\nd LEPs went through to deliver the\n government\n’s proposals \nfor LTBs\n.\n \n6.2\n              \nWhile there was no overlap between Local Transpo\nrt Bodies, there\n are examples of\n overlap\nping\n LEP\ns whereby in these areas\n two different LEPs \ncould be bidding for \nthe same transport investment.  Not only does this create significant duplication in the bidding process, but there will be a need to resolve b\netween the two LEPs how allocated funding will be determined in those areas of overlap.  This is likely to further delay the delivery of schemes.\n6.3\n              \nThere is also much concern within the profession that the inclusion of a significant element of Integrated\n Transport (IT) Block funding within the Single Local Growth Fund is likely to inhibit the delivery of the small-scale sche\nmes which the IT Block is used to deliver.\n \nSuch schemes often demonstrate very\n high value for money\n, which could now be reduced as a \nresult of extra cost\ns\n associated with the more convoluted bidding process\n and bureaucracy\n for the Local Growth Fund. \nMoreover, the inclusion of top-sliced budgets that would have traditionally been used for Highway and Transport schemes into a fund that is\n un-ringfenced means that the level of uncertainty for local highway authorities is likely to be increased.\n6.4\n              \nThe key benefit is certainty of funding which will significantly reduce the amount spent on scheme development: money that can be redirected to scheme delivery.\n&#xa0;\n Providing funding to all LTBs on a formula basis will inevitably reduce the proportion of \navai\nlable\n funding that can be awarded to any single individual LTB and this will impact on the potential to deliver larger schemes. Our concern is that removal of the ring-fence around transport spending will reduce overall transport spending, retarding develo\npment of the transport network.\n6.5\n              \nIn addition, as highlighted in our earlier answers to questions 1 and 5, we understand that beyond the allocations made to each LTB area, the only funding which will be confirmed in July 2014 is for 2015/16, which will m\nean that authorities will not have the funding certainty required to deliver major schemes which span financial years.\n7.1\n   \nVery often the main barrier to private sector investment in essentially publicly owned         infrastructure \nand new and innovative funding mechanism is EU procurement rules cou\npled with the risk appetite \nand confidence \nof all parties, particularly in these austere times. Linked to this is the need to establish revenue streams that provide appropriate payback to the investors in a reasonable period of time. Local authorities can be best placed to take the longer term view\n and provide some form of security which could encourage the private sector to share risk differently and make investments in infrastructure that they would not otherwise make. For example, \nN\northamptonshire County Council ha\ns \nintroduced \na \nRevolving\n \nI\nnfrast\nructure \nF\nund\n based on the following general principles: \nThis approach has allowed a £100m programme of projects to commence as a result of upfront funding in the order of only £10m. \n8.1\n              \nThe current lines of accountabi\nlity for decision making are very clear.  Local authorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of schemes.  The Department for Transport is responsible for allocating funding in many instances and for processing certain statutory processes (Sid\ne Roads Order and Compulsory Orders).\n  Local authorities and the Ministers (through Parliament) are ultimately responsible to the electorate.\n8.2\n              \nIn the past the local highway and transport authority would have had complete control over decision making  th\nrough due diligence and due process as a publicly accountable body responsible for the delivery and the maintenance of transport infrastructure. The system now being proposed is unnecessarily complicated and broadly as follows:\nThere is considerable scope within this process for the priorities of Local Authorities, Local Transport Bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships to be in conflict, and neither LTBs or LEPs are publicly accountable in this same way as local authorities. \n8.3\n              \nWe believe that this makes clear that the process for local decision making is much more complex than is currently the case, and we believe unnecessarily so.\n \nUnder the current system where local decisions are made by elected members the lines of \naccoun\ntability are long-established and clear.\n&#xa0;\n Subsequent to the introduction of the Single Local Growth fund decision making will reside with LEPs.\n&#xa0;\n Lines of accountability have yet to be clarified.\n&#xa0;\n For example, what would be the outcome in the event that a L\nEP and local elected members could not\n reach agreement on priorities?\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
