"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from Dr Rodger Patrick [CST0005]&#xa0;\nIntroduction:&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.   Q1: Are crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly?1.1 \nThe short answer to \nboth \nthese questions is \n“\nno\n”.\n1.2 \nThe Natio\nnal Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) was introduced in April 2002 in order to ensure that police forces across the country were recording crime to a common standard. The then \nHome \nSecretary David Blunkett stated that this was a fundamental requirement if cr\nime was to be tackled effectively.   It was also believed that it would increase trust in the police as victims’ needs would be paramount in such a system\n. The \nNCRS \nstates:\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe aim of NCRS is to&#xa0;be victim focused and maintain a consistent data set of recorded&#xa0;crime allegations across all forces.•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nFollowing the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (notifiable offence) if, on the balance of probability:•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n(a) the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law (the police will determine this, based on their knowledge of the law and counting rules), and (b) there is no credible evidence to the contrary.(Home Office 2006: Appendix A)1.3 \nPrior to the introduction of the NCRS an ‘evidential’ crime recording standard wa\ns being applied. This involved victims having to convince the police that a crime had actually occurred. \nIn effect officers were treating victims as suspects. \nThis system had a long history of abuse as officers\n \nemployed a number of dubious measures to ensu\nre \nreported crimes\n didn’t appear in the official returns. These included\n:\n&#xa0;\n1.4 \nWrongly categorising more serious crimes as lesser offences is also a way of hitting key targets such as burglary reduction. These would include\n:\n&#xa0;\n1.5 \nThese methods are collectively known in police circles as ‘cuffing’ after the magician’s art of making objects dis\nap\npear up their \nsleeve or cuff (Young 1991).\n \n1.6 \nWhist the NCRS enjoyed a brief period of success from 2002-2004 it suffered from a re\n-\ninterpretation from 2004 onwards. \nThis \ncan be traced back to\n the \nthen Prime Minister Tony Blair’s \ninitiative\n to reduce street crime. Dur\ning this \noperation\n,\n involving the twelve forces with high robbery rates\n,\n it became evident that victims of robberies involving mobile phones were reporting these offences sometime after the incident. It was also discovered that mobile phone providers were \nadvising victims to report \ntheir \nphones \nas \nstolen in order to validate their insurance\n claim\n. \nDespite the evidence from the British Crime Survey that victims of robberies are reluctant to report\n \nthe\nse crimes\n to the police\n,\n \nwith \nonly \n51%\n reporting \n robber\nie\ns to the police \n(\nDodd et al 2004:38)\n, \nthose officers co\n-\nordinating the street crime initiative convinced themselves that a high percentage of reported robberies were false reports in pursuit of bogus insurance claims. This led to the introduction of ‘false\n reporting’ policies which required victims to prove the\ni\nr report was genuine. In effect a return to an ‘evidential’ crime recording standard. \n1.7 \nThis in turn led to a re-interpretation of the NCRS where the \noverriding \nvictim focussed emphasis was replac\ned by the secondary conditions\n,\n \ninitially \nrelating to third party reports, based on a ‘balance of probability’ test carried out by the police. The evidence (Patrick 2011a) suggests this re-interpretation spread from robberies to all offences and then from \nforce to force.  The impact on the recorded crime rates is evident from the analysis of Nottinghamshire’s recorded crime\n profile (Fig. 1)\n  \n1.8 \nThe Nottinghamshire data (Fig 1) shows a significant rise in 2001 corresponding with an HMIC inspection report\n (HMIC/Notts 2001) criticising their recording procedures which were clearly based on an ‘evidential’ standard. The sudden fall in 2004/05 corresponds with the introduction of false reporting procedures and would suggest a return to the previous ‘evidentia\nl’ standard of crime recording.    \n  \n1.9 \nSimilar patterns are \nclear\n from an analysis of other forces where evidence of a shift back to an ‘evidential’ standard and associated ‘cuffing’ has emerged.  \nA report in the Daily Mail \n( 6.5.08) contained a revelat\nion from a police ‘whistle blower’ that officers in Norfolk had been instructed not to record reports of criminal damage unless the victim could prove it was not accidental\n. This \nhad a dramatic impact on the levels of criminal damage in that force (Fig. 2)\n. Again the return to pre NCRS levels is significant.  \n  \n \n \n(FIG. 2)\n1.10 \nMore recently the Police and Crime Commissioner of Gwent cited un\n-\nreliable crime recording as grounds for asking the Chief Constable to retire\n.\n The \nHMIC audit of crime recording procedures suggested \n‘cuffing’ was occurring:\n              “HMIC looked at 120 incidents logged by Gwent Police. Seventeen had been wrongly               closed without a crime being raised, which indicated that crime recording in Gwent gives               cause for concern.” HMIC/Gwent 20121.11 \nThe same report indicated recorded crimes were also being wrongly categorised\n and the authors were \nclear on where the blame lay:\n              “The quality of crime and incident data would be significantly improved if there were               greater clarity and focus from chief officers and the police authority on the importance of               the issue.” HMIC/Gwent 20121.12 \nFurther\n evidence of ‘cuffing’ emerged in Kent in 2012 when HMIC investigated the force \nafter\n an officer ‘blew the whistle’ on\n ‘gaming’ \nbehaviours designed to improve the detection rate. \n1.13 \nThe Chief Constable of Kent, who had previously served in Norfolk, announced his retirement in October 2013\n.\n \n1.14 The \nresearch on which this submission is based\n w\nas\n recently corroborated by a report from the Office for National Statistics: \n              “Given the consistent pattern, one possible hypothesis is that there has been a gradual               erosion of compliance with the NCRS such that a growing number of crimes reported to the               police are not being captured in crime recording systems. There are a range of possible               drivers for this including: &#xa0;              • lack of awareness or adequate understanding of the NCRS as time passes from its launch               leading to some officers recording ‘as charged’ or ‘if detected’ which might result from               staff turnover and lack of sufficient on-going training; &#xa0;              • performance pressures associated with targets (e.g. to reduce crime or increase               detection rates) acting as perverse incentives for some crimes to be downgraded from               notifiable into non-notifiable categories or as ASB or as crime-related incidents (which are               not captured in data returned to the Home Office); &#xa0;              • though forces have continued with their own internal audits, the cessation of               independent audits from 2006/07 onwards may have reduced the focus on addressing non-              compliance; &#xa0;              • the move to Neighbourhood Policing in recent years may also have led to more low level               crimes being dealt with informally and outside the formal crime recording system; and, &#xa0;              • in the context of pressure on police budgets and a general policy shift to promote greater               officer discretion, a return to a more evidential recording model”                                                                                                                 (Flatley and Bradley 2013:12)&#xa0;1.15 \nWhilst th\nis\n submission is technical \nin nature, \nthe human cost of such perverse behaviour should not be overlooked. The failure to record crimes prevents \noffences\n being investigated and offenders brought to justice. \n In a number of cases this has \nallowed \ncriminals\n \nfre\ne rein to commit serious crimes, including murder\n. \n \nIn 2006 the IPCC investigated the contact Colette Lynch had with Warwickshire police prior to her death. In this case it emerged Warwickshire officers failed to record \nand investigate a report of criminal\n damage involving the victim’s estranged partner. The IPCC made the following comment on the force’s crime recording procedures:\n “A review should be undertaken of the extent to which those who are required to implement the policies on domestic violence, crime recording and call handling are aware of their responsibilities.” (IPCC 2006:5)     &#xa0;\n1.16 \nThe impact of such an unsympathet\nic response to victims \nis encapsulated by the \nexperience of \nthe parents of \none Birmingham schoolboy\n,\n who was robbed at \ngunpoint:\n&#xa0;\n“The  couple claim they were told they could sign a form to say they had made a false report and pay an £80 fine – or face a court summons” (Lillington Birmingham Post 15.7.12)  \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;2. Q2. What are the factors which can influence mis-recording of crime?&#xa0;\n2.1 Performance Management as a system of control has since its inception been vulnerable to ‘gaming’ type behaviours A\nr\ngy\nr\nis a leading expert conclud\ned\n:\n&#xa0;\n              “the dream of many management information system designers is to design a               tamper-              proof, guaranteed-to-catch-the-culprit information system.  If they succeed, they will also               succeed in superimposing on defensive routines a control system that will call the               individuals to new heights of creativity on how to bypass the threatening features of the               information system.” (Argyris 1985:147) &#xa0;2.2 The advent of ‘false reporting’ pol\nicies and associated re-interpretation of the NCRS is an example of this theory in action.\n The fact that Performance Management systems are a threat to the leadership of the service explains the involvement of \nc\nhief \no\nfficers in the re-interpretation of the\n NCRS. Once th\ne NCRS\n was undermined\n \nthen pressure could be applied throughout the system to ensure that \nobstacles were placed in the way of victims and offic\ners under-record\ned\n crime\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nOfficers are fully aware of how the system operates and also know \nthat if something goes wrong then senior officers will deny any knowledge or complicity\n.\n This phenomenon is referred to as\n ‘organisational hypocrisy’ (Ericson 1981).\n2.4 \nResearch has also established that \nsending an officer to assess every report of crime \nresults in less crimes being recorded: \n“It seems plausible that crime allegations dealt with by telephone investigation are more likely to be accepted ‘at face value’ by the police. By comparison, it is inevitable that where police officers do attend crime scenes they will be in a position to be more discriminating about allegations made” (Burrows et 2000:28)&#xa0;&#xa0;2.5 \nThey went on to conclude\n:\n“If the hypothesis posed by the research team – that forces which attend more crime scenes will tend to record fewer crime allegations (or categorise offences more rigorously) – is credible, this factor is likely to influence that force’s low crime rate” (Burrows et al 2000:29).2.6 \nThis could explain why sending an officer to every reported crime has been adopted by a \nnumber of forces claiming impressive reductions in recorded crime\n e.g. Merseyside, Essex \nand\n Kent\n. Of course this policy is \npresented\n as good practice in customer care.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3. Q3. Are the right checks in place to ensure that the systems for recording crime function effectively and accurately?&#xa0;3.1 \nThe evidence presented above demonstrates that quality control systems have consistently failed to ensure reliable data. However the re\n-\ninterpretation of the NCRS to an universal ‘balance of possibility’ standard \nmakes the task of any auditor extremely difficult. To question the judgment o\nf\n an officer who has attended the scene of an incident and decided a crime has not occurred is a time consuming task \npo\ntentially\n \ninvolving re\n-contacting\n the \nvictim.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nThe data \nquality checks carried out by the Audit Commission did provide a degree of independent scrutiny however they were discontinued with the demise of the organisation.\n \nThe\ni\nr report on the falling standards at the Met \n(Audit Commission\n/\nMPS 2007\n)\n \ncorresponded with a \n6\n% reduction in recorded crime\n in that force. This\n was exposed by Andrew Gilligan in the London Evening Standard \n(17.4.08)\n.\n \n \n \n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nThe Home Office also used to carry out validation checks on \npolice recording rates\n as part of the Nation\nal Crime Survey. However they stopped \npublishing the results \nin 2006 \nwhen it \nbecame\n clear \nrecording rates were falling\n:\n     \n&#xa0;\n“Comparing with the previous year, there have been reductions in the estimated recording rate for burglary (77% to 64%), bicycle theft (62% to 54%) and robbery (53% to 44%)” (Walker et al 2006:47)3.4 In 2005 I had alerted the National Crime Registrar to t\nhe suspicion that the NCRS was being interpreted literally and the ‘balance of probability’ rule applied to all reports. This senior statistician’s role was to oversee and offer guidance on the NCRS and at that time he was of the opinion that victim sovere\nignty was still the overriding consideration and the ‘balance of probability’ test was only to be used in relation to third party reports\n. However\n at a further meeting in 2006 the same individual confirmed the ‘balance of probability’ test was in fact bein\ng applied universally.  It should be noted that at the time of the second meeting th\nis official\n had been replaced as National Crime Registrar by a Police Superintendent on secondment\n from the Met.\n3.5 \nThe reliability of police recorded crime data has been \nthe subject of number of reviews\n;\n Smith 2006 and The National Statistician 2011. Whilst they have tended to be supportive\n,\n notes of caution have started to appear in \nlater \nreports:\n \n              \n“Despite the existence of the NCRS the quality of recorded crime data will vary as               there will always be an element of subjectivity in recording against the crime               categories,               and interpretation of the HOCR that guide that coding. Police recording policies and               processes may also vary, leading to inconsistencies in recording.” (National Statistician               June 2011:13)&#xa0;\n3.6 \nIn 2011 HMIC carried out a further National audit of crime recording standards and found little of concern (HMIC 2012). However this finding has been questioned by the results of \nthe \nreport from the Office for National Statistics \n(Flatley and Bradley 2013)\n and\n the revelations at Kent\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.7 \nThe variation in these national reports is in marked contrast to the rank and file who have consistently made disclosures exposing the fact that th\ney are being pressurised into under-recording crime.\n  \nThese regularly appear in the local press e.g. the Birmingham Mail revealed West Midlands Police had been systematically under recording shoplifting offences for years (5.2.13).  A West Midland’s office\nr contacted \n the TV show The Wright Stuff to report that crime was increasing but they, the police, weren’t recording it: she cited the ‘cuffing’ of common assaults in support of her disclosure\n \n(Channel 5: 19.7.13). \nSuch failings have been a feature of man\ny domestic homicides\n.\n \n \nThe\n Police\n Federation have also highlighted the issue at their conferences\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4. Q4. Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?&#xa0;4.1 \nThe fact that police officers are openly admitting that they are ‘fiddling the figures’ \nsuggests not enough has been done.\n&#xa0;\n4.2 The research I conducted on this topic \n(Patrick 2011b)\n \nled me to the conclusion that too close a relationship between Chief Offi\ncers of Police and those responsible for their governance and regulation led to what Hood and Bevan (2006) referred to as a Nelson’s eye approach to scrutiny. This was manifestly clear from the response to the HMIC audit of detections \n(Appendix A) \nwhich le\nd to ACPO approaching the Information Commissioner. The correspondence between ACPO and the Information Commissioner makes it self-evident th\nere was \na reluctance to expose critic\nal\n failings\n (Appendix B)\n.\n   \n&#xa0;\n4.3 \nThe shift in responsibility for publishing c\nrime statistics from the Home Office to the Office for National Statistics appears to have stimulated the report by Flatley and Bradley\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.4 The problem with the ‘looseness’ introduced to the NCRS through its re\n-\ninterpretation as an universal ‘balance of\n probability’ \nstandard\n \nneeds to be addressed\n. This can be achieved by moving to a ‘prima facia’ standard ensuring that all offences reported are recorded as crimes. In the past this approach has been adopted by forces caught manipulating their figures \nthus \ndemonstrating that if sufficiently incentivised chief officers are capable of delivering accurate data.\n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nThere needs to be \nan \neffective\n, fully \nindependent audit regime with statutory powers to inspect\n, require change and impose sanctions\n. A \nsubsta\nntially \nreformed HMIC \ncould perform\n this function.  The powers conferred on the Police and Crime Commissioners (PCC) to dismiss Chief Constables should ensure compliance. However it may be worth considering introducing legislation empowering the Home Secre\ntary to force the PCC to call an election if standards of crime recording are so poor \nthat the public cannot have confidence in the data on which they are expected to judge the force’s performance\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.6 The pressure created by performance indicators to eng\nage in ‘gaming’ behaviours could be mitigated by a radical change in emphasis on what is measured.  If the performance measures on which forces are judged were qualitative \naudit results \nand other quantitative data was viewed as for learning purposes it sho\nuld be possible to develop a knowledge based approach to policing. This approach \nwas\n advocated by Jackson \n(2005). \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5. Q.5 To what extent can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?&#xa0;5.1 \nTo base policy decisions on such un-reliable data could be counter- productive.\n \nHowever\n consistent identifiable patterns in the performance data linked to various categories of police ‘gaming’ provides a reliable means of detecting the presence of such pe\nrverse behaviours. \nThis could be used to \nfocus\n the activities of the regulatory bodies if they were so inclined.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;6. Q6. Should recorded crime statistics be classified as National Statistics?&#xa0;6.1 \nSuch a title \nconfers \nscientific \nstatus and \nan \nimpression of neutrality\n \nfor \nwhich the current data does not \nqualify\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.2 A more accurate definition would be \n“\na police statistical construct of crime in England and Wales”. \nSuch a title\n would alert users to the dangers \nof\n relying on \nthe\n data.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;References:&#xa0;Argyris C.
