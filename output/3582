[normal]Written evidence submitted by Richard Brooks LCGI, MIET[bold]I
[normal] qualified as an electrician 
[normal]having studied
[normal] in an FE college over 5 years attending evening classes
[normal] as a mature student
[normal]. This was
[normal] supported by working in industry. 
[normal]I c
[normal]ompleted Electrical 
[normal]Installation qualifications to
[normal] Level 4 and hold
[normal] a Licentiateship in Electrical Installation from the City and Guilds. Entered Further Education 15 years ago to train new electricians and have contributed to several national organisations involved in the in
[normal]dustry. This submission represents my own 
[normal]view.

[normal]In summary 
[normal]– the current scheme allows the Part P certification 
[normal]scheme 
[normal]providers to apply l
[normal]ess rigorous standards than those defined by the Sector Skills Council responsible for the industry
[normal]. Having more the one scheme provider means that the level of standard required may be interpreted differently by these organisations with membership of some
[normal] being far easier than others.  
[normal]This 
[normal]can allow
[normal] operatives who have not demonstrated sufficient competency or evidence of sufficient training to carry out electrical installation work. This can only lead to installations being installed that are inherently 
[normal]not safe.
[normal]Even the suggestion of an umbrella list/register that all persons registered with the various scheme providers automatically belong to will not address the issues raised by the committee.
