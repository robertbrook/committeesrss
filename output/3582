defaultIn summary 
default– the current scheme allows the Part P certification 
defaultscheme 
defaultproviders to apply l
defaultess rigorous standards than those defined by the Sector Skills Council responsible for the industry
default. Having more the one scheme provider means that the level of standard required may be interpreted differently by these organisations with membership of some
default being far easier than others.  
defaultThis 
defaultcan allow
default operatives who have not demonstrated sufficient competency or evidence of sufficient training to carry out electrical installation work. This can only lead to installations being installed that are inherently 
defaultnot safe.
defaultEven the suggestion of an umbrella list/register that all persons registered with the various scheme providers automatically belong to will not address the issues raised by the committee.
