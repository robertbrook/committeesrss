[normal]Part 2:  Fraud[bold] and exaggeration[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.19 [bold]ATE provider DAS reports that whilst defendant 
[normal]liability insurers routinely[bold] 
[normal]allege fraud[bold] in hundreds of their cases, in only a small proportion of those allegations are they substantiated.  Whilst liability insurers regularly use this tactic, it does not mean that there is a general issue with fraud. In 2010, DAS 80e had only 6 cases where th
[normal]e allegations could not be refuted and those cases were therefore discontinued. Given DAS’s case load in 2010, this represents 
[normal]a rate of less[bold] than 
[normal]0.018%.[bold]  ARAG encounters fraud in 0.02% of cases, a similar percentage. Most of these relate to either staged
[normal] accidents or exaggerated claims. Their typical costs liability as a consequence is in excess of £10,000. Templeton report that they have only had to repudiate around a dozen claims in the last 12 months on the basis of misrepresentation of the facts.
[normal] [bold]The 
[normal]Experian Fraud Index (July 2011) also confirmed the real figures: only 
[normal]12 in every 10,000 [bold]applications and claims
[normal].
