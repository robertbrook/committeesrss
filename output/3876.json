"&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThese submissions deal with government proposals to overturn carefully thought out rules and approaches developed over decades by the independent judiciary and to restrict civil society organisations from using the law effectively to protect those who are \nunable to protect themselves\n.    \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nproposed \nchanges to\n funding and standing for\n judicial review will be a disaster for\n penal reform, civil society and\n the safety and rights of \nthose in contact with the law whether as defendants or victims, including c\nhildren\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFounded in 1866, the Howard League for Penal Reform is the oldest penal reform charity in the world. The Howard League has \nsome \n7,000 members, including prisoners and their families, lawyers, criminal\n justice professionals and academics. The Howard League has consultative status with both the United Nations and the Council of Europe. It is an independent charity and accepts no grant funding from the UK government. \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Howard League campaigns for less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. We achieve these objectives through conducting and commissioning research \nand investigations aimed at revealing underlying problems and discovering new solutions to issues of public concern. The Howard League’s objectives and principles underlie and inform the charity’s parliamentary work, research, legal and participation work \nas well as its projects.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince 2002 the Howard League has provided the only legal service dedicated to representing children in custody. We also provide a dedicated legal service for young adults in prison (under 21\n years of age\n) and, where appropriate, \ncomment on the particular considerations that are required to ensure that this age group is dealt with fairly and appropriately.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have therefore drawn upon our lawyers’ experience in practice as well as our expertise in this policy area when submittin\ng this written evidence\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1\n              \nThis submission illustrates the grave consequences of the proposal by providing an in depth analysis of the impact of a\n judicial review brought by the Howard League for Penal Reform in 2002, \nThe Queen (on the \nApplication of the Howard League) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Department of Health\n [2003] 1 FLR 484\n [‘The \nChildren Act\n case’]\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nThe proposed restriction on standing would have prevented the Howard League for Penal reform \nfrom b\nringing this case.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nAs \nset out below\n, there is considerable evidence that the impact of this case was wide-ranging and important. \nWhere there is a genuine public interest, it can only be right and proper \nin\n a civil\n society that\n organisations have the o\npportunity to bring these pivotal cases to court. The judiciary must be allowed to exercise their constitutional function to provide \njudicial scrutiny of important issues brought to the\nir att\nention by organisations as well as individuals.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe issues in t\nhe \nChildren Act \ncase\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nIn this case, the Howard League for Penal reform challenge\nd\n the legality of the Secretary of State's policy guidance on the treatment of children\n under 18 years of age held in Young Offender I\nnstitutions. The Secretary of State \nhad asserted in Prison Service Order No 4950\n, which governed the regime for children detained in Young Offenders’ Institutions,\n that the\n Children Act 1989 \ndid not apply in respect of such children. \nWe argued that \npolicy guidance was wrong in law. The main \nissues for determination were the extent to which the 1989 Act applied to children in \nY\noung \nO\nffender\ns’\n \nI\nnstitutions, the legality of the Secretary of State's treatment of juveniles in \nYoung Offender I\nnstitutions \nand whether child protection work in \nY\noung \nO\nffender\ns’\n \nI\nnstitutions should be led by local authorities. \n&#xa0;\n3.5\n              \nThe judicial review was successful.  The Court held \nthat although the \n1989 Act did not confer or impose any powers or obligations on the Secretary of State or the Prison Service, the duties o\nwed by a local authority to juveniles under s\nection \n17\n (duties towards ‘children in need’)\n and s\nection \n47\n (duties towards children at risk of serious harm)\n of the Act did not cease merely because a juvenile was in a young offender institution. However, a local authority's powers and duties under the Act took effect and operated subject to the necessary requirements of imprisonment.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nThis meant that chi\nldren in prison were not offenders to be treated differently from children in the community\n,\n but children who were entitled as a matter of law to full rights under the Children Act 1989.  This meant that if they were in need and appeared to the local autho\nrity to require help to prevent the any further impairment to their health and development, the local authority was required to provide it under s\nection \n17 of the Children Act 1989.  Similarly, if there was reason to believe a child was at risk of serious \nharm, the local authority where the prison was based was required as a matter\n of law to investigate this.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.               Impact of the case on policy, practice and children’s lives&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe judgment itself identified the specific vulnerabilities of children in prison\n (\nparagraph 10)\n:\n&#xa0;\n“\n[Children in custody] are, on any view, vulnerable and needy children. Disproportionately they come from chaotic backgrounds. Many have suffered abuse or neglect”. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs a result of this \nruling, the law changed as reflected in a raft of pol\nicies and \nreferences\n to the case in government guidance.  For i\nnstance, following the case, Prison S\nervice \nO\nrder 4950 was \namended so that Governors/D\nirectors of \nYoung Offender Institutions\n \nwere required to ‘have regard to the policies, agreed by the Prison Service and the \nYouth Justice Board\n for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of chil\ndren held in custody’ (‘Working T\nogether\n’\n, 2006:12)\n.  As a result every single \nYouth Offender Institut\ne\n \nmust\n have a child protection protocol\n and mechanisms to ensure child protection and the welfare of children in custody\n.  \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to the Working Together guidance\n (2006) these arrangements include, amongst other things, the following measures: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn due course, social workers were introduced into \nYouth Offender Institutes\n to assist in compliance with duties under the Children Act 1989.\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nrelationship between \nthese changes \nand the \nChildren Act\n case \nare outlined on the Ministry of J\nustice’s website as follows:\n“On 29 November 2002, Mr Justice Munby judged that the Children Act (1989) should apply to children detained in young offender institutions (YOIs), that duties owed by local authorities continue to be owed to children in YOIs a\nnd that human rights legislation, particularly the Human Rights Act (1998), applies to children in custodial facilities.\n“\nThe report, \nThe Application of the Children Act (1989) to Children in Young Offender Institutions\n&#xa0;\nexamines the application of the \nChildren Act to children in custody, in light of this judgement.\n“\nThe\n&#xa0;\nNational Children’s Bureau\n \n(NCB) has produced a document entitled\n&#xa0;\nTell them not to forget about us\n a guide to practice with looked-after children in custody. Aimed primarily at children’s services authorities, this guide will also be of use and in\nterest to secure estate and YOT staff as it outlines roles and responsibilities for all partnership agencies.\n“\nThe revised\n&#xa0;\nWorking Together\n [guidance] provides further detail on how secure establishments and local authorities should discharge their statutory duties. Importantly, agreed procedures must be in place between secure establishments and those local a\nuthorities (in particular the LSCB) that have secure establishments in their area, outlining how to deal with and undertake child in need assessments and child protection allegations. LSCBs will have oversight of the safeguarding arrangements within secure\n settings in their area.\n“\nIn discharging these duties, local authority children’s social care services should consider seconding social workers to work in secure establishments and establish effective links with a child or young person’s home local authori\nty. The home local authority and YOT have continuing responsibilities to children and young people in custody.\n“\nThe Working Together document includes further details for secure providers on how to effectively work with young people who are looked after as\n well as arrangements for successful transitions between custodial establishments and community services.”\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt should be noted that Working Together is statutory guidance that must be followed in relation to child protection issues.\n \nThese changes represented a sea change in the way in which children in prison were considered.  In \na report\n by the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Local Government Association and the Youth Justice Board,  \nThe Application of the Children \nAct (1989) to Children in Young Offender Institutions\n (2003) at page 2 it was noted that prior to the judgment:\n“\nonce inside a prison, it appeared that children lost the entitlement to services under the Children Act 1989, to health provision from local he\nalth authorities, and to education services from local education authorities…It seemed to be a case of “out of sight, out of mind.”’\n&#xa0;\n5.               The legal impact of the Children Act (1989) case &#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the judgment, the case has been cited in over 20 other cases\n \nand has become a key case in the interpretation of children’s rights.  This is because in passing judgment Mr Justice Munby affirmed that \nin his view the rights contained in the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child and t\nhe European Charter \ncan ‘\nproperly be consulted insofar as they proclaim, reaffirm or elucidate the content of those human rights that are generally recognised\n throughout the European family of nations, in particular the nature and scope of those fundamental rights that are guaranteed by the European Convention\n’ (para\ngraph\n 51). \n6.               Why was the case brought by the Howard league for Penal Reform &#xa0;6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the point wh\nen the charity brought this claim, it did not provide legal services to young people, as it now does.  However, the charity carefully considered in liaison with expert counsel whether or not this challenge should be brought \ninstead \nof \nby \na child affected. \n The charity decided to bring the case as an organization in order to ensure a thorough review of the principles \nin\n issue.  A claim on behalf of an individual child may or may not have arisen\n – that was not an issue that the charity had any control of.  Ho\nwever, it would have appeared \nwrong in principle to wait for a child to be at real risk of failures by the system to protect his or her welfare and there would have been a real danger that the litigation would become focused on that individual \n‘\nrisk child\n’\n rather than the systemic issues that affected all children in custody.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn any event the Court was in \nno \ndoubt as to the appropriateness of the charity bringing these important issues to its attention.  Mr Justice Munby stated:\n&#xa0;\n “\nThe proceedings have been brought by The Howard League for Penal Reform whose history and credentials need no introduction. It undoubtedly is, as it claims to be, the leading non-governmental organisation in this country concerned with penal issues and pol\nicy. Here I need only to note that in the last decade or so it has had a particular focus on children and young people in the criminal justice system. \n“\nIt is not disputed by the defendant that the Howard League has a “sufficient interest” in the matter so\n as to give it locus to make the current application: \nR v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ex p World Development Movement Ltd \n[1995] 1 WLR 386 and \nR v Somerset County Council ex p Dixon \n[1998] Env LR 111.\n”\n \n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSince the judgment, the \nHoward League for Penal Reform legal service has developed and now represents many individual children and young people in or affected by the criminal justice system every year. Where appropriate, we have represented individual children and young people in\n judicial reviews concerning issues that directly affect them, as well as raising issues of public importance.  Many of these cases have relied and built on the principles set out in the judgment. Whilst it is recognised that there will only be rare occasi\nons when it is appropriate and necessary for an organisation such as the Howard League for Penal Reform to bring a legal challenge in its own right, it is essential that such an approach remains an option\n&#xa0;7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConclusion&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnder the proposed regime, the Howard \nLeague for Penal Reform would have been unable to bring thi\ns judicial review to court. Even if the \nsafeguarding policies and promotion of safety across the entirety of the secure estate\n had been introduced as a matter of good practice, it would not have ha\nd a statutory footing.  Children\n would not be \nentitled to be protected and assessed under the Children Act 1989 while in detention.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe opportunity facilitated by the Howard League for \nPenal\n Reform for the Court to consider these important issues and to c\nlarify the law had a major impact on the development of law, policy and practice in \nthis important area.  Any rules to restrict the ability of the Court to determine important issues of law raised by \norganis\nations such as the Howard League for Penal Reform\n should be resisted.  The Courts are best placed to determine these issues and to continue to exercise their discretion wisely and appropriately.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe would be willing to provide oral evidence if required.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nReferences&#xa0;The Association of Directors of Soci\nal Services, The Local Government Association and The Youth Justice Board\n \n(2003) \nThe Application of the Children Act (1989) to Children in Young Offender Institutions\n, \nLondon.
