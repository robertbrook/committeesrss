[[[CQ 14)]]]

[[[Introduction]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]My name is Mrs Daphne Havercroft. I present this evidence on behalf of the South West Whistleblowers Health Action Group. We are a group of patients and members of the public based in the Bristol area. We seek honesty and public accountability from NHS organisations. Most of us have some experience of making CQC aware of potential patient safety concerns and its response to those concerns. &#xa0;

[[[Executive Summary ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]It has been an eventful year for CQC and we welcome its willingness to engage with patients and the public to inform its strategy. We also welcome CQC's reappointment of Kay Sheldon as a Non-Executive Director, and its appointment of James Titcombe as its National Advisor on Patient Safety. The purpose of this written evidence is to focus on CQC's success in translating words into action, particularly in the face of an NHS culture which seems to have changed little despite the lessons of Mid Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay. We appreciate that the Committee does not investigate individual cases. However we mention some cases as examples to illustrate the points made.&#xa0;

[[[Evidence]]]&#xa0;1.

[[[ ]]]Our perception is that the distinction between CQC's and Monitor's regulatory roles in respect of patient safety and clinical and corporate governance still needs to be made much more clear to patients and the public and be shown to work effectively. There is still far too much opportunity for regulators to “pass the buck” and achieve nothing at the cost of patient safety.&#xa0;2. Since the last Accountability Hearing CQC has undertaken consultations with the public on its strategy. This included a half day meeting in Bristol. None of our members attended for two reasons. Firstly it was held during the day making it impossible for people at work during the day to attend unless they took time off. Secondly the event was publicised locally by staff who are regarded as associated with the “old” CQC regime which was perceived as having a much too cosy relationship with local NHS organisations. &#xa0;3. We are concerned that there is a risk that CQC will only take seriously the intelligence it receives from Healthwatch, which we understand calls itself the “consumer champion”. We have seen no evidence that our local Healthwatch organisations are capable of undertaking a “consumer champion” role. Several of them seem only to comprise the paid staff of a voluntary sector organisation which is a contractor to local NHS and Local Authorities. It is perceived as having far too close a relationship with them to be an effective Healthwatch.&#xa0;4. In October 2012 CQC served a warning notice on the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children (BRHC) because its inspectors found that it had failed to meet three essential standards of quality and safety covering staffing levels, staff training and support, and the overall care and welfare of patients. &#xa0;5. However CQC only conducted the inspection after parents of children who died at the Hospital in 2012 formally complained to it. The warning notice was lifted a few weeks later when the Hospital reduced the number of operations in line with its bed capacity. &#xa0;6. Through Freedom of Information requests we now know that the BRHC was, by its own admission, the only one of the current 10 designated hospitals providing paediatric cardiac surgery services without a dedicated paediatric cardiac high dependency unit (HDU). &#xa0;7. CQC has shown no appetite to investigate the background to why the BRHC was the only designated paediatric cardiac hospital without a paediatric cardiac HDU and whether this put patients at higher risk of unsafe care than in peer hospitals. We would expect CQC to ask its Chief Inspector of Hospitals to look at this, but it has not done so. &#xa0;8.

[[[ ]]]Failure to respond to the issues described in points 4–7 inclusive above cannot be blamed on the previous CQC leadership. They were raised with CQC under its current leadership.&#xa0;9. This afternoon (15th October 2013) we are presenting a public forum statement to Bristol City Council's Health Scrutiny Committee concerning information which has emerged indicating that the Bristol Royal Infirmary may be in breach of safe staffing levels for paediatric pathology. The issue of safe staffing levels for Bristol's paediatric pathology service has existed since 2001, when Bristol was facing the aftermath of the Kennedy Inquiry into child heart deaths and when a current Senior Medical Advisor to CQC was the Hospital's Medical Director. We have copied our statement to CQC. We wait to see its response in the light of the Committee's remarks to it that if it is “to genuinely treat feedback from the public as free intelligence then it must show that it can act swiftly on intelligence when serious complaints are made.” &#xa0;10. In the 2012 accountability hearing the Committee discussed the importance which CQC inspectors should attach to making an assessment of the professional culture of organisations which provide health and social care. It said “a key element of this assessment should be a judgement about the ability of professional staff within the organisation to raise concerns about patient care and safety issues without concern about the personal implications for the staff member concerned. An organisation which does not operate on this principle does not provide the context in which care staff can work in a manner which is consistent with their professional obligations. It should therefore be refused registration by the CQC”. &#xa0;11. Another key element of the assessment of the professional culture of organisations must be the response of NHS organisations towards patients and members of the public who raise concerns. We have seen some staff intimidated and bullied into silence and experienced the animosity directed towards us by leaders of NHS organisations when we take up patient safety concerns that their staff have become too frightened to pursue. &#xa0;12. Three of our members are also public members of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. We should not have to raise our concerns about its paediatric pathology staffing in a Council Meeting. We should be able to raise them with the Trust's public and patient governors and have them taken seriously. We cannot do this. It is impossible to contact the public and patient governors without going through the Trust. It is impossible to have meetings and conversations with public and patient governors without them being chaperoned by the Trust Board Secretary. The Trust Board Chair (as is the statutory role of all Foundation Trust Chairs) also chairs the Governors' Membership Council, thereby having the opportunity to control and influence its meeting agendas and discussions. Consequently the extent to which a Foundation Trust Board holds itself accountable to patients and the public depends entirely on the extent to which it chooses to do so.&#xa0;13. The Department of Health's response to the Committee's recommendations on whistleblowing and examination of the professional culture of organisations was that it accepted them and looked to CQC to consider and evaluate how and if they could practically be integrated into its inspection regime.&#xa0;14.

[[[ ]]]CQC accepted the Committee's recommendations on whistleblowing and assessment of organisational culture. However in our opinion CQC has not started to scratch the surface of this issue. If it is to fully embrace the skills and experience of people like Kay Sheldon and James Titcombe, it must urgently work with them to implement a process during its inspections to assess the culture of organisations and their treatment of staff, patient and public whistleblowers. These assessments must start by the New Year 2014 if patients and the public are to have any confidence in CQC’s ability to root out and expose unacceptable organisational cultures of bullying and suppression of whistleblowers.&#xa0;

[[[Recommendations ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We thank the Committee for the opportunity to provide written evidence to inform its 2013 Accountability Review with CQC. We recommend that it refers to our evidence to explore with CQC its progress on translating words into action. We also recommend that the Committee focuses on its 2012 recommendations to the CQC on whistleblowing and assessment of organisational culture because we perceive that little or no progress has been made to implement an action plan in response to these specific recommendations. This is an unacceptable and ongoing risk to public protection and patient safety. &#xa0;October 2013&#xa0;
