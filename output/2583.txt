[[[The extent of white working class pupils’ educational underachievement.]]]1.1. We share the Government’s concern about the underachievement of children and young people from a white working class background and young people. We would argue that this should be a strategic priority from early years through to higher education. However, it is our view that  this is a difficult question to answer empirically as the group under discussion do not exist as a clearly identifiable statistical cohort.&#xa0;1.2. While we cannot separate out children and young people from a white working class background we can analyse achievement for children in receipt of Free School Meals.  An analysis of three years of data for Buckinghamshire by FSM for white British boys and girls, compared to all boys and girls with and without FSM shows is that:•              For non-FSM pupils, at both Key Stages 2 and 4, White British are above or at the average for all FSM pupils•              For FSM pupils, the same is broadly true at KS2, although there was a dip for WB pupils in English in 2011•              For FSM pupils at KS4, generally the White British pupils are below the overall average for FSM.•              There is a very big gender gap for FSM pupils both in English at KS2 and overall at KS4. This applies overall and to White British pupils, with girls outperforming boys.1.3. Therefore the worst performing group are White British boys with FSM at KS4. In 2012 only 24% attained 5+ A*-C Inc. E/M, (White British girls 41) - both are lower than the overall average for FSM pupils (28% boys, 44% girls), which as we know was in itself very low. Results for WB FSM boys went down from 2011 to 2012, results for girls went up. 1.4. However, we would caution about using eligibility for free school meals as anything more than a proxy indicator for this issue. There will be significant number of children who may be classified as working class using other indicators who are not eligible for free school meals and a further group eligible for Free School Meals who would not be categorised as working class. Using free school meals also excludes examining the impact of underachievement in Early Years.1.5. In Public Health, when looking at the impact of measure to stop people smoking, they defined a working class cohort by looking at categories of employment – in this case routine and manual workers.1.7. Recommendation: to target interventions at a group who would be identified as White Working Class, there is a need for a nationally adopted statistical definition which enables analysis of achievement and the impact of interventions.

[[[The factors responsible for white working class pupils’ ]]]

[[[educational underachievement, including the impact of home and family.]]]&#xa0;2.1. We are convinced that factors in families and communities have a significant impact on patterns of educational achievement from Early Years onwards. 2.2. The research published in A Long Division (IPPR 2012) and elsewhere showing that schools can make 20% difference to narrowing gaps but that factors outside school lead to 80% of any gaps in achievement. In projects such as the Aylesbury Standards Project (ASPIRE) and interventions in Chesham, we are also working to develop family and community support for learners. 2.3. We would not want to generalise about the factors in families and communities that lie behind the impact of families and communities on the achievement of white working class children. Organisations such as The Roundtree trust and researchers such as Steve Strand have explored this issue. We would also commend the background papers supporting the 2013 Ofsted Unseen Child particularly the paper by Dennis Mongon, Educational Attainment: White British Students from Low Income Backgrounds (DfE 2013).2.4. Mongon identifies school interventions that make a difference:We are using these three areas as cornerstones of our work to raise achievement for white working class and other underachieving groups.2.5.i  Discussions with Secondary Headteachers have recommended that consideration is given to the different challenges for rural and urban students from a white working class background. The impact of relative deprivation by comparison with the community you live with is distinct from being member of a community where a larger number are from a similar social and economic context. This can be ,manifest in a more significant lack of aspiration and less experience of, and belief in,  the possibility and potential of social mobility. 2.5.ii. School leaders felt that we do not know enough about the impact of social change on rural white working class learners. More needs to be done to understand the effect of changes in the ethnic make-up of rural communities and the increased success and prosperity of young people form ethnic minority backgrounds. There is a hypothesis that white working class communities  is a rural environment may be less well integrated into patterns of social change that are accepted in urban communities and, as a result, are less well equipped, and less positive about,  social or geographical mobility2.6. We interviewed Headteachers from three Aylesbury Primary schools which serve less advantaged communities. In 2011/12 each of these schools had an achievement gap for students eligible for FSM that was both narrower than national or where this cohort achieved more highly that other pupils in the school. They were unanimously of the view that, as well as providing  a good quality of teaching and learning,  their success was the result of  a strong and cohesive pastoral care system that supported children in such a way that they were ready to learn when they were in the classroom. 2.7.i. The importance of pastoral support was echoed by the secondary sector. Here it was argued that the achievement of all students from less advantaged backgrounds could be, and is, enhanced by an on-going, targeted, evidence based focus on removing barriers to learning and aspiration. 2.7.ii. This would include a relentless focus on monitoring attendance, working in partnership with families, engaging with health professionals to support physical and mental health, with the police in targeting support for at risk students and promoting restorative justice. 2.8 It is our view that those working in education from the earliest years to the end of the secondary phase need to work to engage with families and communities, to know the families in the communities they serve and to build powerful relationships.2.9. It was felt that changes to the Ofsted framework over the last 18 months have reduced the significance and celebration of high quality pastoral care as a pre-requisite for student achievement, particularly for children and young people from less advantaged backgrounds.&#xa0;

[[[Whether the problem is significantly worse for white working class boys than girls.]]]3.1. The data on FSM reflects the experience of schools that the issue is more pronounced for boys and girls, but girls do, nonetheless, present cause for concern.&#xa0;

[[[What steps schools can take to improve the educational outcomes and attainmen]]]

[[[t of white working class pupils?]]]4.1. We are supporting and promoting the interventions championed by the Sutton Trust, the Education Endowment fund and in The Unseen Child report and its supporting papers. These are a key element of our strategies to ensure Pupil Premium has an impact on standards and on narrowing the gap for all underachieving groups.4.2. We also believe that investing in good relationships with families and communities and strong pastoral care for children are key strategies.4.3. We are convinced of the importance of early intervention and of coherent, joined up provision and collaboration between early years, primary and secondary phases across communities. &#xa0;

[[[The potential for a wider range of educational approaches, for example vocational pathways, to improve outcomes for white working class pupils.  ]]]5.1. An issue identified by schools and other educational professionals is the need for a greater celebration of a wider range of success and achievement. 5.2Currently, success is defined according to levels of educational achievement with a dis-proportionate focus on access to selective universities. 5.3.i. While we fully endorse and support attempts to raise aspirations and widen participation in further and higher education and selective universities we would also argue that developing a successful career or business or developing the skills required for manual or craft based work is equally important for a balanced society and a balanced economy. 5.3.ii. As such we would be supportive of any plans to raise the profile of apprenticeships and work based training that ensures young people are prepared both for a specific line of work but also have the independence, confidence and adaptability to change in response to evolution in the work place or changes in demand for skills.

[[[What role Government can play in ]]]

[[[delivering improved educational outcomes for white working class pupils. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.1.i) Develop a nationally adopted statistical definition of white working class learners which enables analysis of achievement and progress, the identification of areas where underachievement is most pronounced and the analysis of the impact of interventions 6.1.ii) Raise the profile of pastoral support to address emotional or behavioural barriers to learning to support the impact of high quality teaching and learning6.1. iii) Continue to support the collation and dissemination of evidence based good practice as has happened with  the Sutton Trust materials to support the use of the pupil premium.6.1. iv) Recognise and celebrate a wider range of successful outcomes of education raising the status of work and work based training at the same time as ensuring those who choose this route has a high quality educational support to ensure they can adapt to changing labour trends and technological developments6.1. v) Share and facilitate the development of best practice in building strong links between schools and communities they serve, including the development of parental hubs in schools, education programmes for parents and an increased focus of the role of parents as key partners in early years education.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
