"1\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Suffolk County Council (SRN 033)&#xa0;&#xa0;1.              Introduction&#xa0;1.1 \n              \nSuffolk County Council is th\ne Highway Authority for \nSuffolk\n and liaises regularly with the Highways Agency, particularly to discuss issues relating to the A14, the main trunk road between the \nport\n of \nFelixstowe\n and the \nMidlands\n and a key route for road hauliers. The county council believes that investment in the A\n14 urgently required \nand is vital to the future economic prosperity of the county.\n&#xa0;2.              How will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?&#xa0;2.1\n              \nSuffolk County Council welcomes the Department of Transport’s statements that it will be investing £15 billion on adding additional capacity to the \nUK\n’s strategic road network by 2021. \nIt also welcomes the \nDfT’s\n intention to spend £12 bil\nlion on maintenance and £6 billion on resurfacing. It also welcomes the ambition to bring the \nUK\n’s trunk road network up to clearly defined national standards.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nHowever, while the council recognises that these are signif\nicant amounts of funding, they s\nhould\n not be allocated \nat the expense of funds like \nthe Local Sustainable Transport Fund and the Cycle Safety Fund. Both of these funds enable local transport authorities to find ways of ensuring that the addition of capacity to the trunk road network will\n have minimal negative effects on local communities \nin the form of community severance, noise, light\n,\n and air pollution.\n \nThey also help councils encourage use of modes of travel other than the private car which are safe and have significant public health b\nenefits\n as well as reducing intra-urban traffic congestion\n.\n \nFor example, \nSuffolk County Council is using £1.5 million of the \nDfT’\ns\n Cycle Safety Fund\n to construct a pedestrian and \ncycle bridge\n across the A14 to \nreduce community \nseverance\n and increase walking and cycling within Bury St. Edmunds\n.\n \nIt is these funding streams that ensure the \nUK\n trunk road network is appropriatel\ny pedestrian and cyclist-friendly\n and they must not be stopped or reduced\n at the expense of investment that just\n ben\nefit\ns\n motorists.\n&#xa0;\n3.              How does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?&#xa0;3.1\n              \nSuffolk County Council welcomes the additional capital and revenue investment in the \nUK\n’s trunk road network. However, the council feels that\n this must be embarked upon as part of a coherent inter-urban UK transport strategy for all modes with the aim of using transport as a tool to help facilitate economic growth, but also to ensure the UK meets its environmental obligations and improves the q\nuality\n of life for local communities. \nThe council feels that a crucial part of this is to pr\novide \nhigh quality rail services between key urb\nan centres and to provide\n high quality walk and \ncycle\n facilities within all urban centres. It also believes the gove\nrnment should increase the volume of\n freight moving on to rail. \nThese measures will help free up \ncapacity on the strategic road network for the moto\nrists that have no choice but to use it\n. \n&#xa0;4.              How reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for the strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?&#xa0;4.1\n              \nThe Authors of this paper state that, because of improvements in technology and a reduction of insurance costs (in real terms), the cost of motoring will\n fall in real terms over the next 30 years\n. Consequently, \nmotor traffic, particularly on the strategic network\n, will continue to increase\n as \nstrong \neconomic growth returns. The Council agrees that there are many uncertainties when forecasting traffic growt\nh over the longer term (e.g. the way population age composition might mean a change in where different groups of people will live). The government can deal with the many uncertainties by preparing, monitoring and updating a multi-modal transport strategy w\nith focused and relevant objectives, rather than relying on the “predict and provide” approach of past governments.\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nSuffolk County Council also supports the investment of an extra £500 million between 2015 and 2021 in infrastructure to enable greater use of electric vehicles. However, while these vehicles are affective for shorter intra-urban journeys, they might not be\n as suitable for longer-distance inter-urban journeys. The Council believes that this could add further uncertainty to the department’s forecasts. Also, technological advancements within the motor car industry should not be used as a reason to reduce \nsuppo\nrt for longer distance travel by sustainable modes of transport. \n&#xa0;5.              How can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?&#xa0;5.1\n              \nSuffolk County Council welcomes the \nDfT’s\n \nintentions to invest in the different technological solutions mentioned in this document. However, it also feels that the reliability and efficiency of the strategic road network can be improved through The Highways Agency being more proactive than in the \npast in its \nengagement with local Highway Authorities and their local stakeholders\n. For example, Suffolk County Council’s own \nHighways team has found it difficult in the recent past to share with the Highways Agency its proposals to improve signage at or i\nn the vicinity of junctions connecting local roads with the A14 in the county.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nSuffolk County Council feels that greater use of technology and more proactive liaison between The Highways Agency and local Constabularies would enable quicker and more \neffective responses to accidents and faster clear-up times\n which would reduce the length of delays\n.\n&#xa0;6.              What mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be applied in the UK?&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nSuffolk County Council welcomes the aim of increasing investmen\nt in the strategic network and welcomes the intention to attract investment from sources other than the public sector at a time of public expenditure constraint. It agrees that the move towards 5-year road investment strategies \nwill give the Highways Agenc\ny, its suppliers\n,\n and contractors the financial certainty to commit to innovative ways of working \ntogether \nthat could generate operational efficiency savings.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nLooking at the exampl\nes of other countries and how their governments\n have attracted investment in their strategic road networks, the council realises that some form of direct road user charge,\n shadow toll,\n concession agreement, \nand/\nor availability payment is part of this. However, it feels that direct road user charging sh\nould only be implemented as part of a clear\n, well thought out,\n national trunk road network investment strategy and must apply to all parts of the \nUK\n network so as not to put businesses in one region at a competitive disadvantage to those in another.\n There \nmust also be a full cost benefit analysis undertaken before any of the above arrangements are introduced.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThe Council believes that a direct road user charge is the most effective and fair way to manage the demand placed on the s\ntrategic road network\n, but it mu\nst be implemented throughout the \nUK\n on a \nuniversal \npay-as-you-use basis.\n All routes containing a direct road user charge must also have \nuntolled\n alternative routes that are suitable for Heavy Goods Vehicles, as many haulage companies have a\n policy of not paying road user charges\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nShould direct road-user charging be introduced across the strategic road network, how will the \nDfT\n ensure equitable treatment for all road users in terms of charging policy? What mechanisms will be put in place\n to ensure that prices and price increases are fair and justified when there might be di\nfferent financing and contractual\n agreements across the network? For example, arrangements for the M6 toll road might be different to those of the Dartford Crossing, wh\nich might affect the price charged to the user over time.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nIt is partly for this reason that Suffolk County Council suggests that the performance of the new Strategic Highways Company be monitored by a full economic regulator with a similar remit to th\ne Office for R\nail Regu\nlation over Network Rail\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;7.              How should the Highways Agency be reformed&#xa0;to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play to ensure better management of the strategic road network?&#xa0;7.1\n              \nShould the Highways Agency be given greater operational independence from government, it needs to be properly regulated and held to account by a full economic regulator. \nThis would be particularly important should the organisation adopt one o\nf the operating models mentioned on pages 71-73 of the Action for Roads paper\n in the long term\n. \nThis organisation must \nhave the appr\nopriate powers to ensure that the company\n consults sufficiently with local authorities and local businesses before embarking\n on any investment project. For example, Suffolk County Council feels, along with other stakeholders, that the \nrecent consultation over the A14 Cambridge – Huntingdon investment package \ncould have been more effective. \nThe tone of the \nTechnical Review and O\nptions document\n, published in September 2013\n, the very short consultation time, and the lack of engagement with representatives in Suffolk, made it appear that The Highways Agency and the \nDfT\n considered the problem and possible solution to be unique to Cambridgeshire and gave scant regard to \nthe vie\nws of \nstrategic road users from outside the county. This is in spite of the considerable financial impact a road user charge would have\n on them. \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nIf the Strategic Highways Company were regulated by an organisation \nwith \nsimilar \npowers \nto the Office for\n Rail Regulation, it would at least have to show that it published market studies and business plans and gave an appropriate time for stakeholders to read and respond to them, either in writing or within a workshop envir\nonment.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n Highways Agency (2013), \nA14 Cambridge – Huntingdon Improvement Scheme: Technical Review of Options\n, (accessed online), \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/243999/a14-technical-review-of-options.pdf\n \n"
