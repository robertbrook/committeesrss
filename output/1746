defaultThis discussion note has been prepared in response to the

default&#xa0;
default2. 
defaultI am a 
defaultP
defaultarish Councillor for Cropwell Bishop
default,
default 
defaulta village with a population of around 2000 people located about 8 miles South East of Nottingham City.  
defaultAdjacent smaller villages
default 
defaultextend into the Vale of Belvoir.  
defaultTh
defaultis
default note
default 
defaultreflects the gro
defaultwing concerns and isolation felt by local people due to inadequate public transport provision.  I am
default a
default Chartered Civil Engineer (recently retired) and the comments reflect my personal perspective and frustrations as 
defaulta resident of Cropwell Bishop
default and a comm
defaultuter to Nottingham for the last 20 years.
default 
defaultThe proposals have the support and backing of the Cropwell Bishop Parish Council.
default&#xa0;
defaultSummarydefault 
default3. 
defaultBus services in village communities such as Cropwell Bishop are inadequate.  The village is just 8 miles from 
defaultNottingham but the population of around 2000 people is disadvantaged because there is no direct commuter service and no evening services connecting with the city or other local communities.
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultLocal authorities have reduced funds available to help subsidi
defaultse bus services in less populated areas. Commercial operators have little interest in less profitable semi rural services
default 
defaultbut are generally making healthy profits from their core routes. 
defaultS
defaultometimes 2 or more operators cover the same core route
default indicating po
defaulttential profits to be made.
defaultIt is considered that Improvements to semi rural bus services can be achieved at very small costs if available resources are redirected by partial regulation and licensing of local area concessions.  
defaultLicensed 
default(franchised) 
defaulto
defaultperat
defaultors would be required to provide
default agreed
default appropriate 
defaultsemi 
defaultrural service
defaults alongside their profitable core routes.
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultThese comments were 
defaultpreviously 
defaultmade to the 
defaultCompetition Commission investigating the 
defaultL
defaultocal Bus Market.  Their provisional findings report of 
defaultMay 2011 supported the use of local area or route franchise to help provide the much needed commuter and evening leisure services for the less populated semi rural areas whilst avoiding wastage by excess competition on the more densely populated, commercia
defaultlly attractive routes.
default  Unfortunately, after pressure from the major operators, the local franchise idea was not promoted in the final report of the Competition commission.
default&#xa0;
default6. 
defaultSimilar comments were 
defaultalso 
defaultpassed to the Institution of Civil Engineers request
default for comment on the proposed High Speed railway line (HS2) and a station for the East Midlands
default (April 2011)
default. 
default 
defaultThe nation desperately needs improved transportation and the proposed HS2 line 
defaultmight
default be an appropriate step forward 
defaultbut only if it is 
defaultaccessible a
defaults 
defaultpart of a
defaultn improved
default national and local integrated transport system.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe defaultLdefaultocal defaultIdefaultssuesdefault7. 
defaultAt a local level, I have been campaigning for many years to achieve 
defaultattractive
default 
defaultdirect 
defaultcommuter and evening bus services for Cropwell Bishop
default and other smaller villages in the Vale of Belvoir
default.  My commuter journey into Nottingham 
defaulttook
default approximately 55 minutes door to door using the available indirect bus services but only 35 minutes if I choose to drive my car 
default10 miles across
default 
defaultacross Nottingham

defaultU
defaultniversity
default – 
defaultN
defaultot a very ‘green
default’
default 
defaultsolution
default.
default  
defaultA direct commuter bus would reduce door to door journey times to 35 minutes – a reduction of 20 minutes.
default&#xa0;
default8. 
defaultThe local bus services are supported by generous subsidies from the County Council but 
defaultdespite the 
defaultgreater powers under the 
default2008 
defaultLocal Transport A
defaultct
default (See Appendix 2)
default, 
defaultthey seem unwilling (or unable?) to require the bus companies to provide 
defaultattractive 
defaultdi
defaultrect commuter services and evening leisure services 
defaultinto Nottingham 
defaultas part of that subsidy agreement.
default 
default(
defaultThis could
default change with current 
defaultNottinghamshire 
defaultCounty Council 
defaultTITAN project initiatives
default but we are not holding our breath
default as available funds diminish
default!
default)
default&#xa0;
default9. 
defaultFactors such as 
defaultc
defaultity parking levies, road congestion, fuel costs, and pensioner subsidies, have increased bus usage in recent years and alternative bus companies
default, such as Premiere Travel,
default moved in to try and take a share of the profits enjoyed by the e
defaultstablished companies
default (
defaultsuch as 
defaultTrent Barton)
default.  This has not really helped us in semi rural areas 
defaultlike
default Cropwell Bishop because the competition 
defaultwas
default focussed on the more populated areas of nearby C
defaultot
defaultgrave and Bingham.  It also generated unproductive ‘bus wars’
default with the sister company of 
defaultTrent Baton
default running ‘spoiling’ services with the sole intention of driving out the competition. 
defaultEventually
default 
defaultthe 
defaultsister company’s ‘spoiling’ service did force the competitor, Premiere Travel to abandon the Nottingham to Cotgrave r
defaultoutes in 2012.  The 
default‘
defaultspoiling
default’
default service stopped soon after Premiere pulled out!
default  The competing company, Premiere Travel went into liquidation, January, 2013
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default10. 
defaultAt one time in 2011, 
defaultWe 
defaulthad
default the nonsense of 3 competing buses running in to Notting
defaulth
defaultam from C
defaultropwell Bishop at 8.00am but none of them provid
defaulted
default a direct service because they 
defaultsaw
default the main revenue coming from the 
defaultC
defaultotgrave estates 
defaulte
defaultn route.
default 
defaultAfter the demise of Premiere, w
defaulte have now returned to one indirect bus at 8.00am and no other services into Not
defaulttingham until
default 
default09.26
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default11. 
defaultThe day time services into Nottingham are adequate (2 indirect buses per hour) but we have recently lost the direct link to the adjacent community of Bingham where many of our village children attend seconday school. 
default&#xa0;
default12. 
defaultOur evening 
defaultbus 
defaultservices are very poor with the last bus into Nottingham at 5.40
default pm
default and the last bus home from Nottingham at 6.00 pm.  This creates a severe isolation 
defaultof village people 
defaultfrom the work and social 
defaultopportunities
default 
defaultoffered
default by Nottingham City in th
defaulte evening
default.
default&#xa0;
default13. 
defaultIt is observed that 
defaultp
defaulteak time (7.30-8.30
default am
default) traffic flows from Cropwell Bishop towards Nottingham are over 400 vehicles per hour compared with flows of 
defaultaround 150
default vehicles per hour outside peak times.  If direct commuter buses were availab
defaultle, a proportion of the peak time private vehicle journeys would be eliminated.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultThe Solutiondefault14. 
defaultThe solution
default is to integrate our public transportation systems.  This will never happen if left to the vagaries and 
defaultcommercial 
defaultinterests 
defaultof the private opera
defaulttors and therefore a form of regulation is required.  
default&#xa0;
default15. 
defaultAn appropriate approach would be (as for London buses and the various railway concessions) for the bus companies to tender for local area concessions which would require them to run certain commut
defaulter, shopper and 
defaultevening 
defaultleisure services for the surrounding semi rural areas (such as Cropwell Bishop and the villages in the Vale of Belvoir) alongside their regular 
defaultcommercial 
defaultservices to the more populated centres (such as Cotgrave and Bingham).
default 
default An ex
defaultample of 
defaultpossible area concessions for South East Nottingham
default is presented 
defaultin the Appendixdefault.
default In the case of the ‘Cotgrave’ concession, 6 buses would provide an adequate day time, off peak service
default for the area
default, instead of the
default 
default13 used
default during the competitive ‘b
defaultus wars’
default. 
default(Since Liquidation of Premiere, Currently 5 buses running + 1 on route 50 (route 53 abandoned
default for present
default))
default&#xa0;
default16. 
defaultThe Local Authorities are under severe pressure to save money by cutting subsidised rural bus services.  The fact that 
defaulttwo
default (or even temporarily 3) bus operators are able to profit from 
defaultservice provision on the Nottingham – Cotgrave 
default (
defaultand Nottingham –Bingham
default)
default route is indicative that there if the route were assigned to one operator there would be sufficient surplus profit to s
defaultubsidise the extension of the service to the less populated village areas. 
default(Trent Barton currently run as sole operator with full buses making healthy profits!)
default.
default 
defaultRegulation 
defaultby
default the award of area concessions to operators by competitive tender would 
defaultseem to b
defaulte the best way forward to help
default fund the necessary semi rural routes with reduced cost to the public purse.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultCity Integrationdefault17. 
defaultLooking more widely at the integration of services, it is not necessary to run all buses into Nottingham.  With the much im
defaultproved passenger information and bus location controls now available, timetabled connecting services from the populated centres to the rural villages are perfectly feasible.  
default&#xa0;
default18. 
defaultWithin Nottingham itself not all buses need cross or circulate the city.  T
defaultoo many buses are currently clogging our city streets 
defaultfor example 
defaultat 
defaultParliament Street
default and 
defaultFriar Lane
default (
defaultMarket Square
default)
default.
default  
defaultA free 
defaultC
defaultentre
default L
defaultink has already been introduced and this is the right approach. 
default 
defaultSuggestions have been made to Nottingham City Council (C
defaulthris Carter) for further development of the free link 
defaultwith 
default(electric?) 
defaultbuses running in 
defaulttwo circuits
default every few minutes between key bus stations
default (hubs)
default 
defaultwhere the radial routes can terminate.
default 
default&#xa0;
default19. 
defaultProvision of the free centre link alongside the partial regu
defaultlation and letting of area concessions as suggested will mean that operators do not have to compete for passengers.  Only selected key routes need complete the city loops and operators 
defaultcould ther
defaulte
defaultby
default save some 10 – 15 minutes on many journeys.

default20. 
defaultThe improvement of the A453 between Nottingham and the M1 and East Midland airport is a high priority
default and 
defaulta
defaultfter much local pressure this scheme is now under construction.
default 
defaultIt was 
defaultunfortunate for th
defaulte region 
defaultthat the previous government chose to throw ‘fiscal stimulus’
default 
defaultmoney at the lower priority, over priced, 
default‘
defaultover engineered
default’
default A46 Newark to Widmerpool scheme with its overscaled earthworks at Str
defaulta
defaultgglethorpe and Saxondale resulting in unnecessary loss 
defaultof valuable agricultural land
default and poor energy efficiency (more fuel
default used
default, higher CO
default2
default 
defaultemissions
default) for vehicles using the 
defaultnew
default junctions
default. 
defaultWhilst giving local benefits such as improved
default, safer
default access to Newark and Leicester, 
defaultthe somewhat blinkered design of the A46 improvement has done little to help regional traffic flows 
defaultand integrated transport 
default– the A52 traffic into Nottingham is still delayed
default!
default  
default&#xa0;
default21. 
defaultThe Nottingham tram extension out towards the M1
default is currently under cons
defaulttruction.   
defaultInvestment in the tram is fine for the areas it serves but it has to be recognised that 
defaultmany areas such as 
defaultSouth East Nottingham 
defaultgain
default no direct benefit
default.  
defaultPriority should therefore be given to improvement of bus and other transportation services
default in these areas.
default&#xa0;
default22. 
defaultWhilst the 
defaultproposed 
defaultHS2 may be 
defaultsome
default help for travel between our main cities (assuming it is affordable to all) it will not address the 
defaultneeds for 
defaultregular inter
default-
defaultcity
default and 
defaultinter
default-
defaulttown
default travel or the needs of travel to and from the more isol
defaultated communities.
default  The options of longer trains, longer platforms at certain key stations and revised signalling should be carefully explored to increase capacity where overcrowding 
defaulton the current rail network 
defaultreally is an issue.
default&#xa0;
default23. 
defaultW
defaulthere existing rail c
defaultonnections are poor, there would seem to be
default much scope for a
defaultn improved
default network of intercity
default/intertown
default buses, attractively priced to draw travellers away from the private car.  When more than one person is travelling the car tends to be the obvious 
default‘value f
defaultor money’ 
defaultchoice. 
default 
defaultA 
default‘partner’
default rail/bus card could enable a partner to travel at say half fare to make the public transport journey more 
defaultfinancially 
defaultattractive
default for the pair of travellers
default?
default&#xa0;
default24. 
defaultArriving in a town or city by public transport the traveller ne
defaulteds good information for onward connections.  Perhaps subsidised taxi fares are appropriate for some rural locations
default where demand for bus services is very low?
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCdefaultonclusiondefault25. 
defaultI cannot see an efficient integrated transportation system developing within a
default free market economy.  Transport
defaultation
default is too important for the economic future of our country to be left to commercial interests alone.  It is therefore necessary to plan and regulate services at a national
default, regional
default and local level
default 
defaultso that 
defaultunnecessary dup
defaultlication is avoided and 
defaultsurplus profits from commercial operations in the more populated areas are directed towards supporting provision of 
defaultvital
default transportation in the less populated areas. 
default&#xa0;
default26. 
defaultAs
default concluded at the ICE sponsored, HS2 workshop on 6
defaultth
default April
default 2011
default,
default 
defaultif this expensive scheme is to proceed, 
defaultit must be developed within a system of improved integrated transportation for the whole nation.
default  ‘Connectivity’ is the key buzzword.
default&#xa0;
default27. 
defaultAt a local level for a village such as Cropwell Bishop, access to 
default(and
default usage of) 
defaultan East Midlands 
defaultHS2 
defaultstation 
defaultwill be rather limited.
default 
defaultI
defaultt is far more important
default 
defaultfor
default residents of the local area
default to 
defaulthave
default attractive direct commuter buses which could 
defaultcut 15 minutes off 
defaultthe
default 
defaultcurrent 45 minute journey
default time into 
defaultNottingham
default.  Improvemen
defaultts of this sort can be 
defaultachieved at very small costs
default if available resources are redirected as suggested by partial regulation and licensing of local area 
defaultconcessions

default“A form of franchising is already an option for local councils to introduce: Quality Contract Schemes enable a local transport authority to set out what bus services will be provided in a described geographical area – in effect, suspending the deregulated 
defaultmarket and replacing it with services under contract. These Schemes were introduced by the Transport Act 2000, and made easier to implement by the Local Transport Act 2008, which came into effect in 2009. The Department published guidance on Quality Contra
