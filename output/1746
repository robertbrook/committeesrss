[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence from John Greenwood (TIC 079)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Improving Public transport provision for [bold]Cropwell and the Vale of Belvoir  ([bold]South East of Nottingham[bold])[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold] [bold]1. 
[normal]This discussion note has been prepared in response to the 
[normal]call for evidence by the Transport Committee Inquiry into Passenger Transport in Isolated Communities (SCA 21/2013-14, 
[normal]27
[normal]th
[normal] June 2013)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]I am a 
[normal]P
[normal]arish Councillor for Cropwell Bishop
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]a village with a population of around 2000 people located about 8 miles South East of Nottingham City.  
[normal]Adjacent smaller villages
[normal] 
[normal]extend into the Vale of Belvoir.  
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] note
[normal] 
[normal]reflects the gro
[normal]wing concerns and isolation felt by local people due to inadequate public transport provision.  I am
[normal] a
[normal] Chartered Civil Engineer (recently retired) and the comments reflect my personal perspective and frustrations as 
[normal]a resident of Cropwell Bishop
[normal] and a comm
[normal]uter to Nottingham for the last 20 years.
[normal] 
[normal]The proposals have the support and backing of the Cropwell Bishop Parish Council.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary[bold] 
[normal]3. 
[normal]Bus services in village communities such as Cropwell Bishop are inadequate.  The village is just 8 miles from 
[normal]Nottingham but the population of around 2000 people is disadvantaged because there is no direct commuter service and no evening services connecting with the city or other local communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]Local authorities have reduced funds available to help subsidi
[normal]se bus services in less populated areas. Commercial operators have little interest in less profitable semi rural services
[normal] 
[normal]but are generally making healthy profits from their core routes. 
[normal]S
[normal]ometimes 2 or more operators cover the same core route
[normal] indicating po
[normal]tential profits to be made.
[normal]It is considered that Improvements to semi rural bus services can be achieved at very small costs if available resources are redirected by partial regulation and licensing of local area concessions.  
[normal]Licensed 
[normal](franchised) 
[normal]o
[normal]perat
[normal]ors would be required to provide
[normal] agreed
[normal] appropriate 
[normal]semi 
[normal]rural service
[normal]s alongside their profitable core routes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]These comments were 
[normal]previously 
[normal]made to the 
[normal]Competition Commission investigating the 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal Bus Market.  Their provisional findings report of 
[normal]May 2011 supported the use of local area or route franchise to help provide the much needed commuter and evening leisure services for the less populated semi rural areas whilst avoiding wastage by excess competition on the more densely populated, commercia
[normal]lly attractive routes.
[normal]  Unfortunately, after pressure from the major operators, the local franchise idea was not promoted in the final report of the Competition commission.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]Similar comments were 
[normal]also 
[normal]passed to the Institution of Civil Engineers request
[normal] for comment on the proposed High Speed railway line (HS2) and a station for the East Midlands
[normal] (April 2011)
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]The nation desperately needs improved transportation and the proposed HS2 line 
[normal]might
[normal] be an appropriate step forward 
[normal]but only if it is 
[normal]accessible a
[normal]s 
[normal]part of a
[normal]n improved
[normal] national and local integrated transport system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The [bold]L[bold]ocal [bold]I[bold]ssues[bold]7. 
[normal]At a local level, I have been campaigning for many years to achieve 
[normal]attractive
[normal] 
[normal]direct 
[normal]commuter and evening bus services for Cropwell Bishop
[normal] and other smaller villages in the Vale of Belvoir
[normal].  My commuter journey into Nottingham 
[normal]took
[normal] approximately 55 minutes door to door using the available indirect bus services but only 35 minutes if I choose to drive my car 
[normal]10 miles across
[normal] 
[normal]across Nottingham 
[normal]C
[normal]ity to the Forest 
[normal]F
[normal]ields 
[normal]‘
[normal]park and ride
[normal]’
[normal] and take the tram back in to my work place at Nottingham Trent 
[normal]U
[normal]niversity
[normal] – 
[normal]N
[normal]ot a very ‘green
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]solution
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]A direct commuter bus would reduce door to door journey times to 35 minutes – a reduction of 20 minutes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. 
[normal]The local bus services are supported by generous subsidies from the County Council but 
[normal]despite the 
[normal]greater powers under the 
[normal]2008 
[normal]Local Transport A
[normal]ct
[normal] (See Appendix 2)
[normal], 
[normal]they seem unwilling (or unable?) to require the bus companies to provide 
[normal]attractive 
[normal]di
[normal]rect commuter services and evening leisure services 
[normal]into Nottingham 
[normal]as part of that subsidy agreement.
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]This could
[normal] change with current 
[normal]Nottinghamshire 
[normal]County Council 
[normal]TITAN project initiatives
[normal] but we are not holding our breath
[normal] as available funds diminish
[normal]!
[normal])
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. 
[normal]Factors such as 
[normal]c
[normal]ity parking levies, road congestion, fuel costs, and pensioner subsidies, have increased bus usage in recent years and alternative bus companies
[normal], such as Premiere Travel,
[normal] moved in to try and take a share of the profits enjoyed by the e
[normal]stablished companies
[normal] (
[normal]such as 
[normal]Trent Barton)
[normal].  This has not really helped us in semi rural areas 
[normal]like
[normal] Cropwell Bishop because the competition 
[normal]was
[normal] focussed on the more populated areas of nearby C
[normal]ot
[normal]grave and Bingham.  It also generated unproductive ‘bus wars’
[normal] with the sister company of 
[normal]Trent Baton
[normal] running ‘spoiling’ services with the sole intention of driving out the competition. 
[normal]Eventually
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]sister company’s ‘spoiling’ service did force the competitor, Premiere Travel to abandon the Nottingham to Cotgrave r
[normal]outes in 2012.  The 
[normal]‘
[normal]spoiling
[normal]’
[normal] service stopped soon after Premiere pulled out!
[normal]  The competing company, Premiere Travel went into liquidation, January, 2013
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]At one time in 2011, 
[normal]We 
[normal]had
[normal] the nonsense of 3 competing buses running in to Notting
[normal]h
[normal]am from C
[normal]ropwell Bishop at 8.00am but none of them provid
[normal]ed
[normal] a direct service because they 
[normal]saw
[normal] the main revenue coming from the 
[normal]C
[normal]otgrave estates 
[normal]e
[normal]n route.
[normal] 
[normal]After the demise of Premiere, w
[normal]e have now returned to one indirect bus at 8.00am and no other services into Not
[normal]tingham until
[normal] 
[normal]09.26
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]The day time services into Nottingham are adequate (2 indirect buses per hour) but we have recently lost the direct link to the adjacent community of Bingham where many of our village children attend seconday school. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. 
[normal]Our evening 
[normal]bus 
[normal]services are very poor with the last bus into Nottingham at 5.40
[normal] pm
[normal] and the last bus home from Nottingham at 6.00 pm.  This creates a severe isolation 
[normal]of village people 
[normal]from the work and social 
[normal]opportunities
[normal] 
[normal]offered
[normal] by Nottingham City in th
[normal]e evening
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. 
[normal]It is observed that 
[normal]p
[normal]eak time (7.30-8.30
[normal] am
[normal]) traffic flows from Cropwell Bishop towards Nottingham are over 400 vehicles per hour compared with flows of 
[normal]around 150
[normal] vehicles per hour outside peak times.  If direct commuter buses were availab
[normal]le, a proportion of the peak time private vehicle journeys would be eliminated.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Solution[bold]14. 
[normal]The solution
[normal] is to integrate our public transportation systems.  This will never happen if left to the vagaries and 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]interests 
[normal]of the private opera
[normal]tors and therefore a form of regulation is required.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. 
[normal]An appropriate approach would be (as for London buses and the various railway concessions) for the bus companies to tender for local area concessions which would require them to run certain commut
[normal]er, shopper and 
[normal]evening 
[normal]leisure services for the surrounding semi rural areas (such as Cropwell Bishop and the villages in the Vale of Belvoir) alongside their regular 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]services to the more populated centres (such as Cotgrave and Bingham).
[normal] 
[normal] An ex
[normal]ample of 
[normal]possible area concessions for South East Nottingham
[normal] is presented 
[normal]in the Appendix[bold].
[normal] In the case of the ‘Cotgrave’ concession, 6 buses would provide an adequate day time, off peak service
[normal] for the area
[normal], instead of the
[normal] 
[normal]13 used
[normal] during the competitive ‘b
[normal]us wars’
[normal]. 
[normal](Since Liquidation of Premiere, Currently 5 buses running + 1 on route 50 (route 53 abandoned
[normal] for present
[normal]))
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. 
[normal]The Local Authorities are under severe pressure to save money by cutting subsidised rural bus services.  The fact that 
[normal]two
[normal] (or even temporarily 3) bus operators are able to profit from 
[normal]service provision on the Nottingham – Cotgrave 
[normal] (
[normal]and Nottingham –Bingham
[normal])
[normal] route is indicative that there if the route were assigned to one operator there would be sufficient surplus profit to s
[normal]ubsidise the extension of the service to the less populated village areas. 
[normal](Trent Barton currently run as sole operator with full buses making healthy profits!)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Regulation 
[normal]by
[normal] the award of area concessions to operators by competitive tender would 
[normal]seem to b
[normal]e the best way forward to help
[normal] fund the necessary semi rural routes with reduced cost to the public purse.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]City Integration[bold]17. 
[normal]Looking more widely at the integration of services, it is not necessary to run all buses into Nottingham.  With the much im
[normal]proved passenger information and bus location controls now available, timetabled connecting services from the populated centres to the rural villages are perfectly feasible.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. 
[normal]Within Nottingham itself not all buses need cross or circulate the city.  T
[normal]oo many buses are currently clogging our city streets 
[normal]for example 
[normal]at 
[normal]Parliament Street
[normal] and 
[normal]Friar Lane
[normal] (
[normal]Market Square
[normal])
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]A free 
[normal]C
[normal]entre
[normal] L
[normal]ink has already been introduced and this is the right approach. 
[normal] 
[normal]Suggestions have been made to Nottingham City Council (C
[normal]hris Carter) for further development of the free link 
[normal]with 
[normal](electric?) 
[normal]buses running in 
[normal]two circuits
[normal] every few minutes between key bus stations
[normal] (hubs)
[normal] 
[normal]where the radial routes can terminate.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19. 
[normal]Provision of the free centre link alongside the partial regu
[normal]lation and letting of area concessions as suggested will mean that operators do not have to compete for passengers.  Only selected key routes need complete the city loops and operators 
[normal]could ther
[normal]e
[normal]by
[normal] save some 10 – 15 minutes on many journeys.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Some [bold]B[bold]roader [bold]S[bold]uggestions for [bold]T[bold]ransport [bold]I[bold]ntegration and [bold]U[bold]sage[bold].
[normal]20. 
[normal]The improvement of the A453 between Nottingham and the M1 and East Midland airport is a high priority
[normal] and 
[normal]a
[normal]fter much local pressure this scheme is now under construction.
[normal] 
[normal]It was 
[normal]unfortunate for th
[normal]e region 
[normal]that the previous government chose to throw ‘fiscal stimulus’
[normal] 
[normal]money at the lower priority, over priced, 
[normal]‘
[normal]over engineered
[normal]’
[normal] A46 Newark to Widmerpool scheme with its overscaled earthworks at Str
[normal]a
[normal]gglethorpe and Saxondale resulting in unnecessary loss 
[normal]of valuable agricultural land
[normal] and poor energy efficiency (more fuel
[normal] used
[normal], higher CO
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]emissions
[normal]) for vehicles using the 
[normal]new
[normal] junctions
[normal]. 
[normal]Whilst giving local benefits such as improved
[normal], safer
[normal] access to Newark and Leicester, 
[normal]the somewhat blinkered design of the A46 improvement has done little to help regional traffic flows 
[normal]and integrated transport 
[normal]– the A52 traffic into Nottingham is still delayed
[normal]!
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. 
[normal]The Nottingham tram extension out towards the M1
[normal] is currently under cons
[normal]truction.   
[normal]Investment in the tram is fine for the areas it serves but it has to be recognised that 
[normal]many areas such as 
[normal]South East Nottingham 
[normal]gain
[normal] no direct benefit
[normal].  
[normal]Priority should therefore be given to improvement of bus and other transportation services
[normal] in these areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22. 
[normal]Whilst the 
[normal]proposed 
[normal]HS2 may be 
[normal]some
[normal] help for travel between our main cities (assuming it is affordable to all) it will not address the 
[normal]needs for 
[normal]regular inter
[normal]-
[normal]city
[normal] and 
[normal]inter
[normal]-
[normal]town
[normal] travel or the needs of travel to and from the more isol
[normal]ated communities.
[normal]  The options of longer trains, longer platforms at certain key stations and revised signalling should be carefully explored to increase capacity where overcrowding 
[normal]on the current rail network 
[normal]really is an issue.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23. 
[normal]W
[normal]here existing rail c
[normal]onnections are poor, there would seem to be
[normal] much scope for a
[normal]n improved
[normal] network of intercity
[normal]/intertown
[normal] buses, attractively priced to draw travellers away from the private car.  When more than one person is travelling the car tends to be the obvious 
[normal]‘value f
[normal]or money’ 
[normal]choice. 
[normal] 
[normal]A 
[normal]‘partner’
[normal] rail/bus card could enable a partner to travel at say half fare to make the public transport journey more 
[normal]financially 
[normal]attractive
[normal] for the pair of travellers
[normal]?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24. 
[normal]Arriving in a town or city by public transport the traveller ne
[normal]eds good information for onward connections.  Perhaps subsidised taxi fares are appropriate for some rural locations
[normal] where demand for bus services is very low?
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]C[bold]onclusion[bold]25. 
[normal]I cannot see an efficient integrated transportation system developing within a
[normal] free market economy.  Transport
[normal]ation
[normal] is too important for the economic future of our country to be left to commercial interests alone.  It is therefore necessary to plan and regulate services at a national
[normal], regional
[normal] and local level
[normal] 
[normal]so that 
[normal]unnecessary dup
[normal]lication is avoided and 
[normal]surplus profits from commercial operations in the more populated areas are directed towards supporting provision of 
[normal]vital
[normal] transportation in the less populated areas. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26. 
[normal]As
[normal] concluded at the ICE sponsored, HS2 workshop on 6
[normal]th
[normal] April
[normal] 2011
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]if this expensive scheme is to proceed, 
[normal]it must be developed within a system of improved integrated transportation for the whole nation.
[normal]  ‘Connectivity’ is the key buzzword.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27. 
[normal]At a local level for a village such as Cropwell Bishop, access to 
[normal](and
[normal] usage of) 
[normal]an East Midlands 
[normal]HS2 
[normal]station 
[normal]will be rather limited.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]t is far more important
[normal] 
[normal]for
[normal] residents of the local area
[normal] to 
[normal]have
[normal] attractive direct commuter buses which could 
[normal]cut 15 minutes off 
[normal]the
[normal] 
[normal]current 45 minute journey
[normal] time into 
[normal]Nottingham
[normal].  Improvemen
[normal]ts of this sort can be 
[normal]achieved at very small costs
[normal] if available resources are redirected as suggested by partial regulation and licensing of local area 
[normal]concessions
[normal].
