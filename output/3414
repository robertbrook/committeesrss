[normal]About the BIA
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]BioIndustry
[normal] Association (BIA) is the trade association for innovative bioscience companies. The majority of our members are healthcare focused companies researching and developing new products and technologies to treat areas of unmet medical need. These range from large global biopharmaceuticals to small, pre-revenue companies operating at the translation interface between academia and industry. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The BIA has engaged with its membership in order to provide an informed response to this inquiry.
