"&#xa0;\nSupplementary written submission from the Electrical Safety Council (BRC 79)&#xa0;\nThe complaints are provided in an extract of an email we received earlier today from the Department. This is copied below and I trust that you and the Committee will find the information helpful.\n&#xa0;\nDetails on number of complaints as provided by DCLG\n&#xa0;\n\"For the six-month period April â€“ Sept 2013, there was a total of 179 complaints to the eight scheme operators that include Part P members.\n&#xa0;\n Note though that some of these scheme operators also cover other work, so this number may not be for electrical work only.\n&#xa0;\n When looking at complaints as a proportion of notification numbers then all eight received complaints at a rate well below 1%, the highest proportion being 0.31%.\"\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
