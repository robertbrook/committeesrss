defaultWritten evidence submitted by Kenya Hospices and Palliative Care Association (KEHPCA)default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultMeeting the individual needs of patients diagnosed with a life limiting condition is rarely considered easy as professionals strive to assess and respond to the holistic needs of each person and offer appropriate care and support for thdefaulteir family throughout this difficult time. The social context in which people live (and in some cases the labels which they have ascribed to them) may influence the nature of any end of life care accesseddefault&#xa0;defaultand affect the subsequent care they receive. Whilst a holistic approach is recognised as the basis for high quality palliative care and support, some marginalised groups (people with a disability e.g intellectual disability) may struggle to access palliatidefaultve care and support, for a variety of reasons.default&#xa0;defaultPeople with a disability may not be able to communicate concerns about their health needs in a meaningful way throughout their palliative care journey. Whilst some people with disabilities may not understand defaultcomplex concepts (e.g. palliative care, death, dying), others may have associated visual, auditory, or sensory impairments. default&#xa0;defaultHeath care providers working with disabled people do not have the appropriate knowledge and skills to support these patients, defaulttherefore patients with disabilities will not receive good quality palliative care during their journey with a life threatening illness like HIV/AIDS and cancerdefault&#xa0;defaultPalliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their familiedefaults facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.
