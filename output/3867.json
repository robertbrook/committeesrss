"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) (HCP0001)1. Introduction1.1\n              \nTh\nis evidence submission includes some key information about the performance of the organisation (section\n \ntwo\n).  We have also highlighted our work in three areas\n: \nextending regulation to other professional and occupational groups\n (section\n three\n)\n; continuin\ng fitness to practise (section four\n); and \nbuilding the eviden\nce base of regulation (section five\n).  We have also included \nsome statistical data (section six\n).\n \n2. Information about the HCPC2.1\n              \nTh\ne Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) \nis an i\nndependent\n statutory regulator\n \nof\n \n319,637 \nindividuals across \n16\n health\n, psychological and social work \nprofessions\n (figure correct as at 1 November 2013)\n. \n2.2\n              \nThese \nare\n: \na\nrts therapists; \nb\niomedical scientists; \nc\nlinical scientists; \nc\nhiropodists / podiatrists; \nd\nietitians; \nh\nearing aid dispensers; \no\nccupational therapists; \no\nperating department practitioners; \no\nrthoptists; \np\naramedics; \np\nhysiotherapists; \np\nro\ns\nthetists / orthotists; p\nractitioner psychologists; \nr\nadiographers; \ns\nocial workers in England; and \ns\npeech and language therapists.\n2.3\n              \nThe HCPC was \nestablished by Parliament under \nthe Health and Social Work \nProfessions \nOrder 2001\n. \nOur predecessor,\n the Council for Professions S\nupplementary to Medicine (CPSM)\n,\n was \nestablished in 1961.\n2.4\n              \nOur main objective is to safeguard the health and wellbeing of persons using or needing the services of our registran\nts\n and w\ne do this by\n:\n2.\n5\n              \nWe \nalso \nprotect professional titles, with all the professions having at least one protected title. It is a criminal o\nffenc\ne for someone to claim to be registered when they are not, and \nwe \ntake action against those who do so. \n2.\n6\n              \nIn order to carry out our regulato\nry functions effectively w\ne work with \nrelevant \norganisations\n, sharing \nappropriate \ninformation relating to registration and fitness to practise\n.  One way we do this is through \nmemoranda of understanding\n and \nsuch agreements\n are \nin place with a range of organ\nisations including the C\nare \nQ\nuality \nC\nommission (CQC)\n and the \nregulators of social workers in\n Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n \nThe Register2.\n7\n              \nIn 2012-13, we \nreceived 2,822\n applications from international professionals and \n16,233 applications from \nindividuals\n \ncompleting\n UK approved \nprogrammes\n.\n \n \n2.8\n              \nThe current renewal fee is £76\n. At the time of this submission we had concluded a consultation to increase this to £80 from \nApril \n2014\n.  \nEven with this increase, we \nwould \ncontinue to\n have the lowest fee\n of all \nthe \nnine regulators overseen by the Professional Standards Authority\n for Health and Social Care (PSA)\n.\n \nFitness to Practise2.\n9\n              \nIn 2012-13, we received\n \n1\n,\n657 \nfitness to practise \nallegations\n.\n \nThis amoun\nts to 0.53% of all registrants.\n 248 cases were concluded at a final hearing\n and \npanels \nimposed a \nstriking-off order in 44 cases\n.\n \n2.1\n0\n              \nWe \nare always looking at ways to improve the efficiency of the fitness to practise process, whilst ensuring that the public continue to be protected. In\n recent years this has included introducing the ability\n for panels to agree the disposal\n of suitable cases by consent\n without the need for a contested hearing,\n and the use of pre-hearing case management arrangements to ensure\n the\n timely\n running of hearings\n. In 2012-\n13, the mean time taken from \nan allegation meeting our standard of acceptance\n to consideration\n by an Investigating Committee P\nanel\n (ICP)\n was seven months. The mean time \ntaken \nto conclusion at a final hearing was 16 months.\n2.11\n              \nIn its 2012-\n13 performance review report, the PSA concluded that the HCPC was amongst those regulators \n‘\nmanaging their caselo\nads effectively and efficiently’\n.\nEducation2.1\n2\n              \nWe approve programmes which lead to eligibility to apply to our Register. \nWe approve 872\n programmes at 147 education providers\n \n(figures correct as at\n 25 November 2013\n)\n.\n2.1\n3\n              \nW\ne \nconduct \nvisit\ns of\n education providers to ensure they meet our standards of education and training.  \nThis ensures individuals completing approved programme\ns\n \nare fit to \npractise at \nthe\nir\n point of entry to the Register.  \nContinued \napproval is \nsubject to meeting our \non-going \nmonitoring requirements.\n2.1\n4\n              \n71 visi\nts to 167 programmes \nare \nscheduled in the 2013-14 academic year.\nProfessional and lay input2.1\n5\n              \nW\ne work with\n \na range of \nprofessional and lay \nindividuals who provide expertise in our decision making for our govern\nance\n and regulatory processes.\n  \n2.\n16\n              \nWe have 634\n Partners\n,\n with\n lay\n and professional\n expertise\n,\n who work across six \nregulatory functions\n. This includes \nsittin\ng on fitness to practise panels; visiting education \nprogrammes; \nassessing continuing professional \ndevelopment profiles; and reaching decisions about applica\ntions\n from international applicants\n.\n3. Extending regulation to other professional and occupational groups3.1\n              \nWe have a track record of extending regulation to \nfurther \nprofessions. Since \nour Register opened in 2003\n, we have registe\nred four additional professions. Most recently \nwe opened our Register to social workers in \nEngland\n fol\nlowing the \nabolition of the General Social Care Council (GSCC)\n.\n  \n3.2\n              \nIn 2011, the Department of Health\n committed that it\n would explore the scope for the HCPC ‘to establish a voluntary register of [adult] social care workers [in England] by 2013’.\n3.3\n  \n              \nWe have\n \ncare\nfully \nconsidered this issue and concluded that there are significant shortcomings in a voluntary register being held by a statutory regulator. The\nse\n are\n the lack of \nlegal compulsion for individuals to be registered\n and the inability of \nthe regulator to demand information or \nto \ncompel witnesses when investigating fitness to practise allegations\n.  Crucially, it also means that if someone \nwas removed from a volu\nntary register they could \ncontinue to practis\ne\n. \n3.4\n              \nWe \nconsider\n \nthe\nre \nis \nthe \npo\ntential for public confusion around the status of voluntary and statutory registers being held by the same organisation.\n \nWe have also concluded that\n there would be considerable costs involved in establishing \nsuch \na register \nand paying for its operating costs until \nit was \nself-fin\nancing\n.\n3.5\n              \nRecent estimates are that \nthe adult social care workforce \nin England \nnumber\ns\n 1.63m jobs\n.\n \nThis is a large, low paid and often transitory workforce with significant numbers of part time wor\nkers. We have concluded that ‘full statutory regulation’ \nfor this group \nis unlikely to be considered to be a\n \nproportionate \nor \ncost-effecti\nve\n response.\n3.6\n              \nWe have instead proposed a ‘negative registration scheme’ and statutory regulation of CQC registered \nmanagers. \n3.7\n              \nA negative registration\n scheme \nwould \nimprove public protection because it would \nenable the regulator to deal effectively with the small \nnumber\n of individuals who are unsuitable to work in adult social care\n in England\n, without placing a disproportionate burden on the remainder of the workforce. \n3.8\n              \nThis model would work as follows.\n3.\n9\n              \nThe ‘negative registration’ model draws upon a similar scheme which has been successfully operated by the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission for a number of year\ns\n and is due to be extended to other state\ns\n and territories.\n3.10\n              \nAll providers registered by the CQC must have a\n registered manager for each of \nthe ‘regulated activities’ they carry out.\n Some of these individuals will be from statutory regulated backgrounds, others will not. We have proposed that these managers sho\nuld become statutory regulated.  This will put them on the same footing as other regulated professions by having a binding code of conduct and ethics.\n3.11\n              \nWe consider that these proposals might be more effective than relying on purely voluntary or self-re\ngulatory arrangements alone. They would provide an important ‘safety net’ whilst building on other sector-led initiatives focused on assuring and improving quality in this sector. \n3.12\n              \nWe have submitted these proposals to Government. \nIf the Government con\nsidered that these proposals met its policy objectives\n, further\n development\n work would be required.\n3\n.13\n              \nIn addition, it is existing Government policy that we should in the future become responsible for the regulation of herbal medicine practitioners and \n‘\nnon-medical\n’\n public health specialists.\n4. Continuing fitness to practise4.1\n              \nThis section outlines \nour rationale\n and on-going work in the area of continuing fitness to practise. We use this term \n(\nin line with the approach taken in the PSA’s 2013 report \non this topic\n)\n to describe the steps taken by regulators (and others) to support fitness to practise beyond the point of initial registration. \nThis term \nreflects our\n outcomes-focus\ned\n approach\n and avoids ‘revalidation’ which is often poorly defined.\n4.2\n              \nSin\nce 2003\n, \nwe have required\n registrants to renew their registration every two years. Since 2006, \nregistrants have had a compulsory, statutory requirement to undertake continuing professional development\n (CPD)\n.\n \nOur\n standards for CPD \nare focused\n on outcomes – the benefits of CPD to services users and quality of care.\n These standards are \nlinked to registration and \nare\n \nunderpinned by random audits. We consider that auditing is a proportionate method of ensuring \ncompliance\n. We \ncan and do\n remove indi\nviduals from the Register where our standards have not been met. We \nalso have\n in place requirements for those seeking to return to the Register after a period out of practice. \n4.3\n              \nAnalysis\n \nof fitness to practise allegations\n against registrants has shown t\nhat t\nhe majority\n of cases\n \n(72% in 2012-13)\n \nare about conduct\n and professionalism\n with relatively few cases purely about lack of competence. \nWe have been undertaking a programme of work and research to build \nthe \nevidence base \nfurther \nand inform decisions ab\nout how we approach the assessment \nof continuing fitness to practis\ne. \n4.4\n              \nThis has included or includes the following.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nWe anticipate that the outcomes of these pieces of work will inform whether and in what ways we \nmight\n enhance our existing approach to \nassessing registran\nts continuing fitness to practis\ne\n. For example, we might consider requiring registrants to seek\n \nservice user\n feedback to inform their learning and we \nmight \nwant to consider whether we have sufficient inf\normation on risk such that we might consider targeting our audits towards ‘higher risk’ groups. We consider that it is important that any further developments in this area are evidence-based and proportionate.\n5. Building the evidence base of regulation5.\n1\n              \nWe know that there is generally a lack of research and analysis on topics related or relevant to the regulation of the professions that we regulate.\n \nIn recent years, we have particularly sought to expand the research we commission in order to contribute \nto the \nevidence base of regulation.  Our work in this area is about helping us make better, more evidence-based decisions, as well as making a contribution to the wider regulatory agenda.\n We invest resources in dissemination of research as well as commissi\noning research to ensure that it has an impact on practice. \nEvery year we hold a series of events with our stakeholders to provide a mechanism for debate. \n5.2\n              \nSection four of this submission describes some of the pieces of work we have undertaken or \ncommissioned in relation to con\ntinuing fitness to practise. We have provided \nsome\n \nfurther examples below.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nOur research looking at \nprofessionalism\n in particular\n has been well recei\nved by our stakeholders (see 4.4\n). It has made a valuable\n contribution\n to initiatives\n on this topic\n by \nboth \nthe Scottish Government and the Department of Health.\n We have also published articles in\n a\n range o\nf professional journals and the research has been used as the basis for discussion \nwith registrants \nat seminars and presentations, \nvia events\n held throughout the UK and online\n. We consider this \nto be\n an important area of work\n, particularly in light of rece\nnt well documented examples of failures in care\n in hospitals and care homes\n.\n \nWe \nhave a strong commitment to \ne\nncouraging registrants to think about their profession\nal behaviour and that of others, and to place \nas much emphasis on this \nimportant \naspect of \nprofessional \npractice as\n is already the case for competence.\n&#xa0;\n6.
