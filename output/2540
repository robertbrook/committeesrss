[normal]Written evidence submitted by Crisis[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Summary[bold]This inquiry is vital at a time when homelessness is rising, driven by reforms to welfare and housing benefit
[normal] changes.

[normal]Assistance for those in housing need[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1 [bold]Crisis, the national charity for single homeless people, is pleased to respond to this timely select committee inquiry.
[normal] 
[normal]Support for housing costs through the welfare system is undergoing enormous change. It is therefore very important to take this opportunity to consider the impact of the changes we have already seen and look ahead to future reforms.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2 [bold]At Crisis we are deeply concerned that changes to the way housing benefit is paid will lead to an increase in homelessness. Homelessness has been rising since 2010. In 2012-13, 
[normal]113,260 
[normal]people in 
[normal]England
[normal] approached their council as homeless, 
[normal]an increase 
[normal]of 
[normal]11% over 2 years. 
[normal]Rough sleeping has risen by a third since 2010.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3 [bold]Independent 
[normal]research
[normal] carried out 
[normal]for Crisis
[normal], 
[normal]The Homelessness Monitor
[normal] 
[normal]sets out 
[normal]that 
[normal]these rises are a result of a combination of continuing economic stagnation and welfare reforms and
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have not yet seen the full impact of these changes: ‘transitional arrangements have thus far helped to mitigate the impacts of lowered Local Housing Allowance rates and national Local Housing Allowance caps’ but ‘deepening benefit cuts are likely to have
[normal] a much more dramatic impact on 
[normal]homelessness levels going forward.’
[normal] The current homelessness figures are 
[normal]likely
[normal] 
[normal]then
[normal] to be the tip of the iceberg and we 
[normal]would expect to see
[normal] further rises 
[normal]in all forms of homelessness 
[normal]as 
[normal]welfare reforms bed in
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4 [bold]Other 
[normal]research
[normal] both by Crisis and others including government also points to growing problems with housing affordability and our network of PRS access schemes, organisations who support vulnerable to access private rented accommodation, are reporting an increasing lack of accommodation that is affordable within Local Housing Allowance rates.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5 [bold]It is vital therefore that government address issues of affordability, evaluate the changes to housing support which have already taken place, and ensure that future reforms do not cause homelessness to rise further.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1 [bold]When the
[normal] first wave of
[normal] LHA 
[normal]reforms
[normal] were introduced in 2010, Crisis and many others warned that they would lead to a significant reduction in the availability of affordable accommodation for people on low incomes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2 [bold]The latest homelessness statistics show that from 
[normal]April to June 2013
[normal] there was a 32% increase in 
[normal]households 
[normal]becoming
[normal] homeless due to 
[normal]the end of an AST on the same period in 2012 with this now being
[normal] 
[normal]the leading cause of statutory homelessness. Increasingly people who come to the end of their tenancy are struggling to find accommodation that is affordable at LHA rates and so are forced to seek help from their local authority. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.3 [bold]The interim findings 
[normal]of the 
[normal]government commissioned review of the impact of LHA changes showed that there have already been reduced on-flows to LHA in central 
[normal]London
[normal] boroughs, in contrast to other parts of the country where there has been a continued rise in on-flows.
[normal] This suggests, as expected, that 
[normal]in 
[normal]London
[normal], where pressures on affordability are most acute, people are finding it particularly difficult to secure affordable accommodation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4 [bold]The 
[normal]research
[normal] also found that transitional measures and DHP are so far delaying the impact of the 
[normal]reforms by helping people to make up the shortfall between their rent and benefit levels. 
[normal]It will be very important to keep this area under review over the coming years so that we fully understand what effect the 
[normal]reform
[normal]s are having
[normal] and so that government can adjust policy or bring forward mitigation to ameliorate some of the worst impacts of the reforms. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5 [bold]It is very disappointing therefore that the Government intends that
[normal] this 
[normal]evaluation
[normal] will 
[normal]finish
[normal] at the end of this year. There had been hopes that it could be extended to take full account of the impact of these 
[normal]reform
[normal]s and of subsequent changes. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6[bold] 
[normal]Recommendation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1 [bold]Crisis is 
[normal]particularly
[normal] concerned about the extension of the Shared Accommodation Rate (SAR)
[normal] to single under 35 year olds
[normal]. The SAR is the lowest rate of housing benefit, intended to cover the cost of a room in a shared house. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2 [bold]The SAR has always caused serious problems. In many parts of the country, there is very little shared accommodation available. This is 
[normal]sometimes viewed as primarily 
[normal]a problem in rural areas and small towns where there is no culture of sharing. However, even in larger cities where there is a great 
[normal]supply
[normal] of shared accommodation, 
[normal]research
[normal] carried out on behalf of Crisis has found that 
[normal]benefit claimants 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]face competition from other groups such as students and young professionals who can typically afford to pay higher rents and who are more attractive to landlords.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3 [bold]There have long been problems with the SAR being comparatively lower than other LHA rates. DWP figures from before the extension showed that 67% of claimants faced a shortfall between their benefit and the rent averaging £29 per week (compared to 49% of all LHA claimants)
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4 [bold]The extension of the SAR has exacerbated existing problems. 
[normal]There are now 210,000 people in receipt of SAR, an increase of 43% since the extension
[normal]. 74% of housing advisers surveyed by Crisis reported that the SAR is a serious barrier to finding accommodation for their clients.
[normal] The government’s LHA evaluation 
[normal]research
[normal] found that there has been an 8% drop in single 25-34 year olds claiming LHA in central 
[normal]London
[normal] and there has been no equivalent increase in outer 
[normal]London
[normal] boroughs.  As it is not clear where people in this group will have moved to, we are concerned that many of these are likely to be in hidden homeless situations, sofa surfing, in hostels, and in the worst instances sleeping rough.  Between 2011-12 and 2012/13 there was a 17% increase in the number of under 35 year olds sleeping rough in 
[normal]London
[normal], compared to an increase of just 10% in 35-44 year olds. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5 [bold]Crisis 
[normal]research
[normal] in Lewisham, 
[normal]Birmingham
[normal] and 
[normal]Leeds
[normal] found that only 13% of properties were affordable at the SAR –
[normal] but when we took into account landlord willingness to let to benefit claimants, which is a longstanding problem, 
[normal]only 
[normal]1.5% of the total were both affordable and accessible to SAR claimants.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6 [bold]There is growing evidence that the SAR is not reflective of the 30
[normal]th
[normal] percentile of rents in many areas which leads us to believe that there are significant problems with the way it is calculated. Dialogue with DWP and 
[normal]the Valuation Office Agency (VOA), has confirmed this to be the case. The VOA often uses very small numbers of rents to calculate the SAR – for example, in Harrogate BRMA, the SAR is based on a sample of only 30 properties -
[normal] meaning it is less likely to be reflective of the 30
[normal]th
[normal] percentile. There is also a
[normal] bias towards 
[normal]the cheaper end of the shared market in rental data collection – with greater focus on 
[normal]single rooms
[normal] (rather than doubles) and an over reliance on local authority HMO registers.
[normal] 
[normal]Furthermore, the VOA do not make use of property websites such as spareroom.co.uk or rightmove.co.uk in their rental data gathering despite the fact that many if not most people are likely to find shared accommodation online. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7 [bold]The government grant
[normal]ed
[normal] two limited exemptions from the extension of the SAR
[normal], acknowledging that
[normal] 
[normal]for some people sharing is inappropriate
[normal]. These are for people aged 25-34 who have lived in a hostel 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]those who
[normal] are subject to a MAPPA order. However, there is evidence that these exemptions are not being granted
[normal] to all who should be entitled
[normal]. Crisis’ survey of housing advisers found that 22% had not managed to get the hostel exemption for 
[normal]any
[normal] of their clients
[normal], despite many being former hostel residents
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.8 Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1 [bold]Existing problems with affordability will be exacerbated by the breaking of the link between actual rents and housing support and the 
[normal]uprating
[normal] of LHA by CPI and then 1%.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2 [bold]The stated government intention of the LHA reforms was to exert downwards pressure on rents. However, this does not seem to have been the case. 
[normal]The annual rent increase in 
[normal]England
[normal] and 
[normal]Wales
[normal] was 3.4% last year,
[normal] 
[normal]but in many areas it was much higher. In 
[normal]London
[normal], for example, it was 7%
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This variation underlines the importance of maintaining the link between local rents and housing support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3 [bold]Analysis undertaken by Crisis
[normal] of government figures showing the difference between 
[normal]keeping LHA rates at the 30th percentile and
[normal] 
[normal]uprating
[normal] them in line with CPI
[normal] (currently at 2.7%)
[normal] 
[normal]shows that with the existing
[normal] 
[normal]change from actual rents to CPI, 75% of Broad Rental Market Areas are
[normal] 
[normal]facing an effective cut
[normal] - 
[normal]where the 30
[normal]th
[normal] percentile is higher than the LHA rates 
[normal]uprated
[normal] by CPI -
[normal] in at least one of their LHA rates and 56% in one
[normal] 
[normal]or two
[normal]. This is likely to be exacerbated further by capping 
[normal]uprating
[normal] at 1%.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.4 [bold]In response to the concerns raised by Crisis and others during the Welfare 
[normal]Reform
[normal] Act, Lord Freud gave a commitment that if 
[normal]uprating
[normal] by inflation were to lead to rents and housing benefit to become ‘out of step’ then 
[normal]it would be 
[normal]reconsidered
[normal]. This was reiterated during the debates on the Welfare Benefits 
[normal]Uprating
[normal] Act. 
[normal]However, it is not clear how this evaluation will take place, especially 
[normal]in light of the fact that the LHA evaluation 
[normal]research
[normal] has not been extended. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.5 [bold]It is essential that the funding pledged by the government to ease affordability in areas most affected by changing the method of 
[normal]uprating
[normal] is used in the most efficient way. 
[normal]Rental markets for different property sizes vary within a given area and there is often great disparity within BRMAs, with rates for certain property sizes inflating faster than others. For example, although 75% of BRMAs in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] are seeing an effective cut in one or more of their rates, only 2% are seeing a cut in every rate. A more effective use of funding therefore is to target it at individual bedroom rates where there is a disparity between the 30
[normal]th
[normal] percentile and LHA level rather than at geographical areas as a whole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.6 [bold]Our analysis demonstrates that the SAR has been particularly affected by being 
[normal]uprated
[normal] in line with CPI. The SAR is likely to have a higher effective cut in percentage terms than other rates. In 10% of BRMAs the SAR is 5% or more lower than the 30
[normal]th
[normal] percentile, whilst this is only true of 1% of BRMAs for the 1 bed rate. The SAR is a problem across the country - only 35% of these BRMAs are in 
[normal]London
[normal] or the South East, compared with 100% for the 1 bed rate. The LHA affordability funding should be targeted to help mitigate some of these problems. .
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.7 Recommendations[bold] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1 [bold]It is welcome that the government has acknowledged that some vulnerable claimants or those who are struggling with their finances may need more frequent payments and/or their housing element paid directly to their landlord, known as an Alternative Payment Arrangement (APA). 
[normal]. However we have real concerns as to how this process will work. 
[normal]If Universal Credit is to 
[normal]be a success
[normal], it is vital that it is designed to meet the needs of all claimants, not just those with more straightforward claims.
[normal] In order to prevent arrears, evictions and homelessness, provisions must be in place to secure rent payments to the landlord for people who are less able to manage their finances or who have fallen into arrears 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2 [bold]Claimants who may be in need of extra support will be assessed at the beginning of their claim to see if they need an APA. However, claimants will only be interviewed if the
[normal]y answer questions through the online application which 
[normal]flag them as being in need of assistance. We are concerned that this will not identify all the people who are in need of support. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3 [bold]If people are flagged as needing extra support they will be refer
[normal]r
[normal]ed for an assessment. The factors which the assessor should consider when making a decision are divided into two tiers.
[normal] The first tier includes factors such as being currently homeless, having a mental health condition or a drug addiction. The second includes factors such as having previously been homeless or having a history of rent arrears. It is not clear why these factors have been divided up into separate tiers. 
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]are 
[normal]concerned 
[normal]that what 
[normal]is likely to happen in practice is that people who fall into tier 1 will automatically be granted an APA whereas those who fall into tier 2 will not. Given that assessors are expected to make a decision based on each individual’s circumstances, it is not at all clear why separate tiers are necessary. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4 [bold]Offering a direct payment of housing benefit to a landlord is one of the most important incentives currently available to those working to house people in the PRS. They are able to secure direct payments for their clients through the temporary measures the government have put in place.  PRS access schemes are 
[normal]reporting
[normal] tha
[normal]t
[normal] landlords are planning to stop working with them because they do not expect direct payments to be available under UC
[normal] at all
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5 [bold]Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6. Rent in Advance[bold]6.1 [bold]The abolition of Crisis Loans and the localisation of emergency welfare assistance
[normal] means that there is now little provision for rent in advance for people on low incomes who are moving to a new PRS property. Crisis has looked at the provision offered by local authorities in 
[normal]London
[normal] and found that only four local authorities explicitly state that they will provide support for rent in advance. Research from the Children’s Society confirms that this is a problem across the country.
[normal] If people on low incomes, including those who have been homeless, cannot get help with rent in advance they are unlikely to be unable to secure PRS accommodation. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2 [bold]Recommendation[bold]s[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7. [bold]Temporary Accommodation (TA)[bold]7.1 [bold]Households in TA will be subject to the benefit cap which will cause particular problems where households are placed in accommodation with high rents. The social housing under occupancy measures will apply to households placed in social sector TA which is deemed larger than they need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2 [bold]This could prevent local authorities from being able to secure affordable accommodation to use as TA and therefore make it difficult for them to carry out their statutory homelessness duties. There is also a risk that this will lead to repeat homelessness with households’ housing benefit being restricted and them therefore being unable to meet their rental obligations This will present particular problems in Scotland where the abolition of ‘priority need’ means that there are a greater number of single person households being accepted as homeless and therefore placed in TA. There is a limited amount of 1 bedroom social houses available so single people are likely to be placed in households larger than their needs and so will be subject to the under occupancy restrictions. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.3 Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Exempt Accommodation[bold]8.1 [bold]Supported accommodation, including hostels for homeless people, domestic violence refuges, housing projects for people with learning disabilities and sheltered housing for elderly people, has historically been exempt from normal housing benefit rules. However, there are problems with the specific definition that the DWP uses to decide what accommodation will be exempt. Much of the accommodation which is considered supported does not meet this definition, so people living in it could potentially find that they are subject to housing benefit restrictions including the benefit cap or the ‘bedroom tax’. This is not the government’s stated intention and they are seeking to draft a new definition, but progress on this has so far been limited. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2 [bold]Recommendation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9. Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP)[bold]9.1 [bold]Councils should plan carefully how best to use their 
[normal]extra 
[normal]DHP
[normal] money 
[normal]in light of the extra demand cre
[normal]ated by housing benefit changes. 
[normal]It will be important to ensure that it is available for a range of purposes, including supporting people who have been affected by the extension of the SAR. There must be a balance between granting long term awards, for example to help disabled claimants stay in a property that has been adapted for their needs, and ensuring that short term awards are 
[normal]also 
[normal]available.
[normal] 
[normal]There is evidence that some councils are not spending all of their DHP allocation despite there being huge housing need in their areas, which is particularly worrying.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2 Recommendations[bold]&#xa0;
[normal] About Crisis[bold]10.1 [bold]Crisis is the national charity for single homeless people. We are dedicated to ending homelessness by delivering life-changing services and campaigning for change. Our innovative education, employment, housing and well-being services address individual needs and help people to transform their lives
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.2 [bold]Crisis has worked to open up access to the private rented sector for homeless and vulnerable housed people 
[normal]across 
[normal]the 
[normal]UK
[normal] since 1997. With the support of the Department of Communities and Local Government Crisis manages the Private Rented Sector Access Development Programme which funds and supports local community 
[normal]organisations
[normal] across 
[normal]England
[normal] to help single homeless people find and then keep a private rented home. We have already worked with 
[normal]120 schemes across 
[normal]England
[normal] helping 4000 into accommodation. 
[normal]We also work with the Scottish Government to support the development of rent deposit guarantee schemes.
