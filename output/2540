defaultAssistance for those in housing needdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;default1.1 defaultCrisis, the national charity for single homeless people, is pleased to respond to this timely select committee inquiry.
default 
defaultSupport for housing costs through the welfare system is undergoing enormous change. It is therefore very important to take this opportunity to consider the impact of the changes we have already seen and look ahead to future reforms.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 defaultAt Crisis we are deeply concerned that changes to the way housing benefit is paid will lead to an increase in homelessness. Homelessness has been rising since 2010. In 2012-13, 
default113,260 
defaultpeople in 
defaultEngland
default approached their council as homeless, 
defaultan increase 
defaultof 
default11% over 2 years. 
defaultRough sleeping has risen by a third since 2010.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.3 defaultIndependent 
defaultresearch
default carried out 
defaultfor Crisis
default, 
defaultThe Homelessness Monitor
default 
defaultsets out 
defaultthat 
defaultthese rises are a result of a combination of continuing economic stagnation and welfare reforms and
default 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have not yet seen the full impact of these changes: ‘transitional arrangements have thus far helped to mitigate the impacts of lowered Local Housing Allowance rates and national Local Housing Allowance caps’ but ‘deepening benefit cuts are likely to have
default a much more dramatic impact on 
defaulthomelessness levels going forward.’
default The current homelessness figures are 
defaultlikely
default 
defaultthen
default to be the tip of the iceberg and we 
defaultwould expect to see
default further rises 
defaultin all forms of homelessness 
defaultas 
defaultwelfare reforms bed in
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.4 defaultOther 
defaultresearch
default both by Crisis and others including government also points to growing problems with housing affordability and our network of PRS access schemes, organisations who support vulnerable to access private rented accommodation, are reporting an increasing lack of accommodation that is affordable within Local Housing Allowance rates.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 defaultIt is vital therefore that government address issues of affordability, evaluate the changes to housing support which have already taken place, and ensure that future reforms do not cause homelessness to rise further.
default&#xa0;
default2.1 defaultWhen the
default first wave of
default LHA 
defaultreforms
default were introduced in 2010, Crisis and many others warned that they would lead to a significant reduction in the availability of affordable accommodation for people on low incomes. 
default&#xa0;
default2.2 defaultThe latest homelessness statistics show that from 
defaultApril to June 2013
default there was a 32% increase in 
defaulthouseholds 
defaultbecoming
default homeless due to 
defaultthe end of an AST on the same period in 2012 with this now being
default 
defaultthe leading cause of statutory homelessness. Increasingly people who come to the end of their tenancy are struggling to find accommodation that is affordable at LHA rates and so are forced to seek help from their local authority. 
default&#xa0;default2.3 defaultThe interim findings 
defaultof the 
defaultgovernment commissioned review of the impact of LHA changes showed that there have already been reduced on-flows to LHA in central 
defaultLondon
default boroughs, in contrast to other parts of the country where there has been a continued rise in on-flows.
default This suggests, as expected, that 
defaultin 
defaultLondon
default, where pressures on affordability are most acute, people are finding it particularly difficult to secure affordable accommodation. 
default&#xa0;
default2.4 defaultThe 
defaultresearch
default also found that transitional measures and DHP are so far delaying the impact of the 
defaultreforms by helping people to make up the shortfall between their rent and benefit levels. 
defaultIt will be very important to keep this area under review over the coming years so that we fully understand what effect the 
defaultreform
defaults are having
default and so that government can adjust policy or bring forward mitigation to ameliorate some of the worst impacts of the reforms. 
default&#xa0;
default2.5 defaultIt is very disappointing therefore that the Government intends that
default this 
defaultevaluation
default will 
defaultfinish
default at the end of this year. There had been hopes that it could be extended to take full account of the impact of these 
defaultreform
defaults and of subsequent changes. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.6default 
defaultRecommendationdefault&#xa0;default3.1 defaultCrisis is 
defaultparticularly
default concerned about the extension of the Shared Accommodation Rate (SAR)
default to single under 35 year olds
default. The SAR is the lowest rate of housing benefit, intended to cover the cost of a room in a shared house. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2 defaultThe SAR has always caused serious problems. In many parts of the country, there is very little shared accommodation available. This is 
defaultsometimes viewed as primarily 
defaulta problem in rural areas and small towns where there is no culture of sharing. However, even in larger cities where there is a great 
defaultsupply
default of shared accommodation, 
defaultresearch
default carried out on behalf of Crisis has found that 
defaultbenefit claimants 
defaultincreasingly 
defaultface competition from other groups such as students and young professionals who can typically afford to pay higher rents and who are more attractive to landlords.
default&#xa0;
default3.3 defaultThere have long been problems with the SAR being comparatively lower than other LHA rates. DWP figures from before the extension showed that 67% of claimants faced a shortfall between their benefit and the rent averaging £29 per week (compared to 49% of all LHA claimants)
default. 
default&#xa0;
default3.4 defaultThe extension of the SAR has exacerbated existing problems. 
defaultThere are now 210,000 people in receipt of SAR, an increase of 43% since the extension
default. 74% of housing advisers surveyed by Crisis reported that the SAR is a serious barrier to finding accommodation for their clients.
default The government’s LHA evaluation 
defaultresearch
default found that there has been an 8% drop in single 25-34 year olds claiming LHA in central 
defaultLondon
default and there has been no equivalent increase in outer 
defaultLondon
default boroughs.  As it is not clear where people in this group will have moved to, we are concerned that many of these are likely to be in hidden homeless situations, sofa surfing, in hostels, and in the worst instances sleeping rough.  Between 2011-12 and 2012/13 there was a 17% increase in the number of under 35 year olds sleeping rough in 
defaultLondon
default, compared to an increase of just 10% in 35-44 year olds. 
default&#xa0;
default3.5 defaultCrisis 
defaultresearch
default in Lewisham, 
defaultBirmingham
default and 
defaultLeeds
default found that only 13% of properties were affordable at the SAR –
default but when we took into account landlord willingness to let to benefit claimants, which is a longstanding problem, 
defaultonly 
default1.5% of the total were both affordable and accessible to SAR claimants.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.6 defaultThere is growing evidence that the SAR is not reflective of the 30
defaultth
default percentile of rents in many areas which leads us to believe that there are significant problems with the way it is calculated. Dialogue with DWP and 
defaultthe Valuation Office Agency (VOA), has confirmed this to be the case. The VOA often uses very small numbers of rents to calculate the SAR – for example, in Harrogate BRMA, the SAR is based on a sample of only 30 properties -
default meaning it is less likely to be reflective of the 30
defaultth
default percentile. There is also a
default bias towards 
defaultthe cheaper end of the shared market in rental data collection – with greater focus on 
defaultsingle rooms
default (rather than doubles) and an over reliance on local authority HMO registers.
default 
defaultFurthermore, the VOA do not make use of property websites such as spareroom.co.uk or rightmove.co.uk in their rental data gathering despite the fact that many if not most people are likely to find shared accommodation online. 
default&#xa0;
default3.7 defaultThe government grant
defaulted
default two limited exemptions from the extension of the SAR
default, acknowledging that
default 
defaultfor some people sharing is inappropriate
default. These are for people aged 25-34 who have lived in a hostel 
defaultand
default 
defaultthose who
default are subject to a MAPPA order. However, there is evidence that these exemptions are not being granted
default to all who should be entitled
default. Crisis’ survey of housing advisers found that 22% had not managed to get the hostel exemption for 
defaultany
default of their clients
default, despite many being former hostel residents
default. 
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.8 Recommendationsdefault&#xa0;
default4.1 defaultExisting problems with affordability will be exacerbated by the breaking of the link between actual rents and housing support and the 
defaultuprating
default of LHA by CPI and then 1%.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 defaultThe stated government intention of the LHA reforms was to exert downwards pressure on rents. However, this does not seem to have been the case. 
defaultThe annual rent increase in 
defaultEngland
default and 
defaultWales
default was 3.4% last year,
default 
defaultbut in many areas it was much higher. In 
defaultLondon
default, for example, it was 7%
default.
default 
defaultThis variation underlines the importance of maintaining the link between local rents and housing support. 
default&#xa0;
default4.3 defaultAnalysis undertaken by Crisis
default of government figures showing the difference between 
defaultkeeping LHA rates at the 30th percentile and
default 
defaultuprating
default them in line with CPI
default (currently at 2.7%)
default 
defaultshows that with the existing
default 
defaultchange from actual rents to CPI, 75% of Broad Rental Market Areas are
default 
defaultfacing an effective cut
default - 
defaultwhere the 30
defaultth
default percentile is higher than the LHA rates 
defaultuprated
default by CPI -
default in at least one of their LHA rates and 56% in one
default 
defaultor two
default. This is likely to be exacerbated further by capping 
defaultuprating
default at 1%.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.4 defaultIn response to the concerns raised by Crisis and others during the Welfare 
defaultReform
default Act, Lord Freud gave a commitment that if 
defaultuprating
default by inflation were to lead to rents and housing benefit to become ‘out of step’ then 
defaultit would be 
defaultreconsidered
default. This was reiterated during the debates on the Welfare Benefits 
defaultUprating
default Act. 
defaultHowever, it is not clear how this evaluation will take place, especially 
defaultin light of the fact that the LHA evaluation 
defaultresearch
default has not been extended. 
default&#xa0;
default4.5 defaultIt is essential that the funding pledged by the government to ease affordability in areas most affected by changing the method of 
defaultuprating
default is used in the most efficient way. 
defaultRental markets for different property sizes vary within a given area and there is often great disparity within BRMAs, with rates for certain property sizes inflating faster than others. For example, although 75% of BRMAs in the 
defaultUK
default are seeing an effective cut in one or more of their rates, only 2% are seeing a cut in every rate. A more effective use of funding therefore is to target it at individual bedroom rates where there is a disparity between the 30
defaultth
default percentile and LHA level rather than at geographical areas as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default4.6 defaultOur analysis demonstrates that the SAR has been particularly affected by being 
defaultuprated
default in line with CPI. The SAR is likely to have a higher effective cut in percentage terms than other rates. In 10% of BRMAs the SAR is 5% or more lower than the 30
defaultth
default percentile, whilst this is only true of 1% of BRMAs for the 1 bed rate. The SAR is a problem across the country - only 35% of these BRMAs are in 
defaultLondon
default or the South East, compared with 100% for the 1 bed rate. The LHA affordability funding should be targeted to help mitigate some of these problems. .
default&#xa0;
default4.7 Recommendationsdefault 
default&#xa0;default5.1 defaultIt is welcome that the government has acknowledged that some vulnerable claimants or those who are struggling with their finances may need more frequent payments and/or their housing element paid directly to their landlord, known as an Alternative Payment Arrangement (APA). 
default. However we have real concerns as to how this process will work. 
defaultIf Universal Credit is to 
defaultbe a success
default, it is vital that it is designed to meet the needs of all claimants, not just those with more straightforward claims.
default In order to prevent arrears, evictions and homelessness, provisions must be in place to secure rent payments to the landlord for people who are less able to manage their finances or who have fallen into arrears 
default&#xa0;
default5.2 defaultClaimants who may be in need of extra support will be assessed at the beginning of their claim to see if they need an APA. However, claimants will only be interviewed if the
defaulty answer questions through the online application which 
defaultflag them as being in need of assistance. We are concerned that this will not identify all the people who are in need of support. 
default&#xa0;
default5.3 defaultIf people are flagged as needing extra support they will be refer
defaultr
defaulted for an assessment. The factors which the assessor should consider when making a decision are divided into two tiers.
default The first tier includes factors such as being currently homeless, having a mental health condition or a drug addiction. The second includes factors such as having previously been homeless or having a history of rent arrears. It is not clear why these factors have been divided up into separate tiers. 
defaultW
defaulte 
defaultare 
defaultconcerned 
defaultthat what 
defaultis likely to happen in practice is that people who fall into tier 1 will automatically be granted an APA whereas those who fall into tier 2 will not. Given that assessors are expected to make a decision based on each individual’s circumstances, it is not at all clear why separate tiers are necessary. 
default&#xa0;
default5.4 defaultOffering a direct payment of housing benefit to a landlord is one of the most important incentives currently available to those working to house people in the PRS. They are able to secure direct payments for their clients through the temporary measures the government have put in place.  PRS access schemes are 
defaultreporting
default tha
defaultt
default landlords are planning to stop working with them because they do not expect direct payments to be available under UC
default at all
default. 
default&#xa0;
default5.5 defaultRecommendationsdefault&#xa0;default6. Rent in Advancedefault6.1 defaultThe abolition of Crisis Loans and the localisation of emergency welfare assistance
default means that there is now little provision for rent in advance for people on low incomes who are moving to a new PRS property. Crisis has looked at the provision offered by local authorities in 
defaultLondon
default and found that only four local authorities explicitly state that they will provide support for rent in advance. Research from the Children’s Society confirms that this is a problem across the country.
default If people on low incomes, including those who have been homeless, cannot get help with rent in advance they are unlikely to be unable to secure PRS accommodation. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2 defaultRecommendationdefaultsdefault&#xa0;default7. defaultTemporary Accommodation (TA)default7.1 defaultHouseholds in TA will be subject to the benefit cap which will cause particular problems where households are placed in accommodation with high rents. The social housing under occupancy measures will apply to households placed in social sector TA which is deemed larger than they need.
default&#xa0;
default7.2 defaultThis could prevent local authorities from being able to secure affordable accommodation to use as TA and therefore make it difficult for them to carry out their statutory homelessness duties. There is also a risk that this will lead to repeat homelessness with households’ housing benefit being restricted and them therefore being unable to meet their rental obligations This will present particular problems in Scotland where the abolition of ‘priority need’ means that there are a greater number of single person households being accepted as homeless and therefore placed in TA. There is a limited amount of 1 bedroom social houses available so single people are likely to be placed in households larger than their needs and so will be subject to the under occupancy restrictions. 
default&#xa0;default7.3 Recommendationsdefault&#xa0;
default8. Exempt Accommodationdefault8.1 defaultSupported accommodation, including hostels for homeless people, domestic violence refuges, housing projects for people with learning disabilities and sheltered housing for elderly people, has historically been exempt from normal housing benefit rules. However, there are problems with the specific definition that the DWP uses to decide what accommodation will be exempt. Much of the accommodation which is considered supported does not meet this definition, so people living in it could potentially find that they are subject to housing benefit restrictions including the benefit cap or the ‘bedroom tax’. This is not the government’s stated intention and they are seeking to draft a new definition, but progress on this has so far been limited. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2 defaultRecommendationdefault&#xa0;
default9. Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP)default9.1 defaultCouncils should plan carefully how best to use their 
defaultextra 
defaultDHP
default money 
defaultin light of the extra demand cre
defaultated by housing benefit changes. 
defaultIt will be important to ensure that it is available for a range of purposes, including supporting people who have been affected by the extension of the SAR. There must be a balance between granting long term awards, for example to help disabled claimants stay in a property that has been adapted for their needs, and ensuring that short term awards are 
defaultalso 
defaultavailable.
default 
defaultThere is evidence that some councils are not spending all of their DHP allocation despite there being huge housing need in their areas, which is particularly worrying.
