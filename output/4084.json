"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn our research with the public through our awareness monitor\n&#xa0;\nCAM\n, we see that how charities spend their money really matters. Of course, there are those who say the public shouldn’t care about overheads and should focus on impact. \nWell you live in your ivory towers and we will keep trying in the real world that the public inhabit. Again and again and again, the public tell us that the size of CEO salaries, the level of ‘admin’ costs and how their money is used really matters to them\n.\n&#xa0;\nIs it really surprising that somebody giving up £10 from a pension or a limited salary feels aggrieved when they discover that their money is used to pay a salary many times that of their own? Apparently to Stephen Bubb it is. He said as much on the Tod\nay programme. I have no idea what the evidence base is for his assertion that charity CEO salaries don’t worry donors, but my fear is that he doesn’t have one.\n&#xa0;\nWe are releasing our evidence on what the public think about these issues in powerpoint format \nand as a 15 minute video of me presenting the data. You can watch it\n&#xa0;\nhere. And if you doubt\n&#xa0;\nour research\n, read the comments on the both the Guardian and Telegraph website\ns. Right-wing plot? Not unless you think Guardian readers are in on the conspiracy.\n&#xa0;\nJust as surprising as the fact that some don’t believe that CEO salaries are a problem is the fact that the sector has been so unprepared and unwilling to defend its salary practices. At times like this, the sector doesn’t seem to exist and it’s every char\nity for themselves.\nA few did a good job of doing interviews – such as Christian Aid and Oxfam – but even then, the key messages were not clear. One interview described the work of the Telegraph as an ‘attack’. It’s a dangerous line indeed to describe \npubl\nicising a charity CEO’s salary as an attack, particularly coming from charities which are committed to accountability and transparency.\n&#xa0;\nStephen Bubb’s line of defence appears to be ‘donors don’t care and these are very difficult jobs’. They are very diffi\ncult jobs, but I doubt many listeners to any of the interviews went away feeling reassured. An outcry over charity CEO salaries is entirely predictable. Indeed, what has been discussed is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many charities far smaller th\nan Oxfam or Red Cross who pay their CEOs comparable amounts, while there are also many sector employees that aren’t CEOs who earn over £100k.\n&#xa0;\nI think we need to pay charity CEOs \nover £100k to get good candidates. I give to more than 10 charities that pay their staff over this amount and have no problem with doing so. However, the arguments that have been used to date to defend these salaries are patchy at best. Here are the ones t\nhat I have heard:\n&#xa0;\nThere are probably a number \nof other arguments too (we’d love to hear yours - please write them in the comments section). It’s hard to know which of these are persuasive with donors, so later in the year we hope to carry out some focus groups with donors to find out. This should help\n charities work out the best way to take donors and the public with them.\n&#xa0;\nOne thing is for sure; this is not the last time charity CEO salaries or costs will be an issue in the media. At very least next time, the sector and individual charities should be \nbetter prepared.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
