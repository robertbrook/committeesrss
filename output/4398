defaultIntroduction:defaultNorthamptonshire County Council is a local transport and highway authority and as such has a direct interest in the decision making and funding processes for local major transport schemes.  
defaultNorthamptonshire is the largest single growth area outside London 
defaultand has one of the fastest growing populations in England with a current population of about 700,000.
default  
defaultThrough 
defaultour
default 10 point plan we want to help create 70,000 new jobs over the next 15 years and provide the infrastructure which could potentially release ov
defaulter 80,000 new homes.

defaultLocal highway 
defaultand transport authorities are publicly accountable
default bodies
default and recognised by their communities 
defaultas being responsible for the roads and transport systems within the areas.  They are best placed to understand the problems and make decisions on behalf of their 
defaultcommunities.

defaultThe allocation and bidding mechanisms for local transport expenditure have been undergoing change for many years.  Annual bids for funding using Transport Policies and Programmes submissions were replaced from 2001 by five-yearly Local Transp
defaultort Plans which bid for five year allocations of block funding for Integrated Transport and Maintenance, while retaining a separate bidding round for major schemes over £5million.  Subsequently
default,
default in December 201

default, the bidding process for block allocations w
defaultas replaced by an indicative allocation
default based on calculated formulae
default.

defaultThe benefits of these changes in relation to block funding
default to 
defaultNorthamptonshire County Council
default have been:
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhen the Department for Trans
defaultport announced their decision to devolve decision-making on local major transport schemes in September 2012 their stated reasons were 
defaultthat it will: 
default1.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNorthamptonshire County Council responded to the associated consultation in March 2012 by welcoming the principle of 
defaultdevolving decision-making and accountability to the local level, and finding ways of delivering schemes which minimise the administrative 
defaultburden and costs on both central and local government
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, many 
defaultfelt that the 
defaultarrangements proposed in the consultation paper fell far short of the optimum means of achieving this.  The (then) proposed Local Transport Bodies created further layers of
default unnecessary bureaucracy, which would complicate decision making and inevitabl
defaulty
default lead to additional costs
default.  
default&#xa0;
default1.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSubsequently, the decision to allocate large amount
defaults
default of transport funding via the Single Local Growth Fund 
defaultto
default Local Enterprise Partnerships has created considerable complexity
default in terms of how Local Transport Bo
defaultdies
default work
default.  W
defaulte believe 
defaultthis 
defaulthas 
defaultthe capacity to 
defaultundermine the 
defaultoriginal
default rationale by which decision-making for local major transport schemes was to be 
defaultdevol
defaultved
default 
defaultas real power is not being handed to local communities
default.  
defaultIn addition, apart from the already confirmed figures for
default each LTB area (which represents only 
defaulta small proportion of the total funding
default demand
default), we understand that the initial funding announcement
default in July 2014 will only confirm a funding allocation for 2015/16, which does not provide the certainty that authorities need to deliver major schemes whose construction is likely to span financial years, or indeed the impetus to expedite preparation of sch
defaultemes when there is no certainty of future funding.
default&#xa0;
default1.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe bidding process came as something as a surprise
default to authorities which had been gearing up for a formulaic allocation of funding via Local Transport Bo
defaultdies
default, and given the importance of this funding to the local economy, we believe that the short timescales which have been given for the preparation of Strategic Economic Plans will not produce an optimal result in ensuring that 
defaultallocated
default fundin
defaultg does align pro
defaultperly with need.
default&#xa0;
default1.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe creation 
defaultof new
default organisations, Local Transport Bodies, to administer devolved local major transport scheme funding created 
defaultunnecessary
default bureaucracy.  
defaultThe allocation of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships, means that since local au
defaultthorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of most schemes, three 
defaultorganisations are 
defaultnow involved in what would now seem
default to be an unnecessary and con
defaultvoluted decision-making process with accountability still laying with the Local Highway author
defaultity as part of their statutory duties.
default&#xa0;
default1.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe believe that a far more effective model would be to follow the original proposal for devolution of funding via a formulaic process (perhaps amended to encompass wider priorities), but with funding allocate
defaultd 
defaultdirectly to local authorities who are the Highway and Transport Authorities. Associated with this should be
default a requirement for local authorities to
default demonstrate meaningful engagement with 
defaulttheir local business communities
default and LEPs
default, instead of the heavy-handed
default evaluation process
default that is being recommended by
default the Department for Transport
default.
default 
defaultL
defaultocal authorities are publicly accountable bodies
default with formal scrutiny arrangements and engagement with local communities and businesses is now second nature.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultLike other
default upper-tier local authorities
default, Northamptonshire County Council
default 
defaultmaintain
defaults
default a professional team of highway and transport officers with a wide breadth of experience across the field and a deep knowledge of the transport issues facing the
defaultir localities
default.  
defaultThe capacity of any authority with respect to major transport schemes is heavil
defaulty linked to the level and certain of funding which is available for delivery of such schemes.  When funding is short, there is inevitably a vicious circle in that local authorities will not maintain capacity at a level beyond that which they can reasonably
default expect to be justified.  However, the structures are already in place which would allow that capacity to be easily expanded to meet the needs of increased funding, but an element of up-front pump-priming is needs to allow short-term expansion or a long-te
defaultrm 
defaultfunding commitment so that local authorities can have confidence to expand their capacity.  
default2.2
default              
defaultThe professional team supports and advises elected 
defaultCounty 
defaultCouncillors
default who are able to directly reflect the views and 
defaultpriorities
default of their constituents in the
defaultir decision making.
default  
defaultThe e
defaultlected member structure
defaults include
defaults
default a Cabinet portfolio structure 
defaultwith executive responsibility and established scrutiny mechanisms.  Budget and consultation processes are well established, and engagement with the private sector tak
defaultes place through the Local Enterprise Partnerships and more directly
default when needed
default.
default2.3
default              
defaultTogether, the professional officers and elected members are already responsible for local major transport schemes from problem identification through to delivery, with th
defaulte only decisions which are taken elsewhere being the statutory processes (such as Side Roads Orders and Compulsory Purchase Orders) and the allocation of funding which are 
defaultboth 
defaultundertaken 
defaultby the Department for Transport. However,
default local authorities are 
defaultincreasingly 
defaultexpected to procure or provide a significant amount of the funding and to bear risk of cost-over runs.
default2.4
default              
defaultNorthamptonshire Enterprise Partnership (NEP) maintains a similar team of 
defaultprofessional officers with knowledge of 
defaultstrategic leadership, 
defaultambition and vehicles for identifying clear investment priorities and interventions necessary to stimulate private sector led economic growth
default.  The NEP Board brings together private sector and 
defaultpublic sector interests
default to give a key view of economic developm
defaultent issues.  NEP, although having expertise in its specialised areas, does not have the specialised knowledge of the assessment, prioritisation and delivery of local transport schemes, relying on NCC for advice in this area, and as the funder of the organi
defaultsation we would see the creation of unnecessary cost and inefficiency to duplicate skills we already possess.
default2.5
default              
defaultNEP and NCC have worked closely together to develop the Northamptonshire Arc, an overall spatial investment strategy 
defaultthat ties together all of
default the projects across the county to ensure we are all moving forward
default as one. It 
defaultidentifies connectivity issues and 
defaultan 
defaultinfrastructure deficit that if not tackled through various initiatives would prevent Northamptonshire from fulfilling its vision of sustain
defaultable growth
default. It concentrates on 3 high level outcomes for the county:
default2.6
default              
defaultSouth East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership (SEMLEP) which has 
defaultin its membership five of the seven borough or district councils in Northamptonshire, similarly has limited capacity for assessing, prioritising and delivering transport schemes, and relies on the transport officers of its constituent authorities to provid
defaulte this professional expertise on its behalf.
default2.
default5
default              
defaultWe believe that the optimum delivery body already exists – i
defaultn the shape of local highway and transport authorities
default – 
defaultwho 
defaultalready possess all the skills and democratic accountability to assess, prioritise and
default deliver local transport schemes.
default3.1
default              
defaultLocal authorities have dealt with schemes crossing their boundaries for many years witho
defaultut the need to establish 
defaultcomplicated 
defaultarrangements.  The usual arrangement has been to reach agreement that one authority acts as lead for promotion and delivery of the scheme.  This has worked well on many occasions and there is no need to establish bureaucratic structures to enable such sche
defaultmes, particularly if funding mechanisms – such as formulaic allocations 
default–
default 
defaultencourage local authorities to work in partnership rather than competition with each other.
default3.2
default              
defaultWe therefore believe that funding should be allocated to local authority level, and wh
defaultere a cross-border 
defaultissue 
defaultexists it should be funded jointly by those authorities affected as, if it is a major issue, it will
default already
default be recognised as such by all those involved.
default4.1
default              
defaultNorthamptonshire County Council believes that there is currently good working between local bodies and Government departments and national transport agencies.   As noted in 2.5 above, we have used our excellent 
defaultrelationship with Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership to develop a joint spatial investment strategy for the county, the Northamptonshire Arc.
default4.
default2
default              
defaultOften on a case by case basis we work with other authorities and organisations, e.g.:
default4.
default3
default              
defaultW
defaulte believe that 
defaultoverlapping LEPs create 
defaultfrequent 
defaulttension
defaults and unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing priorities and common delivery agendas.
default4.
default4
default              
defaultWe also believe that there are frequent examples of government departments not supporting common agendas, such as past actions by the Highways Agency, whether due to 
defaultpolicy or pursuit of performance indicators with respect to congestion on their network, which have tended to inhibit development.  The over-proscriptive regime laid down by the Department for Transport for Local Transport Bodies
default does not encourage true lo
defaultcalism and the principles of
default devolution.
default5.1 
default              
defaultThe local authority road network represents 98% of England’s roads by length and carries two-third of all road traffic, and we do not believe that the importance of this network is recognised in the amount of funding made available for investment.  While w
defaulte are aware that there has been significant variation in the funding 
defaultavailable
default over time
default, 
defaultwe have not been able to find clear figures to demonstrate this point, and would suggest that it would be useful for the Select Committee to ask the Department for Tr
defaultansport to produce their spending figures on local major transport schemes over the last 30 years, to show both the relatives changes and the frequent changes in funding levels.
default5.2 
default              
defaultLocal Major Transport Schemes are complex and time-consuming projects.  C
defaulthoosing the most appropriate route requires extensive 
defaultconsultation and
default environmental analysis.  In addition, statutory orders are required, which mean that for most schemes the preparatory process will take a 
defaultperiod
default of years, and cost a seven-figure sum.
default  
defaultAn
defaulty
default funding stream which includes a bidding process therefore means that local authorities must expend 
defaultconsiderable
default time and cost in preparing schemes with no 
defaultcertainty that they will be funded, particularly where an advanced state of scheme preparation me
defaultans that a scheme will have a greater chance of success in bidding.
default5.
default3
default              
defaultIn more recent 
defaulttimes
default, the much reduced level of funding available for LTP major scheme funding has meant that if a scheme is unsuccessful in 
defaultreceiving 
defaultfunding the
defaultn
default delay
defaults
default running into a period of years
default would occur, 
defaultmeaning that any statutory orders obtained in expectation of funding are likely to expire and
default, therefore, 
defaultadditional costs
default will be incurred
default in obtaining them again.
default5.
default4
default              
defaultThis has placed much more emphasis in 
defaultrecent years on funding major transport schemes through other sources
default and Government funding pots
default.  However, 
defaultmany 
defaultfunding streams have often been announced at short-notice and the funding has usually had time limitations meaning that a 
defaultscheme
default has to be at 
defaulta very advanced stage of preparation to be deliverable within such a time period.  
default5.
default5
default              
defaultThe announcement of a much increased level of funding allocated for local major transport schemes over an extended period of years earlier this year was therefore very 
defaultwelcome.  However, as outlined in our response to other questions, the allocation of this funding via a bidding process to LEPs 
defaultand with only one year of confirmed funding (beyond the initial allocation to LTB areas) 
defaultcreates considerable complications and 
defaultmeans that there 
defaultwill not be the 
defaultdegree of funding certainty 
defaultnecessary to ensure effective
default preparatory
default 
defaultinvestment in major schemes
default.
default Consideration should be given to the establishment of a funding stream to allow local highway and transport authorities to u
defaultndertake the preparatory works for major schemes in order to get them to a state of readiness for when funding is eventually forthcoming.
default 
default6.1
default              
defaultAs far as we understand the process, Local Transport Bodie
defaults no longer have a defined role in the process given that f
defaultunding is being devolved to 
defaultLocal Enterprise Partnerships. At present,
default it is not evident 
defaultas to how 
defaultLEPs 
defaultwill be
default requ
defaultired to involve LTBs.  Although we suspect that most will do
default so, the lack of clarity
default 
defaulthas caused confusion, especially given 
defaultthe extensive work that local authorities an
defaultd LEPs went through to deliver the
default government
default’s proposals 
defaultfor LTBs
default.
default 
default6.2
default              
defaultWhile there was
default no overlap between Local Transport Bodies, there
default are examples 
defaultsuch as Northamptonshire of 
defaultoverlap
defaultping
default LEP
defaults where
defaultwe have two 
defaultdifferent LEPs 
default(NEP and SEMLEP) 
defaultcould be bidding for 
defaultthe same transport investment.  Not only does this create significant duplicat
defaultion in the bidding process, but there will be a need to resolve between the two LEPs how allocated funding will be determined in those areas of overlap.  This is likely to further delay the delivery of schemes.
default6.3
default              
defaultThere is also much concern within the 
defaultprofession that the inclusion of a significant element of Integrated Transport (IT) Block funding within the Single Local Growth Fund is likely to inhibit the delivery of the small-scale sche
defaultmes which the IT Block is used to deliver.
default 
defaultSuch schemes often dem
defaultonstrate very
default high value for money
default, which could now be reduced as a result of extra cost
defaults
default associated with the more convoluted bidding process
default and bureaucracy
default for the Local Growth Fund. 
defaultMoreover, the inclusion of top-sliced budgets that would have tradition
defaultally been used for Highway and Transport schemes into a fund that is un-ringfenced means that the level of uncertainty for local highway authorities is likely to be increased.
default6.5
default              
defaultIn addition, as highlighted in our earlier answers to questions 1 and 5, we 
defaultunderstand that beyond the allocations made to each LTB area, the only funding which will be confirmed in July 2014 is for 2015/16, which will mean that authorities will not have the funding certainty required to deliver major schemes which span financial 
defaultyears.
default7.1
default   
defaultVery often 
defaultt
defaulthe main barrier to pri
defaultvate sector investment in essentially publicly owned         infrastructure 
defaultand new and innovative funding mechanism is EU procurement rules coupled with the risk appetite 
defaultand confidence 
defaultof all parties, particularly in these austere times. Linked to this is the need to establish revenue streams that provide appropriate payback to the investors in a reasonable period of time. Local authorities can be best placed to take the longer term view
default and provide some form of security which could encourage the private sector to share risk differently and make investments in infrastructure that they would not otherwise make. For example,

defaultThis approach has allowed a £100m programme of projects to commence as a result of up
defaultfront funding in the order of only £10m. 
default&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
defaultThe current lines of accountability for decision making are very clear.  Local authorities are responsible for the 
defaultpromotion and delivery of schemes.  The Department for Transport is responsible for allocating funding in many instances and for processing certain statutory processes (Side Roads Order and Compulsory Orders).
default  Local authorities and the Ministers (through 
defaultParliament) are ultimately responsible to the electorate.
default8.2
default              
defaultIn the past the local highway and transport authority would have had complete control over decision making  through due diligence and due process as a publicly accountable body responsible for the delivery and the maintenance of transport infrastructure. T
defaulthe system now being proposed is unnecessarily complicated and broadly as follows:
defaultThere is considerable scope within this process for the priorities of Local Authorities, Local Transport Bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships to be in conflict, and neither LTBs or LEPs are publicly accountable in this same way as local authorities. 
default8
default.3
default              
defaultWe believe that this makes clear that the process for local decision making is much more complex than is currently the case, and we believe unnecessarily so.
