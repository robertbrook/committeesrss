[normal]Written [bold]evidence[bold] [bold]from[bold] [bold]Northamptonshire County Council (LTD0013)[bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Introduction:[bold]Northamptonshire County Council is a local transport and highway authority and as such has a direct interest in the decision making and funding processes for local major transport schemes.  
[normal]Northamptonshire is the largest single growth area outside London 
[normal]and has one of the fastest growing populations in England with a current population of about 700,000.
[normal]  
[normal]Through 
[normal]our
[normal] 10 point plan we want to help create 70,000 new jobs over the next 15 years and provide the infrastructure which could potentially release ov
[normal]er 80,000 new homes.
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Local highway 
[normal]and transport authorities are publicly accountable
[normal] bodies
[normal] and recognised by their communities 
[normal]as being responsible for the roads and transport systems within the areas.  They are best placed to understand the problems and make decisions on behalf of their 
[normal]communities.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The allocation and bidding mechanisms for local transport expenditure have been undergoing change for many years.  Annual bids for funding using Transport Policies and Programmes submissions were replaced from 2001 by five-yearly Local Transp
[normal]ort Plans which bid for five year allocations of block funding for Integrated Transport and Maintenance, while retaining a separate bidding round for major schemes over £5million.  Subsequently
[normal],
[normal] in December 201
[normal]0
[normal], the bidding process for block allocations w
[normal]as replaced by an indicative allocation
[normal] based on calculated formulae
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The benefits of these changes in relation to block funding
[normal] to 
[normal]Northamptonshire County Council
[normal] have been:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]When the Department for Trans
[normal]port announced their decision to devolve decision-making on local major transport schemes in September 2012 their stated reasons were 
[normal]that it will: 
[normal]1.5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Northamptonshire County Council responded to the associated consultation in March 2012 by welcoming the principle of 
[normal]devolving decision-making and accountability to the local level, and finding ways of delivering schemes which minimise the administrative 
[normal]burden and costs on both central and local government
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, many 
[normal]felt that the 
[normal]arrangements proposed in the consultation paper fell far short of the optimum means of achieving this.  The (then) proposed Local Transport Bodies created further layers of
[normal] unnecessary bureaucracy, which would complicate decision making and inevitabl
[normal]y
[normal] lead to additional costs
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Subsequently, the decision to allocate large amount
[normal]s
[normal] of transport funding via the Single Local Growth Fund 
[normal]to
[normal] Local Enterprise Partnerships has created considerable complexity
[normal] in terms of how Local Transport Bo
[normal]dies
[normal] work
[normal].  W
[normal]e believe 
[normal]this 
[normal]has 
[normal]the capacity to 
[normal]undermine the 
[normal]original
[normal] rationale by which decision-making for local major transport schemes was to be 
[normal]devol
[normal]ved
[normal] 
[normal]as real power is not being handed to local communities
[normal].  
[normal]In addition, apart from the already confirmed figures for
[normal] each LTB area (which represents only 
[normal]a small proportion of the total funding
[normal] demand
[normal]), we understand that the initial funding announcement
[normal] in July 2014 will only confirm a funding allocation for 2015/16, which does not provide the certainty that authorities need to deliver major schemes whose construction is likely to span financial years, or indeed the impetus to expedite preparation of sch
[normal]emes when there is no certainty of future funding.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The bidding process came as something as a surprise
[normal] to authorities which had been gearing up for a formulaic allocation of funding via Local Transport Bo
[normal]dies
[normal], and given the importance of this funding to the local economy, we believe that the short timescales which have been given for the preparation of Strategic Economic Plans will not produce an optimal result in ensuring that 
[normal]allocated
[normal] fundin
[normal]g does align pro
[normal]perly with need.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.9
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The creation 
[normal]of new
[normal] organisations, Local Transport Bodies, to administer devolved local major transport scheme funding created 
[normal]unnecessary
[normal] bureaucracy.  
[normal]The allocation of funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships, means that since local au
[normal]thorities are responsible for the promotion and delivery of most schemes, three 
[normal]organisations are 
[normal]now involved in what would now seem
[normal] to be an unnecessary and con
[normal]voluted decision-making process with accountability still laying with the Local Highway author
[normal]ity as part of their statutory duties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We believe that a far more effective model would be to follow the original proposal for devolution of funding via a formulaic process (perhaps amended to encompass wider priorities), but with funding allocate
[normal]d 
[normal]directly to local authorities who are the Highway and Transport Authorities. Associated with this should be
[normal] a requirement for local authorities to
[normal] demonstrate meaningful engagement with 
[normal]their local business communities
[normal] and LEPs
[normal], instead of the heavy-handed
[normal] evaluation process
[normal] that is being recommended by
[normal] the Department for Transport
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]L
[normal]ocal authorities are publicly accountable bodies
[normal] with formal scrutiny arrangements and engagement with local communities and businesses is now second nature.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Like other
[normal] upper-tier local authorities
[normal], Northamptonshire County Council
[normal] 
[normal]maintain
[normal]s
[normal] a professional team of highway and transport officers with a wide breadth of experience across the field and a deep knowledge of the transport issues facing the
[normal]ir localities
[normal].  
[normal]The capacity of any authority with respect to major transport schemes is heavil
[normal]y linked to the level and certain of funding which is available for delivery of such schemes.  When funding is short, there is inevitably a vicious circle in that local authorities will not maintain capacity at a level beyond that which they can reasonably
[normal] expect to be justified.  However, the structures are already in place which would allow that capacity to be easily expanded to meet the needs of increased funding, but an element of up-front pump-priming is needs to allow short-term expansion or a long-te
[normal]rm 
[normal]funding commitment so that local authorities can have confidence to expand their capacity.  
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The professional team supports and advises elected 
[normal]County 
[normal]Councillors
[normal] who are able to directly reflect the views and 
[normal]priorities
[normal] of their constituents in the
[normal]ir decision making.
[normal]  
[normal]The e
[normal]lected member structure
[normal]s include
[normal]s
[normal] a Cabinet portfolio structure 
[normal]with executive responsibility and established scrutiny mechanisms.  Budget and consultation processes are well established, and engagement with the private sector tak
[normal]es place through the Local Enterprise Partnerships and more directly
[normal] when needed
[normal].
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Together, the professional officers and elected members are already responsible for local major transport schemes from problem identification through to delivery, with th
[normal]e only decisions which are taken elsewhere being the statutory processes (such as Side Roads Orders and Compulsory Purchase Orders) and the allocation of funding which are 
[normal]both 
[normal]undertaken 
[normal]by the Department for Transport. However,
[normal] local authorities are 
[normal]increasingly 
[normal]expected to procure or provide a significant amount of the funding and to bear risk of cost-over runs.
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership (NEP) maintains a similar team of 
[normal]professional officers with knowledge of 
[normal]strategic leadership, 
[normal]ambition and vehicles for identifying clear investment priorities and interventions necessary to stimulate private sector led economic growth
[normal].  The NEP Board brings together private sector and 
[normal]public sector interests
[normal] to give a key view of economic developm
[normal]ent issues.  NEP, although having expertise in its specialised areas, does not have the specialised knowledge of the assessment, prioritisation and delivery of local transport schemes, relying on NCC for advice in this area, and as the funder of the organi
[normal]sation we would see the creation of unnecessary cost and inefficiency to duplicate skills we already possess.
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]NEP and NCC have worked closely together to develop the Northamptonshire Arc, an overall spatial investment strategy 
[normal]that ties together all of
[normal] the projects across the county to ensure we are all moving forward
[normal] as one. It 
[normal]identifies connectivity issues and 
[normal]an 
[normal]infrastructure deficit that if not tackled through various initiatives would prevent Northamptonshire from fulfilling its vision of sustain
[normal]able growth
[normal]. It concentrates on 3 high level outcomes for the county:
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership (SEMLEP) which has 
[normal]in its membership five of the seven borough or district councils in Northamptonshire, similarly has limited capacity for assessing, prioritising and delivering transport schemes, and relies on the transport officers of its constituent authorities to provid
[normal]e this professional expertise on its behalf.
[normal]2.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that the optimum delivery body already exists – i
[normal]n the shape of local highway and transport authorities
[normal] – 
[normal]who 
[normal]already possess all the skills and democratic accountability to assess, prioritise and
[normal] deliver local transport schemes.
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Local authorities have dealt with schemes crossing their boundaries for many years witho
[normal]ut the need to establish 
[normal]complicated 
[normal]arrangements.  The usual arrangement has been to reach agreement that one authority acts as lead for promotion and delivery of the scheme.  This has worked well on many occasions and there is no need to establish bureaucratic structures to enable such sche
[normal]mes, particularly if funding mechanisms – such as formulaic allocations 
[normal]–
[normal] 
[normal]encourage local authorities to work in partnership rather than competition with each other.
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]We therefore believe that funding should be allocated to local authority level, and wh
[normal]ere a cross-border 
[normal]issue 
[normal]exists it should be funded jointly by those authorities affected as, if it is a major issue, it will
[normal] already
[normal] be recognised as such by all those involved.
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Northamptonshire County Council believes that there is currently good working between local bodies and Government departments and national transport agencies.   As noted in 2.5 above, we have used our excellent 
[normal]relationship with Northamptonshire Enterprise Partnership to develop a joint spatial investment strategy for the county, the Northamptonshire Arc.
[normal]4.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]Often on a case by case basis we work with other authorities and organisations, e.g.:
[normal]4.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]W
[normal]e believe that 
[normal]overlapping LEPs create 
[normal]frequent 
[normal]tension
[normal]s and unnecessary bureaucracy in establishing priorities and common delivery agendas.
[normal]4.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]We also believe that there are frequent examples of government departments not supporting common agendas, such as past actions by the Highways Agency, whether due to 
[normal]policy or pursuit of performance indicators with respect to congestion on their network, which have tended to inhibit development.  The over-proscriptive regime laid down by the Department for Transport for Local Transport Bodies
[normal] does not encourage true lo
[normal]calism and the principles of
[normal] devolution.
[normal]5.1 
[normal]              
[normal]The local authority road network represents 98% of England’s roads by length and carries two-third of all road traffic, and we do not believe that the importance of this network is recognised in the amount of funding made available for investment.  While w
[normal]e are aware that there has been significant variation in the funding 
[normal]available
[normal] over time
[normal], 
[normal]we have not been able to find clear figures to demonstrate this point, and would suggest that it would be useful for the Select Committee to ask the Department for Tr
[normal]ansport to produce their spending figures on local major transport schemes over the last 30 years, to show both the relatives changes and the frequent changes in funding levels.
[normal]5.2 
[normal]              
[normal]Local Major Transport Schemes are complex and time-consuming projects.  C
[normal]hoosing the most appropriate route requires extensive 
[normal]consultation and
[normal] environmental analysis.  In addition, statutory orders are required, which mean that for most schemes the preparatory process will take a 
[normal]period
[normal] of years, and cost a seven-figure sum.
[normal]  
[normal]An
[normal]y
[normal] funding stream which includes a bidding process therefore means that local authorities must expend 
[normal]considerable
[normal] time and cost in preparing schemes with no 
[normal]certainty that they will be funded, particularly where an advanced state of scheme preparation me
[normal]ans that a scheme will have a greater chance of success in bidding.
[normal]5.
[normal]3
[normal]              
[normal]In more recent 
[normal]times
[normal], the much reduced level of funding available for LTP major scheme funding has meant that if a scheme is unsuccessful in 
[normal]receiving 
[normal]funding the
[normal]n
[normal] delay
[normal]s
[normal] running into a period of years
[normal] would occur, 
[normal]meaning that any statutory orders obtained in expectation of funding are likely to expire and
[normal], therefore, 
[normal]additional costs
[normal] will be incurred
[normal] in obtaining them again.
[normal]5.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]This has placed much more emphasis in 
[normal]recent years on funding major transport schemes through other sources
[normal] and Government funding pots
[normal].  However, 
[normal]many 
[normal]funding streams have often been announced at short-notice and the funding has usually had time limitations meaning that a 
[normal]scheme
[normal] has to be at 
[normal]a very advanced stage of preparation to be deliverable within such a time period.  
[normal]5.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]The announcement of a much increased level of funding allocated for local major transport schemes over an extended period of years earlier this year was therefore very 
[normal]welcome.  However, as outlined in our response to other questions, the allocation of this funding via a bidding process to LEPs 
[normal]and with only one year of confirmed funding (beyond the initial allocation to LTB areas) 
[normal]creates considerable complications and 
[normal]means that there 
[normal]will not be the 
[normal]degree of funding certainty 
[normal]necessary to ensure effective
[normal] preparatory
[normal] 
[normal]investment in major schemes
[normal].
[normal] Consideration should be given to the establishment of a funding stream to allow local highway and transport authorities to u
[normal]ndertake the preparatory works for major schemes in order to get them to a state of readiness for when funding is eventually forthcoming.
[normal] 
[normal]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]As far as we understand the process, Local Transport Bodie
[normal]s no longer have a defined role in the process given that f
[normal]unding is being devolved to 
[normal]Local Enterprise Partnerships. At present,
[normal] it is not evident 
[normal]as to how 
[normal]LEPs 
[normal]will be
[normal] requ
[normal]ired to involve LTBs.  Although we suspect that most will do
[normal] so, the lack of clarity
[normal] 
[normal]has caused confusion, especially given 
[normal]the extensive work that local authorities an
[normal]d LEPs went through to deliver the
[normal] government
[normal]’s proposals 
[normal]for LTBs
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]6.2
[normal]              
[normal]While there was
[normal] no overlap between Local Transport Bodies, there
[normal] are examples 
[normal]such as Northamptonshire of 
[normal]overlap
[normal]ping
[normal] LEP
[normal]s where
[normal]we have two 
[normal]different LEPs 
[normal](NEP and SEMLEP) 
[normal]could be bidding for 
[normal]the same transport investment.  Not only does this create significant duplicat
[normal]ion in the bidding process, but there will be a need to resolve between the two LEPs how allocated funding will be determined in those areas of overlap.  This is likely to further delay the delivery of schemes.
[normal]6.3
[normal]              
[normal]There is also much concern within the 
[normal]profession that the inclusion of a significant element of Integrated Transport (IT) Block funding within the Single Local Growth Fund is likely to inhibit the delivery of the small-scale sche
[normal]mes which the IT Block is used to deliver.
[normal] 
[normal]Such schemes often dem
[normal]onstrate very
[normal] high value for money
[normal], which could now be reduced as a result of extra cost
[normal]s
[normal] associated with the more convoluted bidding process
[normal] and bureaucracy
[normal] for the Local Growth Fund. 
[normal]Moreover, the inclusion of top-sliced budgets that would have tradition
[normal]ally been used for Highway and Transport schemes into a fund that is un-ringfenced means that the level of uncertainty for local highway authorities is likely to be increased.
[normal]6.5
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, as highlighted in our earlier answers to questions 1 and 5, we 
[normal]understand that beyond the allocations made to each LTB area, the only funding which will be confirmed in July 2014 is for 2015/16, which will mean that authorities will not have the funding certainty required to deliver major schemes which span financial 
[normal]years.
[normal]7.1
[normal]   
[normal]Very often 
[normal]t
[normal]he main barrier to pri
[normal]vate sector investment in essentially publicly owned         infrastructure 
[normal]and new and innovative funding mechanism is EU procurement rules coupled with the risk appetite 
[normal]and confidence 
[normal]of all parties, particularly in these austere times. Linked to this is the need to establish revenue streams that provide appropriate payback to the investors in a reasonable period of time. Local authorities can be best placed to take the longer term view
[normal] and provide some form of security which could encourage the private sector to share risk differently and make investments in infrastructure that they would not otherwise make. For example, 
[normal]N
[normal]orthamptonshire County Council ha
[normal]s 
[normal]introduced 
[normal]a 
[normal]Revolving
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]nfrast
[normal]ructure 
[normal]F
[normal]und
[normal] based on the following general principles: 
[normal]This approach has allowed a £100m programme of projects to commence as a result of up
[normal]front funding in the order of only £10m. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]The current lines of accountability for decision making are very clear.  Local authorities are responsible for the 
[normal]promotion and delivery of schemes.  The Department for Transport is responsible for allocating funding in many instances and for processing certain statutory processes (Side Roads Order and Compulsory Orders).
[normal]  Local authorities and the Ministers (through 
[normal]Parliament) are ultimately responsible to the electorate.
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]In the past the local highway and transport authority would have had complete control over decision making  through due diligence and due process as a publicly accountable body responsible for the delivery and the maintenance of transport infrastructure. T
[normal]he system now being proposed is unnecessarily complicated and broadly as follows:
[normal]There is considerable scope within this process for the priorities of Local Authorities, Local Transport Bodies and Local Enterprise Partnerships to be in conflict, and neither LTBs or LEPs are publicly accountable in this same way as local authorities. 
[normal]8
[normal].3
[normal]              
[normal]We believe that this makes clear that the process for local decision making is much more complex than is currently the case, and we believe unnecessarily so.
