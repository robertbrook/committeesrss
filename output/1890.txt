&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The Environment Agency is the principal environmental regulator in England. As part of our role we consider the impacts of climate risks in our work including manage flood risk and coastal erosion management, safeguarding water resources and protecting the water and wetland environment. We have a new role to provide advice and support to help businesses, public sector and other organisations adapt to a changing climate (this is known as the Climate Ready Support Service). The role is for England but the products generated are available across the UK.We also administrate the economic incentive schemes such as the EU Emissions Trading System, the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and Climate Change Agreements. We do not have any direct influence over the remaining emissions from homes and surface transport such as cars and trains.Our engagement is generally with and through partners and trusted intermediaries. We work closely with Government bodies such as Natural England, Public Health England and the Met Office, through trade and professional bodies, and with local authorities and local resilience fora. Audience needs vary considerably and we adjust our messages accordingly. Messages that focus on climate impacts such as flooding are better understood than those concerned with climate science.  We have found that using more active language, such as ‘adapting to a changing climate’ and being ‘Climate Ready’ helps audiences to move on from the idea of climate change being remote and something they need to believe in, to needing to take action now.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]Our Climate Ready Support Service1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our Climate Ready Support Service provides online advice, a help desk and tailored support to help organisations adapt to extremes of weather and the changing climate. We operate the service for England only, but our tools and resources are available online for use across the UK.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The service focuses on priority risks and sectors in the National Adaptation Programme, published by government in July 2013. It is therefore aimed at organisations rather than the general public. The priority sectors for the service are: local government, the built environment, the natural environment, infrastructure, health and wellbeing, agriculture and forestry, business and services. 3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The service aims to build climate resilience in these sectors and organisations. We are clear that that the purpose of our advice is to help organisations understand how a changing climate affects their interests and how they can take actions to avoid and reduce the consequences.   4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our advice is delivered with and through other government delivery bodies, service providers and sector representatives. We use existing communication channels and networks where possible to ensure that customers can readily find advice from trusted and familiar sources in a language that they understand.  Our approach is to build capacity in those other organisations rather than to create a dependency on the services of the Environment Agency.  Our advice is tailored to customer needs to help them take appropriate action. For the majority of organisations, this means thinking first and foremost about their organisation rather than climate science.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We provide access on behalf of Defra to the UK Climate Projections, which provide the latest information on how the UK climate may change. We also work with researchers and Research Councils through the ‘Living With Environmental Change’ (LWEC) programme to summarise evidence on future climate impacts. LWEC is producing a series of reports that summarise impacts for policy makers and businesses. These are designed to be accessible to lay audiences, though are not specifically aimed at the general public.&#xa0;Interactions with Local Government6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We work closely with local government through our Climate Ready Support Service and our wider roles. We have supported the Local Government Association’s ‘Climate Local’ initiative with staff secondments. The initiative supports councils’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to improve their resilience to future climate through sharing information and developing action plans. Seventy-three councils have joined the initiative to date.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We provide adaptation training to councils, including a learning aid for councillors on the roles, opportunities and drivers for council led action on climate change. We will run training events in the autumn/winter 2013/14 for local authorities to promote available information and resources.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We support the Local Adaptation Advisory Panel, which brings together local authorities, government departments and delivery bodies to understand what support councils need to adapt to future climate. This is a key mechanism for local government to feedback to central government on adaptation legislation, policy and delivery programmes. 9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We are helping to develop practical tools to promote local adaptation. This includes working with Climate UK to make Kent County Council’s ‘Severe Weather Impacts Monitoring System’ available to all local authorities, helping them to record the impacts of severe weather on their services and aid future service planning.10.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We also provide support to councils and their partnerships through our local advisory and statutory planning role. This includes Local Nature Partnerships and Local Enterprise Partnerships, who we work with on major developments and support in producing European Structural and Investment Fund Strategies.&#xa0;Working through Climate Change Partnerships11.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Local delivery of our Climate Ready Support Service is provided by working in partnership with a network of Climate Change Partnerships, through their Climate UK umbrella organisation. The Partnerships work through stakeholder networks to share learning and build local climate resilience in businesses, local government, and communities. They have close relationships with business organisations such as Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, as well as with utilities, banks, insurers, local authorities, community engagement groups, tourism bodies, universities, and industry associations. 12.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Partnerships promote and support practical adaptation action. Recent examples include: -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Working with local communities to map vulnerable and resilient road networks.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Providing county councils and their local partners with an online system for logging the costs (in money and reputation) of extreme weather on an ongoing basis.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Developing an accredited qualification in Business Resilience, and testing it with 150 small businesses.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Running business resilience training days, including a Business Resilience Health Check, for businesses regulated by the Environment Agency.&#xa0;Working with other government bodies13.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have worked closely with lead government departments to develop the aims of the Climate Ready programme, particularly the Departments of Health; Business Innovation and Skills; Communities and Local Government; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and the Cabinet Office. 14.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In delivering the programme we work closely with other agencies and delivery bodies, especially the Met Office, Natural England and the Forestry Commission. Examples of working with other Government bodies include:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Establishing a delivery group for health sector resilience with the NHS Sustainable Development Unit, Public Health England and the Department of Health, which is supporting Health and Wellbeing Boards to develop local climate risk assessment and action plans.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Working with the National Flood Forum and Cabinet Office to develop local resilience case studies. These document the actions of four community groups to help increase their resilience against flooding and other weather events. The group in Calderdale use social media and web content to engage the local community and increase resilience during extreme events. -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Running workshops for local transport authorities, such as local authority highways teams and ambulance services, to understand and manage risks to their services from extreme weather.&#xa0;Communication through our wider flood and coastal management role15.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We work with our partners to help the public and communities understand their risk of flooding, which can involve consideration of climate change when thinking over the long term.16.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We aim to raise their awareness of flood risk and encourage people to take action to protect themselves and their property so they are better prepared for flooding. This may include them checking their flood risk on our flood map, signing up to our free warning service - Floodline Warnings Direct - or preparing a personal flood plan. We also look to improve flood response at a community level by holding community meetings and workshops, promoting community led flood action groups, and working with communities to establish community flood plans.17.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We issue flood warnings to the public, businesses and the emergency services to help them prepare and respond to floods. In March 2013, 62% of properties in the highest flood risk areas received our direct flood warnings, up from 60% at the end of 2011/12. Research carried out in 2013 found that our communications are effective in helping people to understand that preparing for flooding is worthwhile. Almost nine out of ten customers who are signed up to our free flood warning service and who had previously received a flood warning said that flood warnings are easy to understand, two-thirds agreed that flood warnings are accurate and half take action when a flood warning is issued.18.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; From October to November 2012 we ran a flood action campaign which aimed to change behaviours and encourage people to accept risk and take action: -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Our website had 650,000 unique users during the campaign – a 150% increase compared to the same period in 2011/12.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Over 4,000 people signed up for flood warnings as a result of the campaign.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Almost 2,000 people downloaded flood plans in direct response to the campaign adverts.19.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Climate change projections indicate rising sea levels and increasingly severe and frequent rainstorms, resulting in a greater risk of flooding.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Coastal Communities 2150 20.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Coastal Communities 2150 project helps communities to develop visions for managing their long term risks from coastal and climate change to 2150 and beyond. The project is a partnership between the Environment Agency, Kent and Hampshire County Councils and partners in Belgium and Holland. It is funded by the European INTERREG body.21.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Environment Agency is working in Newhaven, Seaford and Lewes in East Sussex, and has developed successful local engagement groups that are supported by town and parish councils. Kent County Council is working in Margate, the Isle Sheppey and the Romney Marshes. Hampshire County Council is engaging at 6 sites around the Solent.  22.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Public interest has been higher than expected and is driven by the desire to shape long term community plans. The UK partners have found it easier to form local public engagement groups than the Dutch or Belgians, who have encountered a public attitude that ‘the government have always dealt with this - so why should I get involved?’23.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Recent extreme weather events such as the droughts and floods in 2012 and Hurricane Sandy in New York seem to have contributed to general public acceptance that weather events have become more extreme and communities should prepare for more to come. The 150 year time frame has not been a problem for the public or businesses, who seem generally concerned with leaving a sustainable legacy for future generations.&#xa0;24.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We audiences are usually interested in climate change only to the extent that it affects their interests. They find it easier and more worthwhile to engage when risks are framed in familiar terms. We find it is more productive to focus on relevant impacts such as flooding and drought. 25.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We find it helpful to take a people-first or organisation-first perspective.  This involves thinking about how they are affected by current weather, and then how such vulnerabilities could increase in the future. This allows them to consider their adaptation needs without having to engage with complex science. 26.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; More expert audiences such as utilities are comfortable talking about climate change and appreciate to the need to adapt. However, they are also primarily interested in the impacts of climate change rather than the climate itself.  A lack of relevant information is often cited as a barrier to action, with organisations finding it difficult to translate climate projections into the more relevant impact assessments that they need to inform adaptation decisions. 27.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; We have undertaken market surveys to understand how potential customers for our Climate Ready Support Service, including organisations in the, business, local government, infrastructure, built environment, health, natural environment, agriculture and forestry sectors, engage with climate adaptation, and what language resonates with them. In summary, this shows that:-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Organisations are more familiar with climate change mitigation than adaptation and are more likely to be acting to mitigate climate change.  The reasons for this include: greater understanding of how to act; actions are associated with cost savings; they can apply tangible, measurable, specific targets; and existing regulation.  By contrast adaptation tends to have a lower profile and is associated with more barriers to action.  -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; When thinking specifically about environmental risks there is relatively high awareness of climate change among the target audience and organisations perceive it to be the top environmental risk (as important as environmental regulation/compliance).  Organisations also identify the impacts of climate change as key risks (e.g. flooding, droughts, heat-waves, and extreme weather).  29% of organisations believe they have already been affected by climate change a great deal and a further 39% believe that they have been affected a little. The target audience are most likely to think they will be affected by disruptions to staff (63%), all impact on logistics (60%), and all impact on premises or infrastructure (58%).-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The majority of organisations have a strategic approach to risk management as part of their normal business planning, and so can manage climate risks within that process rather than separately.-&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Organisations commonly cite barriers to adaptation that include: mitigation taking priority over adaptation; short-term focus is prioritised (adaptation is perceived to be long-term); a lack of understanding of the business case (the financial argument); economic pressures; lack of knowledge, capacity, finances and time; lack of confidence in the science and difficulty dealing with probabilities.28.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; It can also be effective to focus on adaptation actions (solutions) rather than climate (uncertain problems). In many cases, no- or low-regret actions can be taken that make sense regardless of future climate. For example, businesses can benefit from simple water efficiency measures or registering for our flood warning service irrespective of how the climate changes.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
