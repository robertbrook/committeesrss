&#xa0;Written evidence from Terence E Rowe [TOB01]&#xa0;&#xa0;Good afternoon,&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;It occurs to me that present and previous governments attitude to tobacco has been, too much influenced by the anti smoking lobby. The policy of continuously increasing prices above inflation is as far as smuggling is counter productive. It's prohibition by stealth. If you recall prohibition in the 1920's America led to the birth off and spread of gangsters. This high moral, creeping prohibition is in effect encouraging the ever increasing growth of smuggling gangs. So in my mind lawlessness is being encouraged. So in the words of Tony Blair be tough on the crime and THE CAUSE'S OF CRIME which I think Westminster is the guilty party. Why criminalise people give them FREEDOM to smoke if that's what they want. Why moralise?I my opinion there is far to much of trying to tell people what they should be. Allow people to be themselves, after all this is supposed to be the land of the FREE.&#xa0;Yours a concerned member of the public, who smokes and see's smuggling rife and accepted.&#xa0;Mr Terence E.
