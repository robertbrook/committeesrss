"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence Submitted by Roy Sherliker t/a Elec-craft Electrical ServicesSummary\n&#xa0;\nPersonal Evaluation of Part P \nI write\n as a self-employed electrician registered with NAPIT. I hold a BEng Degree in Civil Engineering, \nhaving retrained over ten years ago to be an electrician. \nI am a member of the IET, I have C&amp;G qualifications for electrical work\n,\n and have over ten\n years\n’\n ex\nperience in the industry\n,\n almost entirely in the domestic sector.\n&#xa0;\nIt would appear that e\nlectrical installation work in the UK can be carried out by \nalmost \nanyone who considers themselves to be capable of doing it\n withou\nt \nfear of \nretribution\n. The dangers of electricity are ignored by many who should not be doing electrical installation work, but because it can be done behind closed doors and “it works” the potential consequences are often \ndismissed. There is also widespre\nad denial of having been involved in doing something when challenged. Quite often people are more than happy to accept complete ignorance of any law when it comes to electrical work which is quite odd when you consider the potential dangers of faulty work,\n such as fires, electric shock and electrocution. When bone fide trades people identify faulty or dangerous work and nobody is prepared to accept responsibility for it they also deny knowledge of Part P. I\nf it is not done correctly or doesn’t comply with t\nhe Law\n it can easily be covered up and hidden. At a domestic level l\nack of \ntraining \nor real understanding \nabout electricity in the home \ndoes not prevent the home do-it-yourself enthusiast from having a go, nor does it adequately ensure companies and indivi\nduals who engage in the carrying out of electrical installation work are truly competent to be doing so.\n \nCompetent Persons Schemes were formed as a direct result of the implementation of Part P of the Building \nRegulations because of a\n requirement\n by this Law\n upon an individual to be a member of such a scheme in order that they could self-certify their work and circumvent the alternative to this of calling upon the Local Government Building Control department to \ncarry out that role. Part P was lack\ning in its structure to compensate for inadequacies of the LABC to carry out their role and almost total reliance on the CPSs to perform the function. Furthermore there was uni\nversal misunderstanding of the n\notification requirements of Part P where certain\n categories of electrical work had to be notified as being carried out, presumably because they were deemed higher risk if carried out incorrectly or improperly. However, the general\n interpretation was that non-notifiable work could be carried out by non-C\nPS members. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n              \n17 November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
