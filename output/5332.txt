[[[.]]] ….2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; The effort, the personal organisation, and the hassle are not my immediate concerns here.  But the risk, comfort and perceptions of others are considered below.2.2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Selected areas from the UW&amp;C research with which I agree, and which require policy change, chosen in relation to the Cycling Safety Inquiry:… it is essential that the urban environment is made safe for cyclists ...  This requires the provision of fully segregated cycle routes on all arterial and other busy roads in urban areas. …… there need to be effective restrictions on traffic speeds, parking and access on all residential roads and other routes without segregated cycle and pedestrian paths …… the system of legal liability on roads used by the public should be changed to protect the most vulnerable road users (cyclists and pedestrians).  …… it is necessary to change the image of cycling ... To a great extent this should be consequential on the above changes: as more people walk and cycle then more people will accept it as normal. …&#xa0;3.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; With colleagues I researched the extent to which cyclists perceive threat from motorised road users. Perceptions of risk are much higher among pedestrians and cyclists than among all other road users surveyed in our studies.  The threat of an ‘accident’ is a major disincentive to cycling.  Reducing speed is a key to accident severity reduction and thus to perceptions of safe streets and changing the environment is another. &#xa0;3.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Here I select those sections most germane for this Inquiry.  Although the work dates from 1992 the rate of incident remains below the threshold of Highways Authority reaction too often, it’s as if the cyclist is expected to bear the risk as a normal cost.  In our research incidents, and their locations, suggest a more important role for segregation on the road than attention being focused mainly at junctions:&#xa0;3.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Discussion]]]

[[[: ]]]The finding that, for this group of regular cyclists, threatening incidents on the roads were experienced at the rate of nearly one incident per cyclist per day cycled, suggests that there is likely to be a considerable disincentive to cycling. …&#xa0;The picture of risk derived from the diaries deviates somewhat from local accident figures. It is not clear what weight should be given to the official statistics on accidents as it is well accepted that cycle accidents, including those involving serious injury, are massively under-reported &#xa0;

[[[The discrepancies between the figures obtained from the diaries and those of police record data ar]]]

[[[e reminders of the subjectivity of accident notation and witness testimony]]]. &#xa0;If a cyclist swerves to avoid

[[[ ]]]an unexpected pothole, an ensuing accident with an offside

[[[ ]]]vehicle could be attributed either to cyclist error, to motorist

[[[ ]]]error or to road conditions.&#xa0;

[[[The diary figures also deviate from national accident figures produced by the Department of Transport, which give more emphasis to vehicles turning left and right, and less emphasis to parked vehicles]]]. &#xa0;In its document Pedal Cyclist Casualties-1, the Department of Transport does warn the reader about the possible unreliability of their data due to the underreporting of cycle accidents to the police, which form the basis for their figures.  Furthermore, local figures may well differ from national figures because of variations in traffic density and type, and local provision (or lack of provision) for cyclists. Also it must be noted that the diarists in the study reported here were over 23-years-old and were experienced and regular cyclists. As such they were likely to anticipate the infamous problem areas for cyclists - that is, junctions and roundabouts. &#xa0;However

[[[Discussion]]], p 274)Data from our previous study suggested that junctions and roundabouts were not perceived to be as numerically hazardous by the cycle diarists as would be expected from their prominence in local and national accident figures. &#xa0;

[[[ ]]]contrasts with Oxfordshire Road Casualty figures (Oxfordshire County Council, 1993),

[[[ ]]]which report that 68% of cycle accidents occur at junctions. It is well known that cycle

[[[ ]]]accidents are under-represented in accident figures (Mills, 1989) but we are addressing here

[[[ ]]]the pattern rather than the absolute number of accidents. National figures (Department of

[[[ ]]]Transport, 1992) also suggest that at least two-thirds of cycle accidents occur at junctions.

[[[  ]]]We suggest that these official figures almost certainly relate more to the classification of

[[[ ]]]accidents than to the nature of what is happening on the road. The police STATS 19 records

[[[ ]]]classify an accident as occurring at a junction irrespective of whether the manoeuvre of either vehicle concerned involved the junction or merely happened in the vicinity of a junction.

[[[ ]]]study, examining the characteristics of fatal as compared to total cycle accidents, finds that

[[[ ]]]fatal accidents are less likely to be at intersections than are non-fatal accidents (Hoque,

[[[ ]]]1990).  Our data also accord with the British Medical Association’s (1992) review, which

[[[ ]]]comments that most adult cyclist fatalities are caused by a vehicle approaching from

[[[ ]]]behind —which presumably includes errors in overtaking. The Highway Code (Department of

[[[ ]]]Environment, Transport and the Regions, 1999b) informs motorists that they should ‘give

[[[ ]]][cyclists] at least as much room as you would give a car’ (p. 18), although the accompanying

[[[ ]]]illustration suggests a less generous margin of overtaking than did the illustration in the 1993

[[[ ]]]edition (Department of Transport, 1993). The cyclists in our study clearly felt that they were

[[[ ]]]not given the margin they required by passing motor vehicles, particularly buses. It is possible

[[[ ]]]that buses overtake cycles with no narrower a margin than cars do, but threaten cyclists more

[[[ ]]]on account of their greater size. A film record would be needed to establish whether cyclists’

[[[ ]]]perceptions of risk relate more to the size, speed or position of the passing vehicle.&#xa0;

[[[lies in the hands of those who plan our roads rather than those who use them.]]] Experience in the Netherlands reveals the extent to which engineering solutions can provide a safer space for cyclists and walkers (Preston, 1990; Tolley, 1990).&#xa0;3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; The likelihood of risk on the highway being located, significantly, as the outcome of planning the road, and/or the degree to which politicians understand, demand or manage the engineering outcomes is a stark conclusion regarding the risks perceived, and imposed on vulnerable road users.  3.5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; But also hopeful because the production of these outcomes could be changed with rapidity.  As has been the case in Germany, the Netherlands etc.3.6.&#xa0;&#xa0; The predominant response in our British experience is twofold,3.6.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The pitifully small modal share taken by cycling3.6.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The belief among many people cycling that ‘defensive’ cycling has to be learnt, to cope with conditions on the road.3.6.2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This then has the added problem that these ‘coping’ cyclists in some way define how cycling should be done.  This presents a barrier to using a bike for many; for the overwhelming majority reported in the ESPRC - UW&amp;C research, who do not expect to, and who will not, ‘battle’ with motorised traffic.3.6.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; For many years divisions within cycling advocacy between vehicular cyclists and those who favour better infrastructure are deeply unhelpful. Advocating for the wishes of existing cyclists, a minority outlier population, is not the way to make cycling appeal to wider swathes of the population. This does of course result in a tension, as it is not unreasonable for cycling advocacy groups to represent their members, but it is a tension that can I think be fairly easily resolved. There is no need for a dichotomous approach, and it is perfectly feasible to support the needs of existing cyclists while also pushing for decent infrastructure, as well as wider factors that support less confident cyclists.3.6.2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In practice and even with years of experience it feels simply impossible to consistently take a ‘vehicular cyclist’ approach.  I base this comment on personal experience and observation of others.  E.G. travelling from Paddington Station to Smithfield, and return, there are many situations where the ambiguity of the road makes it difficult to avoid being in a narrow space alongside/between moving vehicles.3.7.&#xa0;&#xa0; What is illustrated by this section is the gulf between highways practice and a highways environment where cycling is enabled by the physical environment.&#xa0;4.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; The thinking and presumption/expectations of much of the Britain has been deeply influenced by thinking about the road environment dating from WW11, then the influential ‘Traffic in Towns’ report of ‘63, which effectively promoted car use at the expense of urban demolition, segregating motorised movement from the life of the urban area.  Residential Road Layout Guidance followed, ‘DB32’ of 1977 - 2007, cementing the idea that residential areas should be quiet and free from extraneous traffic using culs-de-sac.  A comforting concept but one which was both a travesty of the original Radburn, NJ, where the density is around 4 Dwellings/Acre, as well as a de-facto effect of limiting walking - by distancing retail and other destinations into separate agglomerations; making bus travel difficult to support; and resulting in a bleak, high-speed environment in which to cycle.  The model presented by Stevenage and Milton Keynes has been found not to support cycling because the provision is added after layout concept design rather than part of it.  4.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; A layout conceived for the car’s convenience whilst moving is most unlikely ever to be convenient or desirable for cycling whereas the ‘traditional city’ London in large part for instance, is connected and with a choice of destination on offer and where the bike is frequently the most convenient and quickest travel mode.  The withdrawal of DB32 and replacement by ‘Manual for Streets’ in 2007 is an important milepost in urban design.  A connected system, where most roads will inevitably be ‘quiet’, where connectivity can reduce the need to use a car, and where the bike performs competitively in convenience and quickness, is posited in the current guidance.  But at the point of publication two unfortunate problems appeared: 4.2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Banking crisis led to house-building collapsing and thus practice and debate using the new guidance has faltered, and in addition 4.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The guidance ‘left open a door’, to the continued, inappropriate reference to DMRB, ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges’ the Highways Agency’s design guide.  It was not until the publication of ‘Manual for Streets 2, wider application of the principles’ (2010), that DMRB’s inappropriateness is substituted. 4.2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I fear that the freely available MfS has a wider distribution than the expensive MfS2.  4.3.&#xa0;&#xa0; The consequence of the ubiquity of DMRB in practice is that thinking about users and facilities is ‘controlled’, to some significant extent, by concern over vehicular speed, volume and avoiding congestion of motor traffic.  In comparison the German Roads Guidance, RASt06 (which I translated into English for the publisher) has, since the early 1980s, taken the ‘revolutionary’ view that ‘the place’ and the activities taking place alongside any road are primary considerations in the road design process.  The German approach was itself heavily influenced by Dutch thinking and practice during the 70s and in 1981 West Germany ‘adopted’ Dutch guidance as they rewrote their own manual.4.4.&#xa0;&#xa0; Following the Times newspaper campaign and the existing interest of the current Government, a range of new funding resources have been provided.  In the case of the Cycle Safety Fund I wish to adumbrate a case in Oxfordshire of quite atrocious inability to design a fitting response and worse still, being able to comprehend and react to external criticism.4.5.&#xa0;&#xa0; Here is the body of a recently published letter of a group of local experts: -&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We learn from Oxford Times Letters (2/01/14) that the County is pressing on with its unbelievable design for the Wootton Road roundabout, Abingdon:&#xa0;http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/opinion/letters/10902309.New_cycle_route_is_both_risky_and_ill_conceived/ This follows my objection 17/10/13 that the design, using special ‘Cycle Safety Fund’ grant, was without merit: http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/abingdon/10734790.Fresh_look_at___300k_cycle_safety_project/&#xa0;Since then we’ve met officers on site, submitted a comprehensive report and further criticised a slightly modified scheme. &#xa0;Yet "The cabinet member… informed the meeting that the only place in Oxfordshire the council could identify as qualifying for a Government grant was this area on Wootton Road. &#xa0;Openly admitting that the scheme was flawed he continued, overruling safety concerns in order to spend the money before the April deadline."&#xa0;&#xa0;When budgets are shrunk and e.g. schools are crying out for zebra crossings for their pupils, this is a debacle. &#xa0;To willfully misspend £300,000, including misusing c£200,000 of DfT’s Grant in the process, is tantamount to theft. &#xa0;&#xa0;Is it possible that County Transport Planners and Engineers are so diminished by cuts that there is inadequate management will and design skill? &#xa0;Little response has followed the consultation.  A ‘Cyclox’ member produced a better scheme, earlier on, only to be ignored. &#xa0;&#xa0;The design is an incompetent response to a problem, which is real enough. &#xa0;A County defence that an expensive and poorly located Toucan crossing ‘has to remain, or DfT would withdraw funding’, is spurious.  &#xa0;It is irresponsible to spend money just because its there, it belongs to us all. &#xa0;Perhaps the money should be given back to DfT/Treasury, or at least leave requested to produce an effective scheme.  In my understanding of the DfT assessor's comments, a rethink was called for anyway.  It is not too late to do something effective; it’s the will that is lacking.&#xa0;4.5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Whilst the concern here could be dismissed as parochial, the case will be repeated through the hundreds of schemes receiving such funding, why? :-4.5.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An officer is charged with developing a response to an accident problem but perhaps with little expectation of funding.  A Government fund appears. It is grasped even though the design is perhaps simplistic if worthy.  Essentially, rather than moving away from the ‘DMRB’ style roundabout on the periphery of an urban area - with people travelling by bike to nursery, school, college etc., a proposal to partly remove cyclists from the road has ensued.  However, cost engineering has removed the potential benefits and attractiveness of the design, which is now decimated.  An inappropriate single Toucan remains, adding cost and inducing delay.  Whilst I am sure this problem was, or became recognised within the Engineering Dept. of Oxfordshire County Council, there was no will to jetison the design and time already expended in order to reconsider the problem, which remains soluble.4.5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Even generous central support is squandered in this example.  ‘Localism’ has resulted in wastefulness.  4.5.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What is needed is some kind of ‘Roads Ombudsman’, to act as a design reviewer.  The CABE-Design Council system needs to be replicated for Highways design.&#xa0;5.1.&#xa0;&#xa0; The argument, even fear, expressed by many campaigners that such segregated provision is too difficult, costly or controversial is falsely based.  5.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; If one takes time to understand the development of facilities to be found in continental countries it can be seen that by adopting the concept of a safe, physically segregated (but on-line) provision, the attainment of the concept may be achieved in a number of ways, using normal processes.  Making cycling provisions that enable use by anyone is not rocket science.  Any highways engineer could do it, perhaps as demonstrated in Cologne where the City Engineer told a group I led: “the politicians wanted people to be able to use a bike, so this is what we have done …”.  5.1.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Compared with the massive funding used to effectively enthrall the population to the car, costs can be negligible.  5.2.&#xa0;&#xa0; Essentially one starts with the idea of direct, coherent, continuous provision and initially separated by (mandatory) lines, (with parking controls outside of these mandatory lines).  Physical segregation can then follow as road renewal takes place.  5.2.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The busiest roads are replaced in cities on approximately 10-20 year cycles. Within a generation or two, we could reach Denmark's situation now and approach the Netherlands' level of provision.  5.2.1.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The 30 year period of the now withdrawn ‘cul-de-sac and distributor road’ thinking from 1977 has been remarkably effective around the country, and thus the country’s main routes could be transformed in a similar timespan.  Only thinking is demanded.5.2.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Inevitably some special attention will need to applied to major junctions with their tonnes of concrete, but even these need repair, remodeling and rethinking over time.  The period required seems ‘long’ in prospect, but the renewal process is happening continuously, within the span of a few Parliaments the transformation could be complete.5.2.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Changing the new towns and 70s-onwards estates and their distributor road, if desired, is a big design task, some regeneration projects mostly involving turning houses around!  But for London and most of Britain, making cycling possible for all could be achieved for the proverbial peanuts. And if we started 'now', with the decision to make cycling provisions that were useable by all it could become a reality in reasonable time.  &#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;Short CVConsultant, 'Graham Paul Smith: Urban Design', Studied Fine Art and Urban Design, he is a commuting cyclist and a former amateur racing cyclist,&#xa0;EmploymentAssociate and formerly Principal/Senior Lecturer Department of Architecture, Oxford Brookes University: Post Graduate Diploma Architecture &amp; Joint Centre for Urban Design, 1970 to 2007.
