[[[Kenneth MacLean [FBB0019]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;This submission is comprised of my replies to and observations relating to questions set forth in the Committeeʼs press release of 22 October 2013.&#xa0;I write as a person who has listened to BBC radio since the 1940s and viewed BBC television since the 1950s.&#xa0;At the end of this document is a statistics section which presents statistics illustrative of the size of the BBC in the UK media world.

[[[What should the BBC be for and ]]]

[[[what should be the purpose of public]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[service broadcasting?]]]&#xa0;Perhaps the easiest way to approach the first limb of this question is to ask ʻWhat should the BBC not be for?ʼ.&#xa0;My high level answer to this reversed question is both simple and emphatic: the BBC should not exist to provide the type and quality of radio, TV and online content that is, or could be, provided by commercial media organisations.&#xa0;If the BBC does little or nothing of significance over and above mimicking private sector media organisations, then it has no reason to exist at all.&#xa0;And for the avoidance of doubt, the veracity of this observation is in no way lessened because the BBC happens to be a giant news and current affairs organisation. Clearly, a raison dʼêtre for the BBC cannot reside in its size alone.&#xa0;A further question thus arises, namely ʻDoes the BBC do anything of significance that could not readily be done by other media organisations?ʼ.&#xa0;I address this further question in my answer below to the Committeeʼs question concerning the scope, scale and remit of the BBC.

[[[How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[achieving its mission and public purposes?]]]&#xa0;Being but an ordinary viewer and listener, I was not familiar with the concept of the BBCʼs mission but the BBC website soon informed me that the BBC has a Mission ʻto enrich peopleʼs lives with programmes and services that inform, educate and entertainʼ.&#xa0;I am obliged to the BBC in seeking to enrich me because my annual TV tax together with that of a multitude of others certainly enriches many senior managers and celebrities at the BBC.&#xa0;Googling the term ʻpublic purposesʼ immediately located it for me as being in the BBC Charter. I was thus able to observe that the first Public Purpose of the BBC is ʻsustaining citizenship and civil societyʼ. I was left wondering if the citizen is to exclaim “Gosh, what a wondrous thing is the BBC” or whether he is to think to himself “Crikey, a bit Orwellian that!”.&#xa0;My seeking enlightenment in this vein also yielded an insight into the ways in which the BBC Trust attempts to impart to the management the strategy that the Trust has formulated and the tools that have been constructed for attempting to monitor the performance of the management. In this context I observed that there exist inter alia Strategic Objectives whereby, for example, the Trust ʻchallengesʼ the BBC to increase the distinctiveness and quality of output, Service Licences, Protocols, Public Purposes and Purpose Remits, Annual Tracking Surveys, Statements of Programme Policy and Summary Workplans.&#xa0;I conclude that the objectives given to the BBC by the Charter (plus Framework Agreement) are largely of a high-flown flannel nature and that the machinery for setting the direction of the BBC and for assessing performance is so hideously bureaucratic and so formulaic when put into practice that meaningful results are hardly to be expected.&#xa0;For these reasons I am unable to provide a direct answer to the subject question. I would, however, like to attempt to provide some relevant observations to the Committee, and these now follow.&#xa0;I suggest that it is very useful in examining the BBCʼs performance to adopt a long timescale and to concentrate on television services.&#xa0;Up until the mid-1950s the BBC had a monopoly in TV and I distinctly remember, although I was a teenager, my apprehension when it was announced that commercial TV was to be introduced. I was worried that commercial TV would affect deleteriously the standards of BBC TV. &#xa0;I cannot pretend to remember the exact chronology, but the upshot over a certain timescale was as feared. The BBC did not stand firm on quality standards, but gave in to the temptation of attempting to maintain ratings as against what it perceived to be rival services.&#xa0;The psychology of the BBCʼs reaction to the inception of commercial TV could not be more simple. The BBC bigwigs apprehended that the punters who paid the bigwigsʼ salaries and underpinned the bigwigsʼ careers would begin to complain if they had to pay compulsorily a licence fee for programmes the viewership figures of which fell below those of the commercial services.&#xa0;The adoption of the ratings chasing policy was thus driven by a desire for self-preservation. In the demotic the policy goes, of course, by the name of ʻratings warʼ. The BBC became adept at fighting the ratings war and it has maintained to the present day its view that being active in that war is vital to the BBCʼs continued existence.&#xa0;This plain and simple fact about the BBC is publicly admitted by very few of our parliamentarians. Indeed, the flow over the years of MPs and peers who get upon their feet to proclaim that the BBC provides the ʻgold standardʼ of broadcasting quality has never ceased.&#xa0;Is it a prerequisite of being a politician that one can selectively fail to see elephants in the room? Whatever the answer to that question, the fact is that whilst operating ostensibly under strict requirements as to the maintenance of high standards, the BBC has in fact been permitted for sixty years, and by all parties, to consistently produce a general output at that low level which is dictated by ratings considerations.&#xa0;This means that scandalously the public have been, and still are being, charged, on a compulsory basis, for a sub-standard product.&#xa0;

[[[What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?]]]&#xa0;As I intimated in my answer to the first question, the BBC should be given scope, scale and remit only if it can provide output which is significantly different from that which is deliverable by other organisations, including commercial companies. A requirement additional to difference is, of course, public value.&#xa0;As I explained with reference to the second question, albeit that the BBC operates under a cloak of ultra-respectable Public Purposes etc., it has in fact over a very long period chosen to maintain a dumbed down output as its continuous response to the output of what it sees as its rivals.&#xa0;Here then we have a problematic situation. In choosing to dumb down its output to bolster its programme ratings the BBC has ipso facto brought itself down to the level of its rivals. And in doing this, it has extinguished any justification for claiming to be significantly different from its rivals.&#xa0;At this juncture perhaps I hear members of the Committee saying “But what about the BBCʼs output of news and current affairs?”. “Surely everyone acknowledges the BBCʼs pre-eminence in that sphere”.&#xa0;Well, let us consider a comparison of the quality of a commercial TV news service, Sky News, and a prominent BBC TV news service, BBC News 24.&#xa0;It cannot be seriously said that one of these services is significantly superior or significantly inferior to the other. Individuals may, of course, favour one over the other because of personal preference or merely through habit.&#xa0;Here it is pertinent to note from the statistical section (pp. 14 &amp; 15) that when it comes to users of the most used TV news sources, most rate them reasonably highly in respect of accuracy, trustworthiness and impartiality. And, as the table on page 15 shows, the news services of ITV and Sky are rated very much on a par with those of the BBC.&#xa0;The broadcast media have from their inception been seen as potent in their potential for upholding the democratic values of this country but representing equally potently a threat to democracy should they to come under undesirable control. At the nub of these considerations is the broadcasting of news.&#xa0;Politicians, in providing for an appropriate framework for the operation of the broadcast media, have thus put special effort into attempting to ensure that all radio and TV organisations which broadcast news items do so in a fair, accurate, impartial etc. manner. Indeed, it may be said that the provision of news according to these criteria lies at the very heart of the concept of public service broadcasting, whether one has in mind the BBC or the public service obligations of the other broadcasters.&#xa0;Thus if it is the case that the public see BBC news provision as on a level with the news provision of other providers, that is, if it does not see the BBCʼs news provision as being distinctly more accurate, trustworthy and impartial, then the BBC has failed the Acid Test of Differentiation.&#xa0;If there was any question of the TV news output of non-BBC organisations being significantly inferior to that of the BBC as judged on the crucial criteria aforementioned, this would be a matter of loud, prolonged and general debate, not least, of course, on programmes such as Question Time. No such debate exists.&#xa0;Now as I have already pointed out, in choosing to engage in the ratings war the BBC has had to generally dumb down its output to the level of its rivals. As to whether this general dumbing down includes the BBCʼs news and related programmes can be left for debate, because as has been established the BBC fails the news-specific Acid Test of Differentiation.&#xa0;The logic thus is that the BBC does not warrant scope, scale or remit because its continued existence cannot be justified on PSB grounds.&#xa0;That is not to say that the continued existence of the BBC at a drastically reduced scale (size) might not be justified. On this basis I will now make some remarks on the present size and scope of activities of the BBC and as to what might be an appropriate size/scope in the future.&#xa0;In my consideration of the size/scope of the present BBC I have in mind the BBC as a provider of radio, TV and online services.&#xa0;My contention is that the BBC is far too big. In my view the BBC has been permitted to grow to such an extent that it now constitutes a danger to vital elements of the UK media industry including commercial radio and TV, national and local, and to local and national newspapers. The BBC is a grave impediment to the establishment of a healthily diverse media scene in the UK.&#xa0;I will not dwell on the deleterious effects that BBC TV and radio are having on the general media because I am certain that others far more authoritative than I will make submissions to the Committee. All that I will do is to underline the fact that it is only in a healthily diverse media scene that the public are exposed to a range of different opinions, views and information from a variety of sources.&#xa0;The dominance of the BBC over the three major platforms (TV, radio and online) is amply testified to by facts presented in the statistics section, but it might be helpful here to highlight some specific facts about the BBCʼs news dominance which are revealed in the said section.&#xa0;According to one survey, 78% of those who follow the news use TV therefor, with 40% using newspapers, 35% radio and 32% the internet. See p. 11.&#xa0;According to another survey, using slightly different methodology, the figures are: TV 85%, radio and newspapers 53% each and internet 41%. See p. 12.&#xa0;The BBCʼs cross-platform audience reach for news at the retail level is 86%, the second and third places being taken by ITV (40%) and Sky (28%). See p. 13.&#xa0;[Clearly all three platforms, but especially TV, are important for news and thus dominance over three platforms, including TV, must be very concerning.]&#xa0;75% of all TV news viewers use BBC One as a news source, the second most used being ITV (42%). Also, of the top six TV news services, three are BBC. See p. 15.&#xa0;The BBCʼs share of news by channel group increased between 2002 and 2011 from 59% to 74%. See p. 14.&#xa0;In respect of the BBC radio presence, the BBC UK-wide radio stations include the top three radio stations (Radio 4, Radio 2 and Radio 1) used for news. Moreover, out of the top fifteen stations, nine are BBC and in aggregate BBC UK-wide radio stations account for two-thirds of those who use radio for news. See p. 15.&#xa0;As to the BBC presence online, of the 41% of UK adults who use the internet for news, 57% use the BBC website or a BBC app, with Facebook and Google taking 19% share each. Sky takes 17%. See p. 15.&#xa0;In December 2011 there were nine online news brands reaching over 2 m people per month. Of these the BBC had the highest reach with 11 m Second and third came DMGT (6.6 m) and Yahoo (4.1 m). BSkyB came in with 1.3 m. See p. 15.&#xa0;There can be no doubt that the BBC is a giant organisation per se. This can be ready appreciated by merely examining the list of UK Public Services given in the June 2006 Framework Agreement. And as amply demonstrated by the statistics section, the BBC is a true monster in the news arena. It is thus not surprising that according to a recent DCMS consultation document on media plurality, the 2011 news and current affairs spend of the BBC was more than that of the remaining UK television and radio news broadcasters combined.&#xa0;Added to the picture of overwhelming dominance in news provision is the startling fact that the BBC possess this dominant position not only in broadcasting but within and across the three major news platforms of radio, TV and online.&#xa0;Furthermore it is most important to have cognisance of the fact that owing to the synergistic interaction between the platforms of the multi-platform BBC, the BBC has a power more than congruent with the sum of its parts.&#xa0;All this very disturbing because what it means is that not only does the BBC fail to be differentiated from other media organisations when it comes to TV broadcasting, news or general, but in the news function it is a giant which holds an overwhelmingly dominant position across radio, TV and online.&#xa0;Thus all that does differentiate the BBC are the features of 1. giant size, 2. The absence of advertisements (at least commercial ones) and 3. the imposition of the TV tax.&#xa0;In the present context, as well as embracing the concept of size, the word ʼscopeʼ connotes ʻrange of activitiesʼ and this raises a very serious and concerning aspect of the BBC in its present form.&#xa0;In the BBC Charter one of the BBCʼs Public Purposes is ʻhelping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologiesʼ. In non-spin language what this means is that the BBC is licensed to spend TV tax payersʼ money to extend its activities from radio and TV to online. This is reflected in the 2006 Framework Agreement as ʻa comprehensive online content service, with content serving the whole range of the BBCʼs Public Purposesʼ, meaning that the extension to online is to be a wholesale one.&#xa0;As above shown the BBC has taken full advantage of this carte blanche and it has spent highly - at an annual rate of £177m (2012/13 BBC Financial Statements) – in establishing its commanding presence for news online, although as noted in the statistics section (pp. 15 &amp; 16) users of news websites rated Sky as fully equivalent to the BBC for accuracy &amp; reliability, trustworthiness and impartiality &amp; lack of bias.&#xa0;What then is so very serious and concerning about the BBCʼs so establishing itself in the new communications medium of online? An indication was given very recently by the Home Secretary in a speech she gave to a gathering of the Society of Editors. In her speech Mrs May made the following observations.&#xa0;“Local newspapers are having a particularly hard time. That has been partly the result of the BBCʼs dominant position on the internet, and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee. This makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local reader to buy a paper?&#xa0;It is destroying local newspapers and it could eventually happen to national newspapers as well.&#xa0;This is dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism.”&#xa0;“This is a debate that wonʼt go away and I believe that the BBC has to think carefully about its presence locally and the impact that has on local democracy.”&#xa0;No doubt Mrs May, as a senior cabinet minister, was being somewhat circumspect with her comments on the BBCʼs online services, but she certainly identified a grave threat to the print media, both local and national. &#xa0;In the years running up to the commencement of the present Charter it may have appeared simply logical to permit the TV tax funded BBC to extent itself onto the new online platform. But with the advantage of hindsight we can see that what the politicians did in giving the thumbs-up was rather like that done, with equal facility, by the Sorcererʼs Apprentice.&#xa0;Whereas news services of the broadcast media are regulated as to impartiality, the newspapers are left to grind whatever political or other axe their proprietors fancy. Thus from a political point of view we have on the left the Daily Mirror, the Financial Times, the Guardian and the Independent, on the right the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and with a flexible approach (over time) to position on the political spectrum the Sun and the Times.&#xa0;The freedom of the press to choose attitudes to news items and issues provides the public with an opportunity to be made aware of a wide range of arguments and opinions and is at the very heart of our democracy in the UK.Therefore any news media entity which poses an existential threat to the newspaper industry, whether in respect of printed newspapers or online services, must be examined by Parliament with the upmost seriousness and urgency, this being all the more the case when the entity in question is a public sector entity and thus one which is within the direct sphere of influence of Parliament.&#xa0;In looking to the future, I am not at all sure what would be an appropriate remit for the BBC. As I have indicated above, in the present era there would appear to no more justification for a nationalised broadcaster and online operator than there is for a public sector newspaper.&#xa0;I do not, of course, expect to see the BBC disappear suddenly, but it is important to the future of democracy in our country that as soon as possible it is drastically decreased both in scope and scale.&#xa0;In its present form the BBC is stifling media diversity and threatening the continued existence of our newspapers. This means that the BBC constitutes a threat to our democracy.&#xa0;A much reduced BBC, or a successor organisation, could have one of a number of profiles, but as an indicator I would suggest that the following would be appropriate.&#xa0;

[[[TV ]]]

[[[ ]]]One general channel approximating to an amalgam of present BBC One and BBC Four, plus BBC Parliament Channel. No regional/local TV services.&#xa0;

[[[Radio ]]]

[[[ ]]]Two national channels, approximating respectively to present channels 4 and 3. No local stations.&#xa0;

[[[Online ]]]

[[[ ]]]Excepting for content strictly connected with BBC services, such as programme listings, BBC Online should be cut away from the BBC to form a separate entity funded by subscription. An alternative would be a separation of BBC News, including online news, from the remainder of the BBC, again funded by subscription.&#xa0;My indications of a future BBC or successor will to some appear over-drastic, but such is the state of the present BBC that in the interests of a healthy democracy it is in dire need of brutal surgery.&#xa0;Returning to the question of remit, in the light of my observations all I can advise is that any new Public Purposes or the like are couched in terms less Orwellian and less high-flown than is the case in the present Charter. I would also put in a plea that the Big Brother/social engineering tenor of the PSB purposes and characteristics set out by Ofcom in its PSB Annual Report 2013 (Fig. 1) is firmly eschewed.&#xa0;

[[[What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new ways of]]]

[[[ ]]]

[[[distributing content?]]]&#xa0;The development of technology relating to TV, radio or online and novel modes of distributing content/information/data is the province of the likes of Google, Apple and Samsung, and not that of a UK public sector broadcasting organisation.&#xa0;

[[[How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?]]]&#xa0;The TV tax is very unpopular, especially in view of the multitude of sources of information and entertainment now available to the public on TV (and elsewhere).&#xa0;In my view the idea of imposing a compulsory tax on the UK public in respect of one out of a multitude of media outlets is a totally unjustified anachronism. Much would be the rejoicing among the populace upon the lifting of this unfair imposition.&#xa0;Looking at the matter from a different angle, if the BBCʼs current output truly represents the gold standard of quality in broadcasting as some parliamentarians regularly claim, why should not the BBC be funded, and funded only, by the voluntary subscriptions of members of the public.&#xa0;As set forth above, it is clear that the BBCʼs online services in respect of news are threatening the continued existence of national and local newspapers. This supplies another and vital reason as to why, if the BBC is to be permitted to continue to put out news and current affairs online, the BBC should be funded on a subscription basis.&#xa0;We have had ample evidence of late as to the BBCʼs talent for wasting TV tax payersʼ money as well as to other management shortcomings. Thus an advantage of funding the BBC on a subscription basis is that the BBC would, for the first time, have to earn its income. This would tighten up management.&#xa0;

[[[How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held a]]]

[[[ccountable?]]]&#xa0;It is surely clear that the replacement of BBC governors by the BBC Trust has been a true failure. One cannot be surprise at this since any objective person would perceive immediately that the concept of a body a part of the BBC being responsible for overseeing the BBC and at the same time representing the TV tax payer was doomed to failure.&#xa0;Thus the BBC, whether it is to exist in the near future in its giant, overbearing, competition suppressing , democracy threatening form or not, must be regulated by a body outside the BBC. Whether that body is Ofcom in its present or a modified form is a moot point, but future regulation must be external of the BBC.&#xa0;

[[[UK Media Statistics]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;This statistics section presents statistics illustrative of the present shape of the UK media and more especially of the extent of the BBCʼs operations and of the size of its presence in the UK media world.&#xa0;Emphasis is placed on the provision of news services. The reason for this is simply that the availability of a plurality of news sources is essential to the healthy working of a democracy. In this context “plurality” connotes many rather than few news services and, just as importantly, the avoidance of any one media organisation having too much influence over public opinion and over the political process.&#xa0;Seeking to ensure the existence of many and diverse news sources and the absence of too much media power in one or a few hands is the only way of promoting range and diversity of information and opinion.&#xa0;The statistics have been derived predominantly from Ofcom documents or from report documents commissioned by Ofcom. Abbreviations used in the text to refer to such documents are as follows.&#xa0;“A4” to “A6” -              Annexes, so respectively referenced, to Measuring media plurality, Ofcomʼs advice to DMCS, published 19 June 2012&#xa0;“CMR13” -               Communications Market Report 2013, Ofcom Research Document, published 1 August 2013&#xa0;

[[[Media Generally]]]&#xa0;91% of UK adults say they follow the news. 78% use TV for news, 40% use print newspapers, 35% use radio and 32% use the internet (CMR13 1.9.3 &amp; Fig. 1.93).&#xa0;When respondents were asked to what extent they used each platform for types of news, i.e. serious news items, breaking news, headlines &amp; summaries, opinions &amp; debates and in-depth analysis, TV dominated in each of the 5 categories, only losing its dominance when it came to light hearted stories and rumour &amp; gossip (A4 Fig. 2).&#xa0;By way of example, A4 Fig. 2 shows that for serious news 81% said they used TV, whereas the scores for newspapers, radio and the internet were 42%, 38% &amp; 44% respectively.&#xa0;Using somewhat different methodology, Kantar Media reported (A5) that 95% of UK adults claim to follow the news via at least one of the four major platforms and that TV has the highest reach at 85%, followed by radio and newspapers with 53% each and internet with 41%. Internet news usage is on a growing trend (A4 4.8).&#xa0;When consumers were asked to rate the importance of platforms to them and the ratings were plotted against percentage usage for news, TV was rated highest in importance at 88%, with radio and newspapers both at 55% and internet on computer at 37% (A5 Chart 3.1.1b).&#xa0;In 1970 73% of UK adults used newspapers as a source of news. In 2012 it was 53% (A4 4.7).&#xa0;41% of UK adults use internet for news (A4 4.8).

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[BBC Services]]]&#xa0;BBC operates across TV, radio and the internet.&#xa0;According to the BBC itself (This is the BBC News, R. Sambrook, 13.09.06) BBC News is the largest news operation in the world.&#xa0;BBC TV services -&#xa0;BBC1BBC2BBC3BBC4BBC News (24hr)BBC ParliamentCBBCcBeebiesBBC AlbaBBC World News&#xa0;BBC1 provides national news services in Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland andregional news services in 15 English regions.&#xa0;BBC radio services -&#xa0;National (not separating analogue/digital)Radio 1Radio 2Radio 3Radio 4Radio 5Radio 6Asian Network&#xa0;In addition to these seven national radio services, the BBC provides the World Service (also receivable in UK), eight radio services for the devolved nations (including broadcasts in Scottish Gaelic and Welsh) and forty local radio stations.&#xa0;BBC online services -&#xa0;BBC Online comprises the BBCʼs websites, including BBC News, current affairs, science, technology, history, religion etc. It also provides, via BBC iPlayer, access to prior broadcast BBC TV and radio programmes.&#xa0;BBC Online is 49th of the top 500 sites on the web worldwide (Alexa).&#xa0;BBC news services across platforms &#xa0;BBCʼs cross-platform audience reach for news at the retail level is 86%, the second and third places being taken by ITV (40%) and Sky (28%) (A4 Fig. 12 - reproduced as Fig. 2 in the Consultation Document).&#xa0;BBC One (TV) is the most popular news source of news sources across all platforms, with 57% of people using it. It is followed by ITV with 33%. The top newspapers for news are the Sun (10%) and the Daily Mail (8%). The two most popular radio stations for news are BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4 (8% each). (CMR13, p. 107 &amp; Fig. 1.94)&#xa0;Of the top ten news services six are BBC, including those placed first, third and fourth (Fig. 1.94). Of the top twenty news services featured in Fig. 1.94 eight are BBC, these being 4 TV stations, 3 radio stations and the BBC website.&#xa0;When news users were ask to name their most important single news source, 34% said BBC One (CMR13, Fig 1.103). ITV was second with 13%. The top newspaper according to this criterion was The Sun (1%). Of the eleven ʻmost importantʼ sources named in Fig. 1.103 six are BBC sources.&#xa0;BBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in TV News&#xa0;75% of all TV news viewers use BBC One as a news source, the second most used such source for these viewers being ITV (42%) (A4 Fig. 6).&#xa0;Fig 6 also shows that of the top six TV news services, three are BBC.&#xa0;According to A4 4.83, the total amount of time that adults spend watching the news on TV increased gradually between 2007 and 2011, standing at 21 minutes per day in 2011, this being predominantly driven by an increase in time spent viewing the BBC.&#xa0;According to A4 4.84 and Fig. 18, the BBCʼs share of TV viewing of news by channel group increased between 2002 and 2011 from 59% to 74%, whereas that of ITV decreased from 29% to 14%. In 2011 the figures for Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky were 3%, 2% &amp; 8% respectively.&#xa0;Reference to CMR13 Fig. 1.95 shows that in 2012 BBC 1 and 2 plus BBC News accounted for 75% of TV news viewing, with “BBC other” accounting for another 13%.&#xa0;A4 4.86 and Fig. 19 indicate that in 2011 news programmes on BBC One reached 65% of the adult population in an average week.&#xa0;When it comes to users of the most used TV news sources, most rate themreasonably highly in respect of accuracy, trustworthiness and impartiality.&#xa0;              BBC               ITV               Sky               Ch. 4               Al Jazeera&#xa0;Accuracy &amp; Reliability               67%               61%               68%               62%               56%&#xa0;Trustworthiness               63%               60%               65%               59%               61%&#xa0;Impartiality &amp; Lack of Bias               51%               52%               60%               52%               57%&#xa0;Source: CMR13 Fig. 1.104&#xa0;&#xa0;Clearly, whereas BBC is dominant in TV news viewing, it is only average when judged by TV news viewers in respect of these fundamental criteria of news reportage.&#xa0;BBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in Radio News&#xa0;BBC UK-wide radio stations include the top three radio stations used nowadays for news, these being Radio 4 (26%), Radio 2 (25%) and Radio 1 (19%) (A5 pp. 32-33 and Chart 3.4.4).&#xa0;It may be observed of Chart 3.4.4 that 9 of the 15 featured radio stations are BBC stations and that in aggregate BBC UK-wide stations account for two-thirds of those who use radio for news.&#xa0;BBCʼs (Comparative) Presence in Online News&#xa0;Of the 41% of UK adults who say they use the internet for news, the main source used is the BBC website or a BBC app (57%) (A4 4.39 and Fig. 10). Tying for second place are Facebook and Google (19% each), with Sky News website or app coming third (17%).&#xa0;According to UKOM/Nielsen in December 2011 there were then nine online news brands reaching over 2 million people each month and of these the BBC had the highest reach, with 11 million people. DMGT and Yahoo were next, with 6.6 and 4.1 million respectively (A4 4.99 and Fig. 26). BSkyB came in with 1.3 million.&#xa0;Even when looking at the BBCʼs presence online in general terms, i.e. not restricted to news, it is number five top site in the UK, first and second being google.co.uk and google.com, followed by facebook.com and youtube.com (Alexa)&#xa0;Users of news websites rated the broadcasters BBC and Sky fairly evenly across attributes.&#xa0;BBC                             Sky&#xa0;Accuracy &amp; Reliability                             69%                             70%&#xa0;Trustworthiness                                           68%                             69%&#xa0;Impartiality &amp; Lack of Bias               63%                             65%&#xa0;Source: CMR13 Fig. 1.107&#xa0;&#xa0;*********************&#xa0;&#xa0;The above statistics demonstrate that the BBC is a giant media entity in television, radio and online and that it is a dominant presence on each of these platforms. Furthermore it must not be forgotten that in the present day the dominance in these major three platforms has an interactive effect such as to 

[[[supercharg]]]e the overall impact of the BBC.&#xa0;It is also important to note that for all of its claims to special status (stemming from a Royal Charter, Editorial Guidelines, etc. etc.), in the all-important TV and online platforms the BBC is not awarded by the British public with a unique and lofty status for impartiality or trustworthiness.&#xa0;-----------------------
