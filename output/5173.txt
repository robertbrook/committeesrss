[[[mission to the Select committee]]]

[[[Name withheld]]]&#xa0;I wish to address the select committee on the above subject please. I am a keeper of primates in fact I have 12 in total. I have been a keeper for some years now and my collection is private although I do invite the local schools to visit at certain times of the year for educational purposes. As a private keeper they can learn much more from me and have closer interaction then they would have at a zoo or sanctuary. I keep my primates in large enclosures much the same if not better than the sanctuaries or zoos and follow a notorious and correct feeding plan. My monkeys are cared for in every way and I hold all the correct licences with the relevant authorities as well. I have a very helpful and supportive vet too.&#xa0;I believe that anyone who wishes to keep these animals should be licensed as this would control and protect the welfare of these animals and ensure they are kept in the correct manor and by people who understand exactly what is required and the amount of time and responsibly that is needed to be a successful keeper. &#xa0;If a “Ban” was brought in I feel that it should apply to all not just people like me i.e. the “so called” sanctuary’s that claim they are protecting these animals yet making a living from it. And in much the same case zoos as well.&#xa0;There are rules and regulations in place already i.e. DWA licence which addresses all protective measures for the animals but those who are expected to implement it really do not understand it which is very unhelpful to anyone wishing to apply for one. Having had firsthand experience this is something that really needs addressing.&#xa0;As a private keeper I have studied what goes on around these large organisations that call themselves sanctuaries or primate rescues and there are two very different types. The first is someone who comes to the assistance of a keeper who faces difficulties in continuing to keep their primates for one reason or another. The sanctuary would offer a perminante home in much the same environment as where the primate may have been kept. IE not on public view and one to one contact.&#xa0;The other is a commercial business that would take primates in and place them on public view to make money which is so so so wrong. These animals deserve better. And if the committee is being guided this way these sanctuaries’s and rescue centres should be stopped from brining in primates from other countries. E.g. why would anyone wish to “rescue” a primate from their country of origin and bring it here? The UK could not be further from the climate and environment that it would be used too. Perhaps the committee would request the registers kept by these organisations as part of their licence and Bali rules??? This will identify the true picture of just how may primates they “rescue” from inside the UK. I think it will be much lower than the committee is being lead to believe.&#xa0;If a “Blanket” licence is introduced it will give people the freedom to keep a primate under the correct conditions and under the watchful eye of the relevant authorities and welfare act thus insuring that they are cared for correctly.&#xa0;January 2014 &#xa0;
