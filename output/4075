[normal]I have had many years’ experience in the electrical contracting industry, both as an electrician and a manager, and working for both small domestic and commercial contractors through to large industrial contractors. 
[normal]I have also worked in standards and regu
[normal]lations and sit on professional committees for my professional institutions.

[normal]Whilst the larger contractors end of the industry is self- policing the operation and ability of the industry at the smaller end leaves something to be desired. The industry c
[normal]ontinues to get more complex with
[normal] more commercial pressures,
[normal] increasing electrical equipment and systems available on the market for installation, (eg IT systems, alarm systems, complex lighting controls, more appliances demanding a larger socket-outlet pr
[normal]ovision, etc), and more complex buildings with new building materials, an so the needs 
[normal]and abilities of contractors must rise too. In my experience this has not always happened and so the provision of an independent assessment and certifying authority
[normal] is a
[normal] necessity.

[normal]To look at the committees specific points more closely I have always been concerned that the public are not as aware of the competent 
[normal]person’s
[normal] schemes as they should be, and
[normal] the dangers of electricity. 
[normal]I feel that this stems from the genera
[normal]l lack of knowledge of the general public of the dangers of electricity and the need for electrical safety – correctly installed installations carried out in accordance with the wiring regulations 
[normal]are safe and so the public have perhaps become unaware of t
[normal]hem and just accept their functioning as a matter of course. To reach this level of safety requires safe materials and adequate training
[normal] and experience
[normal] in the design and installation
[normal] of electrical systems. The only difference the public usually see is cost
[normal], and their lack of overall understanding may lead them to believe that they can save money by doing it themselves, or getting a friend to do it, with materials purchased from the local DIY warehouse or store, without any other risks.

[normal]Training is expen
[normal]sive and needs to be properly identified to be applicable to the needs of the works. This identification is not always possible for small contractors, and they also do not have the “manpower” or capital to allow persons to be away from the job and not earn
[normal]ing. However adequate training is essential and competent 
[normal]person’s
[normal] schemes identify operatives training requirements as a part of their 
[normal]competence assessments.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The electrical requirements of the Building Regulations are generally met by working to the requirements of the wiring regulations supplemented by the requirements of recognised specialist trade bodies (for alarms and controls etc). Without the work review
[normal] of competent person scheme bodies there is no independent inspection of works or testing to ensure its 
[normal]compliance
[normal], and no pressure on installers to complete the necessary documentation and ensure that the work is properly registered as may be required
[normal]. Un
[normal]fortunately this review comes at a cost to the installer, and so ultimately to the customer, and there needs to be a proper balance between the need for and the cost of inspections to ensure that the work is properly done
[normal] – too much and the cost and time n
[normal]ecessary become over burdensome and too little and
[normal] the whole registration and 
[normal]inspection system becomes meaningless.
[normal] Although the DLG accredited schemes have been in operation now for several years this balance is still in debate and I’m not able to offer 
[normal]any view on the adequacy of inspections both in terms of frequency and detail.

[normal]There will 
[normal]always be competition between contractors, and commercial and technical completion is healthy as it helps to keep prices down, but it must come from a level playi
[normal]ng field so far as the costs of competent person’s schemes apply, and these must give value for money, both in inspection and management of documents, as well as the provision of advice and help in training provisions for their members.

[normal]Finally I would
[normal] make some specific comments:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I fully support the ideas behind “Part P” and the role of the competent person’s schemes, but these must be clearly explained to the “man-in-the-street” as in general I find that most of the public are not aware of the schemes
[normal] and the safety that such a register
[normal] of recognised competent electrical contractors provide
[normal]s. This will take a long time and be a continual process, but it must be done.
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There needs to be a clear provision in the legislation to easily allow individuals who
[normal] are electrically competent, but not members of such schemes, to undertake their own private electrical work.  This has been discussed many times and I believe that it may be a part of new legislation, but it needs to be clear.
