[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]To retain women graduates and PhD students in academic careers, 
[normal]universities and the higher education sector 
[normal]could
[normal] consider one or more of the following
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]a.
[normal]              
[normal]Provide more effective appraisal and mentoring
[normal],
[normal] and associated training for both employees and their line managers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]b.

[normal]Are there examples of good practice?

[normal].
[normal]              
[normal]Many Universities, including Cambridge, and their constituent Departments
[normal],
[normal] are Athena SWAN charter members. The Athena SWAN award system 
[normal]recognizes good practice relating both to Gender Equality, and to creating a culture that is more likely to retain
[normal] talented individuals, especially women.

[normal]What can the Government do?

[normal]W
[normal]e believe that Government can play a
[normal] role in encouraging the retention of
[normal] women in academic STEM careers, which can be both financial
[normal] 
[normal]and practical, in the following areas:
