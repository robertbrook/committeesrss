"FBA0018/13-14\nDeloitte—Written evidenceWe welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to the Finance Bill Sub-Committee’s enquiry into the draft Finance Bill 2014, and set out below our key comments under the various headings. \nTaxation of partnerships1.1.\n&#xa0; \nDeloitte advises a significant \nnumber of professional partnerships and in particular many of the world’s leading law firms. The majority of such firms are now constituted as LLPs, following the introduction of the Limited Liability Partnership Act in 2000, which encouraged this as a bus\niness structure for these and other businesses formerly operating as General Partnerships. \nWe have \nactively engaged with\n the consultation process, having responded to the Consultation Document and had various meetings with the \nHMRC\n team responsible. \n2.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe main policy objectives of the changes proposed in the Finance Bill 2014 \nhave expanded since the initial consultation and now are\n:\nWhilst we support these objec\ntives, \nin our view \nthe legislation that has been proposed does not meet them\n. Furthermore, o\nur main concern is that \nthe disguised remuneration proposals\n go far beyond the stated objective of tacking those seeking to manipulate the tax rules and, instead, a\nlter the tax treatment of partnership in the UK.  As such\n v\nirtually all professional practices in the UK\n are affected by these proposals.  It is \ndoubtful\n that this was ever the intention or the policy objective\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe di\nfference\n in tax treatment b\netween LLPs a\nnd general\n partnerships (GPs) arises from\n the specific tax legislation which was introduced when LLPs became available in 2000.  \nThat legislation states\n that (providing the LLP is carrying on a trade, profession or vocation with a view to profit) \n“all the activities of the LLP are treated as carried on in partnership by its members”.  \nThis \nis interpreted by HMRC to mean\n that all the members are to be trea\nted as self-employed, \nirrespective of the commercial substance of their status and \nwhether or not they would have been so under the \nwell-established rules applying to\n partners in GPs. \n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nIn our view\n the need for the\nse\n proposals in Finance Bill 2014 are as a \nresult of the\n \nill-considered legislation introduced in 2000.  If the rules relating to GPs had been directly applied to LLPs \nat this time, \nthe playing field \nbetween the two types of business structure \nwould always have been level\n and the door would never h\nave been opened to those who might be tempted to use the rule solely to reduce tax\n. \n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nIf the policy objective is to level the playing field between UK LLPs and other partnerships (such as GPs and US LLPs) then the simplest solution would be to amend the ori\nginal deficient legislation to remove the presumption that members are to be taxed as partners.  This would allow the law to revert back to the previous position namely that an individual’s status as partner or employee should be assessed by reference to t\nhe \ncase law \ntests. \n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, it seems that HMRC, rather tha\nn \napply\n similar rules across both LLPs and GPs\n,\n is now introducing complex rules to counter perceived avoidance in this area\n.\n \nAt the heart of the problem is a failure to appreciate that the difference between a partner and an employee cannot be defined \nby a\n formula.  Rather, it is a question of the qualitative balance of factors\n,\n which is why the UK case law which has evolved ove\nr the centuries constructs the test in this manner.  \nThe challenge with a formula is that it is likely to mean many partnerships not engaged in avoidance need to alter some of their terms of partnership and additionally that those intent on manipulation wi\nll simply have bright lines to satisfy.  Further, the approach chosen is different to the qualitative factors which apply to partners in GPs and overseas LLPs, thus continuing the perceived distortions.\n3.5.\n&#xa0; \nU\nnder the new proposals, a member will be treated as \nemployed if all of the following characteristics are met:\n3.8\n              \nMany professional partnerships will find that their members fall within these rules despite the fact that there\n was no tax avoidance motive in their appointment as members. \n3.9\n              \nThe new proposals will mean that, irrespective of the motive in making individuals LLP members rather than employees, all LLPs will need to consider their internal structure and assess \nwhether the new proposals will apply to them.\n  For many it means, in practice, adjusting either their partner remuneration and appraisal systems or their capital structures before 6 April 2014 so as to fit within these new defined parameters.  \nWe believe t\nhat many partnerships may wish to increase capital to meet the 25% parameter mentioned above.  \n3.11\n              \nPerhaps\n the Sub-Committee will be seeking the vi\news of the banks on this change – as most partnerships arrange borrowings for partners to finance capital c\nontributions to partnerships.  Although it is common for borrowing to be arranged centrally, the debt remains \npersonal\n debt of the individual partners and not a partnership liability.\n  Our understanding from informal discussions is that, while \nbanks\n will a\nim to be as helpful as possible to businesses, the shift required from lending to the firm towards lending to individual partners (so as to increase their capital exposure within\n \ntheir firms) is not necessarily welcome given the higher amounts of regulatory capital required to support lending to individuals than lending to business.  We anticipate that many partners of smaller firms will struggle to \nraise\n the required lending withi\nn this timetable. \n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe consultation was first announced in Budget 2013 with the new rules proposed to take effect from 6 April 2014.  This was an ambitious time scale\n.\n \nThe consultation team were very active in\n meeting \nboth \nindustry specialists and \nthose potentially affected.  \nHowever, the process may have been easier if industry specialists had been more closely involved from the start, or even included in the team. Numerous specialists are available within HMR\nC who could have assisted in this regard.\n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe consultation process which took place in the summer sought responses on the basis of a much less far-reaching set of proposals than those ultimately then published on 10 December.  Had businesses known the true\n parameters many more would have responded and those that did respond would have responded differently.\n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nWe query whether a full impact assessment has been undertaken given the late change from proposals designed to address tax-avoidance to proposals with m\nore fundamental impact across the professions.  Careful impact assessment is important because the cash flow impact of these changes on small to medium-sized professional practices could ca\nus\ne the \nfinancial difficulties for\n some businesses coming as it doe\ns at a time of hardship for many, and without adequate time to arrange alternative sources of funding. \n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe proposals released on 10 December 2013 \nto apply from 6 April 2014 \nwere radically different from the original proposals\n. This l\neaves \na very short time for \nthe many LLPs who are affected by the new proposals \n(\ndespite operating entirely legitimately\n)\n, to re-\norganise their affairs within \npermissible\n parameters, as outlined \nin 3.\n5\n \nabove.\n Such a re-organisation is a time-intensive leadership chore with a very tight timeframe given the necessary partner consultation periods and discussions with firm’s bankers\n.\n \nSome partnerships will need to amend their partnership documents, which certainly\n requires consultation within the partnership and is not a simple or quick process. \n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nTh\ne task\n is particularly difficult as there are still a number of uncertainties around the new rules, \nand their intended application \nto\n many common partnership scenarios i\ns not yet clear, \ndespite the \nguidance issued in December. \nFurther guidance is expected to be published in February which may assist in dealing with these uncertainties.\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nIt may have been more appropriate for the changes to have been deferred to allow for a \nmore detailed consultation on the ope\nration of th\ne\ns\ne\n new rules, which were effectively first announced on 10 December 2013.\n5.4.\n&#xa0; \nFurthermore an implementation date of 6 April brings many additional complexities to the process.  It would be far more sensible to \nimplement the changes at the start of the partnership accounting period, which for many professional partnerships is 1 May\n or 1 June\n, rather than to have the complication of treating members as both partners and employees in the same accounting period.  Th\nis was drawn to HM\nRC’s\n attention during the consultation process and it is unfortunate that it was not taken into account in designing the proposals as it does not seem likely that any significant loss of revenue would be involved by aligning the changes t\no accounting periods rather than tax years. \n6.1.\n&#xa0; \nAs mentioned above, we fully accept the po\nlicy objective of\n prevent\ning\n unfairness and market distortion by ensuring that inappropriate partnership a\nllocations to a company or similar vehicle cannot create tax advantages.\n However, as in the disguised remuneration provisions above, the proposals are very wide, and are likely to affect many \ncommon\n structures, as well as \nthe tax-motivated structures for which \nthey were designed.  \n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nIn particular, they run counter to a number of other current legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the liberalisation of the practice of law through Alternative Business Structures.  \n \nThese structures facilitate non-lawyer external investment into the legal profession.  The most common structure is for the law firm to continue as a partnership but for external ownership to be admitted via a company which becomes a controlling member of\n the law firm.  This creates a \n“\nmixed partnership\n”\n which, at first blush is caught by these \npunitive new rules.   This is particularly unfortunate as the law is one of the UK\n’\ns most successful international exports and the liberalisation of the profession \nwas a positive opportunity for the UK to again take the lead, internationally, in the evolution of legal services.  This tax change takes away with one hand the important commercial opportunity offered by Government with the other hand.\n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nWhether or not a bu\nsiness is caught by the rules is not determined by a test of commercial motivation; instead it is to be assessed by a test of whether or not it is \n“\nreasonable to suppose\n”\n that the company\n’\ns share of profits from the partnership is attributable to the indiv\nidual partner\n’\ns \n“\npower to enjoy\n”\n it.  We can see how this test works to capture inappropriate tax-motivated structures but our concern is that it leaves some genuine, commercial structures and practices in a position of great uncertainty given the highly s\nubjective nature of the test and the lack of any useful guidance as to how it is to be interpreted and applied by HMRC in practice.  There would have been ways of tackling the policy objective without such unfortunate adverse side effects on business.\n&#xa0;\nTax Policy MakingWe very much welcomed the coalition Government’s June 2010 document on Tax Policy Making.  The key improvements we saw are the extended time\nframe\n for introducing new\n legislation, with consultation\n at multiple stages; the focus on re-consider\ning the legal \nframework\n for some areas rather than trying to ‘\npatch\n’ holes in the \nlegalisation\n; and the increased evidence about the policy change and those potentially affected.   \nThere have been some clear successes from the new approach.  The basic not\nion of announcing an outline area in a Budget, producing a consultation document in, say, June and engaging in discussion before preparing draft legislation for consultation from early December and enactment by the following July should give the time neede\nd for proper consideration of the measures proposed.   Examples of successes include the new controlled foreign company rules (started by the previous government) and the statutory residence test.  We also commend the withdrawal of proposal\ns\n when consultat\nion reveals that they \nare unlikely to\n achieve the intended effect.  \nExamples of areas where the Policy Making framework has not been applied fully include the SDLT and Annual tax on Enveloped Dwellings changes implemented in 2012 and 2013 and the partners\nhips consultation discussed above.  In these cases, the objectives of the policy were not set out fully at the start and undoubtedly changed \nsignificantly \nduring the course of the policy development.  That doesn’t help effective development\n of a policy and its translation into legislation.\n  \nThe cap on income tax reliefs is another example of poor policy making, which the committee considered last year.  We still cannot understand the economic rationale \nfor limiting some loss reliefs in resp\nect of losses arising from the business in which the taxpayer is mainly engaged, but not limiting (or having a much higher limit) for some investment losses.  We do fully accept the possible need to put a cap on certain reliefs for cost reasons, though.  \nWe would also highlight policy changes in relation to the oil and gas sector as examples where quite significant economic changes have been announced with insufficient consideration of the overall impact.  The announcement of the increased rate of suppleme\nntary corporation tax has previously been highlighted; the Autumn Statement 2103 contained another change in relation to drilling rigs without enough discussion with the industry on the case for change and the best means of achieving that change.  Naturall\ny the responsibility for policy choices will always rest with the elected government of the day but we should all want those choices to be made with as much information as possible.  \nThe final area to encourage is post-implementation review.  We have not \nyet seen a good example of this being carried out.\nJanuary 2014\n"
