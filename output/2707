[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1.
[normal] 
[normal]The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal] 
[normal]We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which
[normal] 
[normal]works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1.
[normal] 
[normal]Councils support a streamlined system of standards for new homes
[normal]. There are however
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] number of issues arising from the proposals which we feel could be resolved by:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Baseline standards being adopted as national policy where there is no provision already in building regulations.
[normal]2.1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring a reasonable transition period. There should be clear arrangements whereby councils which have published, or 
[normal]have 
[normal]emerging local plans, will retain any local standards set by those plans until the council undertakes a scheduled plan review.
[normal]2.1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The ability for councils to retain standards in examined local plans that are the same or equivalent to those in the proposed national standard set
[normal],
[normal] without having to undertake further tests and examination
[normal].
[normal]2.1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Policies for application of new standards being incorporated into existing housing needs assessments and viability testing
[normal],
[normal] based on data that is already readily available and used by councils, rather than introducing new tests.
[normal]2.1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Introduction of a clear and transparent mechanism for councils and others to raise concerns about the impact of the national standards or to put forward ideas for revised or new standards.
[normal]2.1.6.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring a proportionate process for future new or revised standards to be added to local plans with minimal resource and cost implications for councils. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.2.
[normal] 
[normal]The LGA is
[normal] in discussion
[normal]s
[normal] with the development industry about how we can ensure that 
[normal]our proposals are
[normal] effective in reducing the number of standards
[normal],
[normal] but also 
[normal]how it could 
[normal]save delays and additional bureaucracy in getting appropriate standards in place.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1.
[normal] 
[normal]Councils support the rationalisation of the wide range of standards for new homes that are currently promoted by different 
[normal]organisations
[normal]. A streamlined system 
[normal]will
[normal] reduce complexity and duplication
[normal], assisting both 
[normal]developers and councils.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.2.
[normal] 
[normal]We also believe that with continued and growing demand for housing, new developments should be high quality and well-designed to meet the needs of current and future generations.  Developments which are of high quality are also likely to command greater public support and are therefore important in overcoming local opposition to development.
[normal] There is a potential tension between this and the use of standard “identikit” designs across the country to which Ministers have, we believe correctly, been resistant.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3.
[normal] 
[normal]Architecture and design are also crucial as part of an area’s wider efforts to attract investment and tourism and promote locally led growth. Councils play a key role in driving high-quality design through the local planning system and it is important that councils retain this important role in order to deliver spatial aspirations for local areas. Our recent response to the Farrell Review
[normal]’
[normal]s call for evidence provides more information
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4.
[normal] 
[normal]In addition, the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) requires councils to plan the right mix of homes ‘
[normal]based on current and future demographic trends, market trends and the needs of different groups in the community’ 
[normal](paragraph
[normal] 50). To be able to deliver on these objectives, councils will need to be able to apply specific standards over and above those which exist in building regulations in some cases. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5.
[normal] 
[normal]Councils have included standards within their local plans to ensure that housing is of good quality and meets identified local needs. A national framework that provides some flexibility for areas to choose standards that reflect local needs and circumstances would be welcome and remove much of the need for councils to have their own standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6.
[normal] 
[normal]However, there are a number of issues arising from the proposals which will need to be addressed in implementing a new national standards framework. In particular, councils have concerns about the implications for local plan-making. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impact on local plans
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.7.
[normal] 
[normal]Under the proposals:
[normal]3.7.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Any standards for new housing currently within local plans would no longer apply;
[normal]3.7.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To apply any of the new standards emerging from the review, councils would need to adopt them within local plans subject to a rigorous needs assessment and viability test. This would be subject to thorough testing through the examination by the Planning Inspectorate (PINS).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Needs and viability tests
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.8.
[normal] 
[normal]The existing local plan process and accompanying National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) already provide 
[normal]a
[normal] proportionate framework for the assessment of housi
[normal]ng needs and viability testing. As a result, it is unnecessary for the G
[normal]overnment to introduce additional tests for new standards resulting from this review.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.9.
[normal] 
[normal]Policies for application of new standards should therefore be incorporated into existing needs assessments and viability testing and be based on data that is already readily available and used by councils. There is potential for double-counting of costs if additional needs and viability tests are introduced for any new standards resulting from this review.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.10.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In many cases, councils may already have standards in their local plans which are the same as
[normal],
[normal] or similar to
[normal],
[normal] those in the new national framework. Since these have already been accepted by the Planning Inspectorate, requiring councils to undertake further assessment and examination in order to apply the same or similar standards from a new national standard set would be an unnecessary duplication of effort
[normal] 
[normal]and impose considerable costs on local government for absolutely no gain
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.11.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition, councils will need to re-consult on local plans to include any of the new standards and then resubmit to PINS for “soundness” of the new policies. This will not only involve considerable time and resources for councils, but threatens to distract PINS resources from priority work of getting local plans in place.
[normal] 
[normal]We would therefore suggest that councils should not be required to have their plans re-examined in order to incorporate the new national standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.12.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Clarity is also needed about the legal status of a local plan where an existing standard within it is “nullified” because of a change in national policy. This could lead to an undesirable position where those parts of the plan would be treated as out of date and disregarded when decision making on planning applications was to be undertaken. This would undermine the adopted local plan document and could lead to legal challenge
[normal]s
[normal] and confusion. Therefore, a revision would need to be undertaken just to remove a standard, which would carry with it the requirement for re-consultation and examination, involving additional time and resource on councils and PINS
[normal]. 
[normal]We also foresee, in the absence of proper transition arrangements, extensive debates in front of planning inspectors and the courts, about whether national or 
[normal]existing local policy should have primacy. This uncertainty and the associated cost will benefit neither local government nor the house building industry.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.13.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Finally, the delay between the deletion of existing standards from local plans and the revised plans being put in place cou
[normal]ld lead to a standards ‘vacuum’. This could result 
[normal]in a decrease in the quality of new houses being built 
[normal]–
[normal] an
[normal] 
[normal]undesirable situation for councils, communities and 
[normal]the G
[normal]overnment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These issues could be resolved by:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.14.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Adopting the baseline standards as national policy where there is no provision already in building regulations. They can then be applied with the flexibility afforded by the planning process to make reasonable judgments on standards. 
[normal]3.14.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring a reasonable transition period. There should be clear arrangements whereby councils which have published or emerging local plans will retain any local standards set by those plans until the council undertakes a scheduled plan review.
[normal]3.14.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Allowing councils who already have standards in examined local plans that are the same or equivalent to the proposed national standard set to retain them without having to undertake further tests and examination.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Reviewing standards
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.15.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We agree with the 
[normal]Government’s 
[normal]consultation proposal that the national standards should be kept under review and support the idea of them being kept under scrutiny by a group of key partners who meet at appropriate intervals. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.16.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, there must be a clear and transparent mechanism for councils and others to raise concerns about the impact of the national standards or to put forward ideas for revised or new standards. Councils, in representing the needs of local communities should be an integral part of any review group. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.17.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Consideration also needs to be given to how new or revised standards can be added to local plans and redundant ones removed in a timely fashion with minimal resource and cost implications for councils. Having to re-submit a plan to PINs every time councils want to include a new or revised standard will place unsustainable burdens on councils, add unnecessary bureaucracy and repeat problems outlined above about creating a standards vacuum.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Space
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.18.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]P
[normal]aragraph 50 of the NPPF requires councils to provide a mix of housing, including size, to reflect local demand. To be able to deliver on that part of the NPPF, and in the absence of any national space standards being introduced, councils will need flexibility to be able to apply their own local space standards where there is an 
[normal]evidenced need to do so. A number of councils have already successfully introduced local space standards to all tenures of housing including Bristol City Council and Oxford City Council, which have led to improved internal environments for residents of new-builds. Others, for example Chelmsford Borough Council, have introduced minimum space standards for specific housing tenures, such as Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs), to prevent overcrowding and associated hazards
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.19.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given that minimum space standards are not currently reflected at a national level and require significant resources to implement locally, councils would support the adoption of space standards as a baseline in the national standard set. This would enable councils to apply them with appropriate flexibility and discretion through the planning process, taking into account relevant viability concerns. However, local “grandfathering” rights should be applied for councils (and those covered by the London Plan) which already have an approved space standard. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Affordable housing
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.20.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst the market will dictate minimum standards for market housing in many areas, affordable housing for rent is allocated, according to need, through councils and registered providers and c
[normal]hoice is limited. T
[normal]he market will not therefore protect standards in the same way.  In addition, affordable housing needs to provide for a higher concentration of vulnerable people and those with particular needs. Standards will be important in ensuring that new housing caters to the needs of these groups.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.21.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under current arrangements, standards for affordable homes, including space, are regulated through conditions on grants from the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). If that ceases to be the case, councils
[normal] will
[normal] need the flexibility to be able to set the appropriate standard level for that tenure
[normal], including space. Such a process would need to
[normal] ensure that standards of affordable housing do not fall below a level that would be acceptable for market housing and which meet the needs of particular groups that require affordable housing. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Energy
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.22.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The 
[normal]Government’s 
[normal]consultation paper proposes that energy and carbon targets will be delivered through strengthened building regulations to move towards zero carbon homes by 2016
[normal]. The G
[normal]overnment therefore considers that there is no longer a need for separate targets to be applied through the Code for Sustainable Homes.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.23.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Under the proposals however, councils will no longer be able to require that where viable, a proportion of energy required by new development should be generated by onsite renewable sources.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.24.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Policies 
[normal]regarding
[normal] requirements
[normal] for
[normal] on-site renewable energy generation quite properly have to go through the Local Plan 
[normal]process and are typically subject to site-specific viability assessments.  Such policies have reduced carbon emissions and reliance upon fossil fuels, and driven innovation in the sector. In addition, setting standards for renewable energy would provide a means for ‘Allowable Solutions’ to offset carbon emissions on other sites to be delivered in the area where the development takes place, to benefit the local community. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.25.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LGA
[normal] would therefore suggest that standards for on-site renewable energy should be included in the national framework that councils could adopt in a Local Plan, provided it was compatible with the requirement for viability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Security
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.26.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ensuring security of new housing is an excellent investment which can reduce the substantial costs of crimes – to victims and to the wider community. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.27.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Security standards are not currently covered by building regulations and we would therefore support adoption of the level 1 security standard as a default with a view to incorporating it into building regulations at the earliest opportunity.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.28.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In light of higher levels of vulnerability for those in affordable housing, the Homes and Communities Agency currently apply a security standard broadly equivalent to the level 2 standard. This should continue to be the default for affordable housing.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Water
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.29.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Given that the cost of applying the proposed water standard is only minimally above the standards required in building regulations (identified at £68), there is a compelling argument that it should be adopted as a default (in effect to replace the current building regulation). There should then be a tighter standard available for local authorities to draw upon in areas of water stress.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Impacts upon industry
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.30.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important to consider the impacts of the new standards framework upon industry.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.31.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Code for Sustainable Homes has brought about considerable advancements in low carbon construction industry, increasing training, development and innovation in low-carbon construction skills. 
[normal]If
[normal] the G
[normal]overnment take
[normal]s
[normal] forward their proposal to wind down the role of the Code
[normal] there is a need to ensure that development of these skills continues and competition and innovation is encouraged.
