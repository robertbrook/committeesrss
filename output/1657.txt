[[[Written evidence submitted by RCUK Heat and the City Project, University Of Edinburgh (HOT39)]]]Heat and the City is a four year collaborative project between the Universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde which explores sustainable heating in UK cities. The project is funded by the UK Research Councils, and incorporates case studies, over 100 interviews with policy makers and practitioners, 200 interviews with households receiving district heating, and knowledge exchange workshops with the UK District Energy Vanguards Network.This response focuses on the committee’s question “Why is community heating / CHP not more common in the UK?” 1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; District heating (DH) in the UK is commonly used in conjunction with combined heat and power (CHP) generation. In densely populated urban areas, these technologies can, in the short term, provide affordable heat (particularly where it replaces electric resistive heating), as well as carbon and primary energy saving. In the right places, CHP/DH contributes to local economic regeneration and public welfare. While small gas CHP often stabilises the business model of new DH systems, over the longer term the technologies should decouple, leaving DH infrastructure which would afford key benefits to the UK’s energy system: building in flexibility to respond to changing patterns of energy resource availability and heat technology performance, provide balancing services to an increasingly inflexible electricity system, and enabling a transition away from unabated use of gas for heating in dense areas. The existence of heat networks in Sweden and Denmark is a significant factor in the high renewables penetration in those countries.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Systematic uncertainties across energy systems make it difficult to estimate an optimum level of DH in the UK. DECC estimates range from 14% to 50% of space and hot water demand, considerably greater than the current figure of under 2%. Therefore, while the appropriate deployment of DH in the UK is not clear, it is likely to be at least seven times the current level.

[[[Historical reasons why DH is not more common]]]3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Many of the manifold historical reasons for limited use of DH in the UK have parallels with current (and possibly future) challenges to development of urban sustainable heat systems. DH with CHP was positioned as a central component in energy policy in two distinct periods (immediately following the Second World War, and towards the end of the 1970s). However, development was limited for various reasons including:4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In the intervening period (1960s and early 1970s), small community heating systems were installed in new housing developments. Energy saving was not a strong priority. The coal and oil industries competed to offer packaged heating systems to capture shares of the heating market. Cost cutting and limited experience contributed to poor performance, and DH developed a poor reputation. Competition with then cheap North Sea gas meant economic viability was often challenging, and systems were operated by organisations for whom DH was not a core activity, exacerbating operational problems.5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The above summary does not exhaust the historical reasons why CHP / DH is not more common in the UK, further evidence is cited in endnotes. 

[[[DH Niche Project Development]]]6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While DH is a conceptually simple technology it admits of a wide variety of configurations. This applies to technical components (pipe work, different heat sources), to variety of users connected, to different financing and business models, to different delivery and operational vehicles, and to different strategies for expansion (including no expansion). 7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; UK development is following a liberal model, with policy open to a wide range of configurations. While this allows for innovative exploration, it also leads to DH initiatives characteristically structured as small scale, piecemeal, bounded projects. This contrasts markedly with most municipal infrastructure (including European DH systems) developed strategically in the twentieth century on an integrated, comprehensive area wide basis. A number of interrelated factors contribute to the small scale focus8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The exploitation of niche opportunities presents challenges for future-proofing systems for expansion and interconnection. Some technical aspects of future proofing can be addressed by local adoption of technical standards (such as the GLA’s District Heating Manual for London). Other engineering aspects (particularly sizing systems to accommodate additional load) add cost. Justification of this additional investment to future-proof systems is challenging due to uncertainty over future connections in the absence of requirements on building owners or developers to connect.9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Expanding or interconnecting networks also poses future commercial challenges. There is little empirical evidence that piecemeal networks operated by different organisations can be integrated into a coherent system. Organisational challenges and transaction costs associated with a “link up later” approach to isolated developments have received much less attention than the engineering challenges. 10) The degree to which a heat network is controlled by the local authority impacts on its future trajectory. Differences between public sector goals and commercial owner/operator priorities have, in some instances, led to frustration over expansion (both to new heat users and new heat sources). There is a risk in the current piecemeal approach that lucrative opportunities (large public sector heat users in close proximity) will be cherry-picked rather than used to leverage bigger systems with greater overall benefit.11) Norwegian DH development is an important example for the UK. A centrally administered licensing system establishes concession areas within which developers (public or private) obtain exclusive rights to operate DH, provided they can demonstrate (against a standard appraisal methodology) the integrated social, economic and environmental benefits in comparison with realistic alternatives. This approach builds legitimacy and confidence among subscribers and investors and facilitates a strategic approach. A standardised appraisal methodology imposes some restrictions on the scope for innovation, but delivers reduced transaction costs, strategic development, and public oversight of decisions with long term consequences. Without this, commercial imperatives have the potential to lead to DH systems which fail to address policy concerns, paralleling 1960s and 1970s problems (for example, a developer may judge that the savings associated with low-cost pipe insulation outweigh the costs of energy loss, but such an outcome would undermine energy policy aims). 

[[[Role of local government]]]12) Statutory functions of local authorities (LAs) (as planning authorities and service providers) mean they play a pivotal intermediary role in strategic development and expansion of networks. In addition, the heat demands of LA estates can provide the basis for long-term contracts for heat and power supply, which stabilise business revenues. LA prudential borrowing powers provide access to affordable finance; they can act as guarantor to reduce costs of long term loan finance; they can ensure that heat tariffs are fair and transparent; and they can assist in developing consumer protections and service standards. DH configuration is particular to localities, and needs actors with long-term commitment to the area; this requires local knowledge about opportunities, their timing, and potential for integrated developments. Commercial DH developers regard LA commitment as equally important to area technical characteristics when considering where to invest.13) However, energy services are not a statutory activity for LAs. DH development competes with other priorities, and budget pressures make a strategic approach uncommon. The ability to develop DH is strongly influenced by the clarity of policy direction from other levels of government. The loss of planning guidance in England, along with the transfer of planning functions away from local government under the “localism” agenda, are perceived by LAs as creating significant challenges to DH. Central government’s determination to cut red tape (particularly by reducing reporting requirements which thereby reduces inter-authority visibility) and to reduce directive guidance to local authorities has the effect of isolating them from each other and from other levels of government. This is detrimental to DH development which requires a coordinated planning framework.14) The LA capacity to engage with the consultancy and design market is limited by lack of experience. Difficulties in acting as an “informed client” mean that feasibility studies may be under-specified and outputs inadequately challenged, opening the potential for low quality work. The extent to which DECC’s Heat Networks Delivery Unit (HNDU) builds capacity, and the extent to which HNDU-supported projects are future proofed, will be crucial to transformational change.

[[[Central government policy]]]15) In the early 2000s, DH was identified as a crucial component of the UK’s energy policy, and was supported by the Community Energy Programme. While that programme stimulated many of the recent DH successes, and created networks of expertise, LAs perceive limited policy progress since: as DECC’s 2013 Heat Strategy acknowledges, DH is influenced by a wide range of energy policies and programmes, none of which are specific to it. Over the last decade, policy focus and funding have had a stop-start character, making long-term planning and investment difficult, and creating intermittent spikes in demand for consultancy and contractors, raising costs and lengthening lead times. LAs most successful in responding to funding opportunities have typically committed resources to development, at their own risk, before central government support has been announced. However, the risks of this kind of speculative approach are piecemeal and sub-optimal systems, and projects which fail to progress.16) HNDU will focus on the early project development stages. While this is a crucial contribution to establishing projects and building LA capacity, there is no capital investment budget (either as grants or underwriting). Systemic risks remain, therefore, that first-phase disadvantages and the costs of future-proofing systems, coupled with the potential for patchworks of technically or commercially incompatible systems to emerge without strategic oversight, lead to stunted DH development.

[[[Financing DH systems]]]17) Financial models are highly sensitive to the valuation of future benefits – i.e. the rate of return required of investment. In comparison with regulated gas and electricity networks where returns on sunk investment are protected, DH investments are exposed to greater risks, raising the costs of capital and reducing viability. In common with other investments, a public-sector led approach can accommodate lower rates of return (and lower borrowing costs), but implies risk is taken on by the public sector.18) DH networks face challenges in mobilising finance. Banks are less willing to offer long term commercial finance in the wake of the financial crisis. The Green Investment Bank (GIB) targets district heating under its Non-Domestic Energy Efficiency theme. Some practitioners have questioned whether the requirement that the GIB must lend on market terms to crowd in investment will adequately address the challenges faced by first-stage projects in mobilising long term and low cost finance .19) Institutional investors (such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds) are potentially suited (in terms of time scale and returns) to refinancing DH once higher risk development stages have been passed. However, the minimum investment considered is generally much larger than the niche opportunities which are currently the focus of UK activity.20) Ensuring network subscribers remain connected, require heat over the lifetime of the business model, and are financially sound, are crucial dimensions of risk perceptions. This is mitigated through low risk subscribers (such as public sector organisations). There are differences in opinion as to how significant heat off-take risk actually is to business models; some consider it a “red herring” since subscribers can be replaced. However, given limited DH experience, lenders are unable to quantify such mitigation options and instead assess projects on the basis of “bankable” heat supply contracts. 21) At present the balance of key incentives (particularly the Renewables Obligation and Renewable Heat Incentive) skew business models towards electricity production. This enforces business model preference for electricity, where the established network mitigates volume risks arising from the need to recruit users. While electricity sales are often crucial to financial viability of DH initiatives, distributed generators are disadvantaged by the physical and institutional legacies of the centralised electricity system. These include difficulties dealing with DNOs, the impact of the Citiworks case on private wire models, the slow and uncertain development of License Light opportunities, and barriers to small entrants engaging with wholesale markets.&#xa0; DECC (2013) The future of heating: Meeting the challenge. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-heating-meeting-the-challenge Ericson, K.
