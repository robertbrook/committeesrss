default&#xa0;
defaultLAND REFORM REVIEW GROUP – CALL FOR EVIDENCEdefaultI welcome the opportunity to submit evidence to assist the
default work of the 
defaultScottish Affairs Committee
default. My comments are all aimed at policy and institutional frameworks to support and guide the land reform process.
default&#xa0;
defaultIssues with Current Situation of defaultAdministering and defaultManaging Land in Scotlanddefault&#xa0;
defaultFragmented Land Policies
default - 
defaultThere is no single source of land policy or National Land Policy – rather, the policies on land in Scotland are located in numerous sources such as national development policies, land use strategies, laws and regulations and even as the result of admini
defaultstrative practices. Also, there are numerous policies across the government directorates and agencies that touch on land, such as policies on housing, education, natural heritage, economic development, etc. This patchwork of land policies makes it problema
defaulttic for these land policies to collectively align and effectively support the vision for Scotland and ensure that land effectively supports Scotland’s future needs.
default&#xa0;
defaultWeak Land Governance
default - the governance arrangements of land
default are weak – there is no recognis
defaulted champion of the sector and no cross cutting government body of senior officials, such as a Land Commission, to co-ordinate land activities. This has resulted in weaknesses in two crucial areas: there is no overall National Land Policy, neither in genera
defaultl nor on the state and public lands in particular, providing a consistent policy framework of all the ministries managing land; and the lack of efficient co-ordination across the ministries involved in land administration and management significantly delay
defaults or stops the implementation of land 
defaultinitiatives
default, including land reform
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultInconsistent Management of Land
default - the institutional arrangements for administering and managing land are highly fragmented across 
defaultScottish
default public sector custodians and there is neit
defaulther regulatory nor executive oversight body. This results in inconsistent and inefficient approaches to land management.
default&#xa0;
defaultInefficient Land Information Management
default – information about land is captured, maintained and managed independently by the custodians o
defaultf land without the adoption of national data and procedural standards. This has resulted in land information being incomplete, inconsistent, inaccessible and not shared and used across Government
default and beyond
default. For example, there is no definitive inventory of
default state 
defaultand public 
defaultland
default and the geographic access to land ownership
default is limited to land within the Land R
defaultegister
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInsufficient Capacity in Land Management
default – although the 
defaultdirectorates and agencies
default involved in land have good skills within their particular la
defaultnd disciplines, the government is missing resources that have a wider perspective of land administration and management and can understand the wider land policy issues. This just serves to compound the fragmented and un-coordinated management of land in 
defaultSc
defaultotland
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultWay Forwarddefault&#xa0;
defaultScotland’s land reform agenda has to be guided by a National Land Policy framework, be informed through open, comprehensive land information, be administrated 
defaultand regulated 
defaultthrough strong governance and be implemented with sufficient 
defaultcapacity. These proposals are discussed below:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTransparency is a fundamental characteristic of good land governance that encourages engagement with citizens over land issues and is proven to reduce corruption
default and the mis-u
defaultse of land
default. I believe that 
defaultall government organisations involved with land, including the 
defaultRegisters of Scotland
default,
default should be totally transparent and expose, free of charge, as much of their land information to the public as possible.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would also 
defaultrecommend that 
defaultthis 
defaultland 
defaultinformation
default 
defaultbecome an integral part of the wider ‘open data’ initiative being advocated by open government. The opening up of governmental data, free for re-use, is being justified on economic grounds (2) (
default3
default) 
default(4) 
defaultsince access to th
defaultese data will have major benefits for citizens, businesses, and society and for the governments themselves. Some of the benefits include:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultA National Land Policy and associated Land Reform Policy must be evidence based. This will only happen if Scotland creates a National Land Information Se
defaultrvice that provides ease of access to a holistic set of interoperable land information about Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLand Administration Systems provide the infrastructure for implementing land policies and land 
defaultmanagement strategies in support of sustainable development. This infrastructure includes the institutional arrangements, a legal framework, processes, standards, land information, management and dissemination systems, and technologies required to support 
defaultallocation, land markets, valuation, control of uses, and development of interests in land. Land Administration Systems are dynamic and evolve to reflect the people-to-land relationships, to adopt new technologies and to manage a wider and richer set of la
defaultnd information. The Registers of Scotland provide 
defaultthe 
defaultland tenure element of Scotland’s Land Administration System.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultFigure 1: The land management paradigm (5)defaultLand management underpins the distribution and management of a key asset of any society namely
default its land. For western democracies, with their highly geared economies, land management is a key activity of both government and the private sector. Land management, and especially the central land administration component, aim to deliver efficient land ma
defaultrkets and effective management of the use of land in support of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. The land management paradigm, as illustrated in Figure 1, allows everyone to understand the role of the land administration functions (land 
defaulttenure, land value, land use, and land development) and how land administration institutions relate to the historical circumstances of a country and its policy decisions. The 
defaultLand Administration System
default is the fundamental infrastructure that underpins and i
defaultntegrates the land tenure, land value, land use and land development functions of land administration to support an efficient land market that fully demonstrates sustainable development.
default&#xa0;
defaultLand Administration Systems are just a means of implementing land po
defaultlicies. However, Scotland does not have a National Land Policy to provide a holistic framework to guide the land tenure, land value, land use and land development functions of land administration. It is recommended that Scotland creates a National Land Pol
defaulticy to guide the future of 
defaultScottish land 
defaultinstitutions
default, including the land reform agenda.
default 
defaultAn example framework for a National Land Policy is detailed in Appendix A.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultLand administration and management in Scotland is characterised by the fragmentation of responsibilities across a wide range of land custodians with little monitoring and regulation of their land activities. This 
defaultlaissez faire
default custodian approach is contrar
defaulty to international good practice that is increasingly integrating and regulating the management of state and public land. For example, Singapore has formed a Singapore Land Authority that integrates land registration and cadastre, state land management, ge
defaultospatial and land information management, corporate services and regulation. It is therefore recommended that land institutional arrangements in 
defaultScotland
default are incrementally integrated over the following transitional steps.
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLand Coordination Committee
defaultThe first step change in strengthening the governance of land in 
defaultScotland
default would be to create a Land Coordination Committee, reporting to 
defaulta Minister
default, composed of senior officials from the key 
defaultdirectorates
default 
defaultand agencies
default managing 
defaultand administering
default land. This L
defaultand Coordination Committee would have responsibilities at both the policy and operational levels. A key activity will be to create impro
defaultved access to integrated land information.
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLand Commission
defaultOnce the Land Coordination Committee is operating effectivel
defaulty, then the land governance could be further strengthened by transforming the Land Coordination Committee (based purely on cooperation) into a Land Commission with 
defaultformalis
defaulted executive roles and responsibilities. As well as continuing the role of coordinat
defaulting land activities, a key responsibility for the Land Commission would be 
defaultformulating and maintaining a National Land Policy and monitoring that the individual 
defaultdirectorates’ and agencies’
default policies are aligned and implementing the National Land Policy. This will ensure the allocation of rights to use the land delivers sustainable development and provides optim
defaultum social and economic benefits
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLand Authority
defaultIn the medium term institutional 
defaultreform in the land sector should go further and consolidate many of the current land administration and management activities of the diverse 
defaultdirectorates and agencies
default, including mapping and geospatial information management, into a single Land Authority. T
defaulthis would be similar to the institutional solutions introduced into New Zealand (
defaulthttp://www.linz.govt.nz/
default ) and Singapore (
defaulthttp://www.sla.gov.sg/
default ). 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultScottish public sector professionals tend to be specialists in narrow fields in the land sector and are missing the wider land management perspective and understanding. This reduces the professionals’ interest and involvement in wider land policy iss
defaultues and coordination of land activities across directorates and agencies. It is recommended that capacity building programmes be identified and designed, e.g. continued professional development training programmes, establish a post-graduate educational pro
defaultgram on land management in cooperation with Scottish Universities. Capacity building programmes are a continuous process and should be activated as soon as possible to ensure that the resources are available to underpin the recommended improvements in land
default administration and management in Scotland.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDevelopment practitioners of all persuasion recognize that a well-functioning land sector can boost a country's economic growth, foster social development, shiel
defaultd the rights of vulnerable groups and help with environmental protection. Improving practices requires an objective assessment of the land governance setting, and the identification of priority areas.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultLand Governance Assessment Framework (
defaultLGAF
default)
default, 
defaultdeveloped by the World Bank and its partners, provides a holistic, diagnostic review at the country level that can inform policy dialogue in a clear and targeted manner. It is built around five main areas for policy intervention:

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLegal and institutional f

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLand use planning, management and taxation

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultManagement of public land
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic provision of land information
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDispute resolution and conflict management
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGAF helps policymakers and other stakeholders to make sense of the technical levels of the 
defaultland sector, benchmark governance, prioritize reforms in the land sector, and identify areas that require further attention.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGAF process is guided by a framework of 21 land governance indicators in the 5 key areas listed above, each divided into 3-4 
defaultdimensions for which rankings are assigned by expert panels based on pre-coded answers (on a scale from A to D) that draw on global experience. Through a consensual and participatory assessment by local experts of this core set of indicators, the LGAF serv
defaultes to map out key information on land governance and define actionable paths for policy interventions, all in a contextualized and country-driven manner. Implementation takes place in a number of discrete steps that are overseen by a local coordinator, a w
defaultell-respected and impartial person with extensive knowledge of the sector.
default&#xa0;
defaultI would recommend that the 
defaultScottish Affairs Committee
default commissions a review of Scotland’s current land governance through the LGAF. This will then guide the most appropriate policy 
defaultinterventions.

defaultAPPENDIX A: WHAT IS A NATIONAL LAND POLICY?defaultThe aim of a National Land Policy is to secure the rights of all land users and serve the multiple goals of equity, poverty reduction, income growth, economic efficiency and sustainable environme
defaultntal management. The outline of an example National Land Policy document is provided below:
