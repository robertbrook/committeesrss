defaultSubmission from the Centre for CitiesdefaultExecutive Summarydefault1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBritons work, live and socialise across, and regardless of, administrative boundaries. Nearly 50 per cent of commuters 
defaultto
default cities live and work in different local authorities.
default But neither central government nor local authorities govern or manage budgets at this scale. 
default1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe challenge for UK cities is this: how can one local authority afford to invest in growth if the financial (as well as social and environmental) benefits accrue to Whitehall or neighbouring authorities? The costs of unlocking growth often fall on one loc
defaultal authority, while the benefits are widespread. This means the finances for development projects often do not stack up. Cities 
defaultand city regions 
defaultneed greater control over how they spend money, 
defaultfreedom to raise funding of their own and governance structures
default that reflect the economy and enable services to be delivered 
defaultmore efficiently and effectively 
defaultat scale.
default1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDevolution will not 
defaultinevitably
default lead to increased economic growth but we do know that the current 
defaultcentralised 
defaultsystem 
defaultrestricts growth opportunities
default: str
defaultuggling areas are maintained but areas that could grow more are held back. By providing freedoms, tools and incentives to local authorities, devolution would enable cities to unlock their full potential. 
default1.4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBut devolution in itself
default is not a silver bullet for
default growth everywhere. Not all places have the same opportunities and variation will inevitably increase as places that have more to gain from devolution grow their economies. 
defaultAreas with structural barriers to growth should be helped in different ways to fast
default-growing areas, particularly through minimum standards of redistribution and targeted support. And devolution should
default enable cities to generate additional funds, some of which can be redistributed.

defaulttailo
defaultred 
defaultdevolution provides the best solution
default, with cities and city regions being a priority for greater freedoms and flexibilities
default. With the freedoms and incentives necessary to invest in the services needed – and to do so at scale, in collaboration – cities 
defaultand city regions 
defaultcan improve their economies but also those of neighbouring areas that depend on them
default, whether urban, suburban or rural
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCity governments are investors: in the local economy, in society and in their residents and businesses.  But they do not have the powers and resources to effectively manage their assets: the balance of powers and financial control still lies within Whiteha
defaultll. And while the onus is on local government to deliver local services and support economic growth, it has minimal control over how it manages its finances to invest in growth. Government needs to pass responsibility on to cities – functional economies co
defaultvering multiple local 
defaultauthorities – enabling them to capitalise on local knowledge, incentivise cross-boundary strategies and leverage capital and services investments off one another. 
default2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe figure below shows the spectrum of control Government has over loc
defaultal government income streams, demonstrating that cities and city regions need more financial powers to deliver growth.

default2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf UK cities cannot effectively 
defaultinvest in their future growth, how can they compete in a global economy? Our research and analysis shows that
default 
defaultfor devolution to succeed, it must address and overcome three central barriers to economic growth – as it stands, local government:
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.4.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFlexibility to set budgets to reflect local prioritiesdefault2.4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhitehall limits how local government can spend its budgets and sets statutes on the services local government must provide. Given a set budget, local authorities have little room to provide non-statutory services that support economic growth. This gives t
defaulthem little influence over local policy design as well as how national policies are implemented. 
defaultFor example, 
defaultthe single most important factor determi
defaultning a city’s growth trajectory
default 
defaultis 
defaulteducation 
defaultand 
defaultyet 
defaultthey have few levers to influence how education 
defaultfunding is used.
default 
defaultThe Dedicated Schools Grant and Pupil Premium Grant sit outside of local government’s control almost entirely, and most of the higher and further education grants sit outside Aggregate External Finance, which means local government cannot 
defaultdetermine how the money is spent to address these challenges.
default 
default2.4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCities 
defaultalso 
defaultneed more control over their skills programmes if they are going to provide educated and trained workers in the sectors that build on their local advantages. They should be able 
defaultto
default tailor
default the implementation of the Work Programme, coordinate the skills agenda between relevant stakeholders, and influence the funding provided by the Skills Funding Agency.
default 
defaultUltimately
default local authorities need
default 
defaulta range of options to improve different servic
defaultes: from influencing
default how policy is delivered, 
defaultcontrol over 
defaultthe funding that determines how national policy is implemented, to 
defaultthe 
defaultdesign and deliver
defaulty of
default local policies.
default2.5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFreedoms to raise funds and support growthdefault2.5.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo invest in growth, cities need the funds 
defaultto do so. Giving them more freedom over how to use existing funding is one thing, but cities also need the freedom to raise their own. Recent measures have addresse
defaultd
default the inability of local authorities to raise revenue, such as reform of the business rates system, but are not significant enough. 
defaultBusiness RatesdefaultThe new business rates system, introduced in April, gives local government a greater proportion of the procee
defaultds of local growth than before, but 
defaultchallenges remain, including: 
defaultComplexity:
default 
defaultThe current system is too complicated to effectively influence decisions made by local government and residents.
defaultResets
default:
default Resets
default to the system should be less frequent. They reduc
defaulte certainty for local authority budgets and create a “delay effect” that discourages investment closer to the reset or rebase.
defaultImprovements:
default 
defaultPlaces should benefit from increasing the value of their properties through transport and public realm improvements
default.
defaultFlexibility:
default 
defaultRather than being constant in real terms, the total tax take should grow with the total value of commercial property in the country.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUltimately, local government needs more freedom to raise and spend money that can be invested in services 
defaultand support for the economy. Crowd sourcing
default for instance
default,
default which the committee was interested to hear views on,
default is an interesting innovation and might deliver results at community level, but will not drive change at the scale required. Central Government sh
defaultould reduce restrictions on the fees and charges local authorities can operate locally. And local hypothecated taxes should be more widely permitted to raise funds for specific local projects. 
default&#xa0;
default2.6.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultScale of governance and budgets that reflect the economydefault2.6.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultStru
defaultctures that do not reflect economic areas restrict the ability of local government to plan strategically plan for their economic area. Transport, for example, is key to improving the conditions for business growth but most city regions and economic areas d
defaulto not invest in their transportation network as a system that spans local government 
defaultboundaries. Rather, Government funds councils on the basis of their locally managed roads and local projects and larger projects are managed from Whitehall.
default 
default2.6.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCross-bounda
defaultry decision making and budgeting is part of the solution and can have a positive economic impact by helping align policies with the scope of the real economy. Examples in London and Manchester illustrate some of the benefits and successes of local collabor
defaultation:
default2.6.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThese examples sh
defaultow what can be achieved when councils come together, but remain the exception not the rule.
default 
defaultSome authorities are coming together out of necessity as a response to austerity measures but the benefits of collaboration go beyond this. Strategic collaboration 
defaultbetween local authorities and integration of devolved budgets increases competitiveness, helps councils adapt to austerity and matches governance, funding and service delivery at the city level.
default&#xa0;
default3.1.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAre LEPs the answer?default3.1.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn 2010, L
defaultocal Enterprise Partnerships were introduced as platforms for local authorities to engage with business in decision-making, jointly deciding on investment priorities in 
defaultinfrastructure and services to support economic growth.
default 
defaultWhere LEP boundaries have been well set, they define the geography of a functional economic area and as such should be used to coordinate growth. And if LEPs fulfil their mission, they can become a platform for engagement, enabling LEPs, local authorities,
default public bodies that support service delivery and the business community to collaborate and plan strategically for their local area. 
default3.1.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBut there are limitations: LEPs cannot hold, spend and manage funds as a council does. And complicated regional governance 
defaultin some areas currently makes it difficult and costly for LEPs to coordinate strategies. In Sheffield, for example, the city region and LEP boundaries match-up but proposals for a combined authority include two district councils who will not be legally all
defaultowed to vote in the new authority. 
default3.1.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOverlapping and over-complicated structures for local authorities, LEPs, integrated transport authorities, combined authorities and so forth makes coordinating across layers difficult. But as we have seen with Greater 
defaultManchester – where the LEP geography covers the same 10 local authorities as the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Association of Greater Manchester Authorities – existing structures can be adapted and brought together to provide effective governme
defaultnt of a functional economic area.
default&#xa0;
default3.2.default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAdapting existing structuresdefault3.2.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWith LEPs as a platform for engagement not governance, local authorities must adapt to better meet the needs of functional economic areas in cities.  The question is how to use or improve exis
defaultting local government structures to maximise the benefits of devolution. 
default3.2.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCombined authorities provide democratic legitimacy: there is clarity and visibility of decision-making, as the decisions are made in the public sphere through well-defined structures
default. They 
defaultalso 
defaultoffer strategic vision for the economic area and they have the ability to deliver this vision. Economic Prosperity Boards provide very similar benefits to combined authorities, but they lack the management of integrated transport budgets. 
default3.2.3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNot 
defaultall areas are ready or suited to fully integrated budgets, however, and
default 
defaultinstitutional, 
defaultlegislative 
defaultand political impediments are barriers in some places. 
defaultLocal authorities should build upon their current relationships and build new ones to move along the s
defaultpectrum of 
defaultintegration. Ultimately, local authorities must come to a shared 
defaultevidence-based 
defaultunderstanding of 
defaulthow their local economy works and which areas of collaboration would deliver most benefits for local residents.

defaultTailored defaultdevolutiondefault3.3.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultA tailored approach recognises that both policies and places require different approaches to devolution. 
defaultSome reforms for devolution to cities should be uniform, spread across the country. Business rates reform and further localisation as well as greater f
defaultreedoms and controls over sales, fees and charges for local government will provide better financial management for all cities.
default 
defaultBut
default other
default reforms should only be devolved where there is appetite and resources in the city. 
default3.3.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTailored 
defaultdevolution offers the gre
defaultatest promise in the current political context
default, in
default that devolution can and should be different according to local needs and capability, but also
default because it shares responsibility between Whitehall and local government
default.
default 
defaultLocal authorities need i
defaultncentives to g
defaultet past the political, institutional and financial barriers, but also powers and resources in order to effectively manage the economic area. Government has to put powers, resources and governance on the table that economic areas actually want, while local 
defaultauthorities have to demonstrate how working together and having a common purpose will change their local economy.

defaultuild
defaulting
default on 
defaultthe important steps the 
defaultexisting City Deals programme
default has made, the Government should 
defaulttake
default a simpler approach
default.
default 
defaultGovernment should d
defaultevolve
default certain powers to combined authorities, others to economic prosperity boards
default or Joint Committees
default and fewer for areas with no democratic structures 
defaultacross authorities. This 
defaultwould provide certainty, while a tailored approach would enable further detai
defaultled negotiations on the specifics important to individual cities and city regions.
default Local government must, in turn, build the vision, strategy and commonality of purpose to make economic area working a success
default. 
defaultCommonality of purpose is the essential elemen
defaultt to the local authorities’ proposal: without a common understanding of what the authorities are working together towards, a realistic and focused set of ‘asks’ cannot be determined. 
default4.1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBusinesses, consumers, employers and 
defaultemployees operate in economies
default that do not fall
default within the confines of local authority administrative boundaries. And local authorities, in 
defaultcollaboration, are best placed to 
defaultdesign the strategic
default services that their local economies need
default –
default 
defaultinfluencing the de
defaultlivery of national programmes in some cases; designing and implemented local schemes in others
default. Cities 
defaultand city regions 
defaultcurrently lack the financial freedoms and 
defaultlocalised reward structures
default to invest and innovate
default in strategic services for transport, housin
defaultg, economic development and skills.
default 
defaultI
defaultn addition
default, they
default face barriers to improved collaboration at 
defaultthe 
defaultlocal level. The freedoms to control funding and raise finance for these services should be devolved to cities – reflecting functional economic areas. Crea
defaultting a more direct link between funding raised and spent would also strengthen local accountability and governance.
default4.2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTailored
default devolution offers the best option and rests on a clear proposition: what local government can offer in exchange for devolution and 
defaultgreater collaboration. Central g
defaultovernment must build a united front on the benefits for national growth of increased devolution and provide certainty on measures and structures such as LEPs. But the onus is also on local government to develop a better unde
defaultrstanding of their local geography, work better across boundaries, overcome political differences and share skills.
