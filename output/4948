[normal]Submission from the Centre for Cities[bold]Executive Summary[bold]1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Britons work, live and socialise across, and regardless of, administrative boundaries. Nearly 50 per cent of commuters 
[normal]to
[normal] cities live and work in different local authorities.
[normal] But neither central government nor local authorities govern or manage budgets at this scale. 
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The challenge for UK cities is this: how can one local authority afford to invest in growth if the financial (as well as social and environmental) benefits accrue to Whitehall or neighbouring authorities? The costs of unlocking growth often fall on one loc
[normal]al authority, while the benefits are widespread. This means the finances for development projects often do not stack up. Cities 
[normal]and city regions 
[normal]need greater control over how they spend money, 
[normal]freedom to raise funding of their own and governance structures
[normal] that reflect the economy and enable services to be delivered 
[normal]more efficiently and effectively 
[normal]at scale.
[normal]1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Devolution will not 
[normal]inevitably
[normal] lead to increased economic growth but we do know that the current 
[normal]centralised 
[normal]system 
[normal]restricts growth opportunities
[normal]: str
[normal]uggling areas are maintained but areas that could grow more are held back. By providing freedoms, tools and incentives to local authorities, devolution would enable cities to unlock their full potential. 
[normal]1.4.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]But devolution in itself
[normal] is not a silver bullet for
[normal] growth everywhere. Not all places have the same opportunities and variation will inevitably increase as places that have more to gain from devolution grow their economies. 
[normal]Areas with structural barriers to growth should be helped in different ways to fast
[normal]-growing areas, particularly through minimum standards of redistribution and targeted support. And devolution should
[normal] enable cities to generate additional funds, some of which can be redistributed. 
[normal]1.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The focus for
[normal] 
[normal]Centre for Cities 
[normal]is to improve the economie
[normal]s of UK cities and the surrounding areas that support urban economies, because evidence shows these are the most effective places to improve the national economy as 
[normal]a 
[normal]whole. 
[normal]O
[normal]ur submission focus
[normal]es
[normal] primarily on the existing challenges to growth in cities, o
[normal]r functional economic areas, and why devolution is the answer
[normal] – a
[normal]lthough we also note that there are some freedoms and flexibilities, such as business rates, which should be devolved to all local authorities, urban and rural
[normal]. Ultimately, a process of 
[normal]tailo
[normal]red 
[normal]devolution provides the best solution
[normal], with cities and city regions being a priority for greater freedoms and flexibilities
[normal]. With the freedoms and incentives necessary to invest in the services needed – and to do so at scale, in collaboration – cities 
[normal]and city regions 
[normal]can improve their economies but also those of neighbouring areas that depend on them
[normal], whether urban, suburban or rural
[normal]. 
[normal]2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]City governments are investors: in the local economy, in society and in their residents and businesses.  But they do not have the powers and resources to effectively manage their assets: the balance of powers and financial control still lies within Whiteha
[normal]ll. And while the onus is on local government to deliver local services and support economic growth, it has minimal control over how it manages its finances to invest in growth. Government needs to pass responsibility on to cities – functional economies co
[normal]vering multiple local 
[normal]authorities – enabling them to capitalise on local knowledge, incentivise cross-boundary strategies and leverage capital and services investments off one another. 
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The figure below shows the spectrum of control Government has over loc
[normal]al government income streams, demonstrating that cities and city regions need more financial powers to deliver growth.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If UK cities cannot effectively 
[normal]invest in their future growth, how can they compete in a global economy? Our research and analysis shows that
[normal] 
[normal]for devolution to succeed, it must address and overcome three central barriers to economic growth – as it stands, local government:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Flexibility to set budgets to reflect local priorities[bold]2.4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whitehall limits how local government can spend its budgets and sets statutes on the services local government must provide. Given a set budget, local authorities have little room to provide non-statutory services that support economic growth. This gives t
[normal]hem little influence over local policy design as well as how national policies are implemented. 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]the single most important factor determi
[normal]ning a city’s growth trajectory
[normal] 
[normal]is 
[normal]education 
[normal]and 
[normal]yet 
[normal]they have few levers to influence how education 
[normal]funding is used.
[normal] 
[normal]The Dedicated Schools Grant and Pupil Premium Grant sit outside of local government’s control almost entirely, and most of the higher and further education grants sit outside Aggregate External Finance, which means local government cannot 
[normal]determine how the money is spent to address these challenges.
[normal] 
[normal]2.4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cities 
[normal]also 
[normal]need more control over their skills programmes if they are going to provide educated and trained workers in the sectors that build on their local advantages. They should be able 
[normal]to
[normal] tailor
[normal] the implementation of the Work Programme, coordinate the skills agenda between relevant stakeholders, and influence the funding provided by the Skills Funding Agency.
[normal] 
[normal]Ultimately
[normal] local authorities need
[normal] 
[normal]a range of options to improve different servic
[normal]es: from influencing
[normal] how policy is delivered, 
[normal]control over 
[normal]the funding that determines how national policy is implemented, to 
[normal]the 
[normal]design and deliver
[normal]y of
[normal] local policies.
[normal]2.5.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Freedoms to raise funds and support growth[bold]2.5.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To invest in growth, cities need the funds 
[normal]to do so. Giving them more freedom over how to use existing funding is one thing, but cities also need the freedom to raise their own. Recent measures have addresse
[normal]d
[normal] the inability of local authorities to raise revenue, such as reform of the business rates system, but are not significant enough. 
[normal]Business Rates[bold]The new business rates system, introduced in April, gives local government a greater proportion of the procee
[normal]ds of local growth than before, but 
[normal]challenges remain, including: 
[normal]Complexity:
[normal] 
[normal]The current system is too complicated to effectively influence decisions made by local government and residents.
[normal]Resets
[normal]:
[normal] Resets
[normal] to the system should be less frequent. They reduc
[normal]e certainty for local authority budgets and create a “delay effect” that discourages investment closer to the reset or rebase.
[normal]Improvements:
[normal] 
[normal]Places should benefit from increasing the value of their properties through transport and public realm improvements
[normal].
[normal]Flexibility:
[normal] 
[normal]Rather than being constant in real terms, the total tax take should grow with the total value of commercial property in the country.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Ultimately, local government needs more freedom to raise and spend money that can be invested in services 
[normal]and support for the economy. Crowd sourcing
[normal] for instance
[normal],
[normal] which the committee was interested to hear views on,
[normal] is an interesting innovation and might deliver results at community level, but will not drive change at the scale required. Central Government sh
[normal]ould reduce restrictions on the fees and charges local authorities can operate locally. And local hypothecated taxes should be more widely permitted to raise funds for specific local projects. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Scale of governance and budgets that reflect the economy[bold]2.6.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Stru
[normal]ctures that do not reflect economic areas restrict the ability of local government to plan strategically plan for their economic area. Transport, for example, is key to improving the conditions for business growth but most city regions and economic areas d
[normal]o not invest in their transportation network as a system that spans local government 
[normal]boundaries. Rather, Government funds councils on the basis of their locally managed roads and local projects and larger projects are managed from Whitehall.
[normal] 
[normal]2.6.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Cross-bounda
[normal]ry decision making and budgeting is part of the solution and can have a positive economic impact by helping align policies with the scope of the real economy. Examples in London and Manchester illustrate some of the benefits and successes of local collabor
[normal]ation:
[normal]2.6.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These examples sh
[normal]ow what can be achieved when councils come together, but remain the exception not the rule.
[normal] 
[normal]Some authorities are coming together out of necessity as a response to austerity measures but the benefits of collaboration go beyond this. Strategic collaboration 
[normal]between local authorities and integration of devolved budgets increases competitiveness, helps councils adapt to austerity and matches governance, funding and service delivery at the city level.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Are LEPs the answer?[bold]3.1.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In 2010, L
[normal]ocal Enterprise Partnerships were introduced as platforms for local authorities to engage with business in decision-making, jointly deciding on investment priorities in 
[normal]infrastructure and services to support economic growth.
[normal] 
[normal]Where LEP boundaries have been well set, they define the geography of a functional economic area and as such should be used to coordinate growth. And if LEPs fulfil their mission, they can become a platform for engagement, enabling LEPs, local authorities,
[normal] public bodies that support service delivery and the business community to collaborate and plan strategically for their local area. 
[normal]3.1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]But there are limitations: LEPs cannot hold, spend and manage funds as a council does. And complicated regional governance 
[normal]in some areas currently makes it difficult and costly for LEPs to coordinate strategies. In Sheffield, for example, the city region and LEP boundaries match-up but proposals for a combined authority include two district councils who will not be legally all
[normal]owed to vote in the new authority. 
[normal]3.1.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Overlapping and over-complicated structures for local authorities, LEPs, integrated transport authorities, combined authorities and so forth makes coordinating across layers difficult. But as we have seen with Greater 
[normal]Manchester – where the LEP geography covers the same 10 local authorities as the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Association of Greater Manchester Authorities – existing structures can be adapted and brought together to provide effective governme
[normal]nt of a functional economic area.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Adapting existing structures[bold]3.2.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With LEPs as a platform for engagement not governance, local authorities must adapt to better meet the needs of functional economic areas in cities.  The question is how to use or improve exis
[normal]ting local government structures to maximise the benefits of devolution. 
[normal]3.2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Combined authorities provide democratic legitimacy: there is clarity and visibility of decision-making, as the decisions are made in the public sphere through well-defined structures
[normal]. They 
[normal]also 
[normal]offer strategic vision for the economic area and they have the ability to deliver this vision. Economic Prosperity Boards provide very similar benefits to combined authorities, but they lack the management of integrated transport budgets. 
[normal]3.2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Not 
[normal]all areas are ready or suited to fully integrated budgets, however, and
[normal] 
[normal]institutional, 
[normal]legislative 
[normal]and political impediments are barriers in some places. 
[normal]Local authorities should build upon their current relationships and build new ones to move along the s
[normal]pectrum of 
[normal]integration. Ultimately, local authorities must come to a shared 
[normal]evidence-based 
[normal]understanding of 
[normal]how their local economy works and which areas of collaboration would deliver most benefits for local residents. 
[normal]3.3.[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tailored [bold]devolution[bold]3.3.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A tailored approach recognises that both policies and places require different approaches to devolution. 
[normal]Some reforms for devolution to cities should be uniform, spread across the country. Business rates reform and further localisation as well as greater f
[normal]reedoms and controls over sales, fees and charges for local government will provide better financial management for all cities.
[normal] 
[normal]But
[normal] other
[normal] reforms should only be devolved where there is appetite and resources in the city. 
[normal]3.3.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tailored 
[normal]devolution offers the gre
[normal]atest promise in the current political context
[normal], in
[normal] that devolution can and should be different according to local needs and capability, but also
[normal] because it shares responsibility between Whitehall and local government
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Local authorities need i
[normal]ncentives to g
[normal]et past the political, institutional and financial barriers, but also powers and resources in order to effectively manage the economic area. Government has to put powers, resources and governance on the table that economic areas actually want, while local 
[normal]authorities have to demonstrate how working together and having a common purpose will change their local economy.
[normal]3.3.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]B
[normal]uild
[normal]ing
[normal] on 
[normal]the important steps the 
[normal]existing City Deals programme
[normal] has made, the Government should 
[normal]take
[normal] a simpler approach
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Government should d
[normal]evolve
[normal] certain powers to combined authorities, others to economic prosperity boards
[normal] or Joint Committees
[normal] and fewer for areas with no democratic structures 
[normal]across authorities. This 
[normal]would provide certainty, while a tailored approach would enable further detai
[normal]led negotiations on the specifics important to individual cities and city regions.
[normal] Local government must, in turn, build the vision, strategy and commonality of purpose to make economic area working a success
[normal]. 
[normal]Commonality of purpose is the essential elemen
[normal]t to the local authorities’ proposal: without a common understanding of what the authorities are working together towards, a realistic and focused set of ‘asks’ cannot be determined. 
[normal]4.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Businesses, consumers, employers and 
[normal]employees operate in economies
[normal] that do not fall
[normal] within the confines of local authority administrative boundaries. And local authorities, in 
[normal]collaboration, are best placed to 
[normal]design the strategic
[normal] services that their local economies need
[normal] –
[normal] 
[normal]influencing the de
[normal]livery of national programmes in some cases; designing and implemented local schemes in others
[normal]. Cities 
[normal]and city regions 
[normal]currently lack the financial freedoms and 
[normal]localised reward structures
[normal] to invest and innovate
[normal] in strategic services for transport, housin
[normal]g, economic development and skills.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n addition
[normal], they
[normal] face barriers to improved collaboration at 
[normal]the 
[normal]local level. The freedoms to control funding and raise finance for these services should be devolved to cities – reflecting functional economic areas. Crea
[normal]ting a more direct link between funding raised and spent would also strengthen local accountability and governance.
[normal]4.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Tailored
[normal] devolution offers the best option and rests on a clear proposition: what local government can offer in exchange for devolution and 
[normal]greater collaboration. Central g
[normal]overnment must build a united front on the benefits for national growth of increased devolution and provide certainty on measures and structures such as LEPs. But the onus is also on local government to develop a better unde
[normal]rstanding of their local geography, work better across boundaries, overcome political differences and share skills. 
[normal]4.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If Government wants to put cities in the driver’s seat for growth, the following top 5 fiscal and financial reforms 
[normal]in line with a tailored
[normal] approach to devolution 
[normal]will make great strides towards empowering them to do so:
