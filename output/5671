defaultQ206 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWelcome
default,
default and thank you
default very much
default for giving up your time
default to come and help us in this inquiry
default.
default 
defaultWe are making a study of youth unemployment in the member states
default, following the suggestions from the Commission about the European
default Youth Guarantee 
defaultand what to do about it, because obviously the general consensus is that 
defaultyouth unemployment
default across 
defaultEurope
default is one of the major problems facing the European Union
default.
default 
defaultI am going to ask my team to say who they are and what they do
default, 
defaultperhaps you will 
defaultindividually 
defaultintroduce yourselves
default, 
defaultand then I will tell you the format and we can get on with the questions.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I am Clive Brooke. Formally I was 
defaultGeneral Secretary 
defaultof a 
defaultBritish 
defaultcivil service union that represented tax inspectors. I have been in the House of Lords as a Labour Peer since 1997.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Peter Wilson. I am an independent 
defaultCross-Bench
default Peer. I have had a career mostly in public service
default, 
defaultfinally in that public service as a colonial governor
default,
default and then in some business and some university occupations.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultI am Detta O’Cathain. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came up through the business route but I sit as a Conservative Peer. I have been mainly working in 
defaultS
defaultelect 
defaultC
defaultommittees since I came into the House all that time ago.
defaultLord Freeman:default Roger Freeman. I have had both a career in the House of Commons as a Min
defaulti
defaultster and now in the House of Lords. I earn my living by being chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ 
defaultUK
default advisory board.
defaultThe Chairman:default You have been 40 years in politics.
defaultLord Freeman:default Not quite that long, no. I am not that old.
defaultThe Chairman:default I am so sorry.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: 
defaultThank you so much. 
defaultI am Roland Freudenstein. I am the deputy director and the head of research of the Centre for European Studies, which does not sound like anything very particular but it is the political foundation of the European People’s Party, which is not quit
defaulte as North Korean as it sounds, especially as it leans in the direction of the conservative. 
defaultBeing the head of research I deal with everything, but we have 
defaultdone 
defaultquite some work on youth unemployment, especially in the context of 
defaultthe 
defaultupcoming European elections.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: My name is Robert Plummer. I am an adviser in the 
defaultsocial affairs department
default at BusinessEurope. In that department I am responsible for employment, migration and education issues.
defaultThe Chairman:default Can you tell us in a sentence or two what BusinessEurope is?
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: BusinessEurope is one of the three organisations at a European level that represent employers’ organisations. It is the largest of the three
default. The other two represent
default SMEs and public employers
default. A
defaultll 
defaultare 
defaultbased in 
defaultBrussels
default.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: My name is James Higgins. I am the policy officer for employment at the European Youth Forum. The European Youth Forum is the European network of national youth councils and international non-governmental youth organisations, so we represent youth right across the Council of Europe.
defaultThe Chairman:default The Council of Europe
default,
default not just the EU
default? S
defaulto you have 40 member states instead of 28?
defaultJames Higginsdefault: Yes. I think we go right the way to 
defaultAzerbaijan
default.
defaultQ207 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you. Witnesses will receive a transcript of this session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. I think that is probably all I need to say.
defaultAre you aware of any ways in which the perspectives, ideas and views of young people themselves have been gathered to help different bodies like the European Union, national or local 
defaultg
defaultovernments 
defaultto 
defaultdesign responses to the issue? How does the European Youth Forum help 
defaultto 
defaultbring forward the views of young people in this respect? Before you answer that, 
defaultI should 
defaultjust say 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have had two witness sessions with young unemployed people, one in Birmingham and one in Liverpool, so we know what
default 
defaultthe 
defaultsituation
default on the ground
default is like
default, but if you could answer that question, that would be 
defaulthelpful
default.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: 
defaultThank you very much for that question. T
defaulthe European Youth Forum 
defaulthas 
defaulta lot of interaction with the European Commission on the Youth Guarantee and youth unemployment
default,
default because this is the level that we tend to operate on. We have interacted quite a lot with the Commission on 
defaultits 
defaultproposal, particularly for the Youth Guarantee, and we give our own input and feedback based on the perspective of the youth sector. We were also invited to the Mutual Learning Programme of the European Commission, which was an exchange between member states on their own youth employment policies. We had an opportunity to go on to observe as well as to give some feedback to some of the ministries.
defaultOur level of interaction has been quite good. We felt that what we were communicating as the interests of young people w
defaultas
default being taken on board. Prior to this meeting I contacted our national youth councils throughout 
defaultEurope
default to find out their level of interaction and consultation. That has been more mixed. We found that despite the fact that in a Council recommendation on Youth Guarantee the role of youth organisations and young people w
defaultas
default specifically mentioned to be taken into account, in many member states this was done on a very last-minute basis with Youth Guarantee and communication plans being more shown to the National Youth Council than consulted with.
defaultOther member states have taken more of a proactive approach and tried to engage with youth organisations. Others have interpreted it as just letting them 
defaultknow 
defaultin advance what their plan is going to be, which would not be our vision of consultation with young people.
defaultThe Chairman:default Do you personally see 
defaultyoung
default people and the gritty situations that the
defaulty
default find themselves in?
defaultJames Higginsdefault: We operate in 
defaultBrussels
default but we have gone to our national youth councils and events that they have organised. One that springs to mind was an event of Youth Guarantee organised by the National Youth Council under the Irish 
defaultp
defaultresidency
default. It 
defaultbrought in youth workers from Bray, which is just outside 
defaultDublin
default. They talked very frankly about the reality that they work with. They work with young people from a background of perhaps parents with addiction issues or no parents at all, and explained in real terms literacy problems
default and other 
defaultday
default 
defaultto
default 
defaultday realities 
defaultthat 
defaultthey have.
default 
defaultThe scheme was under a scheme 
defaultrun by 
defaultthe Irish police force 
defaultfor 
defaultyoung 
defaultpeople 
defaultwho 
defaultthey identified
default as being
default on the verge of offending, and they put in youth workers to work with these people. They showed us some of the issues that they come across, and they were questioning what the Youth Guarantee would do for people with th
defaultese
default sort
defaults
default of entrenched problems.
defaultFrom our perspective the Youth Guarantee is not a panacea to solve all these problems
default;
default it is a first step to try to engage with hardcore dysfunctional young people.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: 
defaultAs
default has been mentioned, the
defaultre is the
default 
defaultyouth forum 
defaultat the European level, and another organisation representing students called OBE
defaultS
defaultSU, the Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions. I think they have been quite widely consulted by the Commission on the actions that have been initiated at the European level. Beyond that, from the perspective that I can bring, I could not give you a more detailed assessment from the national level of the extent to which young people have been consulted.
defaultThe Chairman:default So you do not have the same sort of experience that Mr Higgins has in Bray, on the ground, 
defaultin the sense 
defaultof 
defaultknowing what 
defaultthe actual deprivation is?
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: No.
defaultThe Chairman:default That is fine. 
defaultI 
defaultjust think 
defaultthat 
defaultsometimes a lot of people plan for other people way over their heads and 
defaultdo not realise
default where it is at.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: I can say that the Centre for European Studies has just started an initiative called Up To Youth, which is an internet-based platform where young people, in the run-up to the European elections
default,
default can vent their ideas
default and 
defaultmake proposals on questions that concern them particularly, and of course youth unemployment is very prominent among those. We have had 20,000 participants so far in the last few weeks since it has been up and many more 
defaultare 
defaultcoming. We have hundreds and hundreds of concrete contributions. We can go into detail on this
default later on
default. That is the one interface where we would like to come into direct contact with young people and they can tell us their ideas.
defaultThe Chairman:default I think it is very important. They are sentient human beings after all.
defaultQ208 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default Do you think it is important to disaggregate young people’s ages and maturity
default:
default for example graduates, those with no university background at all, those in their mid teens, 
defaultand 
defaultthose in their early 20s? We are dealing with different categories of problem and different skills and background. How important is it to be so specific in dealing with what I call subgroups of the unemployed?
defaultJames Higginsdefault: I think it is very, very important, because when we talk about youth generally at the European level it is young people to the age of 25, but there are vastly different realities in place. 
defaultF
defaultor a young person who is 16 or 17
default,
default has left school and has no formal education
default,
default there is a very different pathway or very different advice on how to find employment than 
defaultthere is 
defaultperhaps 
defaultfor 
defaulta young graduate of 25. It is important to categorise. From the research that we have, there is less and less room in the labour market for young people with no formal education or with a low level of skill.
defaultThe Chairman:default The NEETs.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: The NEETs, precisely. We support these people being redirected back in towards education
default, b
defaultut for a young person who is perhaps a graduate, an engineer, and the labour market is not appropriate for their qualification, more education is not necessarily what is required. Different solutions need to be found.
defaultAn additional point would be that young people, as well as being young, have other circumstances as well. They might come from a background that present
defaults
default some challenges too. I
defaultt is important 
defaultto go into as many details as possible because a blanket solution might not help the situation very much.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: Yes, I think the point that has just been made about advice and support services is a very important one. There is a need for more tailored advice and support for young people
default,
default and obviously the dif
defaultferent age categories then come
default into play significantly. If you have gone to university you have the benefits of in-house career services
default there
default. If you have left school at 16 you may not have the same access to 
defaultthem
default, or if you are trying to enter the labour market directly at 16 or 17 you may not know which direction you want to go in. At that age it is very difficult to identify the pathway that you want to take. That point about tailored support and advice, information services
default,
default to young people is very important, and for the different age categories.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: I would like to come back to the original point 
defaultabout whether there
default are specific problems for young people in the labour market. I would say 
defaulty
defaultes and 
defaultn
defaulto. No, because we are dealing here with a huge problem in the labour market, at least in many member states, which are too inflexible. They have to become more flexible. They have to soften the difference between the two sides of what we call the dual labour market
default. On 
defaultone 
defaultside there are the 
defaultvery, very stable, secure, almost lifetime jobs with high benefits and good social insurance and so on
default. On the 
defaultother 
defaultthere is 
defaulta kind of precarious labour market 
defaultwith 
defaultno firm employment in the classical sense any more.
defaultThe paradox here is that
default tackling
default those problems would help all concerned, but the victims of this dual labour market in countries like Spain and France—Spain has begun to do something about it but France and other southern member states
default have not
default—the real victims of that system are young people because they cannot even enter the secure part of the labour market. If you take the thing to the most strategic level, you need to work on the labour market as such. Having said that, I agree that there are specific problems of access to jobs and especially 
defaultin 
defaultaddressing the question of skills, where you have to focus on the particular group of young people or even more particular groups within that age group.
defaultLord Freeman:default Can I ask a supplementary question, please? 
defaultDo 
defaultyou share my view that the seeds of the problem are very often born at the age of 13, 14 and 15
default?
default 
defaultP
defaulterhaps 
defaultthere is 
defaulta one-parent family, disruptive behaviour in school and an attitude towards work and the workplace that is somewhat hostile? I speak with some experience as chairman of a charity in 120 British schools dealing with that age group and trying to teach them some kind of maturity and ambition.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: 
defaultF
defaultor some young people, yes, I would agree with that. I am speaking more 
defaultfrom an
default anecdotal basis than working with this group of young people, but this is the stage where some of these problems can develop. 
defaultA
defaultnother issue is 
defaultthat 
defaultperhaps 
defaultthere is 
defaultless social mobility than before. I have a feeling that the decisions that young people 
defaultnow 
defaulthave to make in order to be successful in the labour market they have to 
defaultmake 
defaultat an extremely young age
default,
default and there is a lot of pressure on young people. They feel 
defaultthat 
defaultif they make the wrong choice
default and 
defaultmaybe 
defaulthave 
defaulta couple of bad years at school
default or 
defaultare having behavioural issues or whatever, that it might be very difficult for them to get back on track again.
defaultIt is really important to work with young people at this age
default,
default but it is also really important to try to improve social mobility 
defaultso 
defaultthat 
defaultwhen 
defaulta young person perhaps discover
defaults
default more maturity later on in life, they 
defaultmight 
defaultmanage to get themselves on the right course again rather than being locked out.
defaultQ209 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Could I just come back on Mr Freudenstein’s analysis? Would you describe the Dutch, the Austrian and the German labour markets as flexible or inflexible? Looking at it from where we come from
default—
defaultwe have a relatively flexible labour market in the 
defaultUK
default—
defaultthe German
default labour market
default, to me anyway, looks quite inflexible compared with what we have in the 
defaultUK
default. Yet when I look at their youth unemployment they do extraordinarily well by comparison with what we do. The same applies to the Dutch and the Austrians.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: Let me talk less about the Dutch and the Austrian case and more about the German one. 
defaultGermany
default has been enjoying a very good economic situation 
defaultfor 
defaulta couple of years now. 
defaultT
defaulthat and the low youth unemployment 
defaultare 
defaultdue to measures to make the labour market more flexible than it 
defaulthas been 
defaultin almost 10 years. The so-called Hartz IV reforms enacted by the 
defaultSchröder
default 
defaultGovernment in 2003, 2004
default,
default did a great deal
default: 
defaultcorporate action, corporate downsizing and restructuring, and wage reticence on the 
defaultpart
default of the unions. All these factors combined created the situation where
defaultby
default we are 
defaultnow 
defaultreaping the benefits of reform.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Can you identify 
defaultthis 
defaultmore precisely for us? One of the issues that we can see in our country
default relates to apprenticeships. E
defaultmployers do not participate in the way 
defaultwe see employers participating
default in Europe
default: 
defaultaccept
defaulting
default social responsibility for training and putting apprenticeships
default in place that 
defaultseem to work extraordinarily well in 
defaultGermany
default. We have much freer and loser arrangements. We have the CBI, which is way removed from what happens down the line
default, and we 
defaulthave
default chambers of commerce
default. 
defaultIn fact, w
defaulte
default have a 
defaultvery 
defaultwide variety of chambers 
defaultof commerce 
defaultand there is no legislation whatever that controls the way they operate. An argument has been advanced by some people that if they had to accept more responsibilities
default and 
defaultwere more involved and required by legislation to do it, which is what we see in 
defaultGermany
default, we might have better vocational training than we presently have
default.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: I absolutely agree. One has to separate flexible labour markets 
defaultfrom 
defaultcorporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility
default,
default or the entrepreneurs’ social mentality
default,
default is of course another factor that is very important to this. Yes, I agree that 
defaultGermany
default has a quite efficient system of dual education and training, where education takes place in parallel to professional training
default: 
defaultthe German apprenticeship system. Indeed, some of my fellow Germans 
defaultprobably 
defaultgo overboard in trying to export that to other countries.
defaultI think it should be up to the countries concerned to say 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is an element 
defaultthat 
defaultwe can adopt in our own context and 
defaultthat 
defaultothers 
defaultmight not 
defaultfit so well. I do agree that the vocational training system in place in 
defaultGermany
default, and to a certain extent in 
defaultAustria
default, seems to be working very well, but it is up to every other country to take things out of there and apply it to their own situation.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default We are trying to look at the countries that have the lowest level of youth unemployment and the factors that lead to it. 
defaultPrima facie
default there may
default be a case for liberalisation in
default the labour market
default,
default but there are other aspects of the labour market as well that seem to produce good results, which I think your evidence indicates.
defaultQ210 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Just to go on from what Lord Brooke was saying, the general issue is 
defaultwhether 
defaultthe problem lie
defaults
default more with the training of people who go into jobs and their job-readiness, to use that awful bit of jargon, than whether there are jobs available? The implication of what you were saying, Mr Freudenstein
default,
default 
defaultis
default that in 
defaultGermany
default, for example, the training side is well done. The implication 
defaultis 
defaultthat in other countries that is not so much the case. In general
default—
defaultnot just Germany, obviously, but taking the EU as a whole
default—
defaultto what extent do you all see the training and job readiness of young people as a serious issue?
defaultJames Higginsdefault: It seems like a bit of a cop-out to say both, but I will explain why I think it is both. 
defaultA recent
default report from a 
defaultUS
default consultancy, I think it was 
defaultMcKinney
default, showed that in southern European countries there is a huge level of skills mismatch and that many employers cannot get the young people they need in order to fulfil the jobs they have. Even in countries like 
defaultItaly
default and 
defaultSpain
default with a high level of youth unemployment
default,
default this is a battle.
defaultA r
defaulteport from the European Commission in 2012 said 
defaultthat 
defaultabout a third of employees in 
defaultEurope
default have either too many skills or not enough skills for their job. So there is a skills mismatch
default. 
defaultI think that young people are expected to have the skills ready before they even try to go for a job and 
defaultthat 
defaultpreviously employers 
defaultperhaps 
defaultinvested more in training a person over a lifecycle. Because the labour market has changed a bit, there is a lot of pressure on a young person to be ready for the position.
defaultBut if we put all the emphasis on young people being ready and skilled for the position, 
defaultthat
default overlook
defaults
default the huge jump in youth unemployment over the past five years compared 
defaultwith 
defaultunemployment among older people 
defaulti
defaultn the labour market. It seems that another factor is the 
defaultprecariousness
default of young people in the labour market. When an economic crisis hits, a lot of companies want to make reductions in their costs and sometimes for them the most cost-effective way to do that is the last person who comes in 
defaultbeing 
defaultthe first one to leave. Usually that is younger people 
defaultwho 
defaulthave come into the business. It is a mix of both factors.
defaultA quite recent 
defaultreport from the ILO, the International Labour Organisation, showed that even though we are exiting the crisis in 
defaultEurope
default and there is some slow growth, it is not being reflected in levels of 
defaulta 
defaultreduction 
defaultin 
defaultunemployment. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect 
defaultbetween 
defaultGDP and employment rates at the moment.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Since you 
defaultanswered on 
defaultboth, can I just ask you an addition
defaultal question 
defaultto that? We talked about job readiness, rather like readiness for food. What about the mental approach? Is there an issue at all of jo
defaultb willingness, to coin a phrase:
default a division between those who seriously want a job and go flat out to get it, whatever that means, and those who will sit back and say, “No, we are not going to try
default.
default”?
defaultJames Higginsdefault: Yes, I recognise that some young people perhaps do not have the level of job willingness, as was mentioned, because they had some problems when they were young or whatever
default,
default it has knocked their confidence back a bit and they are very far from the labour market. I think it is there but I think sometimes it is overemphasised. We work with young people who are very internationalised but I do not see it in the young people I have met. There is a lot of enthusiasm to get a job. A lot of young people just feel a bit helpless and perhaps lose their motivation even 
defaultto 
defaulttry. That has been shown. Once you have had a period of employment of more than three or four months, your level of ambition to find a job rapidly deteriorates, and I think we are getting into that situation now.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: I think 
defaultthat 
defaultas a starting point there needs to be economic growth in order for there to be job creation
default,
default and employers need to have a degree of certainty in demand for their goods and services before they will look to take people on. On the skills side
default,
default indeed there are mismatches. I think there 
defaultare 
defaultin the region of 2 million unfilled vacancies across the EU at the moment. At the same time, people are as highly educated as they ever have been, 
defaultand 
defaultthe number of people going into tertiary education is growing all the time, yet we see 
defaultthat 
defaultin a number of member states obviously there are very high levels of youth unemployment. So there is a question of mismatch.
defaultE
defaultmployers 
defaultalso 
defaultincreasingly look for people 
defaultwho 
defaulthave some sort of practical work experience when they apply for a job, not necessarily that you hit the ground running but that you have some transferable skills that you might have already picked up from some sort of work experience that you can bring into the position that you are applying for. To help address that I think we need to look at education systems
default, 
defaultparticularly vocational education and training
default. Y
defaultou mentioned apprenticeships
default. With 
defaulttraineeships as well there is a chance to have some practical work experience in combination with the classroom-based elements, 
defaultand 
defaultthat can help to stand young people in good stead when they come to applying for jobs. As part of that I think there is scope to try to better reflect the needs of the labour market within the education system, particularly in vocational education training.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: I will pass on that.
defaultQ211 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Can I ask, 
defaulton 
defaulta point of interest, about this mismatch of skills? I remember 
defaultthat 
defaultduring the Irish 
defaultp
defaultresidency we attended a conference on employment. The point was really made very strongly that it is the IT skills that they are crying out for, and people do not have them. I would have thought that youth would be the IT experts because they are 
defaultinvolved 
defaultall the time with technology whereas the older people in the workforce find it slightly difficult. Secondly, the older people would be delighted to be relieved of the position of dealing with some of these IT issues. What is being done? Is this too general an approach to youth unemployment
default,
default or is there a specific target 
defaultwhere 
defaultpeople, maybe not in our report but later, say, “What about upping the skills of school leavers or even those from 12 onwards and indicate to them that if they really want to get first-class jobs this is what they ought to be doing”? Does anyone have any views on that?
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: What you just described might be termed digital literacy and that needs to become part and parcel of education, more than it has ever been in the past. Digital literacy, transversal skills such as creativity, critical thinking, self-learning and communication, with a view to the job market, need to become part of education in all stages. So does vocational training, even to bachelor’s and master’s degree level, as well as entrepreneurship education.
defaultComing back to digital skills, again referring to the German system here, we need to do away with this black and white separation between education and professional training in firms and to try to see them in a holistic way.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: I think IT skills, certainly. The latest figure we have at European level is a shortage of between 700,000, up to 900,000 by 2015, or maybe 2020. It is broader than that as well. It is the so-called STEM skills—science technology, engineering and mathematics, of which ICT is part. Employers are increasingly looking for people who are trained in those skills, whether that is at vocational education training level or at higher education level. Those are very much the sorts of areas that employers are looking for.
defaultThe Chairman:default Mr Higgins, you are agreeing?
defaultJames Higginsdefault: I was specifically thinking of the Irish context with the skills in this area, because I think sometimes there is a disconnect between what is emphasised and what is integrated into the national curriculum. In 
defaultIreland
default we have been talking about the development of the IT sector since the late 1990s, but there was not a revolutionary change in the way IT was taught in schools. It can be reflected perhaps that the IT sector is very important for 
defaultIreland
default but from my experience a few years ago the construction industry was where young people went to find employment and now we are going back to the IT sector again. I think a long-term approach to these skills is very important rather than perhaps changing the emphasis on sectors depending on exactly what the timing is.
defaultQ212 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default We have had about six or seven witness sessions since we came over here yesterday and you 
defaultare 
defaultthe first people who have mentioned IT skills. Is this because the EU has limited competency in the area of education so they are not going to be specific and say that perhaps one of the big things in sorting all this out is to try to emphasise the importance of IT skills or to encourage member states to do something about it? I am just asking you as an aside.
defaultRoland defaultFreudensteindefault: 
defaultEducation
default is not only a national competency but in some cases even a regional one. The Länder in 
defaultGermany
default even legislate on social policies, education, justice and home affairs and so on. Nevertheless, the European Union can encourage; it can provide incentives, like in all these programmes such as the Youth Employment Initiative within the framework of the European Social Fund. But I think the key is really with the member states. A best-practice model where elements are taken from one country and maybe integrated into the context of another country is the key to success.
defaultRobert defaultPlummerdefault: 
defaultExactly
default. Education is very much a member-state competence. What the EU can try to do is to steer a little bit the—
defaultThe Chairman:default Perhaps they ought to put in a sentence or two to these. In this situation it strikes me with real forcefulness that this is an area that is crying out for a novel approach, for people to encourage young people to get in there and expand their horizons, be the new Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or whoever. It is a young person’s game and I do not think they are really aware of just how valuable they could be or should be or would be.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I think it is an old person’s game for the moment.
defaultThe Chairman:default Why do you think it is an old person’s game?
defaultQ213 default&#xa0; 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default 
defaultI would like to continue on this theme. I think it is a fascinating point the chairman has raised for us there about the interface between the two and when it comes in. My question is a broad one: what do you see are the roles of the Commission, the roles of national Governments, the roles of the Länder as well, if we take it to a reasonable level, of trade unions, of other partners, and employers, in the issue of solving the problem of unemployment?
defaultWhen we come here we hear a lot about the social dialogue. That works and it seems to produce evidence and, if we go back to the earlier exchange we had, seems to produce results, yet there are people who say you go so far and you should not go any further. We look at education there and vocational training. Who is responsible? Is it the employer who is responsible or should we now be looking to see that the authorities should be educating in the area of preparation for going into work at an earlier age, which raises issues of competency between the Commission and between the states? Who do you think is responsible and where would you say the social dialogue these days stands? Is it weathering or is it worsening, as we have been led to believe, or is it in fact still producing results in notable areas like 
defaultGermany
default?
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: The stakeholders are a broad church, so to speak. To be contrary, it is no use for the state to ordain a dialogue of social partners on education or whatever else if the partners do not want to engage, so there has to be some degree of responsibility on the side of the entrepreneurs and the unions and the young people. States and Governments and regional Governments can be a catalyst. They can even be an initiator, but without the co-operation of the other parties concerned it is not going to work. There has to be a complex interplay.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: At the European level in terms of social dialogue we concluded what was called a Framework of Actions on Youth Employment last June. That document set out a series of recommendations for actions at member-state level to help address youth unemployment, looking at issues around education, transition into work, and entrepreneurship. That is something that was negotiated with representatives from employers and trade unions at European level. There are now recommendations, and it is for social partners at the national level to look at how they would go about implementing some of those recommendations. We will be doing a series of annual evaluations for the next three years to see to what extent those recommendations have been taken forward in the different national contexts.
defaultIn terms of who is responsible, I think it is perhaps increasingly a mix of actors. If you look at school-level vocational education and training, and university level, there is scope there for more involvement of a range of actors, including employers, unions, employers’ organisations, education providers and the Government, to try to develop the education systems at the different levels in the best way that they can to facilitate the transition from education at whichever level you might need it into employment.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: I think they all play a role and some actors have stepped up more to the role than others. As regards the European Commission, they have already done quite a lot on youth unemployment. I see their role as establishing the overall framework, perhaps the direction, and they have adopted that in terms of the Youth Guarantee; they have said that is the role they want to go down, and also to improve apprenticeships and traineeships. They have set the context and then the implementation ultimately falls on the member states. On that I was quite surprised that there was news that some of the member states submitted their Youth Guarantee implementation plans very late.
defaultThe Chairman:default Some have not done it at all.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: There was a deadline. I would have thought that with the Youth Employment Initiative and with the money that has been made available there would be a scramble to get them in as soon as possible and to do a varying level of consultation, so we were very surprised by that.
defaultOn the lower level of implementation I think probably the employment services, business, trainers and youth organisations all have a role to play. We talk about the public employment services adapting their needs for young people. It is a bit of a difficult place to go when you are young.
defaultEven social actors such as youth organisations have a role to play as well. They can engage with young people and can get the hardcore ones who are more marginalised to participate. I was pleased to see that trade unions were mentioned as well, because I think that trade unions have a really important role. Young people are less likely to know about employment legislation, about workers’ rights, than other sections of the population. I think the trade unions as well, many of them have not been able to successfully adapt to young people because there has been a decline in many member states of trade union membership, especially among young people. From working with young people there seems to be a disconnect between trade unions and young people completely in many member states, so I think even the social actors need to step up in order to engage with this.
defaultThe report showed that in some countries a quarter of businesses could not get the people they needed to fulfil their positions. I do not know if that is some people holding their hands up and saying they cannot get them, or ones that are really, really trying to engage and to get young people, but there needs to be this partnership in order to get those young people trained and into the jobs that are waiting for them.
defaultQ214 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Could I ask you about training and apprenticeships, and about how much of an issue any of you think the question of the standard of training or of apprenticeships is? If it is, is this an area where the European Union should play a role or not? In other words, should it be the EU doing it, the Commission trying to increase standards, or is that something for nation states? I have another question, but I will come to it in a moment.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: I will go first. When we talk about the quality or the content of apprenticeships and traineeships, I think the focus should lie on the learning outcomes. That is crucial because it is what you learn through a traineeship or an apprenticeship that will develop a person’s skills and competences and help them gain employment.
defaultIn that sense the simple answer is that at European Union level it is not a question for the EU to be setting minimum standards or guidelines around traineeships or apprenticeships. This is something that is best left to member states, taking account, of course, of existing regulations, of the vast array of industrial relations systems that there are across the EU and or existing educational practices. For that reason it is best left to the member states.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: I think, again, the institutions have an important role in defining the framework. I agree that they cannot go in perhaps to the reserve competencies. We expressed a little bit of disappointment in the quality framework for traineeships that there was no specific reference to reasons in terms of apprenticeships, but we also recognise as well that it would be seen to be overstepping the boundaries to all of a sudden put in some sort of figure—and how would that correspond with minimum wage levels?
defaultI think the issue is that internships have cropped up recently in the past decade and a lot of the legislation of member states has not been able to adapt to that. How does an internship correspond with minimum wage legislation in the 
defaultUK
default, where you are supposed to receive money for any hours you work, and if you get to five working hours then you have to be paid? Some member states have adapted to it, some have built in standards and others have not. I think the Commission is trying to react to this and ensure that we are not trying to solve youth unemployment here but also create another entry labour market for young people to go through before they can get into jobs. They have reacted to that to try to address it, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
defaultQ215 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default The other ball that was going to go with that is what do you think of zero-hours contracts, a contract whereby you have no fixed hours? You have a contract and the person who gives you the contract has certain responsibilities, but you have no defined hours, so you may have no work one day and a lot of work the next day.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: 
defaultI
default have no personal experience—neither do I know anyone who has personal experience—but the way it sounds, it fits in perfectly with the demand for greater flexibility and for getting away from the classical, incredibly stiff, 20th century type of labour markets that we have in many member states. Again, if the European Union can act as a catalyst in bringing best practice to all the member states concerned, I think that would be a good thing. That is something where the European level should act, rather than in setting rules or minimum requirements.
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default You think the zero-hours contract is a good thing, not a bad thing?
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: I believe, in the end, it is a good thing.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: I am sorry to disappoint you, but I do not have anything to add.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: We would be very much against zero-hours contracts, firstly because they overwhelmingly affect young people. They are a reason phenomenally for people recently entering the labour market with no guaranteed pension or basic employment rights. It could also entrench intergenerational problems between older people in the labour market perhaps entering at a different time, when there was a more protected and regulated labour market, and young people coming in now.
defaultAlso, the question was raised earlier about incentives to work. I think if you bring in a system of zero-hours contracts and a very poor level of social community, you erode the incentive to work. I do understand the argument for flexibility in the labour market but I think that in many member states there already is a very high level of flexibility. In 
defaultSpain
default they already had a very flexible labour market. Currently over 90% of contracts created in the scheme are temporary contracts. I think there is an issue of flexibility in certain member states in certain contexts but the overall issue is not to do with flexibility. From our point of view it is to do with quality employment for young people.
defaultQ216 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Before you answer my question, you have a fascinating looking graph in front of you. Is it the result of your Up To Youth study?
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: No, these are taken from Eurostat. There are a couple of interesting figures. To give you a couple of examples, the NEET rate—young people not in employment and not in formal education or training—has not changed. In other words, if you look at the 50%-plus unemployment in some Mediterranean countries, there are people who remain in education in some form, although they seek employment. They do not belong to the group not in employment and not in training, they stick with education.
defaultThe Chairman:default That could be good.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: It could be, but of course it relativises a little bit these horror stories of 50% or 60%. Among these 50% or 60% you have some who have nothing at all and you have others who at least compensate for not finding employment at the moment by doing something useful. It strikes you and it is shocking that we have such high youth unemployment but it needs to be specified, and that is what these figures are for.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default I was just wondering, coming back to the survey work you have done, whether there is anything in there that might be of particular use for us. We would be very grateful indeed to see it if we could, particularly with regard to people who raise the issue on the supply-side, and training.
defaultThe main thing from my next question relates to the three major planks that have emanated at EU level for a youth employment programme or the Youth Guarantee, the Youth Employment Initiative that is now working its way through the system, and the decision to encourage a diversion of some of the European Social Fund money specifically to reduce youth unemployment. What do you think about all these initiatives? Do you think they are welcome and we should have more or them, or do you think they are perhaps encroaching in areas where the Commission should not be getting too involved?
defaultIn particular, if we have the time, we are anxious to follow the money, the experience any of you may have had with where the money has been going, who it is going to and whether there is any assessment being made of whether there is value for money being secured. That links in part as well to where we started when we were talking about the needs of different groups of the unemployed.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: We support the Youth Employment Initiative in a number of ways. First of all, to focus on regions with a very high level of youth unemployment, over 25%, I think that is the right place to start with the investment. We support the focus. The focus is on implementing the Youth Guarantee, so it is about training, it is about provision of jobs 
defaultwhen they are there and it is about getting public employment services ready or better equipped to deal with the needs of young people. We like the focus; we think it is very good. The only issue we have with it is that we do not think it is enough: €6 billion sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but the original estimation of the International Labour Organisation in 2012 on Youth Guarantee was €21 billion.
defaultWe know that money could come from national level or it could come from the European Social Fund. The reason that we think there needs to be a higher level of investment is that Eurofound released a report on NEETs in 2011 that showed that €153 billion was the cost in terms of lost tax contributions from youth unemployment. So we think we need a good in
defaultvestment in order to save money in the medium to long term.
defaultOn the previous initiatives that went in, action teams were established to help member states spend the European Social Fund that had not yet been executed. I had a look into those reports and it seemed that most of the money went towards small and medium-sized businesses to help them employ young people. What I think is different about the Youth Employment Initiative, and what is perhaps more promising about it, is that it looks better to make some structural reforms if they want to do that, if they feel they need to do that on a local level, and to engage with young people, so the money is perhaps going in a different direction to try something a little bit new.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: Around the Youth Guarantee we can clearly see that in some member states and in some regions in particular young people are in a very difficult situation and they need some support and the EU can certainly help to deliver that on a short-term basis. I think that with the nature of the Youth Guarantee, it should precisely be short term. In the mid to long term you need to look rather at labour market reforms, and reforms of education systems. We have mentioned apprenticeships, perhaps looking to develop or strengthen apprenticeship systems. That is one of the points that, as employers, we have been making for the European Social Fund: member states that want to should be able to have an allocation of ESF precisely for that reason, around developing and strengthening apprenticeships. In that way, by undertaking those reforms of the labour market and education, you get to the point where you would not need the Youth Guarantee.
defaultAs I said earlier, you need growth to create employment. It is not for employers to guarantee work, so we should rather be looking at some of the structural issues that are there in the different member states and in that way overcoming the need for a Youth Guarantee.
defaultOne other point I would add is that on a short-term basis the EU can help to seed fund—I think that is the phrase—certain initiatives from a European level, but it is important not to reach a point where EU support is subsidising schemes over a prolonged period of time. It should be targeted on seed funding and initial establishment and development rather than over a long-term period.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: Just briefly, I think it is important to see that the Youth Guarantee is not a job guarantee. There is no way the European Union or anyone else can guarantee jobs. The Youth Guarantee is a programme that guarantees that we will make a concerted effort to improve the chances for young people to get employed, but I would re-emphasise what Robert Plummer just said; it is up to reform. Member states have to reform their labour markets; that is the key to everything. Then we need to tackle education systems and increase the mobility of young people, and improve language skills, for example. All these are different issues additional to the digital literacy that we talked about, but reform is the key. The Youth Guarantee is very much a temporary measure.
defaultQ217 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default One issue that strikes me that has been emerging and that we have seen back in the 
defaultUK
default is the silo mentality that one finds in public services that are providing education and providing jobs. Bringing it together is extraordinarily difficult. Listening to you, I get the impression as well that one of the by-products of all this should be an examination of the public service offerings that then lead individuals into employment—the transition from education into work. Is there any specific work being done in that area into these kinds of topics?
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: Do you mean to tackle the silo mentality?
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default That is a sense of what we are seeing here.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: Let me give you some of the ideas that the Up To Youth participants put forward. They all tackled more or less this question of how to connect the educational world with the business world or with the work environment. Schools should set up entrepreneurial programmes for young people interested in starting their own company. They could have used the word “entrepreneurship”, it is just that they did not use that term. That is another key. This even goes to popular culture in some member states, rather different from 
defaultBritain
default, where entrepreneurship is not considered a particular virtue. Universities should establish stable partnerships with companies in practical work and traineeships, such as legal clinics and laboratories, led by experts and not only professors. All universities should have better officers who will help students find a job, depending on their studies. Also, their programmes should be dynamically attached to what the whole job market is asking for. It all goes in the same direction, precisely as you indicated, and this is what young people are telling us.
defaultThe Chairman:default We are up against the time. Everybody here except me has to go back on a train.
defaultThere are two things: first of all, your last question, Lord Freeman, then there is one I want 
defaultto ask 
defaultyou, Mr Plummer.
defaultQ218 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Freeman:default Perhaps we could have just one recommendation from each of you of good practice in any particular country that should be shared with all members of the European Union.
defaultJames Higginsdefault: I would say the Finnish example of the Youth Guarantee. As was mentioned earlier, they have a Public-Private People Partnership, they have created various networks and it seems to work quite well—so well that they are going to reinvest in it even more.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: I will take it a bit broader and say co-operation between different countries, for example between employers’ organisations. If you are looking to develop apprenticeship systems, there is a lot to be learned from 
defaultGermany
default and from others.
defaultRoland Freudensteindefault: I am taking the example not of Germany but of the Netherlands, with the single contact point that centralises all services aimed at helping young people get work, advice and assistance—a one-stop-shop system for young people so they do not have to run around from institution to institution.
defaultThe Chairman:default Mr Plummer, what do you think is the impact of migration on the EU economic crisis? Is it a help or a hindrance, and what about the brain drain? I ask you this because it looks as though you are conducting 
defaultresearch on this
default and you are probably 
defaultan
default expert. Perhaps you would like to write to us on it, unless we have time in the last couple of minutes.
defaultRobert Plummerdefault: Just very briefly, labour mobility we think is an important aspect of employment. It can help address the mismatch of issues that we touched on earlier. Clearly there are issues of brain drain, particularly in the southern member states. It is something that is frequently raised by 
defaultSpain
default, 
defaultGreece
default and 
defaultPortugal
default. Mobility is not a silver bullet, it is true. It can play an important part in addressing mismatch
defaultes and helping young people get work experience, traineeship options abroad and so on, but it has to be taken together with reforms of labour markets and education systems to help address youth employment.
defaultThe Chairman:default Can I thank you very much indeed, all three of you, individually and collectively? It has been a great way to end our couple of days of evidence taking in 
defaultBrussels
default. It has been a great experience for us and I am sure that the report that we eventually produce in April, of which you will have a copy, will benefit from all of this.
defaultYou will get the transcripts and please send them back if there are things that we have misunderstood.
