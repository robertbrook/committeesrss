"&#xa0;\n1. \nT\nhe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) \nwelcomes the opportunity to respond\n to the Economic Affairs Finance Bill Sub-Committee inquiry on the draft Finance Bill 2014\n.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nT\nhe FSB is the UK’s leading business organisation. It exists to protect and promote the interests of the self-employed and \nall those who run their own business. The FSB is n\non-party political, and with\n around\n 2\n0\n0\n,000 members, it is also the largest organisatio\nn representing small and medium-\nsized businesses in the UK.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n3. \nOur response focuses on your request for evidence on the Government’s new approach to Tax Policy Making, and in particular \nI would like to draw your attention to the Tax Impact Assessment process. The FSB published a report in 2012 which considered the wor\nk of the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC) and\n regulatory reform\n. The FSB supports the work of the RPC as we believe that it ensures that there is transparency and independent scrutiny within regulatory development. \n&#xa0;\n4. \nThere is an argument that tax compl\niance is very different to regulation and therefore tax needs to be kept outside of the RPC process. This is an argument that the FSB disagrees with. For business, tax administration is a compliance \nburde\nn in the same way as regulation\n and our surveys show that in fact tax compliance ranks above regulation in terms of compliance burdens\n. While tax decisions themselves should be kept outside of the RPC process – the level and type of tax – we believe that any decision relating to tax adm\ninistration and the process of collecting tax should be subject to external scrutiny. \nWe also understand that there will be instances where exemptions to this rule might be necessary. \n&#xa0;\n5. \nWhile the FSB recognises the important role that the Administrative\n Burden Advisory Board plays in investigating specific issues, and undertaking inquiries it does not undertake an independent, external scrutiny process of all tax impact assessments, in the way the RPC could. This is a specific process which requires a sy\nstematic approach to all impact assessments and results in a formal opinion o\nn\n the quality of the impact assessment which is accessible to all.\n&#xa0;\n6\n. \nThere are two key changes that could be made. Firstly, all tax impact assessments should be subjected to ind\nependent scrutiny at both consultation and final stage by a body external to HMRC – as is the case for all other Government departments. We believe that this should be done by the RPC. They would have the expertise to be able to fully scrutinise the impact\n \nassessment and understand how businesses will implement the change. The opinion of this body should be made public at the end of the process. \n&#xa0;\n7\n. \nSecondly \nwe suggest that \nthere are aspects of a regulatory impact assessment that could be included in a\nll\n t\nax impact assessment in a more significant way. These sections are: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n. \nMany of these aspects will be included in the consultation document but not in the tax impact assessment. We believe that this infor\nmation could ensure that all tax policy changes are fully thought through and scrutinised. In the long-term these suggested changes could mean that reviews such as that which the \nOffice of Tax simplification (\nOTS\n)\n has undertaken would not be necessary. Get\nting tax policy right fr\nom the outset is the next step.\n&#xa0;\n9\n. \nFinally the FSB would like Government to consider bringing tax administration into scope of the Regulatory budget system ‘One-in Two-out’. Businesses regard tax administration as an area of ‘red t\nape’.  To deliver tangible reductions to the compliance burdens that businesses face, \nand to encourage simplification of the tax system that we all desire, \nGovernment should introduce discipline to the development of tax systems by subjecting changes to a \ntight budget. \n&#xa0;\nI hope that these comments are helpful.\n \n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
