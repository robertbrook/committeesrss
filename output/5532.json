As you have previously been informed, I shall be attending in person at 3.30pm on 5 February to give \noral\n evidence on behalf of KPMG.\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is our understanding that the changes proposed in \nFinance Bill 2014 have arisen for two reasons:\n■\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe significant difference in tax rates between companies (20% from 1 April 2015) and individuals (45% for additional rate taxpayers plus National Insurance \nC\nontributions (NIC) where appropriate\n) has caused \nsome LLPs to distribute profits to\n corporate members\n owned by \nindividual \nmembers rather than to \nindividual \nmembers themselves; and\n■\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe different NIC treatment bet\nween self employed individuals, including partners in a partnership,\n and employees\n \nrelate\nd\n to \nemployers\n’\n contribution\ns of 13.8%\n has caused some LLPs to appoint individuals as members who HMRC believe should more properly be taxed as employees.\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nstated \npolicy objective is to prevent th\ne\n avoidance described above\n and we have been advised by HMRC \nt\nhat it is not intended to impact upon the taxation of \ngenuine \nequity partners.\n \nWe support the policy objective.  We have also been advised that the approach taken in drafting the legislation has been to base it on case law principles with the intention of \ncreating a relatively straightforward, forward looking test which can be applied year on year.  \nWe support this approach and believe that the three factors used in the draft legislation of profit sharing, management and capital are, on balance, those most \nprominently featured in previous case law. \n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever,\n as currently drafted we do not believe that the legislation achieves its aim.  It is too vague and is not capable of being interpreted without the use of the supporting guidance.  The guidance itself exp\nands rather than merely clarifies the scope of the legislation.  This is bad law and we believe that it will result in the \nlegislation hav\ning\n far wider scope than its st\nated intent\n.  In effect \nit does have the capacity to impact \nsignificant numbers of genu\nine\n equity partners\n. \n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The individuals from HMRC who have been tasked with this job appear to welcome \ninput and to be willing to make amendments where they will improve both the legislation and the guidance.  However, we believe that the current proposed t\nimetable of an effective date of 6 April 2014 means that insufficient changes will be feasible and that only solution is to defer the introduction of the legislation, ideally until Finance Bill 2015, while this further work is carried out.\nI set out our co\nncerns in more detail below.\nLegislation6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n \ndraft legislation is \nvery broadly drafted and has few defined\n terms.  \nFor \nexample\n \n,a\n key phrase upon which much of the discussion lies is the phrase “substantially wholly”\n in s863B(1)(b)\n.  This is not defined in\n the legislation but is stated unequivocally in the guidance to mean 80%.  \n In addition, \nduring discussions, HMRC have clarified that a factor which will determine whether condition A applies or not (\ns863B(\n1)-(3)) is whether an individual is paid in priori\nty to his fellow members.  This is not mentioned in the legislation but could be included relatively easily\n.\n \n7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legislation includes a capital test (Condition C).  Broadly a member requires capital in excess of 25% of any disguised remuneration in order to fail the condition and avoid becoming a salaried member.  We believe that the level of capital required in \nthis test discriminates unfairly against non capital-intensive businesses and those firms which manage cash flow efficiently.  There is a risk that including this test will drive firms to adopt uncommercial behaviour\n as it may encourage firms to require me\nmbers to inject capital, notwithstanding that this may not be needed by the business.  \n8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n capital\n test also only allows \nformal \ncapital to be included in the calculation. We disagree that only fixed capital is relevant. Large amounts of funding for workin\ng capital and investment come not from capital subscriptions made by partners, but from the retention of internally generated funds otherwise payable to partners, such that at any point in time the total investment by the partner group significantly exceed\ns the formal capital which they inject. This deferral of payment is a feature which distinguishes partners from employees (employees would expect to receive the vast majority of their remuneration during the year rather than after the year-end).  For examp\nle, the Statement of Financial Position at page 48 of KPMG’s Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 shows that while the formal capital contributed by members was £50m, the total members’ interests were £354m.  \nThe balance of £304m represents t\nhe net of unallocated or undrawn profits.  We believe that any capital test should allow all of these interests to be classed as capital.\n \n9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe legislation is drafted by reference to tax years.  The tax basis period for LLPs is the accounting period.  This \nis also the period for which many LLPs agree member remuneration structures and capital.  We believe that the legislation will be easier to apply for both taxpayers and HMRC if it were redrafted by reference to accounting periods and therefore recommend th\nat this is done.\n10\n \nSome firms\n,\n including KPMG\n,\n award retiring partners fixed profit shares or priority payments in their final year of membership or agree the profits of that final year at the time of retirement rather than following the end of the year when\n profits are known. \n While in some instances it will be the case that no further services will be performed by the member following the agreement (see \ns862B(\n1)(a)), this is not always the case as a notice period may be worked.    The current legislation\n wi\nll \ntherefore \ngive rise to the anomalous situation that individuals may be genuine equity partners and taxed as such for many years, but that they are taxed as employees in their final year of membership.  We strongly recommend an exemption from the provisi\nons for anyone in their final 12 months of membership provided they have not been a salaried member in any of the previous three (say) years.\n11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe introduction of specific rules taxing individual members on profits allocated to a non individual member of a \npartnership\n is anticipated to \ncause difficulties for many mixed partnerships because the legislation\n \nis \nintentionally \naimed at taxing commercial \narrangements, as well as structures specifically designed for tax avoidance.  Examples of commercial arrangemen\nts caught by the new rules include allocations of profits to corporates for working capital purposes, investments, or deferred profit arrangements.\n12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, the legislation has been drafted with anti-avoidance mainly in mind, as the legislation requires th\ne taxpayer to consider whether it would be reasonable to conclude that the reason some or all of the excess profits have been allocated to the corporate is attributable to the relationship between the corporate and the individual member.  Then, only a just\n and reasonable \nallocation of the excess profits is taxable on the individual member.\n13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis style of drafting is appropriate for tax avoidance legislation, where a degree of flexibility is required.  However, where the legislation has a purpose of raising additional tax from commercial arrangements it is not appropriate to have such subjecti\nve tests.  Such subjective concepts give rise to a high level of uncertainty as to how the legislation applies to a commercial situation.  \nWe believe that these should be removed as they do not make good legislation.\n14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary we believe that, while the a\npproach taken is drafting the legislation has the potential to achi\ne\nve clarity and restrict application to the stated policy group, it does not do so as currently drafted.\nGuidance&#xa0;\n15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe guidance supporting the draft legislation is 56 \npages\n long.  While we\n welcome the principle of HMRC issuing guidance (and acknowledge that we would have raised concerns about lack of clarity if none had been issued) we do not believe that the guidance as currently drafted performs its correct \npurpose\n.  This should be to cla\nrify the legislation rather than to extend it.\n  As the guidance is not regulated by Parliament there is a risk of interpretation by HMRC which is not in accordance with Parliament’s wish.\n16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite its length the guidance itself does not clarify certain key \npoints.  We have submitted several additional examples and questions to HMRC in an attempt to obtain certainty on our own position and that of many of our clients.  We attach as \nan \nappendi\nx\n \na \ncop\ny\n of\n some\n additional examples \nwe have \nsubmitted \nto HMRC to da\nte.\n  We do not believe that the\n \nguidance take\ns\n account of the wide variety of different commercial arrangements many firms have agreed within their partner group.\n  In addition, the guidance does not cover any of the practical issues which will arise for LLPs in applying the new legislation such as the amounts upon which PAYE and NIC must be paid or the interaction with for example the overlap rules for members who \nare now treated as salaried members.\n17\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe believe that, once changes and improvements have been made to the legislation, the guidance should be rewritten to reflect the revised legislation, taking account of a far wider range of commercial arrangements.\nTiming18\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the consultation in the summer\n of 2013\n HMRC initially proposed that there should be a series of tests based on the case\n law definition of an employee b\nut\n,\n following representations, the test published on 10 December solely looks at three factors\n, pro\nfit sharing, management and capital.\n \nW\ne are pleased that \nsome \nrepresentations have been listened to\n and agree that the three factors selected do represent the most appropriate elements of existing case\n law\n. However, \nt\nhe introduction of these new tests\n with\nout an extension of the timetable for \nintroduction \n allows\n insufficient time for further consultation to be carried out, necessary amendments to be made to improve the application of the legislation and for taxpayers to understand and act on the implicatio\nns.\n \nT\nhe new rules\n were published on 10 December 2013 and\n are due to be effective from 6 April 2014\n although the legislation will not become law until Royal Assent in July 2014.  \nWe understand that following the current consultation process which ends on 4 \nFebruary, revised legislation or guidance\n will be issued by mid-February.  We do not consider that this will provide HMRC with long enough to consider the various representations being made. If revisions are delayed until \nthe time of the budget on 19 March\n there will be \nless than three\n weeks before\n the legislation will become effective\n.\n \n19\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis timing is unsatisfactory for two reasons.  The first is that it is retrospective\n both because i\nt applies from a date before it is fully enacted\n but also because it app\nlies to arrangements already in place before it will be enacted (or, in some cases, published)\n.  The second is that HMRC are unable to provide clearances for firms until after Royal Assent \n(although HMRC \nhave agreed to provide informal guidance) \nmeaning th\nat firms will be required to operate the legislation with uncertainty. We believe that this places an unnecessary administrative burden on all LLPs, which would be substantially reduced if the legislation we\nre\n deferred\n.  \nWhile we understand the need for anti-avoidance legislation to be enacted quickly to prevent avoidance, this legislation goes far further than an anti-avoidance provision would normally go and affects many businesses who are not engaged in avoidance.  \nWe \nt\nherefore \nbelieve that any deferral should be to Finance Bill 2015 as this would allow su\nff\nicient time for further consultation, redrafting and clarification\n.\n              Conclusion \n20\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn summary therefore we believe that\n:\n■\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nsignificant further work needs to be done to re\nfine the legislative approach and draft focussed legislation which meets the policy objective (but does not go wider);\n■\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe \nnon-statutory guidance\n should be redrafted to ensure that it simply clarifies rather than extends the legislation; and\n■\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \ntime\n must be m\nade to do this by postponing the introduction of any legislation until these improvements are made. \n21\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nKPMG has found the individuals responsible for this legislation at HMRC (Richard Rogers and Brian Stokes) to be open and \nto welcome \ndiscuss\nions of\n \nour conc\nerns\n.  \n I would like to reaffirm our willingness to continue working with them and their colleagues to achieve this objective.\nYours faithfully\n&#xa0;\nJane McCormick\nPartner, Head of Tax \nand Pensions\nKPMG additional examples tranche 1 – Condition A                                                                AppendixExample 1a: basic exampleA, B and C are members of ABC LLP.  A is allocated 2 points and B and C are each allocated 4 points.  Regardless of the level of profit A will receive 20%, while B and C will receive 40% each.  \nAll three members receive no disguised \nremuneration,\n they each have a variable interest in the overall profits of the partnership.\nExample 1b: ‘benchmark’ and variable amountsA, B and C award themselves ’salaries’ of £20,000, £40,000 and £40,000 respectiv\nely and agree that the total profit will be shared in proportion to those salaries.\n If the overall profits of the partnership are more or less than £100,000 then each partner will share in the deficit or surplus in proportion to their agreed salary.  \nThis\n arrangement is in substance identical to example 1a: each partner has an interest in the profits of the partnership which is variable by reference to the overall profits of the partnership.  It is not relevant that the partnership has chosen to describe t\nhis arrangement by reference to a salary.\nExample 1c: guaranteed amountsContinuing example 1b, individual D joins the LLP.  He is also awarded a ‘salary’.  His total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the sa\nme way as A, B and C but in his first year he is guaranteed a total profit share of no less than £30,000.  If his allocated share of the profits is less than this it will be borne by the other members; D will receive his profit share in priority to A, B an\nd C.\nD’s guaranteed profit share of £30,000 is disguised salary as it is fixed.  Accordingly, unless it is reasonable to expect that ultimately D’s share for the period will exceed £37,500, such that his overall return is not substantially wholly fixed, he\n will meet Condition A.\nExample 1d: capped variable interestsE joins the LLP described in 1b above. \nLike D, s\nhe is awarded a \n‘\nsalary\n’\n. Her total profit share will be calculated as a proportion of the total profits of ABC LLP in the same way as A, B and C \nbut her total profit share cannot exceed £25,000.  \nAs E is sharing directly in the overall profits of the partnership up to a certain point and her profit share is not paid in priority to the other members she will not meet Condition A unless, in practice\n, the overall profits of the partnership are expected to be such that she will \nrealistically \nalways receive £25,000\n.  If this were so, it would imply that her total received was not in practice a variable share of total profit equal to her ‘salary’ as a fr\naction of all salaries, but was simply a fixed sum meeting Condition A.\nExample 1e: businesses with stable or reliable profitsSame as example 1b above, but the profit forecast is reliable or the nature of the business is such that profits are not signific\nantly variable from year to year such that it is unlikely that profits will be materially greater or less than £100,000.\nThe fact that the overall profits of the business may be accurately forecasted and/or are stable from year to year does not mean that C\nondition A is necessarily met: each of the partners has an interest in the partnership which will vary with the overall profits of the partnership, even if those overall profits are predictable or are not significantly variable.\nExample 1f: timing differences between cash and profitFacts as \n1b above\n.\n However\n, \nthe ‘salaries’ are distributed in-year.  It is agreed that to the extent there are insufficient \nprofits,\n excess\n drawings will only be \nsatisfied \nout of future profits of the firm\n (meaning the drawings \nin the following years would be less than the affected members’ profit allocations)\n. \nThe distribution to members of drawings representing advances against allocations \nof  profit\n share does not of itself change the position from that in 1b.\nExample 2: discretionary awardsPlease see attached marked-up versions of Examples 1A and 14 from HMRC’s 10 December Guidance.\nExample 3a: sharing in divisional profits onlyAB LLP has four members \nA\n, B, C and D.  A and B work in division X and C and D work in division \nY.  Division X generates profits of £10\n,000\n and Y of £90\n,000\n.  \nThe LLP deed provides that\n A and B will share the profits of division X and that C and D will share the profits of division Y.  \nAll four members meet condition A as none of them receive a shar\ne of the overall profits of the firm.\nExample 3b: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (i)The facts are the same as example \n3\na except that \nthe LLP deed provides that profit allocation is at the discretion of the \nmembers.  T\nhe four members \nmeet and, as per their terms of reference, they consider a range of factors including the financial performance of each division, the need for the divisions to work together and support each other, and the overall strategic direc\ntion of the firm. They \nagree\n \nthat A and B will share profits of £\n15,000\n, leaving C and D to share £\n85,000\n.\nAssuming the members have properly exercised their discretion under terms of reference based on more than just divisional profit sharing, they will n\not meet condition A as their profit shares are each partly dependent on the overall profits of the whole firm.\nExample 3c: whole firm profits shared on discretionary basis between members of divisions (ii)The \nfacts are the same as example 3b\n except that\n t\nhe \nfour members agree\n \nthat A and B will share profits of £\n1\n0\n,000 while \nC and D \nwill\n share £\n9\n0\n,000\n.\nThe four members will not meet condition A as their profit shares are still partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm,\n \nnotwithstanding that \nthe resulting shares are the same as if profits were shared on a purely divisional basis.\nExample 3d: part divisional, part pro-rata splitThe facts the same as above example 3a except that the four members agree in advance that half of each division’s pro\nfits will be split between the partners in that division, and half will be pooled and split equally between all the partners. Using the example above, A and B are therefore allocated £17.50. C and D are allocated £32.50.\nWe see two possible interpretations\n of the legislation, either:\nThe four members will now not meet condition A as their profit shares are partly dependent on the overall profits of the entire firm.\nOr:\nThe firm’s total profit should be treated as two amounts.  The first, \ndivision\nally alloca\nted amount then meets Condition A while the second, \nequally split \namount does not.  The relative proportions of the two amounts for a member will determine whether that member meets Condition A.\nExample 4a: bonus pool for high performersA is a member of \nXY LLP. A receives a fixed share of £90,000\n the terms of which result in it being considered to be disguised salary\n. XY sets aside a proportion of profits each year as a \nbonus pool to reward high performing members.  Whilst the \noverall \npool will vary with \nprofits, the \nshare of that pool \nallocat\ned\n to \nan \nindividual member will depend on their individual personal performance.  All members are eligible to receive a share of this profit pool and A typically receives a bonus ranging from £25,000 to £35,000 each y\near. \nA will \nnot meet\n condition A as less than 80% of her expected profit share is fixed.  \nExample 4b: infrequent bonusesThe same conditions as in 3a but \nA\n only occasionally receives a bonus allocation.\nA will meet condition A as her expected profit shar\ne is just her fixed share.\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n"
