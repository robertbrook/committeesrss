"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by RenewableUK&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRenewableUK welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence \nto the Environmental Audit Committee with regards to\n Marine Conservation Zones. \n&#xa0;\nRenewableUK is the trade and professional body for the UK wind and marine renewables industries. Formed in 1978, and with over 650 company members, RenewableUK is the leading renewable energy trade association in the UK. Wind has been the world's fastest growing renewable energy source for the last seven years, and this trend is expected to continue with falling costs of wind energy and the urgent international need to tackle CO\n2\n emissions to prevent climate change.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRenewableUK\n supports the development of a network of ecologically coherent Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)\n, and \nendeavours\n to positively contribute to the achievement of this objective. The offshore renewables industry is gaining an increasing understanding of the impacts of its activities in the marine environment and has\n \nplayed a constructive role in the designate Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), providing data and information to the bodies involved in the process and in some cases contributing to working groups with the aim of developing management measures collaboratively with the relevant statutory nature conservation bodies. \n&#xa0;\nWe believe that further refinement and improvement of the designation process for MCZs could help meet both conservation and industry development objectives. If we are to fulfill Government policies on economic growth and sustainable development whilst meeting the objective of creating a network of ecological coherent MCZs, it is important that efforts are made to address the following key areas which have \ncharacterised\n the process to date.\n&#xa0;\nRenewableUK asks that the following aspects are taken into account before the next tranche of MCZs sites is considered for designation:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRenewableUK continues to be supportive of the objective to create \na network of ecologically coherent Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)\n, considering its fulfillment as a key element to combine conservation objectives and the definition of a clearer context for the development of offshore renewables. We are sure that DEFRA and regulators share the same vision and therefore wish that our suggestions are taken into account in the interest of all parties.\n&#xa0;\nPlease note, we understand this inquiry to be focused on Marine Conservation Zones as designated under the Mar\nine and Coastal Access Act 2009. W\ne have therefore made no comment on the separate and distinct process for designation and management of marine protected areas under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010.\n&#xa0;\n23 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
