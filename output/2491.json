SummaryWomen’s Aid in Scotland supports t\nhousands of women and children \nevery year\n, \nwith \nover 500 women \na week making contact with Women’s Aid for the first time for support, refuge accommodation, information or advice. Vulnerable women and children\n \nacross Scotland face growing difficulties acces\nsing and sustaining the support and hosing they need due to the cumulative impact of welfare reform. Our members are reporting concerns about the following aspects of welfare reform which particularly impact upon women and children \ntrying to escape\n domesti\nc abuse:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3. 0 The Impact of changes to the way costs for housing are dealt with under welfare reform3.1 \nScottish \nWomen’s Aid welcomed the an\nnouncement by Ministers to the C\nommittee in September 2012 that ‘exempt accommodation’ would be dealt with outside of Universal Credit and\n would be\n part of a localised system in the longer term\n. \n3.2 \nHowever, n\not\n all supported accommodation qualifies as ‘supported exempt accommodation’ (SEA). The definition of SEA, excludes supported accommodation owned by a local authority. It also only applies if s\nupport is provided on behalf of the landlord, current commissioning practice is for local authorities (as funders) to procure support services directly from the support provider, the landlord (an RSL) is not\n normally \ninvolved in this process.\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nIn April 2013, Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform, wrote to \nScottish \nWomen’s Aid stating that the Government intends to protect supported housing such as refuge accommodation from Universal Credit changes and will be developing solutions to this. \nWhi\nle we welcome this decision we are still awaiting details \nof\n the interim solution, \nwhich is likely to include a \nrevision of the SEA definition\n,\n \nbut\n remain\n apprehensive\n that a revised definition will continue to exclude local authority owned supported accom\nmodation.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n In the \nlonger term \nthe \nlikelihood \nis \nthat a new system will devolve funding to the Scottish Government.\n We are concerned about the impact of this on the future financial stability of refuge accommodation:\ncurrent cost\ns\n of supported housing.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n5\n \nIn Scotland a\nlmost a third of refuge accommodation \nis owned by local authorities and does not qualify as exempt. \nThe majority of local authorities have continued to exempt this accommodation from the under occupation \ncharge for this financial year\n,\n while \nthey await\n the outcome of the DWP’s consultation on housing benefit and supported accommodation. \nIn some areas, h\no\nwever\n,\n there has\n already\n be\nen an impact on refuge services, for example;\n3.6\n The \n‘bedroom tax’ is severely limiting the options for women moving on from refuge due to the lack of availability of one bedroom accommodation. In one area women in \nrefuge have been told that the waiting list for one bedroom properties is 3 years. \nThe delay i\nn women moving on from refuge means services struggle to accommodate women and children at the point of crisis.  Many Women’s Aid services report having to operate waiting lists and this inability to offer safe accommodation when it is needed\n greatly\n incre\nases the risk to women and children.\n3.7 \nRefuge services in Scotland are already unable to meet demand; our annual census day survey found that \n2 out of 3 women were unable to get a refuge space for themselves and their children because of the lack of safe\n or suitable space\n. \nWhere women are not able to access refuge accommodation for themselves of their children when they need to they may be at risk of returning t\no abusive partners or forced to\n accept unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation through a lo\ncal authority which no longer has access to appropriate temporary self-contained accommodation.\n3.8\n \nWe are\n \nvery \nconcerned that women may be prevented from leaving an abusive partner because they fear they will be unable to pay for alternative accommodation\n. \nIn one area a\n Women’s Aid service has reported \na woma\nn returning to \nher\n abusive partner after being offered \na two bedroom flat\n by the local authority\n, as she feared not being able to pay \nthe ‘bedroom tax’\n and getting into debt\n.\n \n4.0 Pressure on Women’s Aid services as a result of welfare reforms 4\n.1 \nWomen’s Aid \nservices in Scotland \nare reporting women presenting for support with\n increasingly complex problems, \nrequiring support to deal with \nonline \nbenefit claims, appeals\n, sanctions, d\nebt\n and housing issues arising from the \n‘bedroom tax’\n.\n \nOur members\n reported a 70% increase in demand for their services in the last year\n;\n that they are struggling to meet. We are concerned that the essential support services Women’s Aid provides to help women and children recover and rebuild their lives is being diverted into responding to urgent welfare benefit issues resulting from recent\n reforms.\nIt is essential that \nalongside the introduction of sweeping changes to the welfare benefits system the Government provides sufficient and accessible advice services\n to respond to the needs of vulnerable people affected by these reforms. At presen\nt it is the severely overstretched voluntary sector that is being relied on to meet that need.\n5.0 Increased poverty 5.1 \nWomen’s Aid workers are working with an increasing number of w\nomen c\noming to them who have no money;\n this is due to \nthe length of time\n claims are taking to process, \nESA appeals and \nbenefit sanctions\n. These sanctions are at times the result\n \nof\n DWP st\naff being \nun\naware of the JSA D\nomestic Violence Easement\n, which exempts victims of domestic abuse f\nro\nm job seeking conditions and requirements\n for up to 13 weeks.  Recent research by the DWP found low levels of awareness or promotion of the \nexemption \nin Job Centre offices.\n \nWhere possible Women’s Aid services will provide small \nemergency \nloans \nbut have very limited resources to do this with and \nare aware that these are unlikely to be \nrecovered. \nWe are \nalso \naware that women in these situations are being increasingly advised to go to food banks, in rural areas of Scotland many women lack the means to travel to food banks\n.\nWomen experiencing domestic abuse face considerable barriers in trying to leave an abusive partner, access to refuge at the point they make that decision is crucial, as is the possibility of finding and \naffording a home at a future date. The current reform\ns to the benefits system are impacting adversely on women’s ability to access refuge and move onto to rebuild their lives.\nScottish Women’s Aid is continuing to call on the Government to ensure that\n all\n refuge services are \ntreated as \nexempt \nsupported accom\nmodation.\n27 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.scottishwomensaid.org.uk/sites/default/files/SWA%20Census%20Leaflet%202012%20v2.pdf\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/208123/rrep843.pdf\n"
