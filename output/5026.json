"&#xa0;\n11\nth\n January 2014\nThe British Veterinary Zoological Society (BVZS) submission1. Introduction1.1&#xa0; \nThe British Veterinary Zoological Society (BVZS) is the specialist division of the British Veterinary \nAssociation (BVA) and has over 400 active members. The membership includes registered veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses working with exotic species at all levels, from those in general practice providing a service for herpetologists, aviculturists,\n aquarists and the owners of exotic pets including primates, to those working in animal sanctuari\nes, wildlife parks\n, bird gardens, zoos and aquaria, and with free living wild animals. \n&#xa0;\n1.2&#xa0; \nAn aim of the Society is\n to promot\ne the advancement of knowledge \nin the maintenance of the health and welfare of non-domesticated animals \nto the veterinary profession and \nto \nexotic pet owners\n, so \nwould appear\n well placed to provide a submission to the Committee\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.3&#xa0; \nThis response \nh\nas \nbeen prepared following a full consult\nation with the BVZS membership\n,\n including a debate on the\n subject of keeping \nprimates as pets held at the BVZS spring conference held in Cambridge in 2013\n. The Society has also consulted with the British Veterinary Association (BVA).\n&#xa0;\n2. BVZS Observations2.1 \nPrimates are not kept commonly as pets in the UK although the remov\nal of several species from the S\nchedule of animals requiring a Dangerous Wild Animal licence in 2007 appears to have led to an increase in popularity in keeping captive primates. \n2.2 \nThe husbandry requirements for primate groups are complex requiring large enclosures to prevent hierarchical stress and need to be constructed robustly. In addition, most primate species have such specialised UV-B, temperature, humidity, lighting, behaviou\nr and dietary requirements to be taken into account that BVZS consider\ns\n it is extremely difficult to fulfil their basic welfare needs, as specified in the Animal Welfare Act 2006, if kept as pets. \n2.3 The majority of the \nclinical \nconditions in all primate\ns presented to veterinary practices in the UK are associated with a failure by the owner to meet basic husbandry requirements.\n2.4 \nPrimates are \nextremely \nintelligent and social animals\n. T\nhe BVZS \ntherefore \ndo\nes\n not consider any \nprimate \nspecies to be su\nitable to be kept as\n solitary\n (singleton)\n \npets\n as their basic welfare needs cannot \npossibly \nbe met\n,\n due to a fundamental requirement for\n the\n company of \nconspecifics\n.\n2.5 Nevertheless, the BVZS recognises that there are individuals in the UK who maintain sm\nall privately owned collections of primates, not subject to inspection under the Zoo Licensing Act, \nbut \nthat meet the specialised requirements of the species. These animals are not kept as pets per se\n,\n but maintained \nin \ncollections\n \nusually \nfor conservation\n or educational\n reasons\n.\n2.6 The definition of a \n‘\npet\n’ \nis \ntypically\n accepted as \nthe keeping of an animal as a companion to a pe\nrson. Although the BVZS agree a\n \nsolitary \nprimate is not suitable as a c\nompanion to a human\n, the definition of \n‘\npet\n’\n can also be i\nnterpreted as an animal that is kept for the \nemotional benefit of a human. If a primate was kept appropriately in a collection, it could therefore still be consider as a ‘p\net’ under \nthis sense of the word, \nso BVZS believes great care\n is required in draftin\ng any legislation\n in order to avoid inadvertently effecting stakeholders maintaining primate collections\n under the terms\n outlined in\n paragraph\n \n2.5.  \n2.7 \nG\niven the recent evolution of European policy towards lists of exotic species with potential to be kept as pets or traded following an evidence-based risk assessment, BVZS considers there is considerable merit in keeping primate species within this overall \nregulatory \nframework\n,\n to ensure a consistent \nevidence-\nbased \napproach, \nto \nreduce duplication of\n \ncost\ns in \ncreating \nseparate \nlegislation\n and to avoid margi\nnalising particular stakeholder groups\n.\n3 Summary of BVZS position3.1 \nBVZS acknowledge there should be \nregulation preventing the keeping of primates \nas \nsolitary (singleton) \npets, but proposes there should be dispensation for stakeholders to be able to keep \ngroups\n of pr\nimates\n, assuming their welfare needs are entirely satisfied, \nperhaps \neither \nin partnership\n w\nith an \naccredited \nBIAZA \nzoo \nfacility\n,\n or \nalternatively \nregulated through an inspection and licensing process\n \nthat gives consideration to appropriate private\nly owned\n or charitable p\nrimate rescue, rehabilitation and \nbreeding facilities that form part of \nrecognised, global conservation efforts\n. \nThe Society considers \ngreat \ncare is required drafting any new legislation particularly in defining\n the term\n ‘pet’ and believes there are \nsignificant \nbenefits \nprovided by \nincluding primates within the framework of E\nuropean policy \npresently evolving regarding\n exotic pet \nspecies\n,\n \nwhich would be expected to be evidence-based, \nrather than creating separate regulation for one taxonomic group.\n \nIn addition, if ther\ne is to be an outright \nban on privately owned primates\n eith\ner in Europe or the UK\n,\n \nBVZS believes it is important\n \nconsideration is\n given to the difficulty privately owned collections would face disposing of their animals.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
