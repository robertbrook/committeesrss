[[[Bernard Hewood – Written evidence]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I have lived in Sheffield for almost thirty five years and during this time I have walked extensively in the Peak District, the surrounding areas and on several long distance routes.  As well as walking for my own pleasure, I have been qualified as a hill walking leader, and a Duke of Edinburgh Award Expedition (DoE) trainer and assessor, working to develop expedition and countryside navigation skills, and cultivate an appreciation in secondary age pupils of the need to value and protect the countryside.&#xa0;In my experience it has unfortunately become evident that, increasing off road car and motorcycle use, exploiting archaic 'horse and cart' laws to justify access, is causing increasingly, severe and costly damage to countryside tracks and pathways. Noise, exhaust pollution, visual intrusion, degradation of the natural environment and physical damage, all caused by off-roading vehicles, conflict directly with the purposes of our  National Parks, designated areas of natural beauty, sites of historic or cultural interest, Sites of Special Scientific interest (SSSI's) and ideas of protecting  and respecting the countryside.  Often the scale of physical damage caused by off-roading vehicles  is entirely disproportionate,  in that a relatively a small number of off- roading  4 x 4's or motorcycles can cause  damage to tracks or paths that prevents  or degrades use by others, is costly to repair and is likely to require levels of maintenance that cannot be  sustained in the long term by the responsible  local or national park authorities.&#xa0;The Deregulation Bill could be an opportunity to reduce the problems and damage caused by inappropriate vehicle use in the countryside and help to reduce conflict between those who wish to use the countryside as an obstacle course to test driving skills by off-roading with cars and motor bikes and the majority, who according to a survey by the Peak District National Park Authority, visit  and value the countryside for its quiet and tranquillity .&#xa0;Classifying green lanes and Byways Open to all Traffic  (BOATS) as Restricted Byways, would greatly simplify the current system, reduce red tape and introduce a more realistic frame for regulation than the present use of  'historic  horse and cart use' that is used at the present as a yardstick to determine the suitability of routes for off-road use by vehicles they were never intended for. I would hope that the Parliamentary Committee advising on the Deregulation Bill would see the potential  for positive use of the Bill and advise accordingly to protect our heritage and countryside.&#xa0;September 20132 of 1&#xa0;
