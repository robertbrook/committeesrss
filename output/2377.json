"&#xa0;\nKiki Angelrath – Written evidence&#xa0;&#xa0;Deregulation Bill - Green Lanes - BOATs and UCRs&#xa0;\nI am writing in support of the petition that  BOATs and UCRs be re-classified as Restricted Byways having rights of way for pedestrians, horses and horse drawn vehicles, cycles and farm/access vehicles  but NOT FOR RECREATIONAL MOTORS.\n&#xa0;\nI also support the proposal that when a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or magistrate.\n&#xa0;\nI have supported the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance since its inception  as I abhor the damage done by large numbers of pleasure  vehicles roaring along unmetalled tracks/roads and the disturbance such activity does to the peace of the wonderful countryside, as well as the health and safety issues posed to walkers, cyclists and those on horseback and the inconvenience to farmers.\n&#xa0;\nI live on a farm within the boundaries of the Norfolk Broads and also spend time walking in the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Parks.\n&#xa0;\nPlease add my name in support of the two proposals/petitions. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThese proposals/petitions also supported by Kurt Angelrath, Member Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n2\n of \n1\n&#xa0;\n"
