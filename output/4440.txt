&#xa0;&#xa0;Lumos is an international NGO working to end the institutionalisation of children around the world. We work to transform education, health and social care systems for children and their families and help children move from institutions to family-based care.  We are a founding member of the UNICEF Global Partnership for Children with Disabilities in Development.&#xa0; www.wearelumos.orgThis response is intended to highlight the impact of the systematic institutionalisation of children with disabilities around the world.  It illustrates the need for DFID and other donors to adopt an approach which is consistent both with the UK’s international human rights commitments and with international good practice in the provision of and transition to community and family based care for children with disabilities.   This Inquiry is a timely opportunity to ensure that the current process to replace the Millennium Development Goals puts in place specific mechanisms for the protection of societies’ most vulnerable children: those with disabilities and living in institutional care. Whilst much of the evidence and research we refer to comes from the European Region, the issues raised are common to children everywhere.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in some form of institutionalised residential care.  Research from across the world has demonstrated the significant harm caused to children by such institutionalisation.   The harmful effects include: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Any post-2015 framework should include mechanisms to promote and ensure that the above approaches are prioritised.  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(13)70056-1/fulltexthttp://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/err9_full.pdf&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; Registered in England and Wales as a company limited by guarantee, number  5611912 and as a charity, number 1112575.“Deinstitutionalisation – A Human Rights Priority for Children with Disabilities”.
