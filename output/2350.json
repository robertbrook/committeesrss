There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject t\no English law is entitled to its protection.”\n \n See paragraph 2.14. \n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/14/yarls-wood-immigrant-sex-abuse-tanja\n. \n \nMartha \nSpurrier\n \nof the Public Law Project, note at \nhttp://legalaidchanges.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/martha-spurrier-exc\neptional-funding-does-not-protect-access-to-justice/\n. \n This paper may be found here: \nhttp://www.nrpfnetwork.org.uk/policy/Pages/default.aspx\n. The summary is also on the legalaidch\nanges.wordpress.com site.\n What is now the LAA. See the \nLSC \nAnnual Report\n 2011-12. A legal aid certificate represents a grant of full legal aid funding.\n Legal aid for preliminary advice and assistance, usually administered on a low fixed fee. \n See \nWri\nght v Michael Wright Supplies Ltd \n[2013] EWCA \nCiv\n 234 \nper \nLord Justice Ward at [2]. \n&#xa0;\n Consultation response, Annex F, paragraph 4.8.\n See paragraph 214 of the consultation response.\n Judicial review will remain possible, in prisoner cases, although there are serious doubts around how those will arise if solicitors are not able to act at the earlier stages, or are no longer doing prison work as a result of the 17.5.% rate cut.\n Parole\n Board \nAnnual Report and Accounts \n2011/12.\n Based on the assumption that all lifers would be in the cheapest accommodation (open conditions), which costs £25,106 a year (see \nCosts per place and costs per prisoner \n(MOJ Oct 2012)), and IPPs would be either \nin open or in Cat C. It may be said that a three month delay overstates it. The present author’s experience is that it is conservative, but more importantly, this figure has been seen and agreed by the Parole Board. At the same time, this figure gives no a\nccount of young and elderly prisoners, who may be delayed longer, and whose incarceration is much more expensive (a place for a child in a secure training establishment, for example, costs up to £215,000 a year. A Young Offender Institution place is £60,00\n0 a year. There are at least 1,000 children in prison at any one time). Nor does the figure take account a further Parole Board concern, which is that it needs specialist solicitors to persuade prisoners not to make applications for parole when such applic\nations are bound to fail. Factoring in these figures would drive the £3.45m figure up, perhaps significantly. \n MOJ figures, ibid. \n Annex B to the consultation response, paragraph 10. \n Which also undermines years of progress on promoting alternatives \nto litigation.\n \nJudicial Review – proposals for further reform, \nparagraph 119.\n See the impact assessment accompanying the \nTransforming Legal Aid \npaper. \n Ibid, §31. \n Which means there is a success rate, on issued cases, of over 50%. \n Again, it is l\nikely that these are particularly susceptible to a change in incentives. Social welfare and education cases tend to settle early because they concern failures to assess and provide services and compromise can usually be found. At the moment, therefore, ver\ny few of these cases fight.  \n As the consultation paper accepts: §3.76.\n"
