"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence \nfrom Greater Manchester Police (CYS0039)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1. \n              \nIntroduction.\n&#xa0;\n1.1  \n              \nAs \nin \nmany cities \nGreater Manchester has some of the busiest roads in the country\n. The city\n is a major hub for commercial activity and \nhas \nbeen affected by \nthe national increase in road user traffic. Whilst it has an increase in \nits fair share of heavy goods veh\nic\nles and buses using these roads\n it does not contain the \namount of continuous \nstructural \ndevelopment that the capital is experiencing.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nIt is clear that Manchester does not have the motoring infrastructure which requires the constant monitoring from \nT\nfL\n to allow free flow of traffic and use of road users within the capital.\n&#xa0;\n1.\n3\n  \n              \nIt has become apparent that cycling as a mode of transport is on the increase as more road users \nare\n switching \nto pedal cycle\ns. This has been enhanced with the success of the British Cycling \nT\neam and \nas a more cost effective, sometimes quicker and greener way to comm\nute to work and places of \nstudy\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nGreater Manchester is the home of British Cycling and has excellent faciliti\nes within the \nVelodrome\n. The \nroad\ns are not, proportionately, as well developed\n.  \n              \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nN\national \nKSI \nstatistics \nidentify \nthat whilst\n overall\n numbers \nof KSI’s have decreased\n the \nproportion of \npedal cyclists KSI numbers\n has \nrisen\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nWithin Greater \nManchester t\nhe highest number of KSI figures in relation to pedal \ncyclists\n was the main \nA34, B5117 and A6010\n route from \nthe south west of Manchester\n to the city centre. This route \nis \nused by students using pedal power attending the University of \n              \nManchester and \ndaily commuters. This route \nincludes what is commonly known as ‘Curry Mile’ as the road is the centre of a plethora of late night eating houses \nused by all.\n  F\nrom January 2011 to August 2012 there were 43 \npedal \ncyclists’\n collisions\n \non this r\noad \n4 of which were serious\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n \n              \nI\nn order to reduce the number of collisions on the roads within Greater Manchester \nofficers above\n from Traffic Network Section developed an innovative approach named Operation \n‘\nGrimaldi\n’\n which underpins \nthe force\n road saf\nety initiative Operation \n‘\nDice\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nPhases\n&#xa0;\n2.\n \n1\n \n              \nThe\n first phase \ninvolves an educational interactive \n‘\nwalkthrough\n’\n \nexhibition containing an articulated tractor unit \nwith\n full sized curtain sided trailer and a bus.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe \nsecond is a period of targeted\n enforcement\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nT\nhe third being \nroad safety presentations with the offer of free\n cycle training.  \n&#xa0;\n3\n. \n              \nWalkthrough\n&#xa0;\n3\n.1  \n              \nInitially \nOperation ‘\nGrimaldi\n’ staff \n arrange a suitable place to\n hold an interactive walk through in specifically targeted areas\n such as town \ncentre’s\n or outside \nthe \nUniversity buildings. This involves \nvehicles from a \nlocal haulage \ncompany ‘\nFagan and \nWhalley\n’ \nand \n‘Stagecoach’ \nbus\n company\n,\n who also provide\n their respective \nsenior \ndriving trainers\n. \n&#xa0;\n3\n.2  \n              \nThe HGV \nunit and \narticulated \ntrailer \nis set at a slight angle as though \nthe driver / vehicle was \nturning\n left (the most common \nmanoeuvre\n \ninvolved in\n KSI’s)\n to highlight the blind \nspots\n.\n \nA member of the public then\n sits in the driver’s seat \nwhere \nt\nhe trainer \np\noint\ns\n out the \nblind spots \nand\n difficulties that \na \nHGV driver ha\ns\n especially when turning left\n. \n&#xa0;\n3\n.3\n              \nThis also \ndispels \nthe \nassumption \nthat they can see the drivers mirror so \nthe driver\n must be able to see them. \nTh\ne input \nalso includes what mirrors on the vehicle can ass\nist and that not all such vehicles have proximity mirrors.\n&#xa0;\n3\n.4\n              \nThe bus \ncompany also provides a senior \ntrainer\n who will also\n invite people to sit in the driving seat\n. The instructor then \nwalk\ns\n into the blind \nspots\n and ask\ns\n if he can be seen\n.\n \nWhilst the member of the public \nsitting in the driving seat will often shift position by leaning back or forward in an attempt to see the \ninstructor the \nfact that this is not practical whilst driving is pointed out by the trainer. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4\n. \n              \nEnforcement.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.1\n  \n              \nHighlighted \nlocations\n are carefully chosen and \na full risk assessment is undertaken.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.2 \n \n              \nOne \njunction \nin particular \nwas highlighted in the data as the centre of \ncollision\n              \nhotspot\ns\n for pedal cyclists\n. Observations at this junction by ‘\nGrimaldi\n’ staff revealed \n              \nthat there \nwere\n a\nlso a\n large number of near misses\n at this \nlocation\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.3  \n              \nThe\n \nmain \noffences \ncommitted are\n careless and inconsiderate cycling,\n failing to comply \nwith traffic signs\n, \ncycling\n with\n no lights fitted or illuminated and cycling on \nthe footpath\n.\n A \nsignificant\n number of collision\ns\n take place when a cyclist rides from the pavement into the road.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.4  \n              \nFailing to comply with traffic signs can be red lights or one way streets. Cycling with\n no lights fitted or illuminated is an offence, which can only\n be dealt with during the hours \nof darkness. Cycling on the footpath is dealt with on a common sense approach\n \ni.e.\n: busy footpaths in town centres. The previous three can be dealt with by way of a traffic \no\nffence report \nwhilst\n careless and inconsiderate cycling is a \nsummonsable\n offence and deemed more serious.\n The only offence a PCSO can enforce is cycling on the foot\npath all others have to be dealt with by a constable. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.5  \n              \nHaving chosen a suitable location \nthe team of officers / staff working together to deliver the operation\n observe\n \noffenders, be it\n \ncyclists or \n              \nother road users, the details are forwarded to ‘sto\nppers’ who directs offenders to a safe location to stop.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nThe offenders are \nspoken to by an officer. \nVehicular offences are processed in the usual manner whilst \nthe offending cyclist is issued\n with \na traffic offence report\n \n(\n£\n50\n fine). \n              \nAs an alternati\nve to the fine t\nhe cyclists are then given the opportunity to \nattend \na\n force\n cycle safety \npresentation\n \nand \ninformed \nupon conclusion of such \nthe fine will be rescinded.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.7\n  \n              \nThis \nmirrors the current driver improvement scheme and is a onetime offer\n and at this stage is free\n.  Cyclists are informed that if they commit a further offence this will result in a fine or court appearance. \n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n8\n  \n              \nIt is clear that if the ticket is\n not issued \ncyclists would not attend the\n safety \n              \npresentation\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n. \n              \nPresentat\nions.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.1 \n              \nThe presentations are held in \nthe \nlocal \nproximity to where\n the enfor\ncement has happened, usually at \ncommunity rooms in local Fire Stations.\n \nThis is \nled by \nGareth Walker\n \na member of the team and includes a\n \nsuitabl\ny\n \nqualified cycle trainer\n from \nTfGM\n.\n&#xa0;\n5\n.2  \n              \nThe \nintention of the \npresentation is to show \nthe v\nulnerabi\nlity of \ncyclists \nwhen using\n the \n              \nroad. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe views of the cyclists vary throughout and the lack of knowledge and understanding \nof road safety legislation \nis concerning\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n. \n  \n              \nFigures.\n&#xa0;\n6\n.1  \n              \nSince the operat\nion began nine months there ha\nve\n been\n \n17 \nenforcement days\n.\n \n              \nThis equates to approximately 51\n hours.\n&#xa0;\n6\n.2  \n              \nThe results are the results of cyclists\n that have been issued with traffic offence reports.\n              \n420 for failing to comply with traffic signs\n              \n107 for cycling with no lights fitted or illuminated\n              \n118 for cycling on the footpath\n \n              \n5 for\n \ncareless and inconsiderate cycling\n              \nIn total 650 cyclists.\n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n3  \n              \nOf those cyclists 474\n so far have attended a presentation and had their ticket rescinded.\n \n(\nThere is still one series of presentations to run so this figure will be higher\n)\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6\n.4 \n              \nOf those 650 cyclists 17\n have been stopped twice\n and now face prosecution\n.\n \n \n&#xa0;\n7\n              \nOther road users.\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nThe force \nhas\n produced a leaflet \nbased on ‘S\nharing the \nR\noad\n’\n in which it includes education for all road users. It is felt that this can be used at any event within the force and aimed at any members \nof the public.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nThe force are also involved in the training of \nthe drivers of HGV and bus companies on the correct setting of mirrors and the hazard perception of other road users including cyclists when using the road systems.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nThe force have obtained the use of a Volvo D40 \nmotor vehicle, s\nupported and lent \nby Volvo, \nfitted with a unique cyclist and pedestrian safety system which includes auto braking, blind spot information system and 360\no \nproximity s\nensors\n. This includes an und\ner-bonnet airbag to protect vulnerable road users. This has been used \nas an aid at all static exhibits\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nConclusions\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n8\n              \nRecommendations\n&#xa0;\n8.1\n              \nMost of the offences committed by cyclists are seen as low level and as such are not dealt with robustly. Consideration must be given to ex\npanding the powers of the PCSO \nto include such offences as lighting and fail to conform to\n traffic signs. Currently they \ncan only issue \na Traffic Offence Report\n \nfor the offence of cycling on the footpath.  This would fit th\ne new \nrecommendations of increasi\nng the use of neighbourhood policing\n model and allow more cyclists to be educated\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.2\n              \nCycle retailers could do more to support the work of the local authorities, police and community groups by ensuring \nwhen \nthey sell a cycle \nit is \nfitted with the \nrespective lighting\n, security\n, (lock and cycle marking\n) fluorescent\n jacket\n and \nadvice on the rules of the road for cyclists\n, cycle maintenance \ntogether with\n free cycling information\n in with the purchase price.\n \n&#xa0;\n8.3\n              \nAn N\nDORS style\n course similar to the dri\nver improvement scheme\n should be developed\n. (GMP \nis\n \ncurrently compiling such for \nTfGM\n to complete and offer of training for offences committed within the\n \nforce). This leaves the force to deal with enforcement and the local authority to train.\n \nThe aim eventually would be to look to a national course. \n This would also follow with\n \na training of police staff as to the new system in place.\n&#xa0;\n8.4\n              \nWhilst there are many areas within Greater Manchester that are relatively safe to cycle \n              \nthere are a numbe\nr of areas of concern\n. The area highlighted is one that has been given \n              \ngovernment approval to change the road structure reducing the potential risk to \n              \ncyclists.\n \nHowever the traffic displaced may well \ncreate\n another potential ‘hot spot.’\n \n&#xa0;\n8.5\n              \nDespite the\n number of HGV’s on the road system to prohibit such at peak times would \n              \nnot be feasible for the following reasons.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
