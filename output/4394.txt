[[[1) What is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level ]]]

[[[decision-making on transport expenditure? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s approach? Are there better models?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]Decisions about transport infrastructure have been devolved to the County Local Committees.  They are allowed to progress 3 Traffic Regulation Orders a year.  They cover a large area and having such a limit put on their decisions means that a lot of time is spent on deciding which 3 schemes will be progressed.  Inevitably this means that a huge number of schemes get on the list but never actually get done.  People are asked to provide support for their scheme and hand in petitions.  Even if you hand in a petition there is no guarantee that the scheme will go ahead – eg petition for a crossing at Walnut Tree Pub in North Mundham which has resulted in a £10,000 study but no crossing for the children to get to the local school on foot.  The members on the County Local Committee seem aware of promoting sustainable travel but the need to “keep traffic flowing” and “increase capacity” are higher up the political agenda.  Cycle paths for leisure are promoted over and above schemes on busy junctions or gyratories or arterials for utility cycling.  Sustainable travel does not have a proper budget but is dependent on S106 funding – so there is no way of getting repairs to cycle paths or new facilities progressed.  A new bridge for pedestrians and cyclists was put in over the railway in Chichester.  When this was planned the councillors’ attention was brought to the fact that cargo trikes and trailers would have to use this bridge.  The turns are too tight for these vehicles and a row of bollards have been put in on the road to prevent cars from parking near the bridge but they are too close together and now cargo trikes and trailers cannot turn off the road to get to the crossing! To change this, this will have to be put on a list to be put to the CLC meeting and it will have to bid for S106 monies.  It is very unlikely that this will be prioritized over other schemes in Selsey, Chichester, The Bourne and Tangmere.  Road schemes are prioritized that often do not include an element for cycling.  &#xa0;Undoubtedly it is important that local bodies make decisions about what transport schemes ought to be progressed.  However if the local body is not made up of transport professionals, is influenced by political concerns above all, and has a huge list of projects to chose from and finally is only able to chose 3 a year, it is not surprising that this approach does not bring many advantages for the residents.  A better model would have better funding – not just chasing S106 monies, would have clear guidelines so as to promote sustainable travel as a proper means of transport, rather than as the Cinderella of Motor transport.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[ and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?]]]&#xa0;The structure we have at the moment means that a lot of plans are produced but local transport schemes for cycling are not being delivered.  There is no mechanism to ensure that what Chichester District Council says is necessary to promote sustainable travel is carried out. There have been cuts to funding to local government, changes of staff, and there is no dedicated cycling budget or officer or proper strategy.  The well-intentioned words in the plans are not translated to proper schemes and these are not progressed through the slow, complicated and restrictive CLC system.&#xa0;The optimum delivery body would be more transparent – it is very difficult to find anything out in Chichester.  Different areas/ schemes would have named officers attached to them who could follow projects through.  A transport body is needed for individual areas that is allowed to develop and work through a vision with a proper budget, proper input from people concerned to bring about a sense of place and safer, people-friendly places, rather than traffic engineers interested primarily in traffic flow and increasing traffic volume.  We must work towards different priorities in 2014.&#xa0;There is no evidence that anyone is working to implement the outlines of LTP3.  Local bodies such as the CLC committees do not have the capacity to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes.&#xa0;

[[[3) What is ]]]

[[[the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]I am not aware of the working together of borough or district councils across boundaries at the moment.  There is a lot of competition for money between areas and schemes and for planning and delivery to work the approval of such schemes needs to be with a higher body that has an overall vision for the whole area.  Transport planning seems to be taken away from any groups that wish to promote sustainable travel throughout the county and devolved to county local committees that are just fighting their own little corners and not aware of the need to produce a cohesive network of safe, people-friendly streets.  We have a lot of issues in Chichester with the danger on the A27 to pedestrians.  Many people have been killed on the road which cuts through Chichester’s urban areas.  Noone is willing to look into reducing the speed – as has been done outside Worthing and Arundel (40mph).  We still have 70mph and we are planning yet more houses on brownfield sites on the other side of the A27 to the main urban area.  The Highways Agency do not want to hear from people who ask for the speed to be reduced.  Who is the Highways Agency accountable to? This is a body that operates across local authority boundaries and yet it seems very difficult to hold it accountable for its decisions. &#xa0;

[[[How effectively do local bodies work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies]]]

[[[?]]]We know that there are meetings between agencies but we have little evidence of changes coming about.  We have asked for the speed on the A27 which effectively cuts through residential areas in the city to be reduced.  There is little evidence that people’s wishes are taken into account or any changes carried through despite the large number of deaths on this road.  Noone seems to know who the Highways Agency is accountable to and thus noone knows who to influence or how this change can be brought about.&#xa0;We know that the district and county councils work together to produce plans.  Chichester District Council is having to plan for a large number of extra houses and so they work with WSCC planners to work out how the roads should be improved.  They produce hugely detailed plans to show how each roundabout on the A27 should be improved and updated to keep the traffic flowing.  However the plans only contain “arrows of connectivity” to show where the new cyclepaths should go in.  They do not show any new cycle paths or cycle infrastructure at all.  The councils work together well on things they prioritize, but things that are less important to them eg cycle paths are only mentioned vaguely and no proper detail is given to carry out any real changes.

[[[5) Do the ]]]

[[[current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?]]]WSCC has had to make huge numbers of cuts and this reason is given for the lack of schemes being brought forward for our roads and for sustainable travel too.  As the roads have deteriorated over the past few winters, WSCC is fighting a losing battle, with more and more complaints being brought by motorists.  The motorists lobby is obviously very strong so sustainable travel schemes are not prioritized.  Chichester and Horsham won some LSTF funding – however all the other towns and cities in the county got no money at all.  The funding will not allow a proper job to be done on one of our gyratories – instead cyclists are offered some more shared pavements, and the chance to use 3 toucan crossings to get round a gyratory.  This scheme is being rushed through so that the deadline for spending is not missed and the end result will not produce that vision of proper, safe, segregated paths as in Holland – but it is a sad compromise just offering those people who are scared of cycling round a busy gyratory the chance to wait at 3 toucan crossings. Most cyclists will still use the road as being far quicker and then they will be shouted at for not being on the cycle path.  The source of danger for cyclists on the junction will not be removed.  The whole area will not be revamped as a people-friendly instead of a traffic dominated place. For proper local transport planning proper funding must be provided instead of a few drops here and there.  The County cannot plan properly for cycling as it does not put any monies aside for this,  if it is using S106 monies, it has conflicting pulls on this from lots of other interest groups, funding from central government has to be bid for and does not get spread evenly around areas.  Apparently there was a fund earlier in 2013 called Cycling Ambition Fund, which seems to have passed us by.  This is all piecemeal funding which does not produce satisfactory results for anyone.  So much time is spent on deciding how to deploy scarce resources and the council says it has to save £140 million so there is not much likelihood of proper planning and proper improvements to roads, or any expenditure on the sustainable infrastructure we so badly need. Sustainable infrastructure will only be put in when it can bid for S106 monies when enough houses have been built by new developers.  So if we don’t build more houses, we won’t get any cycling infrastructure!&#xa0;

[[[6) What impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?]]]I have not heard of this so cannot comment. My concern with any procedures that are set up is that inevitably councillors, who are politicians, want to do “popular” things as they want to be re-elected.  Therefore if decisions are left entirely to elected representatives to decide how money is spent, only certain political viewpoints would favour money being spent on proper cycle infrastructure.  There is no doubt that everyone in our different layers of council knows that they need to tick the boxes about sustainable travel, but when it comes to how the money is spent, it is considered more important to please the motorist and to increase traffic flow and capacity.  To get a body to actually put proper cycling infrastructure on the list for funding you either have to change the view of the vocal majority or use some of the opinions of the sustainability forums and committees these councils undoubtedly have.  There is a lot of support for cycle infrastructure as most people you speak to would like to cycle safely around our small city, it is just that we need to prove this to the councillors (via petitions etc) as otherwise nothing will get done, whatever body or funding structure is introduced.  We fear that the Single Local Growth Fund will wipe out any consideration of sustainable transport schemes both big and small.   That is because it is designed to promote jobs supported by road building.  &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[7) How can local authorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? Wha]]]

[[[t scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?]]]Local authorities have the responsibility of funding transport infrastructure and so it is unlikely that private investors will volunteer for this.  I have heard that individual streets have been asked to finance their own 20mph signs which I think is wrong.  In such cases only richer people who can afford such luxuries could finance such safety measures for their streets.  The children of the poorer families would not be able to pay for their signs, although it is well known that there are more collisions in poorer areas.  For this reason, I do not believe that such things should be outsourced from the state.  I believe that the Highways Authorities bear responsibility for maintaining the roads, setting speed limits etc and they should be adequately financed by central government to allow this happen.  At the moment local councils are put under such pressure, that they are barely able to fulfil their statutory obligations, so looking into changing speed limits to ensure the safety of pedestrians and cyclists falls to the lottery of S106 funding and the perseverance of local campaigners.  The local council does not have enough money available to put into funding any cycling related infrastructure at all – although it should do so, to enable people to travel in safety around the area, and to encourage more sustainable travel for health and environmental reasons.

[[[How clear are the lines of accountability for local decision making on transport expen]]]

[[[diture?]]]There are no lines of accountability.  The impression the average person on the street has is that WSCC and CDC write whatever they like in their plans, and do whatever they like without paying heed to the views of the ordinary citizen.  Consultations are carried out but the voices of the normal residents often appear to be blatantly ignored - some people have even claimed that the comments to the consultations are not even read.  The councils exert their decision making without there being to our knowledge any means of questioning decisions or bringing anyone to account for their decisions.  The councillors exert unrestrained influence over all decisions and all policy documents and all expenditure. There is no means of redress for any individual or group except the ballot box.  If there are, unknown to us, lines of accountability for local decision making, we have yet to discover them after 4 years of continual campaigning in this city.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;
