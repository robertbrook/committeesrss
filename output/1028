defaultConclusions
default&#xa0;
defaultThe debate on prisoners’ votes is often conducted as a clash of two broad and incompatible principles.  One is that imprisonment constitutes a loss of liberty and, as a 
defaultcorollary
default of that, a range of 
defaultopportunities
default to 
defaultparticipate
default in civil society, as well as in normal social patterns of activity, are forfeited, including the right to vote. The other is that the right to vote, as a bulwark of genuine democracy
default, is
default essential both in 
defaultrespecting
default the full humanity o
defaultf
default the prisoner and in encouraging each prisoner to achieve 
defaultfull
default r
defaulteintegration into
default society
default.
default 
default 
defaultBecause t
defaulthese two incompatible positions
default are held strongly by many of their adherents, and because the history of cases in the European Court of Human Rights, which in historical terms is driving the present discussions, has centred on whether a ‘blanket ban’ is just, the debate has become polarised.  
defaultIt is helpful, therefore, t
defaulthat the draft Bill, like government consultation
defaults
default which preceded it, presents a range of views rather than a binary choice. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe whole range of views is represented among 
defaultmembers
default of the Church of England, 
defaultand the starting-point of this submission is the suggestion that the choice is not about deciding 
defaultwhether all or no prisoners 
defaultshould
default vote, but about balancing, without caricature, the 
defaultarguments
default 
defaulttending
default towards either end of the spectrum of views.
default 
defaultChristians
default believe in justice, and 
defaultt
defaulthat it is 
defaultthe duty
default of the 
defaultstate
default to maintain justice by, among other 
defaultthings
default, punishing offender
defaults
default 
defaultj
defaultustly
default (1Peter 2:14).  They also believe that e
defaultv
defaultery 
defaultindividual
default is made in the image of God and loved unconditionally by God, and is for those reasons worthy of the respect of their fellow-citizens; and that no one is beyond hope, beyond redemption
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe debate, as framed in the draft Bill, is not between those for and against an artificial threshold which measures severity of offence by the nature of the sentence, and those against such a threshold.  
defaultThe 
defaultchoices
default given are 
defaultsimply
default three thresholds: imprisonment, 
defaultimprisonment
default for six 
defaultmonths
default, and imprisonment for four years.  It 
defaultremains
default possible to reject these terms of debate, and argue 
defaultagainst
default any general threshold.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn this submission we briefly consider the context of the current debate, especially the European dimension; the
defaultn
default go on to consider and assess the arguments for and against a blanket ban on 
defaultprisoners
default voting, before
default considering the case for each of the intermediate options presented in the draft Bill, and 
defaultfinally 
defaultdrawing our conclusion
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe present 
defaultdiscussion has
default been brought about by the 
defaultneed
default to react to judgments in the European Court of Human Rights. 
defaultIt is not our view that the discussion should be shaped by a desire to react on the basis of any general view of the actions of that court, still less to subsume it under the  heading of ‘European institutions’ and base the response on a generalised attitude to those institutions.  
defaultRather, the court’s judgments are to be taken as the spur for us in the UK to 
defaultdiscuss
default the substantive issue in terms of what we 
defaultas
default a nation believe to be right. If we emerge convinced that a blanket ban is right, we are very unlikely to be decisively swayed even by the undoubted weight of the European Court’s authority.
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless
default, we do not believe it right to dismiss the various 
defaultjudgments
default of the European 
defaultcourt
default as of no 
defaultrelevance
default.  
defaultThis debate is undoubtedly about the extent of human rights, and the many aspects of human rights are inseparably connected with one another.  
defaultIn signing up to the ECHR, the UK Parliament
default agreed to secure to everyone within its jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined therein, and to comply with all the judgments of the ECtHR.  To derogate on this matter could risk weakening the authority of the EC
defaultt
defaultHR, and could provide cover for other nations wishing to justify non-compliance with other human rights requirements laid on them by European institutions.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMore specifically, the 
defaultquestion
default in relation to the 
defaultEuropean
default court turns on the 
defaultextent
default of the ‘margin of appreciation’ allowable to individual states  - what arrangement might be sufficiently far from a blanket ban to 
defaultremove the perception that it is ‘general and 
defaultautomatic
default’ in such a away as to be 
defaultarbitrary
default 
defaultand disproportionate
default in its effects.  
defaultThe successive judgments in the European Court – especially Hirst, Frodl and Scoppola – have left a measure of uncertainty about where the boundaries of the margin lie.  
defaultScoppola, at least, has 
defaultremoved the bar on setting any threshold in terms of sentence length alone.
default  
defaultAlthough some in the Church of England believe that disenfranchisement should only follow from a decision by a judge in the individual case (as envisaged in the Hirst judgment), this view is not widespread in view of the difficulties both of principle – this seems to enact the view, criticised by the UN Human Rights Committee, that disenfranchisement ‘amounts to an additional punishment’ – and of practice, in laying an additional and perplexing burden on the judge in every sentencing decision.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is a rich variety of practice among different 
defaultcountries
default – 
defaultincluding European
default states – as to which, if any, 
defaultprisoners
default can vote.  About 18 
defaultEuropean
default 
defaultstates
default have no ban on 
defaultprisoners
default voting, while others 
defaultdebar
default 
defaultsome
default 
defaultprisoners
default on the basis of 
defaultsentence
default length, or type of offence, or both. 
defaultThere are no clear patterns, no critical mass, no obvious overall direction of travel from which we might draw any 
defaultlessons
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultNo prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for contempt, default or on remand
default, and this has been the case for almost all of the last 140 years since the 
defaultquestion
default was 
defaultfirst
default made 
defaultexplicit
default in law.
default  
defaultThe weight of public opinion in the UK seems to tend towards retention
default of this ban - in a November 2012 YouGov of 1812 British adults, 63% of respondents said that 'no prisoners should be allowed to vote at elections', versus only 8% saying that 'all prisoners should be allowed to vote', 9% who said 'prisoners serving sentences of less than 4 years should be allowed to vote', and 15% saying 'prisoners serving sentences of less than 6 months should be allowed to vote'.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are no significant practical issues in enabling prisoners to vote – it already happens for those on remand.   It is generally accepted that each prisoner would vote in the constituency in which they were last resident.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current draft Bill gives a succinct reason for denying the vote to prisoners
default:
default&#xa0;
default‘Successive Governments have maintained the position that when an individual breaks their contract with society by committing an offence that leads to imprisonment, they should lose the right to vote while they are incarcerated.’ (Introduction, para 9).
defaultThis argues that the right to vote is not absolute, but presupposes a degree of compliance with the law, as the citizen’s side of the unwritten contract.  The key phrase is ‘an offence that leads to imprisonment’; - i.e. the operative criterion is not the imprisonment per se but the offence.  The threshold of the seriousness of the offence is defined as that which attracts a prison sentence.  ‘Seriousness’ is a judicial category which is defined in official terms in a document 
defaultof the Sentencing Council
default.
default&#xa0;
default‘Contract’ has a metaphorical sense here, since there is no suggestion that the grant of citizenship is legally conditional on full compliance with the law
default.
default 
defaultA power does exist for someone to be stripped of citizenship: under section 40 of the British Nationality Act
default 1981, as amended in 2006, the Home S
defaultecretary may make an order depriving a person of citizenship status if they are "satisfied that deprivation is conducive to the public good". This has only been used in a small number of terrorism-related cases.  Being metaphorical, the ‘contract’ 
defaultstatement describes rather than explains or justifies the established position.  But it 
defaultdescribes it helpfully:
default many people see prisons as a sort of ‘sin bin’, such that anyone consigned to it 
defaultcannot
default take any part in the action on the field of play until they return.
default The difficulty is that society treats prisoners as still on the field of play for taxation of earnings and savings, and there is always some force in ‘no taxation without representation’
default (see below).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe draft Bill further says: ‘The ban on prisoner voting pursues the legitimate aims of preventing crime by punishing offenders, and enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law’.  (Explanatory Note 92).  
default&#xa0;
default‘P
defaultreventing crime by punishing offenders’ is naturally read as implyin
defaultg a deterrent effect.  
defaultHowever
default, n
defaulto one has argued that the threat of losing their vote is likely to deter anyone from criminal action.
default  ‘P
defaultreventing crime by punishing offenders’ is 
defaultalso 
defaultnaturally read as stating that the withdrawal of suffrage is itself a punishment.  This risks playing into one argument of ECtHR in the Hirst judgment, that disenfranchisement is a further punishment, and should be specified as such by the 
defaultsentencing judge
default in each case. 
defaultThis question would hinge on whether disenfranchisement is an ‘additional punishment’, or so closely linked to imprisonment (as a natural implication or corollary of it) that it simply adds a further resonance to the shame and incapacitation constituted by the imprisonment itself.  
defaultIt is difficult, in the face of the wide variety of practice in
default different countries as to disenfranchisement
default of 
defaultthose
default in prison, to assert as intuitively evident the 
defaultproposition that losing one’s freedom naturally involves losing one’s vote.
default&#xa0;
default‘E
defaultnhancing civic responsibility and re
defaultspect for the rule of law’
default implies that the removal of the franchise from prisoners will add solemnity and weight to the significance of the vote for those who do p
defaultossess it.  
defaultThis is quite a high-level proposition, not easily susceptible of proof or disproof.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is notable that the UK debate has been confined entirely to the question of prison.  There has been no call to disenfranchise permanently, as in some countries, those who commit certain very serious crimes, so that even when released from prison they cannot vote.  This illustrates the close association in the public mind between prison and exclusion from voting.  We trust the judges to sentence correctly; and if during the prison sentence, even a short one, an election happens to occur, then it is the luck of the draw that the person serving perhaps a couple of months at that very time is not able to cast their vote.
default&#xa0;
defaultOpposed to this is the view that prisoners remain citizens while in prison, and imprisonment cannot by itself be grounds for removing the vote.  This implies that a judge should decide in each case, quite separately from the question of imprisonment.  It is possible in principle that someone convicted of an electoral fraud offence, for example, but not imprisoned, could be disenfranchised for a period while most prisoners were not. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ECtHR can no longer insist on this individualised approach (which the Hirst judgment backed) because of the Scoppola judgment which legitimised thresholds based on sentence length alone.  It is unreasonable to expect that in every case, the judge in fixing a custodial sentence should also have to consider the question of disenfranchisement.  In legal terms disenfranchisement would have to become a separate penalty; in practical terms the criteria for disenfranchisement would have to be defined clearly.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultPrison is seen by many as a place of removal from society and from participation in society.  In this light, disenfranchisement is a corollary
default or 
defaultimplication
default of incarceration, not a punishment additional to it.  Prison is often defended partly on the simple ground that it takes people out of society so that they cannot commit crime.  
defaultP
defaultrisoners can hold bank accounts and driving licences, get married and pay taxes – but all of these under carefully controlled conditions.  Possession of a vote would be a much more unconditional denial that the
default prisoner has been definitively 
defaultexcluded from society.
default  It would add to what is sometimes called the ‘declaratory’ 
defaultfunction
default of imprisonment: expressing in action the 
defaultseverity
default of society’s disapproval of crime.
default&#xa0;
defaultSome campaigners, including some within the Church of England, have argued that this status quo and consensus are alike based on an obsolete notion of ‘civic death’, dating back to the days of Edward III. ‘Lock them up and throw away the key’ does not usually mean ‘throw away the key’, but it does imply as absolute as possible a removal from society.
default 
default 
defaultBishop Peter Selby has put his objection to this
default forcefully:
default&#xa0;
default ‘Denying prisoners the right to vote serves no purpose of deterrence or reform.  What it does is to state in the clearest terms society’s belief that once convicted you are a non-person, one who should have no say in how our society is to develop, whose opinion is to count for nothing.  It is making someone an ‘outlaw’, and as such has no place in expressing a civilised attitude towards those in prison’.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe ECtHR’s objection is that the ban is ‘general, automatic and indiscriminate’, and this may reflect the experience of prisoners – all lumped together in a category of outcasts.  In that case the example and teaching of Jesus comes strongly into focus, in terms of not rejecting, pillorying and stigmatising any individual.  
defaultThe Bible contains insistence on proportionality in punishment – the limits 
defaultof the
default lex talionis are set at ‘an eye for an eye’, 
defaultetc.
default - Exodus 21:23-4
default.
default  It also contains warnings against excessive punishment – e.g. Deuteronomy 25:3 ‘He must not give him more than 40 lashes.  If he is flogged more than that, your brother will be degraded in your eyes’ (NIV).  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis view 
defaultthat
default 
defaultautomatic
default 
defaultdisenfranchisement
default is an unnecessary humiliation of the convicted person is not universal among church 
defaultmembers
default; some would share the view that is a proportionate corollary of the exclusion that prison signifies.  
defaultHowever, the Mission and Public Affairs Division in
defaultdicated the viewpoint of many others
default within the church in its report to the General Synod of the Church of England in 2007, ‘Taking Responsibility for Crime’, which included a pointer in favour of giving at least some prisoners the vote:
default&#xa0;
defaultClassical criminology and penology, often backed by Christian beliefs about human freedom and dignity, treated the offender primarily as a rational agent who could be influenced by the prospect of punishment or helped and encouraged to change his – mostly “his” – attitudes and behaviour.  An excessive concentration on the protective function threatens both justice and the principle that the offender or potential offender remains a citizen and is not deprived of all civil rights.  The current argument over the restoration to prisoners of the right to vote is a litmus test of the application of this principle. (p.8)
default&#xa0;
defaultFor those in favour of a blanket ban, 
defaultdisenfranchisement
default of 
defaultprisoners
default enhances democracy.  The argument would be that the fact that one’s vote can be forfeited is likely to raise the value placed on the franchise by the community in general, whereas the possession of the vote by hardened criminals in prison might cheapen it in public estimation.  
defaultA responsible democracy will thus benefit from the exclusion of those who have committed imprisonable offences, for the duration of their custody, with the safeguard that the vast majority will 
defaultin due
default course reassume their civic rights when they leave prison
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor those against, prisoners are a minority in society who need to be heard.  If those standing for election have to give attention to the votes of prisoners (although a tiny minority of any constituency electorate), that will raise the profile of prisons in democratic debate, as well as perhaps taking some candidates into prisons to experience the reality. The Canadian Supreme Court has said that ‘A government that restricts the franchise to a select portion of citizens is a government that weakens its ability to function as the legitimate representative of the excluded citizens, jeopardises its claim to representative democracy and erodes the basis of its right to convict and punish law-breakers.’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThose who advocate a blanket ban do not, in 
defaultgeneral
default, regard
default rehabilitation as a factor in deciding on the franchise.  
defaultRather
default, the restoration of the right to vote on 
defaultrelease
default is a sign of the person returning to society, since the 
defaultsentencers
default and/or Parole 
defaultBoard
default have decided that this is the proper time to do so.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor 
defaultothers
default, however, rehabilitation is the key to 
defaultunderstanding
default why the issue of voting is important.
default&#xa0;
defaultFor them, to
default take away the right to vote of every prisoner weakens their ties to civic society, and conveys a message of rejection which is unlikely to support their rehabilitation.  The purpose of rehab
defaultilitation, to which 
defaultalmost
default everyone is
default committed as an integral aim of imprisonment, is that people should leave prison with better resources for living as law-
defaultabiding citizens.  There is a strong emphasis now on ‘through-the-gate’ approaches to rehabilitation, i.e. a continuity of service and support in and out of pri
defaultson.  Imprisonment at its best  creates
default conditions where people can, within the restrictions of a secure institution, learn and practise habits of responsibility and mutuality.  In that way prisons might become colleges of citizenship rather than universities of crime.  
defaultAccording to this view, t
defaulto tell all prisoners that they are not citizens, by stripping them of their vote, hardly reinforces that message. 
defaultThe Catholic Bishops’ Conference 2004 repo
defaultrt, A Place of Redemption, came
default out very clearly in favour of giving the vote to prisoners ‘except in the most serious of cases’.(paras 107-111). ‘It would restore to prisoners some sense that they have to become the author of their own transformation’ (p.66). ‘Prison regimes should treat prisoners less as objects, done to by others, and more as subjects who can become authors of their own reform and redemption.  In that spirit, the right to vote should be restored to sentenced prisoners’ (ibid).
default  Lord Mackay of Clashfern once suggested that 
defaultprisoners
default in the last six months of 
defaulttheir
default sentence 
defaultshould
default be given the vote, as a way of easing them 
defaultback into
default full membership of the community
default, though this would, no doubt, be too complex in practice to administer
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is no knock-down argument showing that 
defaultthose
default in prison should have their vote taken away.  
defaultEqually
default, the weight and 
defaultconsistency
default over time of 
defaultpublic
default 
defaultopinion
default in favour of denying prisoners the vote has to be taken seriously
default. 
defaultThose campaigning for votes for prisoners frequently assert that voting is ‘a right, not a privilege’, and they have international law o
defaultn their side in that respect.  Certainly, t
defaulto take away that right is a serious matter.  But then imprisonment is a serious matter, and should be reserved for serious offences – as is in 
defaultprinciple
default the case, although the 
defaultnumbers
default in 
defaultprison
default raise 
defaultquestions
default 
defaultabout
default it.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are relatively few who have argued that all prisoners should have a vote; one area of virtual consensus seems to be that there are
default some people 
defaultwho have committed crimes so wicked, or sustained, or both, that they have forfeited the right to be considered as full voting members of the state.   
defaultIt would be possible to hold that 
defaultdisenfranchisement
default 
defaultshould
default be reserved as an 
defaultadditional
default sanction in the 
defaultsentencer’s
default toolbox, to give extra weight to the condemnation of those most serious crimes.  This has not
default, however,
default been 
defaultadvocated
default to any s
defaultignificant extent, and we would not advocate a further complicating of the responsibilities laid on the sentencer.
default&#xa0;
defaultA partial ban on allowing those in prison to vote is, 
defaulttherefore
default, the position taken by many who are unhappy with the 
defaultblanket
default ban.  Th
defaultis is 
defaulta way of 
defaultholding
default together on the one hand a perception 
defaultof prison
default as exclusion fro
defaultm society, and on the other hand a wish to 
defaultavoid
default cutting off the possibilities 
defaultfor
default reintegration 
defaultimplicit in treating 
defaultprisoners
default as citizens.
default 
default 
defaultIn any
default event, there are no 
defaultarguments
default for a 
defaultpartial
default ban that can carry the absolutist rhetorical weight of the other two positions, since compromise is inevitably involved.  To define a 
defaultthreshold
default in 
defaultterms
default of sentence length is the only 
defaultpracticable
default option, but any such criterion is 
defaulta net
default which will catch 
defaultboth
default the deserving and the undeserving in the 
defaulteyes
default of some beholders.  
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principle underlying this option is most 
defaultlikely
default 
defaultto be
default that t
defaulthose who have taken or wrecked the life of one or more other people should not be allowed an equal place with their 
defaultfellow-citizens.  Almost all of these, of course, will regain their vote on release, even if they are on a life sentence.  
defaultThe four
default-year-sentence option in the current proposals approximately meets this point, since those with a sentence of four years or more are likely to have done some serious damage.
default  
defaultIt is 
defaultreasonably 
defaultclear that the four-year option would fall within the ‘margin of appreciation’ allowed by the ECtHR, since the Italian three-year option has passed the test of examination in the Grand Chamber
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is widely accepted that short-term sentences offer almost no opportunity for rehabilitative work, but on the contrary tend to disrupt the person’s life – especially in terms of employment, housing, college courses and family ties – so as to make it if anything more likely that they will re-offend.  
defaultTo lose one’s vote, should an election fall during the custodial period, seems a minor but still an additional element of alienation of the offender from society, to no particular purpose since, on the basis of so short a sentence, it is unlikely that they pose a high risk of harm.  
defaultThis option is a minimal 
defaultresponse
default to E
defaultCtHR, in that it enables the UK
default to argue that there is no longer a blanket ban, while 
defaultgiving as little ground as possible on the government’s part (it enfranchises 
defaultabout 
default6% of the prison population at any one time).
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultweight
default of 
defaultpublic opinion
default tells
default in favour of a blanket ban, while
default the weight of the 
defaultjudgements
default of the European Court of Human Rights tells against it
default; it would be a serious matter to ignore that court, since that would weaken any claim by the UK to exercise moral leadersh
defaultip in the context of 
defaultvarying standards of respect for human rights, within Europe and beyond it.
default.   
defaultThere is no clear reason to suppose that a prison sentence naturally entails loss of one’s vote; the variety of practice in European and other states illustrates the lack of an international consensus.  There is a range of views on whether the element of exclusion from society which is inherent in imprisonment should extend to suspension of the franchise; on the impact of prisoner franchise on the integrity of our democracy; and on the relevance of rehabilitative considerations.
default&#xa0;
defaultA member of our MPA Council
default reflects the 
defaultview
default of 
defaultseveral
default colleagues in saying that
default they are not convinced of the argum
defaultents for a blanket ban, but going
default on to observe:  ‘However,  introducing enfranchisement for those who have caused great harm to society and individuals will I think be genuinely distressing for victims (and others). I would therefore be in favour of the four year rule and encourage the Government to use the opportunity of prisoner voting to strengthen its efforts to encourage reform and promote citizenship within the prisoner population.’
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless, t
defaulthere is no ‘Church of England view’ as between the options presented in the Bill.
default 
defaultWhat is shared among the Church’s members is a refusal to dismiss anyone as a pariah, as less than human; a commitment to universal suffrage as broadly defined as possible, since all are created in the image of God and none is beyond his love; a recognition of the calling to ‘administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another’ (Zechariah 7:9); and an acknowledgement that to balance the punitive and rehabilitative purposes of 
defaultimprisonment will men striking difficult balances on many issues, not least the issue of votes for prisoners.
