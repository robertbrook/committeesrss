"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the \nInternational Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists \n&#xa0;\nSummary\n&#xa0;\n1. The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists (IAJLJ) is an \ninternational NGO \nfounded in 196\n9 by Nobel Prize Laureate \nRené Cassin\n, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, and Israeli Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice\n \nHaim Coh\nen.  The IAJLJ\n is\n \nan \naccredited\n NGO\n by the \nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe\n \nand has \nmembers in \n3\n5 countries. \nWe were\n established, primarily, in order to further the cause of human rights, to act against Anti-Semitism and the denial of the Holocaust\n, and to act against all forms of racism manifested against any people.  \nAs such, \nthe\n IAJLJ has been\n monitoring \nmatters relating to \nUNRWA\n that have\n implications on human rights.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2. \nBritain\n \nis UNRWA’s second largest\n donor\n \nnations\n after the \nUnited States\n.  \nT\nhe IAJLJ submits this \ndocument\n therefore\n in response to\n \nthe British Parliament’s\n \nInternational Development Committee inquiry on The UK's Development Work in the Middle East\n call for experts to submit evidence regarding its\n questions\n of “w\nhether the Bri\ntish Department for International Development’s (DFID) funding to the Palestinian Authority aides the twin goals of state building and achieving a negotiated peace\n” and “w\nhether DFID is currently funding the right sectors and working with the right organis\nations, or whether there are sectors and organisations that do not receive UK funding, but should do\n.”\n \n&#xa0;\n3\n.\n The IAJLJ is d\nisturbed to conclude that\n UNRWA in effect\n works against human rights by \nits financial support o\nf\n Palestinian entities that\n \nincite\n its \nyouth to murder Jews and Israelis \nand \nwhich \nwork against promoting peace and\n a\n two-state solution\n.\n  \nThis situation not only \ncontradicts the stated use of British contributions to UNRWA \nbut also\n arguably am\nounts to support of child abuse\n \nin violation of the\n UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\n.\n&#xa0;\n4\n.\n \nThe IAJLJ has appeared twice at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in support of Syrian refugees and submits that a more effective\n and\n equitable use of funding is to support this refugee problem\n rather to fund UNRWA entities which contradict the goals of peace, good will, and a two-state solution.\nEvidence\n&#xa0;\n6\n.\n A review of textbooks used in UNRWA schools and these video clips entitled \nCamp\n \nJihad\nand Inside the UNRWA Classroom\n \nprovide ample evid\nence that UNRWA entities support incitement to murder Jews and Israelis, inculcate\n \nPalestinian children with the belief that a Palestinian “right of return”\n to Israeli cities is\n viable and expected,\n and \nnegate Israel’s right to exist\n \nexplicating the use of\n violent means to achieve this \ngoal.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n The result is \na generation of \nmany \nyoung Palestinians \nwho would oppose any two-state solution and have been brainwashed into thinking that violence and death in order to destroy \nIsrael\n is laudable and the only acceptable option.\n&#xa0;\n8.\n \nIn the material reviewed Palestinian children, with rare exception, are taught to make refe\nrence \nto Jews, not Israelis or \nIsrael\n.  \nThe two video clips contain numerous examples of children from \nGaza\n speak in \nhighly inflammatory language that children could know only if taught by adults.  When asked what the “right of return” means, \nchildren\n answered\n it means\n \nJews are the “enemy of Allah, must kill all of them\n,\n”\n \n“it means throw stones at Jews and also\n slaughter the Jews”\n and \n“we will kill the Jews and \ndefend \nour homeland.”\n \n  \nTeachers at these schools and camps\n promote this attitude \nby routinely and openly refer\nring\n to the Palestinian “right of return” to \nHaifa\n, Acre, \nJaffa\n, and \nNazareth\n. \n \nOne clip show\ns a teacher clearly stating in an interview that Jews never had any right to any land in the region and showed children in Gaza referring to their envisioned state \nas \nextending “from \nriver to the \nto sea” (the Jordan \nRiver to the Mediterranean Sea).  The en\ntire narrative taught at these UNRWA-supported entities apparently is that Jews never had any right to any land, Palestinians lived their honorable until the Naqba when Jews deported them, \nthe Palestinian \n“right of return” will materialize through violence\n and death whereby all Jews will be liquidated, creating \na Palestinian \nstate “from sea to sea.”\n&#xa0;\n9.\n \nThese clips also show\n Palestinian youth saying “I will defeat the Jews\n.  They are a gang of infidels and Christians. \nThey do not \nlike Allah\n and worship Alla\nh.  And they hate us\n,”\n “weapons will accelerate the right of return,” \n“collect stones, throw them at the patrol,” \n“I want to return to Kafar Kassem whether the Jews like it or not,”\n “there will never be peace between us and \nIsrael\n,”\n \n[games children play ar\ne] “Palestinians against Jews.  We shoot each other,”\n a Palestinian child\nren\n repl\ny\n to the question “how will you defeat the Jews by answering “with missiles,”\n “\nas Palestinians we must defend our honor and recapture our land,” \n“no to negotiations, attacking stage-by-stage is not the right way, \nif we attack them altogether at once, that will be the answer,”\n “the resistance in Gaza wasn’t enough, we need to unite and fight together in order to return,” \n[a song] “when we die as mar\ntyrs we go up to heaven\n . . . children have obeyed the command\n,\n”\n \n“we learn about Britain which gave our land to the Jews\n,\n”\n “[at school] they teach us that Jaffa is our land is it is forbidden to give it up,” \n“\nJews . . . fought against Allah and became \nthe \nenemy of Allah.  \nWe\n must kill all of them.”\n&#xa0;\n10. Teachers\n \nspeak \nclear\nly\n whether teaching children or in interviews.  A\n Palestinian teacher e\nxplain\ns to her class\n that Jews are “the wolf [that] expelled and deported us\n.  They killed us and \nshot our families\n,\n” \n “we off\nered martyrs, suicide bombers . . \n.\n \nwho here is related to a martyr?  Why were the\nre\n martyrs?  In order to \nliberate Al-Aqsa and return to Haifa and Jaffa\n;\n” \nteacher\ns\n ha\nve their students \nrepeat “Palestine is an Arab land from the river to the sea,\n \nwe want Haifa we want Acre,\n”\n another teacher has her students repeat\n \n“Glory to a liberated and an Arab Palestine, \nglory and eternal life for martyrs and the righteous,\n” “\nwe will liberate Jerusalem\n,\n” \nin interview\ns\n teacher says “the right of return is an integral part of \nthe\n curriculum,” \n“if \nstudents are taught by religious teachers,\n they will be taught that Israel must be wiped out\n,” “the land never belonged to the Jews, not in the past and not in the present\n.\n”\n&#xa0;\n11\n. In one clip Palestinian education minister,\n \nLamis al-Alami\n who taught in UNRWA for twenty years\n before her appointment as \nhead of education for all UNRWA schools and colleges\n,\n said these schools do not teach the right of return.\n&#xa0;\n12.\n \nTh\nis\n \nclip also show\ns UNRWA school students attending the memorial ceremony for\n Awad al-\nQiq\n, \nheadmaster at an UNWRA\n school in\n \nGaza\n \nand head of the Islamic Jihad’s rocket engineering unit\n \nand hearing \n“you were a great educator and you departed as a great warrior\n.\n” \n  \nOf note, \nin 2004 UNRWA head Peter Hansen stated to the Canadian Broadcasting Company: \n\"Oh, I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll, and I don't see that as a crime. Hamas as a political organization does not mean that every member is a militant,\n and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another\n.\n”\n \n I\nn 2010 \nCanada\n decided to redirect some of its aid from UNRWA to specific projects.\n&#xa0;\n1\n3\n. \nPalestinian\n Authority\n textbooks contain similar language.\n&#xa0;\nReturning\n, returning, we are returning\nBorders shall not exist, nor citadels and fortresses\nCry out, O those who have left:\nWe are returning\nReturning to the homes, to the valleys, to the mountains\nUnder the flag of glory, \nJihad\n and struggle\nWith blood, sacrifice, \nfraternity and loyalty\nWe are returning\nReturning, O hills; returning, O heights\nReturning to childhood; returning to youth\nTo \nJihad\n in the hills, [to] harvest in the land\"\n(\nOur Beautiful Language\n, Grade 5, Part 1 (2011) p. 50)\n.\n&#xa0;\nAccording to another Palestinian Authority textbook, \nthere are no Jewish rights whatsoever in \nPalestine\n – only \"greedy ambitions\" [\nAtmaa'\n]\n (\nNational Education\n, Grade 7 (2011) p. 20)\n.\n&#xa0;\n\"Good morning, O my homeland…\nA morning of glory and red liberty, \nwatered by the martyrs' blood…\n[Assignment:] I will reconcile the following poetic lines with the feelings they express:\n'A morning of glory and red liberty, watered by the martyrs' blood…' – The hope for the liberation of \nPalestine\n.\"\n(\nReading and Texts\n, G\nrade 9, Part 1 (2012) pp. 9-10, 12)\n&#xa0;\nO brother, the oppressors have exceeded all bounds and\n Jihad and sacrifice are necessary…\"(\nReading and Texts\n, Grade 8, Part 1 (2012) p. 44)\nHearing [weapons'] clash is pleasant to my ear\nAnd the flow of blood gladdens \nmy soul\nAs well as a body thrown upon the ground\nSkirmished over by the desert predators\n…\nBy your life!
