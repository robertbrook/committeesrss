defaultSubmission from defaultDamian Skelton. Skelton Electrical Ltddefault (BRC81)default&#xa0;
defaultI watched with interest the 
defaultlatest committee m
defaulte
defaulteting held today (20/01/2014)
default with Stephen Williams and Bob 
defaultLedsome
default regarding Part P.
default&#xa0;
defaultI noticed that although the issue of non qualified and inexperienced people actually 
defaultcarrying out electrical work was raised, no one brought up the issue that the qualified supervisor themselves, the person responsible for checking the work of the inexperienced and unqualified, does not need to be highly qualified themselves.
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently th
defaulte minimum required qualification that the qualified supervisor needs to hold is the City &amp; Guilds 2382 (Requirements for Electrical Installations)
default, which is obtainable by passing only a two hour open book exam. The competent persons schemes have introduced
default another method of proving competence in that they say they require a qualified supervisor to hold the City &amp; Guilds 2397 (
defaultLevel 3 Certificate
default in 
defaultInstalling
default, 
defaultTesting
default and 
defaultEnsuring Compliance
default of 
defaultElectrical Installation
default in 
defaultDwellings
default). Although classed as an N
defaultVQ level 3 this qualification is obtainable after only 5 weeks of training unlike the City &amp; Guilds 2357 NVQ level 3 Advanced Diploma (Advanced Electrical Installation) which is the current 4 year apprenticeship.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo summarise, it is entirely possible, and
default regularly the case, that a sole trader who owns his own business, or a qualified supervisor within a business, who's only qualification is the completion of a two hour open book exam (possibly during a five week course), is able to check and sign off the 
defaultwork of those who are completely unqualified. I believe the term 'Qualified Supervisor' is entirely misleading because it implies a high level of training which is not the case.
