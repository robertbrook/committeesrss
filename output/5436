[normal]Submission from [bold]Damian Skelton. Skelton Electrical Ltd[bold] (BRC81)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I watched with interest the 
[normal]latest committee m
[normal]e
[normal]eting held today (20/01/2014)
[normal] with Stephen Williams and Bob 
[normal]Ledsome
[normal] regarding Part P.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I noticed that although the issue of non qualified and inexperienced people actually 
[normal]carrying out electrical work was raised, no one brought up the issue that the qualified supervisor themselves, the person responsible for checking the work of the inexperienced and unqualified, does not need to be highly qualified themselves.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently th
[normal]e minimum required qualification that the qualified supervisor needs to hold is the City &amp; Guilds 2382 (Requirements for Electrical Installations)
[normal], which is obtainable by passing only a two hour open book exam. The competent persons schemes have introduced
[normal] another method of proving competence in that they say they require a qualified supervisor to hold the City &amp; Guilds 2397 (
[normal]Level 3 Certificate
[normal] in 
[normal]Installing
[normal], 
[normal]Testing
[normal] and 
[normal]Ensuring Compliance
[normal] of 
[normal]Electrical Installation
[normal] in 
[normal]Dwellings
[normal]). Although classed as an N
[normal]VQ level 3 this qualification is obtainable after only 5 weeks of training unlike the City &amp; Guilds 2357 NVQ level 3 Advanced Diploma (Advanced Electrical Installation) which is the current 4 year apprenticeship.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To summarise, it is entirely possible, and
[normal] regularly the case, that a sole trader who owns his own business, or a qualified supervisor within a business, who's only qualification is the completion of a two hour open book exam (possibly during a five week course), is able to check and sign off the 
[normal]work of those who are completely unqualified. I believe the term 'Qualified Supervisor' is entirely misleading because it implies a high level of training which is not the case.
