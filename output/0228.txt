[[[ position]]]

[[[:]]] I am Professor of Forensic Genetics at the Norwegian Institute of Public health and the University of Oslo, Norway.  Previously, I was principle research scientist at the FSS research laboratories for a period of 25 years (1982-2008).C.V.is available at: https://sites.google.com/site/peterdgill/

[[[International interests:]]] 1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I am member of the EU-FP7 (security)  funded EUROFORGEN network of excellence http://euroforgen.com/  and I am responsible for coordinating research activities within workpackage 3.  2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I chair the ISFG DNA commission http://www.isfg.org/Working%20Groups/DNA%20Commission which is responsible for publishing standards and guidelines for practitioners3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I chair the ENFSI methods, analysis and Interpretation and subgroup (part of the DNA working group) – also responsible for providing practitioners with standards and best practice guidelines: http://www.enfsi.eu/about-enfsi/structure/working-groups/dna

[[[Research interests:]]] 1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; I work primarily on the interpretation and statistics of DNA profiling evidence. I specialise in supporting the development of open-source software to interpret complex mixtures see: http://forensim.r-forge.r-project.org/ . In addition, current interests include writing a major review, based on recent incidents, on the causes of Miscarriages of Justice.

[[[What impacts have the FSS closure had?]]]Britain demonstrably lags behind the rest of Europe – international credibility is seriously damaged.1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The FSS ranked 5th in the world in terms of scientific citations [1].  No other laboratory in the UK features as a world class laboratory devoted to forensic science. In addition, England and Wales are the only countries in Europe without a national forensic science centre.2)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The rest of Europe has implemented new marker systems based on the European Standard Set of Markers recommended by the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes [2,3](ENFSI) and adopted by the EU commission. UK appears to be isolated in Europe by failing to move this project forward within the time-scales suggested by the EU. 3)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The new systems have much more powerful discriminating power and are able to analyse highly degraded and compromised samples (not possible with current system in use). UK is currently locked into outdated technology that is more than ten years old.  This means that cases will not be analysed using best practice methods. Cross -border comparisons with other countries will be compromised since the systems in use will no longer be entirely comparable. Is there a timetable for UK introduction?

[[[Impact of FSS closure on quality]]]Notable high profile errors have occurred4)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The New Scientist anonymous survey [4] was strong evidence that there is concern from employees within the UK laboratories. More than three quarters of respondents believed that there was significant risk of miscarriages of justice within the current system. It is highly significant that two high profile errors were identified a matter of weeks after the prophetic publication of the New Scientist report (see next section). The New Scientist survey demonstrated the importance of discovering the morale and opinions of employees. In the interests of restoring public confidence, I would recommend that a new survey is initiated to discover if the position has improved. 5)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The loss of quality predicted by the New Scientist review came to fruition with two high profile cases  in: ‘wrongful arrest of Adam Scott’[5] and the contamination event combined with a transposition error in ‘Death of Gareth Williams’[6,7]. Both errors were the result of bad practice (clearly not following international guidelines e.g.[8] ) –  in particular, ignoring negative controls that give DNA profiles (Scott); failure to check results before uploading to the national DNA database (Williams).A zero error rate is scientifically untenable6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The regulator review was critical of the offending laboratory but suggested that no further contamination incidents were present in a batch of 26,000 samples7)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Further work is needed, however. To clarify the position: there is no test for contamination (the effect is hidden) and it is not possible to equate the (presumed) regulator’s view of ‘absence of evidence’ with ‘evidence of absence’.  In a (contradictory)  piece of work to understand the mechanisms and impact of contamination, Gill and Kirkham[9] , working under FSS auspices, showed that it was possible to estimate contamination rates, but it is not possible to identify which samples were contaminated. A review carried out under FSS auspices on a typical casework process demonstrated a contamination rate of 1 in 1000 samples analysed. Not all contamination events lead to errors of interpretation, however[9].8)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A zero error rate for commercial providers is scientifically untenable (note that the statistic quoted in Scott was 1 in 1 billion, and ignored the possibility of error). There needs to be pro-active assessment of error rates that should be disclosed and published.

[[[What should be the role of the forensic science regulator?]]]9)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Clearly the regulator role cannot properly function in isolation but needs to be part of a coherent centralised organisation that is devoted to forensic science. In previous submissions to the committee I recommended that the core functions: research, regulation/accreditation, and standards, were subsumed and coordinated centrally by a national centre of excellence[10].  Forensic science is rapidly changing and improving. This means that there needs to be a mechanism in place to implement research into casework – implementation needs to be simultaneous across UK laboratories. This is difficult to achieve within a highly fragmented environment. The necessary infrastructure required to validate and to implement new technology to the same standards across providers does not currently exist.  &#xa0;The way forward

[[[&#xa0;]]]10)&#xa0; We must accept that the FSS (as it existed) was no longer fit for purpose, but it seems obvious that the core functions could have been preserved in a national centre of excellence (UK could also have retained its international ranking and associated credibility by this route). This course of action would have resulted in divestment of routine casework activities to commercial organisations, but the new centre would have retained the ability to carry out analysis of complex casework requiring novel technology that is not used by any commercial provider. This is because the profit motive precludes use of any technique that is loss-making. This has resulted in a rapidly growing technology-gap in the UK. For example implementation of latest new body fluid markers (RNA), mitochondrial DNA analysis; Y chromosome analysis; informative SNP ancestry markers are not in routine use11)&#xa0; There is a concern that the Home Office exerts undue influence over the regulator and the role should be remote and independent from this government body.  Otherwise conflict of interest may arise.12)&#xa0; There is a concern that the regulator role is restricted to committee discussions without the necessary resources to implement recommendations.13)&#xa0; There should be much more focus on discovery of error rates and limitations of evidence. The information should be in the public domain.14)&#xa0; As a prime example: there needs to be much more pro-active assessment of laboratories to prevent errors occurring.  Note that the laboratory involved with the Scott and Williams cases was fully accredited by the authorities, but this did not prevent catastrophic failure. The regulator response to the Scott case was mainly re-active. However, we must recognise that there is an implied weakness within the accreditation/regulatory process itself in that it failed to detect major deviance from acceptable laboratory practice in the first place . In a recent review by Gill et al [11], under UK regulator auspices, it was proposed to develop three over-arching ‘assessor’ roles (if properly resourced, this will  begin to address the concerns). The new roles are:15)&#xa0; However, significant resources are required to implement the points above (in a purely commercial environment this is quite challenging). Also this is further evidence of the need for a UK centre of excellence to take over the combined roles of research/implementation/ standards etc.&#xa0;
