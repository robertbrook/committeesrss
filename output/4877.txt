[[[]]]]&#xa0;1. This memorandum sets out the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA’s) role in supervising banks and money service businesses (MSBs) in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing. In particular, it sets out:The FCA’s role and responsibilities, including our financial crime responsibilities;Our recent work in combatting financial crime; andHow we work with other agencies.&#xa0;

[[[FCA’s role and responsibilities]]]2. The FCA was established on 1 April 2013. Our overall objective is to ensure that relevant markets work well. This is supported by three operational objectives, which are to:protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system;secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; andpromote competition in the interests of consumers.&#xa0;3. We are responsible for regulating the conduct of around 26,000 financial firms and for the prudential supervision of 23,000 that are not regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority. We also regulate some important parts of UK market infrastructure and we are the UK’s Listing Authority for securities issuers raising capital on UK markets. We promote innovation and healthy competition between financial services firms, and help them keep to the rules and maintain high conduct standards.&#xa0;

[[[Financial crime responsibilities]]]4. In carrying out our work we have a duty under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000(FSMA) to have regard to the importance of taking action intended to minimise the extent to which it is possible for firms to be used for financial crime. We are also the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CTF) supervisor of most financial services firms subject to the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (MLRs).&#xa0;5. All FSMA-authorised firms must put in place systems and controls to enable them to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk, including the risk of terrorist financing. In addition, all firms who are subject to the MLRs (the exceptions being mortgage brokers, general insurers and general insurance brokers) must put in place systems and controls including effective and risk basked customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring procedures.&#xa0;6. We are responsible for the supervision of banks’ compliance with the MLRs and our rules. We are also responsible for overseeing firms compliance with any direction issued by the Treasury under schedule 7 of the Counter Terrorism Act 2008 in relation to risks of nuclear proliferation.&#xa0;7. The FCA focuses on a firm’s systems and controls to prevent money laundering. As a result, having effective systems, including checking the identity of customers at the opening of an account and monitoring ongoing transactions should assist the firm in protecting itself from being misused by those seeking to fund terrorism.&#xa0;8. HMRC is the AML supervisor for Money Service Businesses (MSBs) under the MLRs. The FCA is only responsible for AML supervision where MSBs are already authorised with the FCA for another activity e.g. a bank providing money transmission services.&#xa0;9. Under the Payment Services Regulations 2009 we are responsible for overseeing the conduct of business and prudential requirements for firms offering payment services, which includes those MSBs who provide money transmission. We are responsible for ensuring they comply with the relevant legislation and regulation and consumers using their services are protected. However, this does not include responsibility for AML.&#xa0;

[[[Recent financial crime work]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[AML report]]]10.As the Committee is aware, in response to your report ‘Drugs: Breaking the Cycle’, we committed to publishing a report on the performance of our duties under the MLRs 2007. On 25 July, we published our first AML annual report which set out our AML obligations, how we meet those obligations and the trends and emerging risks in money laundering and terrorist financing that we are seeing in the firms we regulate.&#xa0;11.One of the issues we highlighted in our report that may affect FCA-regulated firms included the risk that the MSB sector may be used to launder money or finance terrorism. Our report stated that “the Money Service Business (MSB) sector as a whole is assessed by law enforcement as being at particularly high risk of abuse by those seeking to launder money or finance terrorism, and some MSBs have been seen to be complicit in these activities”.&#xa0;

[[[Systematic Anti-Money Laundering Programme]]]12.An important strand of our supervisory work continues to be our in-depth periodic probes in the UK’s biggest banks – our Systematic Anti-Money Laundering Programme (SAMLP). This currently covers 14 major retail and investment banks operating in the UK. The SAMLP covers AML, counter-terrorist financing and financial sanctions.&#xa0;

[[[Enforcement]]]13.An essential factor of our regulatory toolkit is enforcement action against the firms we regulate. Our enforcement action has focused on the issue of high risk customers/politically exposed persons (PEPs) over the past few years. This includes:Guaranty Trust Bank: £525,000 fine (August 2013) - failings in AML controls for high risk customers, including PEPs;EFG Private Bank: £4.2m fine (April 2013) – failings in AML controls for high risk customers, including PEPs;Turkish Bank (UK) Ltd: £294,000 fine (August 2012) – failings in AML controls over correspondent banking.Habib Bank AG Zurich: £525,000 fine and Money Laundering Reporting Officer fined £17,500 (May 2012) – failings in AML controls over high risk customers, including PEPs.Coutts &amp; Co: £8.75m fine (March 2012) – failings in AML controls relating to high risk customers, including PEPs.&#xa0;

[[[Trade Finance thematic review]]]14.On 1 July we published our thematic review into trade finance in UK based banks. Trade finance is internationally recognised as posing a high financial crime risk so the UK’s position as a major financial centre could be severely impacted if banks engaging in trade finance do not have appropriate systems and controls to prevent financial crime.&#xa0;15.The review into 17 banks found that they had generally developed effective controls to ensure they were not dealing with sanctioned individuals and entities, but most had failed to adequately consider money laundering and terrorist financing risk in trade finance.&#xa0;

[[[Financial Crime Guide]]]16.We provide details of our expectations of how FCA-regulated firms should tackle financial crime risks in our publication ‘Financial crime: a guide for firms’. This document is the main repository of information about financial crime (including money laundering and terrorist financing) and contains numerous examples of good and poor practice. It is a living document and is where we place the guidance material that, after consultation, flows from our thematic reviews such as the trade finance review mentioned above.&#xa0;

[[[Working with others]]]17. An essential factor of the FCA’s financial crime strategy is working in partnership with Government, law enforcement, other supervisors and the private sector.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Government]]]18.We are a member of the Money Laundering Advisory Committee, co-chaired by the Treasury and the Home Office, which brings together representatives from law enforcement, government, industry and regulators to advise the Government on its approach to preventing money laundering in the UK. This committee also reviews industry guidance before it is approved by the Treasury.&#xa0;

[[[Law enforcement]]]19.Alongside other agencies such as HMRC and the Serious Fraud Office, the FCA works in partnership with the Economic Crime Command (ECC) of the National Crime Agency (NCA). We attend the ECC committees that determine its priorities and coordinate multi-agency action in response to economic crime threats. The FCA also has a seat on the ECC board.&#xa0;20.The ECC currently focuses on fraud against the individual, public sector bodiesor private sector organisations. It has identified money laundering as one of fourenablers for these frauds. The ECC sees tackling money laundering as importantfor reducing serious organised and/or complex economic crime and protecting the UK’s reputation and economy.&#xa0;21.The FCA receives occasional reports on individual cases from law enforcement agencies about money laundering investigations where there are concerns that FCA-regulated firms may have facilitated money laundering, either knowingly or though ineffective AML procedures. The FCA works with law enforcement to encourage their financial investigators to pass more intelligence to us about poor AML practice by firms, to help us focus our supervisory efforts.&#xa0;

[[[Other supervisors]]]22.The FCA collaborates with other anti-money laundering supervisors in the UK and in other jurisdictions. The Anti-Money Laundering Supervisors forum was set up by the supervisory authorities specified in the MLRs to share views on current and emerging concerns and best practice. The FCA plays a key role in this forum, as well as chairing the public sector group within the forum.&#xa0;23.In relation to MSBs in particular, we regularly share information with HMRC about the firms that both organisations oversee, and arrange joint visits where appropriate. This is where the FCA regulates the firm under the Payment Services Regulation 2009 and HMRC is the AML supervisor. In addition, we support HMRC’s work on MSBs. The FCA sits on the board of Project Quaver, a multi-agency approach to deal with the risk of MSBs and are supporting the Serious Organised Crime Agency in providing information on specific areas of risk to the industry and then working with the industry to share best practice in mitigating that risk.&#xa0;

[[[Private sector]]]24.We work with the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group, which produces guidance for the financial services industry on preventing money laundering and combating terrorist financing.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Financial Conduct Authority]]]September 2013&#xa0; This includes amongst others banks, building societies, stockbrokers, e-money institutions and safe custodyservices. From 1st April 2014 the FCA will also be responsible for supervising consumer credit firms subject to theMLRs. http://www.fca.org.uk/static/documents/anti-money-laundering-report.pdf http://www.fca.org.uk/static/documents/thematic-reviews/tr-13-03.pdf Financial crime: a guide for firms, Part 1: A firm’s guide to preventing financial crime(http://media.fshandbook.info/Handbook/FC1_20130401.pdf) and Financial crime: a guide for firms, Part 2:Financial crime thematic reviews (http://media.fshandbook.info/Handbook/FC2_20130401.pdf)&#xa0;
