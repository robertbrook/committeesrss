[normal]Written evidence from David [bold]Tredrea[bold] (GMC0017)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]GMC effectiveness concerns[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]I write this letter in a personal capacity as David 
[normal]Tredrea
[normal], 12 Harley Street, London W1G 9PG. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1: 
[normal]I regret feeling obliged to bring this sordid affair to your attention.  
[normal]I 
[normal]f
[normal]eel it 
[normal]is 
[normal]something which affects the very DNA of the G
[normal]M
[normal]C and its inability to deal with 
[normal]complex but important 
[normal]rogue doctor 
[normal]cases.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]2:  
[normal]For me, t
[normal]he matter started 
[normal]in 2008 when
[normal] I made 
[normal]serious allegations 
[normal]to the 
[normal]              
[normal]GMC about 
[normal]physici
[normal]an BB
[normal].  She 
[normal]so abused one of her young
[normal] daughters 
[normal]              
[normal]there was a suicidal crisis.  I was brought in to assist this child, safeguard her 
[normal]              
[normal]future and help the family re-establish its moral compass.  In the ma
[normal]in I was 
[normal]              
[normal]successful and achieved all objectives.  The daughter is now an adult, 
[normal]              
[normal]independent and 
[normal]has completed a university degree.  
[normal]BB has divorced and 
[normal]              
[normal]now lives alone, estranged from family. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3: 
[normal]I submitted evidences to the GMC in 2008 but they felt 
[normal]then 
[normal]there was 
[normal]insufficient evidence to challenge her ‘
[normal]fitness to practice’
[normal].  I 
[normal]have 
[normal]supplied 
[normal]various evidences since and now there are some 90 independently verified 
[normal]              
[normal]and 
[normal]dispirit threads showing this doctor to be an exceptional risk to others – 
[normal]profes
[normal]sionally and otherwise.  
[normal]The catalogue showing 
[normal]66 of these w
[normal]as
[normal] sent to 
[normal]the GMC 12 months ago
[normal].  The 
[normal]bottom line is the GMC 
[normal]makes some noises of 
[normal]grunt but f
[normal]ails to take robust action.  This is largely because BB has the 
[normal]hallmarks of a vexatious litigant and constantly Appeals in the various Courts 
[normal](criminal and civil) in which she has re
[normal]g
[normal]ularly appeared since 2008. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4:  
[normal]On 19
[normal]th
[normal] November 
[normal]2013 
[normal]I wrote to the GMC with:  
[normal]‘I have your email of 
[normal]November 15
[normal]th
[normal] informing me o
[normal]f the GMC position but note there is still 
[normal]nothing 
[normal]tangible by way of evidence or effort.  My anxiety is that in 12 months I will be
[normal] 
[normal]fobbed off with similar platitude and secrecy.  As a victim of serious crime 
[normal]              
[normal]committed by BB 5 years ago, I am no longer
[normal] prepared to accept the GMC 
[normal]              
[normal]lack of progress report as satisfactory.  If, as you say, this case is at a crucial 
[normal]point, I need to alert the Police to ramp up protection because of BB’s past 
[normal]history and evidence the GMC already has of her retaining the
[normal] 
[normal]di
[normal]sreputable
[normal] 
[normal]for nefarious activities. Clearly she would see me as a prime target that needs 
[normal]to be quietened so she can continue with her various 
[normal]mischiefs
[normal].  I see no 
[normal]evidence of change in her alarming mental disorders.
[normal] The GMC shares duty 
[normal]with me to pr
[normal]otect my family and home as much as possible
[normal].’  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]5:  
[normal]On November 27
[normal]th
[normal] 
[normal]2013 
[normal]The GMC replies with:  ‘
[normal]Finally, in terms of 
[normal]              
[normal]protection for you and your family this is not a matter for the GMC and if you 
[normal]              
[normal]have concerns for your safety and wel
[normal]l
[normal]-being you should raise these with the 
[normal]              
[normal]Police’
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]6:  
[normal]On its Internet home page,
[normal] t
[normal]he GMC 
[normal]shows
[normal] 
[normal]five core organisational 
[normal]              
[normal]values which underpin everything 
[normal]it does:  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]1: 
[normal]We protect the public through the work that we do.
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]2: 
[normal]We treat everyone fairly.
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]3: 
[normal]We are honest and strive to be open and transparent.
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]4: 
[normal]We are committed to excellence in everything we do.
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]5: 
[normal]We are a listening and learning organisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]These values form the basis on which our organisation operates. We want 
[normal]              
[normal]every decision 
[normal]we make, every interaction we have and every email we write 
[normal]              
[normal]to embody our values.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]7: 
[normal]There is evidence the GMC has previously 
[normal]lied
[normal] in aspects of this case.  The 
[normal]              
[normal]conclusion I reach is that the GMC is unable to address this case with 
[normal]              
[normal]appropriate serious
[normal]ness, resource and priority.  BB has shown on many 
[normal]              
[normal]occasions that Harold Shipman and similar reprobates are cases she 
[normal]has 
[normal]              
[normal]studie
[normal]d carefully
[normal].  This doctor 
[normal]a
[normal]ctively lied to a GMC 
[normal]FtP
[normal] 
[normal]about 12 
[normal]              
[normal]months 
[normal]ago that led to a ‘
[normal]no sanctions
[normal]’ verdict despite being 
[normal]dismissed for 
[normal]              
[normal]gross 
[normal]professional conduct and lack of trust from her NHS employers
[normal].  
[normal]BB
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]was sacked with immediate effect 
[normal]because of sustained dishonesty.  
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]8:  
[normal]BB submitted her own Application to the Supreme Court of Judicature 
[normal]              
[normal]that 
[normal]              
[normal]she 
[normal]‘lacked ment
[normal]al capacity’
[normal] concerning another case she was running at 
[normal]the 
[normal]              
[normal]time her NHS suspension 
[normal]started 
[normal]– yet still saw fit to see private patients. 
[normal]              
[normal]              
[normal]9: Despite knowing this information, t
[normal]he current position is the GMC has 
[normal]              
[normal]absolutely no restrictions on her current licence to practice despite 
[normal]knowing in 
[normal]              
[normal]detail about 66 
[normal]independent
[normal], separately 
[normal]evidenced 
[normal]challenges to her probity 
[normal]              
[normal]and risk to patients.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10;  
[normal]It is my view that whilst the GMC has gloss and fine words for its
[normal] web-
[normal]si
[normal]te 
[normal]and publications, when faced with tough, rough doctors it is easily subjugated 
[normal]and lacks the spirit, wherewithal and other means to 
[normal]meet its objectives.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]              
[normal]11:  
[normal]In complaint to the PSA they take a similar stance of timidity.  Their 
[normal]              
[normal]Chairman r
[normal]ecommends the case is taken to the Privy Council.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Recommendation:  [bold]&#xa0;[bold]I would like the HSC to highlight this case as an example where the GMC ‘
[normal]talks the talk’ 
[normal]but 
[normal]stridently and knowingly 
[normal]fails in its core duty to protect patients and public. I would 
[normal]also 
[normal]like the HSC to continue to monitor the progress of this important case.
