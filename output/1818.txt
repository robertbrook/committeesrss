[[[Written evidence submitted by CO2DeepStore Ltd (CCS39)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]CO2DeepStore welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the committee on CCS. The development of CCS is fundamental to the UK and international ability to mitigate the effects of climate change whilst delivering societyâ€™s energy needs. CCS is complimentary to other low carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear.&#xa0;CO2DeepStore has been focused exclusively on development of CCS projects in the UK for the last 6 years. As such, we are perhaps unique in bringing a perspective of the challenges the industry faces to get CCS started.&#xa0;CO2DeepStore and Summit Power are joint developers of the proposed Captain Clean Energy Project, a new build IGCC plant at Grangemouth on the Forth Estuary. The developers are in discussion with DECC about the project.&#xa0;CO2DeepStore offers the following input to the committee;&#xa0;technology challenges preventing its deployment at scale. CO2 capture, transport and storage can be delivered safely and effectively. CCS will be cost-competitive with other low-carbon technologies&#xa0;We would be glad to provide further input should the committee require.&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
