"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Ann Farmer [OLS 00010]&#xa0;\nI would like the Committee to take into account the dangers of online pornography to children and young people, especially in negatively affecting them mentally and emotionally.\nMy research into eugenics and population has\n found a significant overlap between the\nse\n movements and the campaign for ‘value-free’ sex education;  \nboth movements have\n historical links with the pornography industry. \nThe aim of the pornography industry is to maximise profits by turning people into se\nx addicts, searching for sexual material on a regular basis, often of a\nn increasingly\n extreme nature. \nEventually they may seek more extreme ‘thrills’ by acting out what they have seen online: two r\necent cases of rape and murder of young girls, April \nJones \nand Tia Sharpe, have featured the use of pornography by men unknown to police.\nThere is also evidence that young boys are themselves becoming child \nmolestors\n, acting out the pornographic scenarios they have seen online.\nPornography dehumanises women and ch\nildren, depicting them as sex toys to be used at will, often in a brutal manner; even those women who participate willingly do not remain psychologically unharmed. It also dehumanises the viewers of pornography, reducing them to their sexual appetites, and\n encourag\ning\n them to believe that there is a ‘right to sex’.\nEven without these extreme negative outcomes, we must face the prospect of a society where the younger generations ha\nve\n learned to view other people through the distorted prism of \na perverted\n sex\nual desire; the history of pornography shows that lust swiftly turns to cruelty, thus we must tackle this problem of easily accessible online pornography if we do not wish society to be composed increasingly of uncaring sociopaths who care chiefly about th\neir own sexual appetites.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
