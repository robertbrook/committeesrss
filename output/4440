[normal]This response is intended to highlight the impact of the systematic institutionalisation of children with disabilities around the world
[normal].  It 
[normal]illustr
[normal]ate
[normal]s
[normal] the need for 
[normal]DFID
[normal] 
[normal]and other donors to adopt a
[normal]n
[normal] 
[normal]approach 
[normal]which is consistent both with 
[normal]the UK’s 
[normal]international human rights 
[normal]commitments
[normal] and 
[normal]with 
[normal]international good practice in the provision of and transition to community and family based care for childr
[normal]en with disabilities.  
[normal] This 
[normal]I
[normal]nquiry is a timely opportunity to ensure that the current process to replace the Millennium Development Goals puts in place specific mechanisms for the protection of societies’ most vulnerable children
[normal]:
[normal] those with disabilities
[normal] and living in institutional care. 
[normal]Whilst much of the evidence and research we refer to comes from the European Region, the 
[normal]issues raised are
[normal] common to children everywhere.

[normal]An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in some form of institutionalised residential care
[normal].  Research from across the world has 
[normal]demonstrate
[normal]d
[normal] the 
[normal]significant 
[normal]harm caused 
[normal]to children 
[normal]by 
[normal]such 
[normal]institutionalisation.
[normal] 
[normal]  T
[normal]he harmful effects include:

[normal] are prioritised.
