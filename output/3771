defaultUnder the Charities SORP, charities are already required to disclose in their accounts the number of staff pa
defaultid over £60,000, in £10,000 bands.  Women on Boards supports extending this requirement to disclose the total amount of employee benefits received by any individual employee paid over £100,000.

defaultCharity leaders 2012 report provided evidence that – as the sector with the most female CEOs - the charity sector is an important training sector for women, equipping them to move into executive and board ro

defaultWomen on Boards does not support a statutory cap on salaries in the charity sector as we believe reducing the pay of CEOs in this sector would further disadvantage already underpaid women wor
defaultking in this sector, and would lead to a reduction in the caliber of the women seeking the CEO roles with obvious knock-on implications.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 2011/2012 annual pay survey of the Association of Chief Executive Officers of Voluntary Organisations reports a pay gap of 16% between male and female chief executives in voluntary bodies with the pay gap rising to almost 30% for some roles.

defaultWomen o
defaultn Boards believes that requiring organisations in all sectors to analyse and report their gender pay gap publically, is the single most important step that can be taken towards reducing these inequities.
