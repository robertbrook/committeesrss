&#xa0;defaultWritten evidence submitted bydefault defaultRoger Bennettdefault [CT 1default6default]defaultI am writing as a private individual. I am aware that the deadline has passed.  The committee may still wish to consider this short submission.  The submission consists of only 10 short paragraphs.  The submission is made by a citizen rather than an organisation.  If the committee decide to consider the submission then I believe that it should not be published due to (a) its late arrival, as I only became aware of the work of the committee yesterday, and (b) and my status as an individual rather than an organisation or politician.

defaultI am now retired having worked for the Fire and Rescue Service between 1978 and 2010 where prior to retirement I held a senior role as Corporate Head of Civil Contingencies and Resilience.  I operated at GOLD command level, and passed a Strategic Assessment and Development Centre prior to securing my Strategic role in the Fire and Rescue Service.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have a First Class honours degree (BSc 
defaultHons
default) in Fire Engineering and Management from the University of Central Lancashire, and a social and economic science Masters degree (MSc Econ) in Strategic Studies from the Department of International Politics at the University of Wales Aberystwyth, where I took the Michael 
defaultMccGwire
default prize. I have a keen interest in people behaviour, with several articles published about human behaviour in fire and a dissertation that  covered amongst other things 'insider outsider groups'.

default(1) It doesn't matter what decisions are made by a government or any of its agencies; if that or those decisions preserve life. 
default&#xa0;
default(2) The preservation of life must be the fundamental principle upon which everything evolves.  I understand the 'Right to Privacy' and the right to a private life, and I recognise that this 'right' is embedded in the Human Rights Act.  However, I still take the far reaching view that the 'Right to Life' is of the primary importance.  It does not matter how well society is performing economically, how good the health care system is, or how good the education system is, or how good the transportation systems are; if you are not here to enjoy these provisions or to enjoy the strong performance that underpins a thriving society.
default&#xa0;
default(3) I would not even go as far as to say that the 'right to a private life' should be balanced with the needs of the State.  Indeed, any 'right to a private life' must be discarded if such a 'right' prevents or hinders the State from preventing its citizens from being violently murdered while going about their lawful business on the streets, in public venues, and on the transportation systems.  
default&#xa0;
default(4) You may have noticed that I have preferred to use the words 'murder' and 'murderers' rather than 'terrorists' and 'terrorism'.  This is because there are certain connotations that can be assigned to the latter words.  This includes some perverse assignation of a perceived ideological status.  The failure to use appropriate language and to avoid inappropriate language is madness on our part.  Those who set off bombs, or take weapons to an event, deal in death and have a clear intention 
defaultto murder.  We should hinder their attempts to somehow elevate their cause or elevate their status within the wider public domain.  Their intention is not to injure or to maim, their intention is to indiscriminately commit murder, and to do so, on as wide a scale as possible.  Given the odious nature of their intention, why do we use language that strengthens their purpose?     
default&#xa0;
default(5) I find it strange that we still treat these murderers and potential murders with kid gloves.  We allow our media to widely, and accurately, and succinctly, inform others of the methods, tactics, and strategies of our enforcement agencies.  We provide detail about our surveillance systems.  We provide that explanation to the extent, that we even explain that which works and that which is a bit more difficult for us to use.  It simply beggars belief that we as a society do very little to protect our fellow citizens while paradoxically we arm the murderers by informing them of our information gathering systems.  'Counter-terrorism' must be one step ahead of the murderers, but we somehow allow ourselves to hold their hand so that they can keep up with us.  To do so, is simply madness, but nevertheless that is what we do.
default&#xa0;
default(6) We do not adequately protect our systems and surveillance 'weapons', and we do not adequately punish those that make the choice of betraying us.
default&#xa0;
default(7) So what changes do I propose?  Well the first one is for someone to begin considering how  'language' can and does impacts on others.  What language could hinder the wider gains that the murderers try to achieve.  What language could reduce the potential for marginalisation of individuals.  What language should be used when there is a specific threat.  What language should be used following an event.  And for central guidance to be provided that informs others of the language that should be encouraged throughout.  This equally applies to wider situations e.g. influenza pandemic, a major natural catastrophe.  The consistent use of appropriate language can be a powerful weapon.  I expect that we spend billions on actual weapons and systems and people, but very little if nothing on a language strategy.  This therefore is the first of my two big hits for the Committee to consider.
default&#xa0;
default(8) The second hit is about electronic surveillance.  We should continue to work with partners to develop electronic surveillance systems e.g. emails, mobile phone data, internet message boards or whatever.  This continual development should be far reaching, worthwhile, and should become an even stronger tool in the armoury of the 'Counter-terrorism' agencies.  There should be no 'right to a private life' when it comes to preventing our citizens from becoming victims of a violent murder.  But there should be a caveat, and maybe this is where the 'balance' comes in.  Under no circumstances whatsoever can any information that is obtained, then be used by any agency or to bring about any prosecution that is NOT 'Counter-terrorism' related.  If you got the information from for example, reading an email, well enjoy the read, because unless we are dealing in death, then the information cannot be used.  The HMRC for example, cannot use the information.  Indeed if it could be shown that an agency instigated a separate non 'Counter-terrorism' investigation purely on the grounds of the email detail, then that outcome of that investigation should also become void in law.  By providing this safeguard to the use of information, we bring about the 'balance' that society probably expects and is certainly entitled to.  We will 
defaultdo much more to gather information, we will do much more to make good use of that information, but we will restrict how that information is used.  The information can only be used for the purpose of 'Counter-terrorism', and we will prevent it from being used for anything else or for being used as a catalyst to begin other investigations.  The information that we obtain has been obtained to prevent or to reduce the potential of death, it cannot be used for any other sole purpose.  Yes, that information must still be shared with all agencies to ensure 'joined up working' but it is its use that is limited.  
default&#xa0;
default(9) Finally, we will severely punish those that betray our country.  If you choose to divulge secrets, then you must expect to be treated as a spy.  Spies come in many forms, it doesn't matter if you are the Editor of a newspaper, the writer of a Blog, an analyst, a soldier, or a government employee.  If you make a conscious decision to divulge information then you must expect to be punished accordingly.  
default&#xa0;
default(10) Everyone has the 'right to life' and it's about time we stepped up to the mark and begin to better protect that right.
