[normal]Summary[bold]The Select Committee has called
[normal] for 
[normal]written
[normal] evidence 
[normal]on
[normal] the effectiveness of academy status for schools. This submission focusses only on the f
[normal]ifth
[normal] reference raised of: 
[normal]“
[normal]The appropriateness of academy status for 
[normal]primary schools
[normal] and what special factors apply”
[normal].
[normal]Recommended as crucial for consideration in this inquiry are the contextual factors of rurality and size. It is vital to acknowledge how corresponding factors, such as limited available resources and geograp
[normal]hical coherence in smaller rural primaries can limit the opportunities offered to them by academy status. The following concerns must be raised: 
[normal]Side-lined, yet also critical to this inquiry is the effect that greater academisation is having upon those schools 
[normal]that rely upon LA support. Reduced funding for non-academies that remain with the LA can leav
[normal]e schools vulnerable and facing
[normal] closure or academisation. With smaller primaries most reliant upon LA support, this is a significant note of consideration
[normal] on the a
[normal]ppropriateness of academisation
[normal] for this inquiry. 
[normal]2.0[bold] 
[normal]Introduction[bold]This submission is the product of extensive research that included contacting county councils, interviewing once council’s Assistant Director of Children’s Services, and analysing both com
[normal]mittee reports and academy statistics at a regional and national level. 
[normal]It is compiled with the aim of raising schools standards and achievements in rural areas, where these can fall significantly below the national average. In my own county of Norfolk, r
[normal]esults and achievements have fallen to the extent where 40% of primaries were rated by Ofsted as “Less than good” in comparison to a national average of 31%
[normal].
[normal] With the experience of attending an Academy in such a rural setting, it is my concern that the co
[normal]mparative difficulties facing these smaller schools in rural areas are not relegated from the public agenda.
[normal]Raising standards through competition: the case of alternative service providers[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Academy conversion 
[normal]offers
[normal] schools the freedom to either continue purchasing services from their LA, or seek more competitive alternatives elsewhere. Yet, 
[normal]this freedom of choice 
[normal]has been
[normal] contextually limited. 
[normal]Interviewing
[normal] the Assistant Director of Children’s Services from one Count
[normal]y Council
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]an
[normal] absence of 
[normal]alternative providers
[normal] in rural areas
[normal] was cited
[normal] 
[normal]as evident
[normal] from
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] lack
[normal] of competitive standards
[normal] in these areas
[normal]. This could mean advantage
[normal]s
[normal] of academy conversion 
[normal]are
[normal] potentially stagnated
[normal] in rural schools
[normal] when there is little comp
[normal]etition
[normal] or choice
[normal] between service providers from which to drive up standards.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]These schools can
[normal] face
[normal] the
[normal] alternatives of either: i) remaining
[normal] to purchase services form the Lo
[normal]cal Authority or ii) outsourcing
[normal] to other providers less local to the area. 
[normal]Conti
[normal]nuing to purchase services from the LA can
[normal] potentially
[normal] problematise 
[normal]efficiencies in provision 
[normal]when LA standards are poor or below par. 
[normal]Schools that comparatively choose to outsource service provision to a less local provider may face similar issues of effi
[normal]ciency due to the lack of geographical proximity. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In the context of small primary academies
[normal] without local alternatives
[normal], ii) 
[normal]is
[normal] a particularly ineffective solution. This is due to the great strategic capacity required to coordinate this service provision.  
[normal]With fewer resources in specialist staff and a reduced institutional capacity, 
[normal]these
[normal] schools
[normal] may
[normal] face greater difficulty in ou
[normal]tsourcing and maintaining the most competitive providers from more distant locations. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If academy conversion is to be an effective solution for small
[normal]er
[normal] primaries in rural areas, there must be a sufficient range of local alternatives for the provision of s
[normal]ervices.
[normal] This is particularly vital in instances where the Local Authority’s 
[normal]quality and efficiency in services is of a poor standard.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]The role of the LA in the formation of partnerships between schools[bold]&#xa0;[bold]4.0
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Partnerships 
[normal]are 
[normal]frequently cited as
[normal] an effective solution for smaller schools lacking the resources required to outsource the most competitive providers.
[normal] 
[normal]Whereby
[normal] encouraging
[normal] schools to pool resources together
[normal] may 
[normal]increase smaller schools’ institutional capacity and encourage greater 
[normal]economies of scale to be achieved
[normal]. 
[normal]Yet, context is
[normal] a prevalent issue for consideration here when some schools face greater difficulties than others in coordinating the formation of these partnerships.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In their previous inquiry into the effectiveness of p
[normal]artnerships for secondary schools alone, the committee recommended that those “In which all members are located in within close proximity are most likely to be effective”
[normal]. This concern of the committee 
[normal]is similarly prevalent to the 
[normal]case of primary academi
[normal]es. 
[normal]With
[normal] a greater numeracy and more widely distributed location 
[normal]across counties, issues of geographical proximity 
[normal]can
[normal] potentially
[normal] be
[normal] exacerbated more greatly 
[normal]for
[normal] the context of
[normal] these
[normal] small, rural primaries. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The role of the Local Authority could be key t
[normal]o coordinating efforts between these schools in the formation of effective partnerships. In a report on academy strategies, the Norfolk County Council noted the “considerable strategic capacity”
[normal] 
[normal] required to encourage groups of primary s
[normal]chools to set up t
[normal]heir own 
[normal]arrangements 
[normal]or form local partnerships
[normal]. With the 
[normal]LA
[normal] needing to evolve to the recent conditions of academies within the educational landscape, a role of coordination could match the expertise 
[normal]in
[normal] local knowledge of these authorities with the ability to increase educational standards. 
[normal]This is particularly vital to smaller rural primaries, where the LA could 
[normal]contribute to increasing their
[normal] institutional capacity by encouraging a pooling together of r
[normal]esources, expertise and knowledge between schools. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The impact of academisation on small primaries that rely upon LA support[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Relegated from the terms of this inquiry are the effects of academisation on the support framework of the LA. It is evident that 
[normal]increased academisation can significantly affect the ability of the LA to continue to fund those non-academies, with smaller primaries most at risk. If an LA is no longer required to provide non-statutory school support services to academies, they 
[normal]risk rec
[normal]eiving
[normal] a 
[normal]significant reduction in their
[normal] revenue grant. This could subsequently affect their ability to support financially those schools that remain under their provision.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is in particular those smaller primary schools that are at greatest risk from su
[normal]bsequent issues of funding when they are the most reliant upon the LA for support for resources. The Lincolnshire County Council warned 
[normal]previously
[normal] of how the implementation of the current Academies policy could lead to 184 out of 276 primary schools being 
[normal]at risk of closure from a reduced revenue grant
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The pertinence of this issue in funding is reflected in how the LCC was subsequently forced to admit that it no longer had the financial capacity with which to fund those remaining schools under its suppo
[normal]rt. That it recommended these schools’ conversion to academy status and 
[normal]membership to
[normal] a trust located hundreds of miles away demonstrates the clear failures in the funding system for Local Authorities. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This
[normal] incident reflects two issues for consideration: 1) That the appropriation of funds to the Local Authority must be adjusted to account for the increased academisation of schools and separation from LA support 2) That rather than recommending smaller school
[normal]s to join trusts located miles away, the role of the LA would better be appropriated to use is local knowledge and expertise to coordinate local trust formations. With small rural primaries most at risk of reduced funding in LA support, this is a pertinent
[normal] issue of consideration for this committee inquiry
[normal] on the effects of the academisation process.
