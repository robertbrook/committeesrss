"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence\n from Dr Tabitha \nTanqueray\n (CYS 061)\n&#xa0;\nI use a bicycle as my main form of transport in London, whether commuting to work, travelling to the West End to see a play or taking my 9-month-old and 3-year-old children to \nnursery in a cargo-bike. I have to be hyper-alert and mind-read other road users. I have to predict when a taxi is about to pull over immediately in front of me, or a stationary car is about to pull out into the road (manouevre, mirror, signal). However ca\nreful I am, I can’t pre\nvent ‘close passes’ from driver\ns who just don’t respect a cyclist’s right to be in the road. Although 95% of drivers seem to be careful, the remaini\nng 5% can certainly terrify and –in many cases- \nactually injure us.\n&#xa0;\nI work as an ana\nesthetic consultant, and I have experienced the pain, as part of a large team, \nof \ntrying desperately to save the life of a fatally-injured cyclist. I believe that the only reason that death rates for cyclists have not climbed recently in London is that the\n centralisation of trauma services in 2010, under Dr Fionna Moore’s leadership, has improved survival for critically-injured Londoners\n1\n.  The injury rates \nfor cyclists \nare constantly climbing. \nThe majority of my colleagues feel unable to cycle to work, be\ncause they’re legitimately afraid of being injured. Only the eccentric risk-takers amongst us use our bikes. Children are rarely seen cycling, which helps to explain the\nir\n terrifying obesity rates (27% of year 6 primary school children in my borough are ob\nese).\n&#xa0;\nI believe that the Transport Select Committee already knows exactly the steps which could be taken to reduce injur\nies and deaths to cyclists. \nI \nalso \nbelieve that \nboth central and local government are\n lacking the vision to implement them. \nOur roads d\no not cater for cyclists. Almost every cycle lane/ advanced stop line \nin London \nhas been tacked on or put in as an afterthought aiming to somehow let bicycles quietly fit in and filter around “proper” traffic.  This is not good enough, particularly on busy\n roads. The time has come fo\nr fully-segregated cycle lanes and junctions designed with cyclists in mind\n. It is obvious that countries which priorit\nise safe space for cycling on thei\nr roads have lower\n rates of injuries and deaths amongst\n cyclists, despite a\nttracting a wider range of people onto their bikes.\n \nOf course, other measures such as tighter HGV controls, better road policing etc could be useful adjuncts to safety, but designing \nspace for \ncycling into our roads is the number one priority.\n&#xa0;\nPlease \nals\no \nconsider\n the \nsummary \nreport\n2\n by the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group\n before you write up your conclusions.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
