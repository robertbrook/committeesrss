defaultA total of 3.5 million tonnes of LP Gas is used in the UK, of which
default two thirds is used in the petro-chemical industry and the remaining third sold into the inland heating and industrial market. Two thirds of LP Gas produced in the UK comes from refinery production versus one third from gas separation.

defaultA study into the role of LP Gas to heat rural homes and businesses was carried out by Delta Energy Environment. The resulting report, entitled

default reviewed existing and new heating technologies such as hybrid air source heat pumps, 18 kw LP Gas

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDelta-ee found that in addition to the 42% energy savings from low-carbon LP Gas technologies, that in old detached properties, LP Gas

defaultAccording to Delta-ee 
defaultmodelling for a detached pre-1900 property there are cost saving, as well as carbon saving benefits when using LP Gas. 
defaultRunning cost savings are a high priority for customer decision making LP Gas heat pumps offer a very attractive
default reduction in annual running costs (~£1,200 per year). Hybrid ASHPs &amp; boiler plus controls are quite attractive delivering savings of ~£350 / yr. For other technologies, savings are more modest at &lt;£300 per year.

defaultSignificant improvements in energy effic
defaultiency in the housing stock can be achieved through replacement of inefficient appliances by technologies such as the condensing boiler, which utilises the latent heat of water produced from the burning of fuel, in addition to the standard sensible heat, to
default increase its efficiency. Condensing technology, an established and cost-effective solution has a demonstrated potential to increase boilers efficiency by 15-20 percent as compared to their conventional equivalents.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLPG and solar or wind energy are a natural partnership: Solar and wind are great examples of how LPG can offer reliability and security to renewables. LPG can be used as a primary or complementary source of energy, helping to overcome the intermittent natu
defaultre of these energy sources.
default These modern systems —often referred to as hybrids — combine the reliability of a conventional fuel with the numerous benefits of renewable energy to provide warm water for millions of consumers across Europe. Hybrid solutions c
