[[[&#xa0;]]]"I find it hard to believe that a government which truly respected the rule of law - which had taken the trouble to understand what that phrase really means, and to study the consequences of what it has in mind - would have contemplated introducing the [civil legal aid proposals]".

[[[Timing, effectiveness and evidence-based policy making]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]We deal with each of these concerns in greater detail in our response to the First Consultation Paper.  However, we are concerned that the inadequacy of the evidence for reform is compounded by the short treatment of the consultation in Next Steps, specifically, in Annex B.  The analysis of the concerns expressed by many of the consultation responses, including members of the senior judiciary and public authorities who will be affected by these changes, is cursory.&#xa0;&#xa0;

It represents an important safeguard that contributes to ensuring the fairness and public trust in the administration of justice.Legal aid should be as broad as possible...to contribute to the elimination of obstacles and barriers that impair or restrict access to justice by providing assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal representation and access to the court system.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Exceptional funding]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;27 September 201321&#xa0; See for example, Daily Mail, The judicial review system is not a promotional tool for countless Left-wing campaigners, The Rt Hon Chris Grayling MP, Lord Chancellor, 6 September 2013 See JUSTICE, A  Public Defender, (1987) and Public Defenders: Learning from the US experience, (2001).  For examples of our work on LASPO, see, our response to the Green Paper consultation –(http://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/159/legal-aid-green-paper-justice-response), Press Summary (http://www.justice.org.uk/data/files/resources/282/press210611.pdf) and our letter to the Lord Chancellor on the principles of legal aid reform (http://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/48/legal-aid-cuts-must-be-guided-by-principle).       CP 14/2013 JUSTICE’s response to the First Consultation Paper is available here: http://www.justice.org.uk/resources.php/349/transforming-legal-aid Next steps, here: https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/transforming-legal-aid-next-steps   https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/judicial-review  For example, the removal of the right to choose may have been unlawful pursuant to section 27(4) LASPO. The Government maintains its view that the residency test may be introduced through secondary legislation following LASPO. While LASPO clearly permits the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the provision of legal aid, it is difficult to argue that this power includes the ability to exclude whole classes of persons from eligibility without further scrutiny by Parliament. See for example,  ex parte Khawaja [1984] AC 74 Tom Bingham, The Rule of Law, Allen Lane, London, 2010, pp. 85 and 88.  That the rule of law included a requirement on the State to furnish civil legal aid, in addition to protection for those accused of crimes was clear.  The rule of law includes that “means must be provided for resolving, without prohibitive cost or inordinate delay, bona fide civil disputes which the parties themselves are unable to resolve”.   That the principles of the common law protect the right of access to justice, including through the testing of rules which might inhibit access to the court is clear.  See R v Lord Chancellor ex p Witham [1998] QB 575 (this case dealt with the implications of court fees for access to the courts).   Airey v Ireland (1979) 2 EHRR 305 at 26 Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom (2005) 41 EHRR 22 at 59 The Government ought to recall its obligations to comply with Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights when implementing EU law, which provides that ‘legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.’.  Importantly, Article 47 TEU does not include the additional requirement of Article 6 ECHR that a fair hearing be provided in the determination of “civil rights and obligations”.  See DEB v Germany, [2010] ECR I- 13849, 28.   Several international and regional human rights treaties recognise access to free legal assistance as an essential component of the right to a fair trial.  Although many of these focus on criminal justice, international law appears to mirror the requirements of the common law and the ECHR that legal assistance may be essential where otherwise a hearing would be rendered unfair.  For example, In its General Comment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee acknowledged that “the availability or absence of legal assistance often determines whether or not a person can access the relevant proceedings or participate in them in a meaningful way”, and encouraged States to provide free legal aid not only in criminal proceedings, but also in other cases where individuals do not have sufficient means to pay for it.     A/HRC/23/43, Report of the Special Rapporteur on Judges and Judicial Independence, Geneva, 15 March 2013,.  http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/23/43  See also Article 21 TEU, which expressly prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality.    Constitutional Reform Act 2005, sections 1 and 17 set out the Lord Chancellor’s statutory duty to uphold the rule of law.

[[[ ]]]Section 17 makes reference to the Promissory Oath undertaken by the Lord Chancellor that: ”I do swear that in the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain I will respect the rule of law, defend the independence of the judiciary and discharge my duty to ensure the provision of resources for the efficient and effective support of the courts for which I am responsible.” Legal Services Act 2007, section 1 further defines the regulatory objectives of the Legal Services Board and other relevant authorities as including (a) protecting and promoting the public interest; (b) supporting the constitutional principle of the rule of law; and (c) improving access to justice. For example, all UK born infants under 1 year old would be excluded from support to represent their interests in care proceedings. Victoria Climbié, had she survived the horrific abuse which led to the Climbié Inquiry, would equally have been denied representation. See Shelter’s Consultation Response, for example, http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/briefing_legal_aid  The Catholic Church has, for example, written to Ministers to raise particular concerns about trafficking victims:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/may/22/catholic-church-legal-aid-trafficking  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/14/yarls-wood-immigrant-sex-abuse-tanja.  The JCHR conducted a lengthy inquiry on the treatment of asylum seekers and made a number of recommendations connected with treatment in detention.  These recommendations were based on a series of visits to places of detention, including at Yarls Wood.  Tenth Report of Session 2006-07, Treatment of Asylum Seekers, HLPaper 80, HC60.

Article 24(1) Treaty on the European Union  The Refugee Convention, article 16; Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings articles 10, 12 and 15.  See also UNCRPD, Articles 12 and 13, CEDAW, Article 15.   Articles 2, 3, 4 and 8 ECHR – and possibly 5 and 6 ECHR which ensure access to an independent and impartial tribunal - will be engaged by the examples set out in this section. See also legal advice prepared for the Public Law Project and others by Michael Fordham QC, published as part of the PLP response to the First Consultation Paper.   On the impact of litigants in person on the effectiveness of hearings, see Wright v MWS Ltd [2013] EWCA Civ 234 at 2.   First Consultation Paper, paras 3.1 – 3.22 [1985] QB 251  See the Lord Chancellor’s evidence to the House of Commons Justice Committee on 3 July 2013.  During this session, the Lord Chancellor explained the Government view that: “the taxpayer should not be paying legal aid for prisoners to go to court to debate which prison the Prison Service has decided to detain them in, what the conditions are in their cell, or whatever” (Q202), that “is why we have prison visitors, a prison complaints system, independent monitoring boards and a prisons ombudsman-to make sure that those safeguards are in place. I do not believe that it is appropriate for us then, on top of that, to be paying for legal aid for those cases to go to court (Q205).   That prisoners are in a vulnerable position and subject to the absolute coercive power of the State is recognised in most international human rights instruments and within the domestic law.  As Lord Woolf recognises in his report, Prison Disturbances: ‘a prisoner, as a result of being in prison, is particularly vulnerable to arbitrary and unlawful action’ (1991), para 14.293.   See also R v Board of Visitors of Hull Prison [1979] 1 QB 425 and Raymond v Honey [1983] 1 AC 1. For example, many of the serious issues identified in the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on deaths in custody about the treatment of prisoners – segregation, access to healthcare and restraint to take a few – would now be treatment issues for which prisoners would no longer be able to access criminal legal aid to lodge a complaint, even if it had been shown that a remedy was not possible using the alternative mechanisms identified in the First Consultation Paper.  See Third Report of Session 2004-05, Deaths in Custody, HL&#xa0;15-I/HC&#xa0;137-I R (P and Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 1 WLR 2002.

The case of Tarrant considered the circumstances in which an individual might be entitled to representation at an oral hearing.  The criteria include the seriousness of the implications of the hearing for the individual prisoner.
