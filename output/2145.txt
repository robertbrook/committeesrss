[[[Discrimination Law Association – Written evidence]]]&#xa0;This submission by the Discrimination Law Association (DLA) relates to Clause 2 of the draft Deregulation Bill.&#xa0;For the reasons set out below, the DLA does not believe that removal of employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations when it has made a finding of discrimination will contribute in any way to reducing the regulatory burden on business. On the contrary, the experience of DLA members suggests that tribunal recommendations, which are intended to assist employers to adopt improved equality practices and thus to avoid future litigation, are often welcomed by employers.  In this brief submission the DLA seeks to assist MPs and Peers to understand what this power of employment tribunals involves and why it should be retained.&#xa0;Summary &#xa0;&#xa0;Introduction&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Background&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Powers of employment tribunals to make recommendations&#xa0;(a)&#xa0;&#xa0; make a declaration as to the rights of the parties in relation to the matters to which the proceedings relate;(b)&#xa0;&#xa0; order the respondent to pay compensation to the complainant;(c)&#xa0;&#xa0; make an appropriate recommendation.Section 124(3) states:“An appropriate recommendation is a recommendation that within a specified period the respondent takes specified steps for the purpose of obviating, or reducing the adverse effect of any matter to which the proceedings relate –(a)&#xa0;&#xa0; on the complainant;(b)&#xa0;&#xa0; on any other person.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Clause 2&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Examples of wider recommendations&#xa0;&#xa0;Crisp v Iceland Foods – ET/1604478/11 &amp; ET/1600000/12 The employment tribunal upheld a claim of direct disability discrimination and made a recommendation that the HR managers should receive training ‘relating specifically to the issue of mental health disability’.Why v Enfield Grammar School - 3303944/2011The employment tribunal upheld a claim for discrimination on grounds of pregnancy and made a wider recommendation that the senior management team and all heads of department have training on equal opportunities employment law within 6 months, including the position of women on, and returning from, maternity leave. The Tribunal upheld a claim for victimisation, sexual orientation harassment and religion or belief harassment (managers had called an employee “gay” for not liking football”, and for doing household chores. He was also repeatedly called a “pagan” for not agreeing with statements expressed by Jehovah’s witnesses). They also made a wider recommendation, that the Respondent updates its policies on discrimination taking account of the Equality Act 2010 and that the directors and managers of the Samuel Grant Group receive diversity training from a reputable provider, both recommendations to be complied with no later than six months from the date of the judgment.Kerr v O’Hara Brothers Surfacing Ltd. [2013] EqLR 296The Tribunal found the Respondent company liable for age discrimination and age-related harassment and made recommendations including that the Respondents will discuss language within the workplace with their entire workforce and will devise and implement a work rostering system allowing for individual capacity to be objectively assessed and combined with information on availability and skills.Ncheke v Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service [2013] EqLR 649The Tribunal upheld a claim of failure to make reasonable adjustment and recommended that the Respondent’s line managers and HR are to receive adequate training on the Respondent’s own disability leave policy and to ensure that the policy is appropriately communicated to employees.Dixon v Royal Mail Group Limited [2013] EqLR 1910In this case the Respondent accepted that it had unlawfully discriminated against the Claimant because of her pregnancy or maternity. At the remedy hearing the Tribunal made a series of recommendations including that within 28 days of the issue of the Tribunal’s judgment the Respondent shall publish the Tribunal’s written reasons on their internet; the Tribunal noted that it “accepted the Claimant’s contention that bringing the judgment  to the attention of all managers and employees in the Royal Mail would increase their awareness of the risks of discrimination and therefore was likely to reduce the risk of such discrimination occurring to other employees in the future”.&#xa0;16 September 2013&#xa0;7&#xa0; Leeds Rhinos Rugby Club v Sterling UKEAT/0267/01 at [6.1]&#xa0; Para. 23 Equality Act 2010: employment tribunals’ power to make wider recommendations in discrimination cases and obtaining information procedure – Government response to consultation October 2012 op cit para 24 op cit para 7.
