"&#xa0;\nWritten Evidence from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDefra welcomes the opportunity to submit evidence to E\nfra\n on the keeping of primates as pets.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n              \nPrimates are among the most intelligent animals; they are \nsocially \ncomplex\n, long lived and\n require specialist keeping\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n              \nIt is understandable, therefore, that people should be concerned when they hear of primat\nes being kept in inappropriate conditions that contravene the Animal Welfare Act 2006.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n              \nDefra’s\n responsibility is to ensure that animals are provided with the appropriate protection and that enforcers have the necessary powers to take action in order t\no investigate allegations of cruelty or poor welfare.  Defra also sees its role as reminding \nowners and \npotential owners of their responsibility to provide for the welfare needs of their animals, as required under the \nA\nnimal Welfare Act 2006. \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n              \nDefra w\nould like to make it clear that primates should not be kept as pets in the \nconventional \nmeaning of the word “pet”.  If keeping a primate as a pet means keeping it in the domestic setting\n,\n whether in a cage or running free, \nthen this would be likely to be\n \ni\nn breach of \nsection 9 of \nthe Animal Welfare Act 2006\n (the need to provide an animal with its welfare needs)\n.  However, keeping primates in a \nsuitable social \ngroup setting in suitably constructed accommodation and ensuring that \nall of \nthe welfare needs of the animals are met \nsh\nould \ncomply with the Animal Welfare Act requirements \n- as long as all other related regulations are being met.\n&#xa0;\n2.1\n              \nPeriodically the Government receives correspondence from interested stakeholders or ind\nividual members of the public, usually in response to campaigns from stakeholders, expressing their concern about the conditions in which some primates are being kept by individual owners.  Anecdotal evidence of solitary primates being kept in small cages \nin a domestic setting and being fed inappropriate diets are central to most of the concerns.  Other concerns relate to the ease with which primates are advertised for sale on the internet.  Many adverts use terminology such as “good with children”, “diaper\n trained” and “will provide good company”.  Such claims are disturbing because\n we do not consider that\n primates should be kept in a domestic setting.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThere are also allegations that many primates are being kept in breach of other legislation (e.g. the\n Convention on the \nInternational \nTrade in Endangered Species (CITES) as well as the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976\n - \nsee “Legislative framework”\n.\n \n Under the 1976 Act\n,\n anyone wishing to keep a listed animal must obtain a valid licence from their local auth\nority.  There are claims that listed animals are being kept without an appropriate licence.\n&#xa0;\n2.3\n              \nOther allegations claim that primates are taken from their natural habitat in the wild and transported to developed countries such as the UK and the US to be k\nept as pets.  Such action is likely to be in breach of laws in other countries as well as CITES and regulations on the welfare of animals in transport. However, there is little evidence to show that wild-caught primates are being transported to this countr\ny for the pet trade.  It is more likely that UK residents will obtain a captive bred primate than one that is wild caught and then transported to this country.\n&#xa0;\nAnimal Welfare Act 2006\n3.1\n              \nFor years, the Protection of Animals Act 1911\n was the principal piece of legislation that protected animals from acts of cruelty.  Under this law, it was an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal.  This stood the test of time and was used by agencies, such as the RSPCA to prosecute a\nround 800-1,000 people for animal cruelty each year.\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nHowever, in 2007 the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”) came into force.  This largely replaced the 1911 Act and as well as retaining the “causing unnecessary suffering offence”\n,\n also introduc\ned the “welfare offence” under which an owner or keeper could be prosecuted for failing to provide for the welfare needs of \nan \nanimal.  The welfare offence was based on a similar offence that related to farm animals.  The new offence meant that for the fir\nst time owners of non-farm animals could be prosecuted for failing to look after their animals properly, even if no suffering had actually occurred.  This ha\ns\n the benefit of not having to wait for an animal to undergo suffering before action c\nan\n be taken.  \n&#xa0;\n3.3\n              \nUnder the 2006 Act, the maximum penalty for causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is 6 months imprisonment or a fine of £20,000, or both.\n \nThe maximum penalty for failing to provide for the welfare needs of an animal is 6 months impri\nsonment or a fine of £5,000, or both.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n              \nT\nhe welfare of primates is \ntherefore \nprotected \nunder the 2006 Act\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nPrimate \nCode of Practice\n3.5\n              \nIn addition, under the 2006 Act\n there are powers for the Secretary of State to make statutory codes of practice for\n the welfare of animals or animal related activities.  In 2010, Defra introduced the \nCode of Practice for the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-human Primates\n.  The code was made in response to \nconcerns about primates expressed during the passage of the Animal\n Welfare Bill through Parliament.  \n&#xa0;\n3.6\n              \nWhilst it is not a\n specific o\nffence to breach the \nC\node, if proceedings \nare brought under the Act, the Court can take into account\n \nthe extent to which \nsomeone\n ha\ns\n complied, or failed\n \nto comply, with the Code in decid\ning whether \nthe\ny\n \nhave committed an offence.\n&#xa0;\n3.7\n              \nThis Code of Practice is a guide to the steps a \nprivate \nkeeper of primates must take to meet the needs of an animal as required by Section 9 of the \n2006\n Act.  \nIt also provides local authority or RSPCA \ninspectors, who may be investigating an allegation of a primate being kept in poor welfare conditions, with guidance on how \nthe primate should be being kept.\n It does not apply to zoos or research establishments (where other guidance is available). \n&#xa0;\n3.8\n              \nTh\ne Code of Practice is due to be reviewed in 2015 (five years after it was made).  We will be inviting key stakeholders and experts to take part in the review.\n&#xa0;\nPet Animals Act 1951\n3.9\n              \nThe 1951 Act requires anyone who is in the business of selling animals \nas pets to obtain a valid licence from their local authority.  The local authority has powers to inspect premises and decide whether to issue a licence based on whether the animals will be held in appropriate conditions.  The local authority can issue a li\ncence with conditions such as limiting the species of animals the pet shop may sell.\n  The local authority has powers to investigate allegations of cruelty or poor welfare in a pet shop.  The local authority also ha\ns\n powers to charge a fee to an applicant t\no cover the cost of administering the licensing scheme. \n&#xa0;\n3.10\n              \nAnyone who is in the business of selling animals as pets and does not hold a valid licence \nis \ncommit\nting an \noffence.  The maximum penalty for such an offence is 3 months imprisonment and/or a f\nine of £500.\n  \n&#xa0;\nDangerous Wild Animals Act 1976\n3.11\n              \nCertain species of primate deemed sufficiently dangerous are contained in a Schedule to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 (\nthe “1976 Act”\n) and are subject to a licensing regime administered and enforce\nd by local authorities. \n&#xa0;\n3.12\n              \nThe precise \nprimate \nspecies listed in the Schedule to the 1976 Act and thereby requiring a licence to keep them are:\n&#xa0;\nNew-world monkeys (including: capuchin, howler, \nsaki\n, \nuacari\n, spider and woolly monkeys - night monkeys (also known as owl monkeys) \ntiti\n monkeys and squirrel monkeys are excepted); \nOld-world monkeys (including: baboons, the drill, \ncolobus\n monkeys, the gel\nada, guenons, \nlangurs\n, leaf monkeys, macaques, the mandrill, \nmangabeys\n, the \npatas\n and proboscis monkeys and the \ntalapoin\n); \nAnthropoid apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, \nbonobos\n, and orang-utans);\nGibbons and \nSiamangs\n;\nLeaping lemurs (including: the indri, and \ns\nifakas\n - the woolly lemur is excepted); \nLarge lemurs (bamboo or gentle lemurs are excepted).\n&#xa0;\n3.13\n              \nThe schedule of listed species was last amended in 2007. The amendments were made in order to reflect species \nbetter \nthat are considered as genuinely danger\nous to people – there were criticisms that the previous list was not consistent in this respect.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.14\n              \nSome \nstakeholders \nwould like to see certain species of primates re-instated on the schedule in order to provide more protection for primates.\n&#xa0;\n However, \nit is important to remember that the 1976 Act is \nprincipally \nabout protecting people from animals rather than providing additional welfare protection to animals.\n&#xa0;\n Therefore the schedule should reflect animals that are considered a genuine threat to the pub\nlic.\n&#xa0;\n \nSimply to \nplace more species on the schedule as a way of providing an additional regulatory requirement for owners, or potential owners, of primates would \npotentially \ngo beyond the scope and purpose of the 1976 Act\n and legal advice has confirmed that\n, if species were listed for reasons other than their dangerousness, then there would be a high risk of legal challenge being successful.\n&#xa0;\n3.15\n              \nT\nhere is no central depository, held either by Defra or DCLG, for information relating to the number of licences\n issued or which species they cover.\n  These are kept within each local authority.\n&#xa0;\n3.16\n              \nThe \n1976 Act\n provides \nsome\n ancillary welfare provisions as a local authority cannot grant a licence unless it is satisfied that the specimens “kept…. under the authorit\ny of the licence”: \n“\nbe held in accommodation which secures that the animal will not escape, which is suitable as regards construction, size, temperature, lighting, ventilation, drainage and cleanliness and which is suitable for the number of animals \nproposed to be held in the accommodation, and\n \nbe supplied with adequate and suitable food, drink and bedding material and be visited at suitable intervals\n.”\n&#xa0;\n3.17\n              \nThe \n1976 Act \nis a regulatory piece of legislation rather than a prohibitive one and does not \ndeny the right for people to keep those animals listed on the Schedule as long as an appropriate licence has been obtained.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n&#xa0;\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)\n3.18\n              \nAll primates are listed on CITES of which the UK is a signa\ntory.\n&#xa0;\nThrough CITES, the UK works with 178 other countries to protect endangered species of \nanimals \nand \nplants \nby restricting and monitoring international trade in them.  The objective of CITES is not to prohibit all trade in animals and plants, but to ensure that it is carried out in a sustainable way that ensures the long-term survival of all species. \n CITES proh\nibits the commercial importation of the most endangered\n \nAppendix I wild-taken primates in all but exceptional circumstances, such as for breeding or educational purposes which benefit the conservation of the species.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nT\nrade in captive-bred specimens is gen\nerally considered to be sustainable and so is allowed, subject to certain licensing provisions.\n \n \nAll imports of primates from outside the EU are subject to strict controls.\n&#xa0;\n3.19\n              \nRecords of primates being imported as pets into the UK from outside the EU (n\no CITES records are kept of intra-EU trade) are rare. They \nshow that in the past 5 years (December 2008 – December 2013) only 4 \nlive primates have been reported as imported \nfor personal purposes\n \ninto the UK; of these, two were imported by an animal sanctua\nry.  \n&#xa0;\n3.20\n              \nAlthough CITES is not a welfare Convention, the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations that implement CITES in the EU place a condition on imports of all live Annex A and B species (the EU equivalents of Appendices I and II) that the intended accommodat\nion must be adequate to care for the animals properly. This applies to all primates. Such import applications must be accompanied by a detailed description of the intended housing facilities so that the relevant CITES Scientific \nAuthority (the Joint Nature\n Conservation Committee) can assess their adequacy as part of the application.\n&#xa0;\n4.1\n              \nDuring 2013, Defra officials asked a representative of private keepers to work with the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG - a group\n of animal welfare, keeping and veterinary organisations) to draw up guidance and pop-ups\n for internet advertisers (similar to work they have done with other pets).\n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nPAAG have \nnow \npublished advice to potential owners of primates which is available on \ntheir website.  Once PAAG know who their affiliated websites will be (those who agree to adopt their minimum standards) those sites will place the pop-ups on their classified pages.   \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nWe have been alerted by stakeholders \nthat \nsome \nadvertisements for \nprimates \nmay be \nbogus and an attempt to extract money from unwitting customers in exchange for an animal that doesn’t exist.  The advertisements are allegedly selling a primate in this country but the use of American-English terminology, such as “diaper-tr\nained” should arouse suspicion as “diaper” is not in common use in this country.\n&#xa0;\n5.1\n              \nIt is not clear how many primates are kept privately in this country – the estimates range from 2,500 to 7,500. \nThese are rough estimates base\nd around numbers of 1976 \nAct \nlicences issued in relation to primates and sales of primates. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe number of pet primates rescued by Monkey World (one of two primate sanctuaries in England) has, according to their records, increased in the last two year\ns from an average of 0.4 per year from 1989 to 2011, to 15 in 2012 and 11 in 2013.  \nWhilst this shows a steep increase it is low\n in absolute terms\n and would be too early to say whether \nsuch figures\n signal a steady rise in primate ownership or a steady rise\n in people alerting the authorities about welfare concerns of primates.\n  We would also need more evidence on which to base any estimates about the numbers of privately held primates.\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n              \nSome people have called for \nadditional regulations to help secure the welfare of primates.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nAnimals in zoos are protected not only \nby \nthe Animal Welfare Act 2006 but also \nby \nthe Zoo Licensing Act 1981.  The 1981 Act \ndefines a zoo as an establishment where wild animals (those not \nnormally domesticated in the UK) are kept for exhibition to the public for seven days or more a year.   The Act \nrequires all zoos to have a licence\n, although exemptions from some or all of the provisions of the Act can be allowed for small zoos in specific\n circumstances\n. \n Zoos are subject to inspection and licensing by their local authority.  \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThere have been calls for individual primate owners to be subject to the same requirements as \nzoos.  Under the 1981 Act, the Secretary of State has published Standards of Modern Zoo Practice with which all zoos are expected to \ncomply \nif they wish to be granted and subsequently retain \na \nzoo\n licence.   However, the standards go further than requiring\n minimum welfare standards\n for\n the animals.  They also set out how\n zoos should meet the \nconservation \nand education \nrequirements \nof the Act (arising from the EC Zoos Directive), and also how public safety should be secured\n.  Clearly for individual owners th\nese requirements will not be required – \nalthough \nfor primates listed in the Schedule to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 there is a need to prevent injury to people by the animals.  We would therefore not expect to apply \nthe Secretary of State’s Standar\nds of Modern Zoo Practice to individual owners.  \nHowever, for purposes of animal welfare, w\ne consider that the standards set out in the Primate Code of Practice provide primates \nowned by individuals \nwith the same level of protection as those \nkept \nin zoos. \n In both cases the Animal Welfare Act 2006 would \napply in the event of any \ncases of cruelty or poor welfare.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n              \nWhilst we agree that people should not be keeping primates in inappropriate conditions th\ne available evidence\n does not \nsuggest that th\nis \nis a\n \nmajor\n problem.\n  \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nWe do not consider that it would be appropriate to seek to ban the keeping of primates as pets because it is already illegal to keep primates in \n“\npet like conditions\n”,\n i.e. to keep primates in inapprop\nriate conditions is an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.  To seek a specific ban on top of the existing law would be difficult to achieve because there would have to be a definition of “pet” or something that differentiates from keeping them in su\nitable conditions.  \nEven if a definition could be found it is difficult to see what this would achieve that is not currently available under the existing law.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n              \nTo introduce a wider ban on the trade in primates or on all private keeping of primates woul\nd mean that \nknowledgeable \npeople who keep them in appropriate conditions would be unable to continue to do so.  This would penalise law abiding, responsible owners because of the actions of irresponsible owners.  It would be disproportionate and, given the\n number of primates imported as pets (four in last five years), without any \nreal \nfoundation.\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n              \nThe Government considers that the existing legislation on the welfare of kept animals and the regulation of the pet trade provide enforcers with appropriate p\nowers to take action \nin cases where a primate’s welfare is causing a concern.\n&#xa0;\n7.5\n              \nWe also consider that PAAG’s work will help to alert prospective owners of primates \nto \nthe welfare needs \nof \nprimates.  \n&#xa0;\n7.6\n              \nThe\n forthcoming\n review of the Primate code of pr\nactice will also help to assess whether further action needs to be taken.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n \nWhen looking at advertisements on a relevant website a \n“window” will automatically open on\n the\n viewer’s computer screen providing key information about primates.\n"
