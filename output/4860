defaultn Turner, my High Commissioner in Nairobi, about the arrest in November 2010 of Mr Adebolajo, one of the suspects in the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, as part of the Home Affairs Select Committee’s inquiry into countering international terrorism and crime.  I understand you have also written regarding the incident to other parts of 
defaultthe Government
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere has been considerable and understandable Parliamentary and media attention on this attack.  For that reason the Prime Minister made a statement to the House on 3 June 2013, confirming that a thorough investigation would be conducted by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament (ISC).  The ISC is able to receive and consider a wide range of sensitive material from Government departments and agencies, and we have recently expanded its remit and strengthened its role through the Justice and Security Act 2013.  The Committee’s investigation will cover all aspects of this attack, including the issues you have raised
default.  The ISC hopes
default to conclude its work 
defaulton this investigation 
defaultaround the end of the year.
default&#xa0;
defaultBoth I and the Home Secretary believe the ISC is the appropriate forum to consider these matters, and we are confident that its investigation will be comprehensive and robust.  I hope you will appreciate that we are keen to avoid opening up a dual track approach to Parliamentary scrutiny
default.  We also want to avoid any pre
defaultjudice 
defaulttowards 
defaultthe current prosecution of Mr Adebolajo and his co-defendant, and the investigation into other suspects which could result in a criminal prosecution.  On this basis we have respectfully decided to decline your request for this information.
