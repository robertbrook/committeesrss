defaultWe initially hold a
defaultn interactive
default walk through presentation that
default involves a bus and a HGV, which are there to illustrate the dangers of blind spots on these vehicles. We have a their respective driving trainers there to explain 
defaulthow little can be seen from the vehicles and the other issues they have to deal with whilst they’re driving. People are encouraged to sit in the cabs and view it from the drivers
default’
default perspective.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultOn th
defaulte back of that we have devised 
defaulta system to deal 
defaultwith cyclists committing offences by issuing Traffic Offence Reports (currently £50 for cycling offences) then rescinding them when they attend a road safety presentation ran by ourselves and Drivesafe
default. T
defaulthis is means the cyclist pays NO
default fine
default,
default but we feel t
defaulthat issuing the TOR is the only way to get the cyclists to attend
default the presentations
default to find out the dangers they are putting themselves in, also to receive information about free 
defaultcycle 
defaulttraining that is provided by a
default trainer from Transport for Greater Manch
defaultester
default.  We are able to deliver this free of charge as 
defaultwe use the community rooms at a local firestation which are fr
defaultee, Special Constables who find it a useful experience in dealing with people, issuing TOR’s, using PNC also stopping traffic.
default Any drivers 
defaultthat are seen committing offences are deal
defaultt
default with by issuing a TOR so they can attend the relevant driver improvement
default scheme at a cost to themselves which currently are £79.50 or £89.00 depending
default on the course that they attend
default,
default if there is no scheme available for the offence the relevant points and fine stand. Only one driver improvement scheme can be attended for each offence in any one 3 year period.

default12 cyclists have committed the same offence again and have been issued with another TOR which will have to
default be
default paid as only one presentation can be attended.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe presentations that we run 
defaultare constantly evolving as we receive feedback from each one and try and tailor them accordingly, we have h
defaultad some very positive feedback 
defaultwith a lot of people going away saying that they will consider their
default actions more now.
default Steve
default Owens
default the cycle trainer 
defaultplays an integral part in the presentations offering advice on the varying scenarios that we show as part of the power point, giving examples of his experiences as a cyclist and ways of dealing with situations that cyclists find themselves in. At the end w
defaulte tell people about the free cycle training what it entails and how it can be tailored for individuals.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe have done all this to encourage safer cycling, push the free training and give advice to cyclist
defaults
default that have had little or 
defaultno training, 96% of the pe
defaultople 
defaultthat attend the presentations have had no cycle training many of these being non drivers as well. We have also found that a lot of the cyclists we stop are international and have little or no idea of road traffic law in this country.
