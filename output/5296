[normal]Written evidence from Greater Manchester Police (CYS0123)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We initially hold a
[normal]n interactive
[normal] walk through presentation that
[normal] involves a bus and a HGV, which are there to illustrate the dangers of blind spots on these vehicles. We have a their respective driving trainers there to explain 
[normal]how little can be seen from the vehicles and the other issues they have to deal with whilst they’re driving. People are encouraged to sit in the cabs and view it from the drivers
[normal]’
[normal] perspective.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]On th
[normal]e back of that we have devised 
[normal]a system to deal 
[normal]with cyclists committing offences by issuing Traffic Offence Reports (currently £50 for cycling offences) then rescinding them when they attend a road safety presentation ran by ourselves and Drivesafe
[normal]. T
[normal]his is means the cyclist pays NO
[normal] fine
[normal],
[normal] but we feel t
[normal]hat issuing the TOR is the only way to get the cyclists to attend
[normal] the presentations
[normal] to find out the dangers they are putting themselves in, also to receive information about free 
[normal]cycle 
[normal]training that is provided by a
[normal] trainer from Transport for Greater Manch
[normal]ester
[normal].  We are able to deliver this free of charge as 
[normal]we use the community rooms at a local firestation which are fr
[normal]ee, Special Constables who find it a useful experience in dealing with people, issuing TOR’s, using PNC also stopping traffic.
[normal] Any drivers 
[normal]that are seen committing offences are deal
[normal]t
[normal] with by issuing a TOR so they can attend the relevant driver improvement
[normal] scheme at a cost to themselves which currently are £79.50 or £89.00 depending
[normal] on the course that they attend
[normal],
[normal] if there is no scheme available for the offence the relevant points and fine stand. Only one driver improvement scheme can be attended for each offence in any one 3 year period.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]w Road and one in Bolton.

[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]93 motorists
[normal]12 cyclists have committed the same offence again and have been issued with another TOR which will have to
[normal] be
[normal] paid as only one presentation can be attended.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]he presentations that we run 
[normal]are constantly evolving as we receive feedback from each one and try and tailor them accordingly, we have h
[normal]ad some very positive feedback 
[normal]with a lot of people going away saying that they will consider their
[normal] actions more now.
[normal] Steve
[normal] Owens
[normal] the cycle trainer 
[normal]plays an integral part in the presentations offering advice on the varying scenarios that we show as part of the power point, giving examples of his experiences as a cyclist and ways of dealing with situations that cyclists find themselves in. At the end w
[normal]e tell people about the free cycle training what it entails and how it can be tailored for individuals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We have done all this to encourage safer cycling, push the free training and give advice to cyclist
[normal]s
[normal] that have had little or 
[normal]no training, 96% of the pe
[normal]ople 
[normal]that attend the presentations have had no cycle training many of these being non drivers as well. We have also found that a lot of the cyclists we stop are international and have little or no idea of road traffic law in this country.
