"EIS 29Written evidence submitted by the Geological Society&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat is the contribution to the UK economy of extractive industries in the UK? &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow does the UK based extractive industries support employment a) in the UK and b) for UK citizens overseas?&#xa0;\nHas the boom in London-listed extractive companies with businesses overseas over the last two decades resulted in a strengthening in the UK’s competitive position in this sector?Is there sufficient engagement between UK extractive industries and the NGO sector? Are there examples of best practice in engagement between the extractive industries and NGOs?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDoes the UK have the skills base to remain a centre for the extractive industries and to ensure that UK based businesses benefit from potential future opportunities such as shale gas? &#xa0;\nWhat is the impact of the industry of the UK signing up to the EITI?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWould increased regulation for London listed extractives companies result in competition from elsewhere or can it be used to make the UK a centre of excellence for best practice and corporate governance?&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat is the competitive landscape for the extractive industries in the 21st Century and is it in the UK’s interest to remain a global centre for them?&#xa0;\n23.\n              \nIt is in the UK’s strategic interests to secure sustainably the resources which support its population’s quality of life (including for food supply, \ndrinking water, construction and energy); to capitalise on its competitive advantages in the extractive industries (some of which are referred to above) for economic benefit; and to ensure that industry has access to the critical and emerging resources it \nwill need to be innovative and competitive.  The pressure on all geological resources will\n increase\n as the\n world’s\n \npopulation grows – this is a geopolitical matter, because deposits of these resources can only be found where nature has put them.  Some comm\nodities trade globally, and for these the UK will be in competition with other countries.  Within the UK, some commodities (shale gas, for example) may occur in sensitive areas, and there is an opportunity to provide global leadership in securing social co\nnsent to operate.  To capitalise on our geographical and historical competitive advantages will require world-leading research and training. \n&#xa0;\n21\n September 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
