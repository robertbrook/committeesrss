"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Royal College of Nursing (AMO0006)&#xa0;1.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntroduction&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWith a membership of more than 410,000 registered nurses, midwives, health visitors, nursing students, health care assistants and nurse cadets, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is the voice of nursing across the UK and the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world.  RCN members work in a variety of hospital and community settings in the NHS and the independent sector. The RCN promotes patient and nursing interests on a wide range of issues by working closely with the Government, the UK parliaments and other national and European political institutions, trade unions, professional bodies and voluntary organisations. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCN welcomes this opportunity to make a submission to the Health Select Committee in advance of Monitor’s annual accountability hearing.\n&#xa0;\n2.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nExecutive summary &#xa0;\n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIncreasing transparency across the NHS has been a key theme in the last year. Monitor has a key role to play in providing reassurance to the public that information regarding foundation trusts (FTs) is freely available.\n&#xa0;2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe clinical insight which Monitor is tasked with providing on trust mergers     remains unclear and unsubstantiated. The RCN would like to see clear evidence of the weight of Monitor’s judgement on clinical decisions in trust mergers.\n&#xa0;2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt remains to be seen how Monitor will interpret legislation on competition. The RCN will continue to closely observe how Monitor infers the government’s legislation on competition in upcoming cases. \n&#xa0;3.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew role &#xa0;\n3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing the passage of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which had significant implications for Monitor as a new sector regulator, Monitor has been settling into their new role and developing their new responsibilities, including:\n &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCN has an active interest in how these areas of work develop and we have responded formally to Monitor on the National Tariff.\n The RCN is particularly concerned that Monitor’s proposals for a 4% efficiency requirement of providers in 2014/15 is simply too high to be achieved without affecting patient care and safety. As we have previously stated, setting efficiency expectation too high will place too much pressure on the service and fail to deliver the safe, effective and compassionate care that patients and their carers deserve.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA key test for Monitor is how its decisions are reached in relation to competition issues. The RCN has raised concerns about competition and its role within the NHS \nthroughout the passage of the Health and Social Care Act and, following its royal assent, during debate on the Section 75 regulations, with regard to how Monitor will go about implementing the requirements set out in the Act. Monitor’s work is in the early stages in this area, for example, Monitor is currently investigating commissioning of cancer services in Greater Manchester\n and non-emergency care commissioning in Lancashire.\n The results and rulings of Monitor in these investigations will provide a better indication of how Monitor is interpreting the legislation. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCN remains concerned about whether appropriate clinical advice is sought and applied as Monitor continues to refine their approach to their new responsibilities. We have consistently called for Monitor to include a formal role for nurse representation to ensure effective clinical advice is supplied throughout all levels of the organisation. We believe that this post could be a joint post across the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and Monitor, covering both finance and quality. This would be consistent with the recommendation from the Francis Inquiry that “there should be at least one nurse on the executive boards of all healthcare organisations”\n. Although Monitor does not directly provide health care, it plays a crucial role in influencing it. The RCN, therefore, believes Monitor should be included in this definition and take action as such. \n&#xa0;\n4.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContributing to transparency and enabling national workforce planning&#xa0;\n4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is essential that Monitor plays their part in contributing to transparency across the system. Unfortunately, we do not believe this is currently happening consistently. For example, Monitor previously published Quality Innovation Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) plans for foundation trusts on their website. Unfortunately, these are no longer available in full. Monitor informed the RCN that this information was now considered ‘commercial in confidence’. The RCN believes that it is important that Monitor is transparent, and that such data is available in full to contribute to effective national workforce planning.  \n&#xa0;\n5.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClarity of roles required&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCN has some concerns around the clarity of Monitor’s role as sector regulator of foundation trusts. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCN notes that there are a whole host of organisations both within and outside the NHS looking at the future of the NHS. Monitor has recently launched a piece of work to understand what the future of the provider landscape could look like and how such future scenarios might be achieved. Confusingly, Monitor has also released work with an accompanying press release stating “\nMonitor sets out how to secure the future of the NHS”\n.\n This ambiguity does little to reassure our members, or the public, of Monitor’s capability as sector regulator. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are also now many agencies with a regulatory remit over different parts of the health care system: Monitor with its license for FTs, and in 2014, license for some larger providers of NHS care, the Trust Development Agency (TDA) for non-FTs, \nand NHS England as part of contracting and defining currencies for nationally priced services\n.  This is without including others such as the CQC, \nHealthwatch\n etc. This can seem bewildering and raises serious concerns around inconsistencies if they do not work together successfully.  \n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMonitor, the Office of Fair Trading, and the Competition Commission are involved in assessing mergers of hospital trusts. Monitor has an advisory role and is supposed to provide clinical insight throughout this process. However the recent decision by the Competition Commission to stop the merger of \nRoyal Bournemouth and Poole NHS Foundation Trust\n raises questions about how this clinical insight is brought to bear on such decisions. This example has raised very real questions as to the relative weight placed on Monitor’s clinical \nadvice in these situations, as Monitor did see and state the potential for quality improvements, along with concerns\n. What and who has the final say in such decisions is unclear, however patient care should take ultimate precedent. \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDecisions on mergers are also proving to take a long time, as the above case has shown, and leaves providers and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) facing uncertainties in what decisions they are able to make with regard to services.\n&#xa0;\n6.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNeed for evaluation and learning over time&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCN would like to again highlight that much will be proven by how all elements under Monitor’s remit, including pricing, their advice on mergers, commissioning the Trust Special Administrator for FTs under the failure regime etc, will work together. This will either help or hinder the ability of the NHS to deliver safe, high quality care and stay within a challenging budget.  The RCN urges an open attitude for agencies such as Monitor to evaluate their approach and to work with others on making improvements in the best interests of patients.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n Royal College of Nursing, \nResponse to Monitors Consultation on 2014/15 National Tariff System\n, October 2013 \n Monitor, \nUpdate on Monitors investigation into cancer services in Greater Manchester\n, 30th October 2013\n Monitor, \nMonitor investigates complaint about the commissioning of routine operations in Lancashire\n, 10th October 2013\n \nReport of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry\n, February 2013, p77\n Monitor, \nMonitor sets out how to secure the future of the NHS\n, 10\nth\n October 2013\n “In an NHS contract, a currency is a defined “unit” of health care to which a price is attached” \nhttp://www.monitor.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/LocalPricingReport23Sept13.pdf\n 24 September 2013 \n Competition Commission, The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/Poole Hospital NHS Foundation trust Merger Inquiry Provisional findings report, July 2013\n Monitor, \nAnticipated merger of Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n, 11th February 2013\n"
