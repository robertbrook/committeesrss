Written evidence from the defaultChartered Society of Physiotherapy (LTC 08)default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultChartered Society of Physiotherapy 
default(
defaultCSP
default)
default welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the 
defaultHealth Select Committee i
defaultnquiry into the Management of Long Term Conditions. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) is the professional, educational and trade union body for the UK’s 51,000 qualified physiotherapists, physiotherapy students and support workers. 97
default per cent
default of qualified physiotherapists are CSP members. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPhysiotherapy enables people with long term conditions (LTC) to move and function as independently as possible, maximising quality of life, physical and mental health and well-being
default and social participation
default. With a focus on quality and productivity, physiotherapy puts meeting patient and population needs, and optimising clinical outcomes and the patient experience, at the centre of all it does. 
default&#xa0;
defaultPhysiotherapy has a key role to play in care for people with a range of 
defaultLTCs
default including stroke
default;
default 
defaultmultiple sclerosis 
default(MS) 
defaultand 
defaultother inflammatory diseases; 
defaultParkinson’s disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; arthritis
default;
default musculoskeletal disorders
default;
default 
defaultlymphodoema
default; asthma
default;
default mental health; chronic pain; and 
defaultfalls in the frail and elderly.
default CSP’s membership includes clinical specialists working with patients with these conditions and their carers
default. 
defaultThe evidence we submit draws on
default 
defaultthis expertise
default. We would be pleased to supply additional information on any of the points raised in our evidence at a later stage.

defaultSummary of key pointsdefault&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default1.1
default              
defaultThere is significant scope 
defaultfor varying
default the current mix of services, 
defaultrequiring 
defaultsustained resource reallocation
default towards
default community-based services, prevention, early intervention and 
defaultreablement
default/rehabilitation. There is also 
defaults

defaultwithin

default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultNorthumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Tru
defaultst established an Early Supported 
defaultDischarge team
default to support stroke survivors in the community. This m
defaultulti-disciplinary team including physiotherapists
default has
default resulted in the average length of stay in hospital being reduced to half the national average and savings of around £500, 000
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultThe 
defaultHOPE Specialist Service at the North East Lincolnshire Care Trust provides a ‘one-stop-shop’ for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
default and older people at risk of falling. The team
default includes 
defaultphysiotherapists
default, 
defaultsupport worker specialists, volunteer ‘rehab buddies’ and expert patients
default. Hospital admissions were reduced (1 per person attending the 
defaultpulmonary rehabilitation course
default)
default, and over four years, the falls and post hip fracture 
defaultrehabilitation programme has seen an 8 per cent reduction in visits to A&amp;E and a 13 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for people who have fallen

default              
defaultCOPD

defaultMany

default              
defaultTwo out of every 1000 people in the UK suffer from lymphoedema. Early access to specialist physiotherapy-led intervention prevents the most disabling aspects of the condition associated with poor management.

default              
defaultWhile there are many examples of excellent practice, 
defaultthere 
defaultare insufficient community-
defaultbased services for the treatment and management of 
defaultLTCs
default, and a lack of integration between services in community and acute settings that can limit an individual’s recovery or rehabilitation
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default2.
default7
default              
defaultResearch conducted by the CSP and The Stroke Association in 2010 found that a quarter of stroke survivors had to wait longer than one month after discharge
default for physiotherapy
default.

default              
defaultPhysiotherapists and other allied health professionals (AHPs) have a unique insight and expertise working with patients and in multi-disciplinary teams across care settings in the management of 
defaultLTCs
default, which should inform

default4.default              defaultThe ability of the NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focussing on individual conditionsdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe impact of multi-morbidity is profound. People with several 
defaultLTCs
default have markedly poorer quality of life, poorer clinical outcomes and longer hospital stays, and are the most costly group of patients that the NHS 
defaulttreats
default.
default&#xa0;

default7.1
default              
defaultPhysiotherapy rehabilitation has a crucial role in keeping older people independent 
defaultand
default restoring their independen
defaultce
default, reducing
default the numbers of people requiring social care support or residential care, or delay
defaulting
default the need for such support.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default              
defaultEach year 35 per cent of over 65
default’s
default, and around 45 per cent of people over 80 fall in the community.
default 
defaultAmong the over 75’s injury from falls is the leading cause of mortality. 
defaultHalf of all people who have a fall will fall again in the next 12 months
default, 
defaultincreas
defaulting
default mortality, rates of hospitalisation and institutionalisation.
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default              
defaultThe physiotherapy-led Glasgow Falls Prevention Programme sees nearly 175 patients a month in their homes to assess risk factors and intervene to modify these. Between 1998 and 2008 admissions due to falls in the home
default reduced by
default 32 per cent, 
defaultfalls in residential institutions by
default 27 per cent and 
defaultfalls in the street by
default nearly 40 per cent. Over the same period, the number of admissions for hip fractures decreased by 3.6 per cent (compared with an increase of nearly 2 per cent in England
default)
default.
default 
default7.5
default              
defaultI
defaultnvestment in community physiotherapy services for older people is poor in many parts of England
default, and
default older people discharged from hospital and needing continuing rehabilitation, or those who have had a fall or a musculoskeletal injury at home, face long waiting
default times
default. This 
defaultincreases
default dependency 
defaulton
default social services and 
defaultthe NHS.

default              
defaultFour million people with long term 
defaultphysical 
defaultconditions also have a mental health problems
default.
default 
defaultFor many people the experience of a 
defaultLTC
default, including chronic pain, can result in 
defaultanxiety, stress, 
defaultdepression and other mental health issues. 
defaultThere are psychological factors in behaviours around eating and exercise tha
defaultt can cause or exacerbate some LTCs
default. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2
default              
defaultPhysiotherapists often work with psychologists on multidisciplinary teams for people with 
defaultLTCs
default, and on mental health teams. 
defaultAs the ‘physical expert’, the physiotherapist has a key role in enabling physical activity for health promotion, disease prevention and relapse, and makes a significant contribution in the delivery of lifestyle, weight management and wellbeing programmes. They can act as care co-ordinator supporting service users to access services as and when needed. By utilising a rehabilitation and recovery model physiotherapists work with service users to develop and facilitate strategies for the journey through wellbeing and recovery.
