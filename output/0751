Written evidence from the [bold]Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (LTC 08)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The 
[normal]Chartered Society of Physiotherapy 
[normal](
[normal]CSP
[normal])
[normal] welcomes the opportunity to provide evidence to the 
[normal]Health Select Committee i
[normal]nquiry into the Management of Long Term Conditions. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) is the professional, educational and trade union body for the UK’s 51,000 qualified physiotherapists, physiotherapy students and support workers. 97
[normal] per cent
[normal] of qualified physiotherapists are CSP members. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Physiotherapy enables people with long term conditions (LTC) to move and function as independently as possible, maximising quality of life, physical and mental health and well-being
[normal] and social participation
[normal]. With a focus on quality and productivity, physiotherapy puts meeting patient and population needs, and optimising clinical outcomes and the patient experience, at the centre of all it does. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Physiotherapy has a key role to play in care for people with a range of 
[normal]LTCs
[normal] including stroke
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]multiple sclerosis 
[normal](MS) 
[normal]and 
[normal]other inflammatory diseases; 
[normal]Parkinson’s disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; arthritis
[normal];
[normal] musculoskeletal disorders
[normal];
[normal] 
[normal]lymphodoema
[normal]; asthma
[normal];
[normal] mental health; chronic pain; and 
[normal]falls in the frail and elderly.
[normal] CSP’s membership includes clinical specialists working with patients with these conditions and their carers
[normal]. 
[normal]The evidence we submit draws on
[normal] 
[normal]this expertise
[normal]. We would be pleased to supply additional information on any of the points raised in our evidence at a later stage.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CSP Evidence [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary of key points[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]There is significant scope 
[normal]for varying
[normal] the current mix of services, 
[normal]requiring 
[normal]sustained resource reallocation
[normal] towards
[normal] community-based services, prevention, early intervention and 
[normal]reablement
[normal]/rehabilitation. There is also 
[normal]s
[normal]cope to make better use of the skills and knowledg
[normal]e 
[normal]within
[normal] the healthcare workforce. 
[normal]Physiotherap
[normal]ists
[normal] have a detailed understanding of the 
[normal]physiological
[normal], social, physical and environmental causes of ill-health within people and populations
[normal] and
[normal] a high level clinical
[normal] reasoning. Working 
[normal]across a variety of settings
[normal], 
[normal]they can 
[normal]co-ordinat
[normal]e and lead
[normal] effective and integrated services for people with LTCs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Tru
[normal]st established an Early Supported 
[normal]Discharge team
[normal] to support stroke survivors in the community. This m
[normal]ulti-disciplinary team including physiotherapists
[normal] has
[normal] resulted in the average length of stay in hospital being reduced to half the national average and savings of around £500, 000
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]HOPE Specialist Service at the North East Lincolnshire Care Trust provides a ‘one-stop-shop’ for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
[normal] and older people at risk of falling. The team
[normal] includes 
[normal]physiotherapists
[normal], 
[normal]support worker specialists, volunteer ‘rehab buddies’ and expert patients
[normal]. Hospital admissions were reduced (1 per person attending the 
[normal]pulmonary rehabilitation course
[normal])
[normal], and over four years, the falls and post hip fracture 
[normal]rehabilitation programme has seen an 8 per cent reduction in visits to A&amp;E and a 13 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for people who have fallen
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapy staff
[normal] work in 
[normal]Rapid Response Teams and 
[normal]Emergency Departments
[normal]. 
[normal]Wirral University Teaching Hospital ha
[normal]ve
[normal] developed a service to support the A&amp;E department by pr
[normal]oviding
[normal] physiotherapy and occupational therapy
[normal] assessment and
[normal] reports and a range of practical follow-up services
[normal].
[normal] The service has demonstrated significant reductions in bed days for the hospital.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]The readiness of local NHS and social services to treat patients with [bold]LTCS[bold] (including multiple conditions) within the community[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapy
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]as part of a
[normal] multi-disciplinary 
[normal]care pathway,
[normal] has been shown to be clinically and cost effective 
[normal]in
[normal] treat
[normal]ing
[normal] patients with a wide range of long term conditions
[normal] in the community setting.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]COPD
[normal] is the fifth biggest killer in the UK, and the second most common cause of emergency admissions in the UK. Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes 
[normal]are
[normal] proven to reduce the length of hospital stay and re-admissions
[normal] 
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]3
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Many
[normal] musculoskeletal disorders (
[normal]MSDs
[normal])
[normal] are 
[normal]LTCs, 
[normal]and
[normal] can 
[normal]be 
[normal]both a causal factor and 
[normal]caused by
[normal] other LTCs. 
[normal]Early intervention with physiotherapy 
[normal]is 
[normal]clinically and cost effective
[normal]. Self-referral to 
[normal]community 
[normal]physiotherapy has been demonstrated to 
[normal]save money and improve access
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]4
[normal]              
[normal]The greatest potential for central nervous system adaptation and recovery occurs in the early stages of 
[normal]MS
[normal] and 
[normal]early access to 
[normal]p
[normal]hysiotherapy can reduce disability. 
[normal]P

[normal],
[normal] as part of a speciali
[normal]st 
[normal]neurorehabilitative
[normal] service, 
[normal]h
[normal]as
[normal] a key role in managing specific symptoms of MS including pain, spasticity and the prevention of secondary complications. Results from clinical trials of 
[normal]MS exercise programmes
[normal] have demonstrated benefits in muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness, aerobic thresholds and activity levels and functional ability
[normal]. 
[normal]O
[normal]ver a six month period, a physiotherapy-led community 
[normal]service
[normal] in Newcastle resulted in a decrease in GP and hospital consultant visits
[normal], the cost of the service 
[normal]was
[normal] offset by a reduction in bed days
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]5
[normal]              
[normal]Two out of every 1000 people in the UK suffer from lymphoedema. Early access to specialist physiotherapy-led intervention prevents the most disabling aspects of the condition associated with poor management. 
[normal]I
[normal]n the 
[normal]Abertawe
[normal] Bro 
[normal]Morgannwg
[normal] University Health Board in Wales, a lymphoedema team includ
[normal]ing
[normal] specialist physiotherapists was established in 2004
[normal]. This
[normal] reduced 
[normal]cellulitis
[normal] 
[normal]episodes
[normal] for 
[normal]lymphoedema
[normal] patients from 58 per cent to 
[normal]9
[normal] per cent
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]While there are many examples of excellent practice, 
[normal]there 
[normal]are insufficient community-
[normal]based services for the treatment and management of 
[normal]LTCs
[normal], and a lack of integration between services in community and acute settings that can limit an individual’s recovery or rehabilitation
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]Research conducted by the CSP and The Stroke Association in 2010 found that a quarter of stroke survivors had to wait longer than one month after discharge
[normal] for physiotherapy
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]8
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]In 2011 the CSP and the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) published 
[normal]a report
[normal] which 
[normal]revealed a third of patients n
[normal]ot
[normal] being referred for physiotherapy, a third waiting for more than one year, and just 
[normal]one in ten waited less than one month.

[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]The practical assistance offered to commissioners to support the design of services which promote community-based care and provide for the integration of health and social care in the man[bold]agement of long-term conditions[bold] [bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapists and other allied health professionals (AHPs) have a unique insight and expertise working with patients and in multi-disciplinary teams across care settings in the management of 
[normal]LTCs
[normal], which should inform 
[normal]commissioning 
[normal]and service redesign
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]The ability of the NHS and social care providers to treat multi-morbidities and the patient as a person rather than focussing on individual conditions[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The impact of multi-morbidity is profound. People with several 
[normal]LTCs
[normal] have markedly poorer quality of life, poorer clinical outcomes and longer hospital stays, and are the most costly group of patients that the NHS 
[normal]treats
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.
[normal]2
[normal] 
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapy takes a per
[normal]son-
[normal]centred approach to care, 
[normal]taking into account the totality of an individual’s health and wellbeing needs, 
[normal]supporting 
[normal]self-manage
[normal]ment
[normal] and 
[normal]informed choices
[normal]. 
[normal]Physiotherapists 
[normal]a
[normal]ddress multiple and complex
[normal] needs of patients through high-
[normal]level clinical reasoning, diagnosis and treatment skills. 
[normal]Physiotherapists are 
[normal]accustomed to working in a variety of settings, across health and social care, and can be a valuable point of continuity and transition for patients moving from one setting to another. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]Proactive Care: Long Term Condition
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]pilot project 
[normal]started in April 2012 in the South Kent Coast CCG. Patients are supported by a multi-disciplinary team including a GP, community matron, health care assistant, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, pharmacist, health trainer, care manager and mental health professional. Patients are offered a 12 week package of support 
[normal]to improve
[normal] the management 
[normal]and self-management 
[normal]of 
[normal]their 
[normal]condition. Evidence shows a 15 per cent reduction in A

[normal]hysiotherapists in Brighton and Sussex Trust 
[normal]run exercise groups

[normal]. Services are
[normal] access
[normal]ed
[normal] through patient charities (National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society, Parkinson’s 
[normal]UK
[normal], Arthritis Care and the local Osteoporosis Society)
[normal]. 
[normal]This allows community-
[normal]use of the facility when not being used and generates income.

[normal]besity is a contributing factor to a range of
[normal] LTCs
[normal], including the physical stresses associated with obese bodi

[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.
[normal]2
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapists
[normal] have a diverse skills set to identify strategies for the prevention and management of obesity
[normal], and
[normal] the communication skills to build up trusting relationships required to address psychological and emotional barriers to taking up physical activity and accessing services. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]The ‘Lose Weight Feel Great’ service in Ashton, Leigh and Wigan PCT
[normal] offers general health and wellbeing services as well as specialist weight management, that people can self refer to. One-to-one care is delivered by physiotherapist or dietician. Activate, the physiotherapy-led obesity service in Tower Hamlets has in its second year seen childhood obesity declining against a rising nation trend, despite local deprivation
[normal].

[normal]Physiotherapists support the management 
[normal]and prevention

[normal]              
[normal]Current examples of effective integration of services across health, social care and other services which treat and manage long term conditions [bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]              
[normal]Liverpool City Council runs an ‘Exercise for Heath Scheme’ at 
[normal]its
[normal] leisure facilities. 
[normal]In 2008 the Musculoskeletal Therapy Team at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital 
[normal]started directly 
[normal]refe
[normal]r
[normal]r
[normal]ing
[normal] patients
[normal]. 
[normal]Among other benefits , this led to a reduction in

[normal]7.[bold]              [bold]The implications of an ag[bold]e[bold]ing population for the prevalence and type of long term conditions, together with evidence about the extent to which existing services will have the capacity to meet future demand [bold]&#xa0;
[normal]7.1
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapy rehabilitation has a crucial role in keeping older people independent 
[normal]and
[normal] restoring their independen
[normal]ce
[normal], reducing
[normal] the numbers of people requiring social care support or residential care, or delay
[normal]ing
[normal] the need for such support.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]              
[normal]Each year 35 per cent of over 65
[normal]’s
[normal], and around 45 per cent of people over 80 fall in the community.
[normal] 
[normal]Among the over 75’s injury from falls is the leading cause of mortality. 
[normal]Half of all people who have a fall will fall again in the next 12 months
[normal], 
[normal]increas
[normal]ing
[normal] mortality, rates of hospitalisation and institutionalisation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.3
[normal]              
[normal]The physiotherapy-led Glasgow Falls Prevention Programme sees nearly 175 patients a month in their homes to assess risk factors and intervene to modify these. Between 1998 and 2008 admissions due to falls in the home
[normal] reduced by
[normal] 32 per cent, 
[normal]falls in residential institutions by
[normal] 27 per cent and 
[normal]falls in the street by
[normal] nearly 40 per cent. Over the same period, the number of admissions for hip fractures decreased by 3.6 per cent (compared with an increase of nearly 2 per cent in England
[normal])
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]7.5
[normal]              
[normal]I
[normal]nvestment in community physiotherapy services for older people is poor in many parts of England
[normal], and
[normal] older people discharged from hospital and needing continuing rehabilitation, or those who have had a fall or a musculoskeletal injury at home, face long waiting
[normal] times
[normal]. This 
[normal]increases
[normal] dependency 
[normal]on
[normal] social services and 
[normal]the NHS.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.[bold]              [bold]The interaction between mental health conditions and long term physical health conditions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1
[normal]              
[normal]Four million people with long term 
[normal]physical 
[normal]conditions also have a mental health problems
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For many people the experience of a 
[normal]LTC
[normal], including chronic pain, can result in 
[normal]anxiety, stress, 
[normal]depression and other mental health issues. 
[normal]There are psychological factors in behaviours around eating and exercise tha
[normal]t can cause or exacerbate some LTCs
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapists often work with psychologists on multidisciplinary teams for people with 
[normal]LTCs
[normal], and on mental health teams. 
[normal]As the ‘physical expert’, the physiotherapist has a key role in enabling physical activity for health promotion, disease prevention and relapse, and makes a significant contribution in the delivery of lifestyle, weight management and wellbeing programmes. They can act as care co-ordinator supporting service users to access services as and when needed. By utilising a rehabilitation and recovery model physiotherapists work with service users to develop and facilitate strategies for the journey through wellbeing and recovery.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.3
[normal]              
[normal]As part of 
[normal]multi-professional team
[normal]s,
[normal] physiotherapists support care pathways
[normal] and focus on the individual by: m
[normal]aximising service user independence
[normal]; i
[normal]mproving both physical and mental healthcare and the intrinsic link between the two
[normal]; d
[normal]emonstrating flexibility in their role to improve person-centred care
[normal]; w
[normal]orking across sector and agency boundaries as part of integrated care pathways.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.[bold]              [bold]The extent to which patients are offered personalised services (including evidence of their contribution to better outcomes)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1
[normal]              
[normal]Physiotherapists are ideally placed to support the personalisation agenda, using their broad skills set to empower patients to take responsibility for their own health and ach
[normal]ieve patient-
[normal]centred outcomes.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2
[normal]              
[normal]S
[normal]elf-referral to physiotherapy is an excellent example of a personalised service w
[normal]hich leads to better outcomes.

[normal], which is part of Homerton University NHS Trust
[normal] and manages 89
[normal] per cent
[normal] of musculoskeletal patients in the community.
[normal] The Locomotor service has a chronic pain interdisciplinary service within it, allowing a smooth pathway from initial physiotherapy assessment to interdisciplinary management. The Locomotor sets goals 
[normal]with patients with chronic pain, to achieve personal function and quality of life goals. Patients are taught to manage persistent pain and flare-ups, and as a result visit 
[normal]A
[normal]&amp;
[normal]E and their GPs with pain less frequently. Patients are also taught how to manage their medicines.
