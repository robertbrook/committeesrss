However, \nthe decision \nappears to have been \ntaken within HMRC/HMT that the scope of the consultation should not be extend\ned\n. \nThe Law Society believes that this would have been a good \nopportunity\n \nfor HMRC/ HMT \nto capitali\ns\ne on the good work that had been done in the consultation process.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nLess effective consultations&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n              \n9\n              \n \n              \nA review of two aspects of the Tax Rules on \nPartnerships,\n published on 20 May 2013 and ran until 9 August 2013. \n \n              \nIssued on 10 December 2013.\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-review-of-two-aspects-of-the-tax-rules-on-partnerships\n \n              \nSee para\ngraph 2.8 and paragraph 3.6 of the May 2013 consultation document.\n \n              \nModernising\n the taxation of corporate debt and derivative contracts: December 2013.\n \n              \nParagraphs 3.6-3.20 of Summary of Responses 10 December 2013.\n \nhttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/esma\nnnual/esm0500.htm\n \nHMRC: “Partnerships: A review of two aspects of the tax rules: Summary of Responses” (10 December 2013), \npara\n 1.7\n \nSchedule 45 Finance Act 2012.\n \nSchedule 2 Finance Act 2012.\n \nThe Patent Box: Technical Note and Guide to Finance Bill \n2012 Clauses.\n \nPossible changes to income tax rules as interest: March 2012.\n \nHMRC \nconsultation document:\n Tax treaties anti-avoidance (1 August 2011).\n \nDiscussion document and draft guidance on tax and procurement.\n \nReform of Close Company Loans to Par\nticipator Rules – July 2013.\n"
