Yes. \n&#xa0;\nIf so, how can it be guaranteed that the public interest plays a decisive role in their negotiations? &#xa0;See paragraphs above. \n&#xa0;\nWould such a body ie a debates commission represent the best way of ensuring the public interest is paramount in such matters? &#xa0;\nNo. \n&#xa0;\nWhat would be the arguments for the establishment of such a body? &#xa0;\nNone are evident to us. \n&#xa0;\nWhat would be the arguments against the establishment of such a body?&#xa0;See paragraphs above\n. &#xa0;\nHow should a new independent body be established? &#xa0;\nSee above as to why we are not in favour of such a body.  \n&#xa0;\nHow could it ensure that the relevant broadcasters and political parties would participate and to do so according to its rules and guidance?&#xa0;\nWe do not consider it is appropriate for any body to seek to enforce the participation of political parties in television programming.  It is a matter for them.    \n&#xa0;\nWhat principles should guide the body responsible for this system in determining its view on some of the thorny questions it would face e.g. which political parties should participate? &#xa0;It is a matter for the broadcasters to decide which political parties should be invited to participate, both in the debate itself, and in any related programming.  Any party that felt itself unreasonably excluded can complain to the relevant regulator, and thereafter to the courts.       \n&#xa0;\nWhat relationship should the new body have, if any, with the Electoral Commission? &#xa0;We see no rationale for involvement in this process by the Electoral Commission. \n&#xa0;\nOn any one of these questions, what lessons can the UK learn from other democracies with an established tradition of election debates eg. Australia, Canada, Sweden, Norway, USA etc?&#xa0;Given the very different traditions of broadcast regulation of these other territories, we take the view that there are relatively limited lessons to be drawn.     \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
