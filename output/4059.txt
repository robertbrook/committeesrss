[[[Summary]]]

[[[The Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting Industry]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Joint Industry Board for the Electrical Contracting Industry (JIB) is a not for profit organisation. It was established in 1968 by The Electrical Contractors’ Association and the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union (now part of Unite the Union). Further information on the JIB is available on its website at www.jib.org.uk

[[[The Electrotechnical Certification Scheme]]]2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS) is jointly owned by the Joint Industry Board (JIB) and its sister organisation, the Scottish Joint Industry Board (SJIB). The primary aims of the Scheme are to set standards for individual competence, to assess competence against the standards within the Scheme and to accredit competence through the issue of ECS cards to individuals.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Scheme developed from the JIB and SJIB Grading Systems, which were introduced in 1968 by the JIB and in 1969 by the SJIB.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The UK Register of Electricians was established in 1993 to accredit electricians who could demonstrate competence equivalent to the standards of the National Vocational Qualification (N/SVQ) at Level 3.5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In 1999 the JIB Grading System was merged with the UK Register of Electricians to form one industry recognised scheme under the Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS). The scheme became available to all individuals who could demonstrate that they met the required standards.6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The ECS was affiliated to the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) in 2002 following the introduction of Health and Safety Assessments. These were implemented following a call in February 2001 by the Deputy Prime Minister for the construction industry to improve its safety record.7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; A total of over 111,000 cards are held across the UK, with 98,000 cards currently held by individuals based in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, of which over 48,000 are Installation Electricians. A further 13,000 cards are held by individuals based in Scotland.8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Further information on the ECS is available on its website at www.ecscard.org.uk

[[[Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations]]]9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The introduction of Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations in 2005 set minimum standards for the first time for electrical installation work in dwellings.10. Competent Person Schemes took the domestic sector forward by introducing the registration of Qualified Supervisors by electrical companies. The Qualified Supervisor is responsible for signing off work and in doing so warranting that the work has been undertaken in accordance with all parts of the Building Regulations and that the electrical installation has been executed in accordance with the UK wiring regulations (BS 7671). 11. The use of initial and subsequent annual assessments of the electrical business by a Competent Person Scheme helps to set and maintain standards.12. The concept of Competent Person Schemes, which ensure that companies comply with Building Standards, is however incomplete without the accreditation of the competence of the individuals who actually undertake the work.13. It should be noted that whilst the Qualified Supervisor is responsible for signing off work under Part ‘P’, they may not have personally undertaken the work. This point is particularly important in the case of electrical installations and repairs because much of the work is hidden. 14. The JIB offers to work with the Competent Person Schemes to accredit the competence of each individual who undertakes electrical installation work in the domestic sector in England and Wales within the scope of Part ‘P’ of the Building Regulations.15. In each case the individual’s qualifications and experience will be considered in accordance with the rules of the ECS and an appropriate ECS card will be issued to that individual.16. The ECS will then become the UK wide scheme for the accreditation of the competence of electricians. This will provide confidence for consumers and clarity for the industry. &#xa0;
