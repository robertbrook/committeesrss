defaulttates (ECOWAS)
default region of Africa to underscore the significance of  inclusive 
defaulte
defaultducation
default,
default and how it would accelerate  access to quality 
defaulte
defaultducation by children with disabilities. 
defaultMany children
default,
default 
defaultof 
defaultwhom most are psychologically or physically disabled
default,
default are prevented from going to school simply because no one thought about integrating adapted learning, teaching and construction facilities to accommodate them. 
defaultNot less that 5% of the total children population in the countries of the region have been projected to have one disability or another (ANCEFA Report ECOWAS, 2013)
defaultThe first shocking revelation is that there is absolutely no reliable 
defaultdisaggregated 
defaultdata 
default showing
default  statistics 
defaulton the number 
defaultof  disabled children, 
defaultless 
default 
defaultstill 
defaulton the nature of 
defaulttheir 
defaultdisability. ANCEFA and partners thus heavily rooted for an inclusive 
defaulte
defaultducation process that would ensure that EVERY child is in school
default,
default and LEARNING. Development partners have thus been called upon to support the process
default,
default with governments being asked to take the lead
default,
default since delivery of 
defaultinclusive education 
default should be the top priority of every government
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultFurther, disabled children and girls in rural areas do not go to school and in urban areas, special schools are insufficient. Consequently, most disabled children are totally excluded from the educational system.
default&#xa0;
defaultInclusive 
defaulte
defaultducation relates to all children accessing and meaningfully participating in quality 
defaulte
defaultducation in ways that are responsive to their individual needs. Inclusive education is therefore expected to meet EVERYONE’s rights to Education.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is universally agreed that every child has a fundamental right to 
defaulte
defaultducation
default and that every child CAN Learn. Further every stakeholder
default,
default and 
defaultevery 
defaultlead agenc
defaulty, 
default including governments and donor aid agencies
default,
default should acknowledge and respect differences in children. Education structures, systems and methodologies must meet the needs of 
defaultall 
default children, and where historically disabled children have been discriminated against, schools have to accommodate children with special educational needs and redress the past imbalance
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultIncreasing awareness and vigilance among communities, enhancing capacity building of MPs and journalists on inclusive education, budget tracking and child rights, advocacy on inclusive education and increased budget allocations, popularization of instruments and texts on children
defaults’
default rights, 
defaultand 
defaultsensitization and lobbying using diverse means should help address the problem
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultNational and international partnerships need to be enhanced to tackle the perennial exclusion of the children with disability from education. A call to all international aid agencies to promote this would be a welcome move.
