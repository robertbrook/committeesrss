"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Marine Conservation Society&#xa0;Summary1.1 \nThe designation of the first \n27 Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) in English Seas is a welcome start to the English component of \nGovernment’s\n now overdue obligation to deliver\n a\n well managed E\ncologically \nC\noherent \nN\network\n (ECN)\n of Marine Protected Areas\n (MPAs) in UK Seas\n.\n However, it is just a start since the first 27 sites represent less than a quarter of the 127 MCZs originally proposed collaboratively by scientists, fishermen, industry, NGOs and local stakeholders as necessary to deliver the English contribution to a UK ECN. We are still a long way from the complete network necessary to arrest the alarming decline in  our marine biodiversity, and those goods and services it provides. This submission will detail:\n&#xa0;\n1.2 On the Committee’s question on the “levels of ambition”To date a lack of political will to drive meaningful change is evident through: (a) the rending down of the process to a “cherry picking” of sites, rather than seeking a full network; (b) the misinformation of existing levels of MPA protection in English waters.\n&#xa0;\nNonetheless, the recent commitment to two future tranches of MCZs in English Seas in 2015/16 offers promise, providing they are each more ambitious than the first tranche. Government has the scope to learn from some of the mistakes in delivering the first tranche of 27 MCZs, and deliver the kind of ambitious designations and protection necessary to deliver an effective network for our seas.      \n&#xa0;\n1.3 On the Committee’s question on the evidence base for further zonesThe burden of proof has shifted to now require “robust” scientific evidence for each individual feature within each MCZ, contradicting the original guidance that “best available” evidence should be used in developing the network. This shift is an unnecessary and unrealistic goal, with limitless costs. Evidence requirements should be reasonably obtainable considering the urgent timescales. The only context in which we can reasonably discuss “robust science” is in detailing declining biodiversity of our seas. Indeed, this was the very stimulus for the MCZ policy; that the “costs of inaction” were too great.  \n&#xa0;\n1.4 On the Committee’s questions on the “balance of factors” for decisions on future sites Bottom towed fishing gear cannot continue to be permitted to destroy our remaining marine biodiversity. There needs to be a comprehensive network of MCZs to arrest decline and foster recovery in marine biodiversity, and there is an increasing wealth of evidence demonstrating how full networks of MPAs are effective tools in doing so. Furthermore, as well as there being a strong scientific imperative for designating a full network of MPAs, there is also a strong economic rationale given the goods and services our seas provide, in addition to the overwhelming and wide ranging societal support.\n&#xa0;\n1.6 On the Committee’s questions on management measures We are extremely concerned about the following management issues, which could render MCZs little more than paper parks:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDefra, the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) and Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) are considering a voluntary approach to the management of fisheries in sites, despite the fact this has been shown to be ineffective on numerous occasions. While a participative approach engaging local stakeholders is important, \nit is vital that management \ndecisions are still based on \neffective deliver\ny\n \nof \nthe \nstatutory \nconservation objectives\n. C\nonservation objectives, a\nnd in turn\n management measures\n,\n should be set out per site, not per \n“feature”, according to the Marine Act. \n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is vital that IFCAs,\n or appropriate regulators\n,\n are \nsufficiently\n resourced \n- \nwith either funding or\n the\n mandate \nto implement \nbye-laws\n - \nto monitor and enforce these sites\n. \n&#xa0;Responses to Committee’s Lines of Inquiry&#xa0;2. (Q.5) “The level of ambition in the programme to establish protected areas (including MCZs), compared with the need for biodiversity protection.”&#xa0;\n2.1 The Committee’s scrutiny of the “level of ambition” is the most pertinent point in the Inquiry. MCS believe that the present level of ambition falls considerably below what is needed to achieve Government’s stated vision of “clean, healthy, safe, productive, biologically diverse oceans and seas”. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 The need for better protection of marine biodiversity has never been greater, to halt its decline and ensure the sustainability of the already overstretched goods and services provided by our seas. The overwhelming evidence of the decline in our marine biodiversity is detailed later in this submission. However, we should not loose sight that the very stimulus for the MCZ policy was an assessment - principally through the \nReview of Marine Nature Conservation \nand later \nCharting Progress \nand \nCharting Progress 2\n reports - that the “costs of inaction” were unacceptably high. This demand for better protection and management is not presently matched sufficiently by a supply of political will to deliver a full network. Reference to “political will” in this submission is made not solely in relation to Defra, but more broadly to the Coalition Government. We believe political will was reduced because:\n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the political climate of austerity, Government has been blinded by minimising short term costs, however small, thereby disregarding the huge long term gains.\n&#xa0;\n(b)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment has overestimated what is already protected in MPAs. \n&#xa0;\nMPAs &amp; Politics of Austerity2.3 The designation of a full network of MPAs is presently defined principally by the aim of minimising what is viewed as undue burden on the status quo for industry. This is clearly shown by the fact that when consulting on the 31MCZs proposed in the first tranche, the Government Impact Assessment\n only calculated the costs to industry \n(often as little \nas £1,000 per year). It made no\n attempt to quantify the benefits that would be delivered by the sites, or network as a whole\n. Furthermore, no quantification was made of the\n \n“costs of inaction”\n – the fundamental stimulus of the MCZ policy. \n&#xa0;\n2.4 This approach results in decisions being premised solely on narrow economic valuations of private commercial interests, and therefore disregarding the substantial benefits that will be realised by a much broader group of society. \nEven when numerous academic studies (detailed \nlater\n) have sought to ascribe firmer values to the benefits provided by\n MPAs and our marine ecosystems -\n as well as the costs of doing nothing\n -\n the methodologies \nhave been\n \nchallenged\n by Government\n,\n \ndespite the fact that environmental economic methodologies have now been well established. In often discounting\n these studies they also disregard the huge cost\n incurred by society from \nthe\n continued\n degradation of marine habitats and species. Despite the clear and recognised evidence detailing the social, economic and environmental imperative for this network, the \nreluctance to\n ascrib\ne\n firm monetary figures compatible with the narrow framework of valuation within which we \ncurrently\n operate, means that short-term\n economic costs continue to trump broader long term valuations.\n \nThe result is that the pursuit of a functional network \nhas been rendering down to a\n cherry picking \nof \nsites\n, disregarding the scientific advice that was issued to design the original network. \n&#xa0;\nInflated claims on existing levels of protection2.5 The lack of ambition is also driven by Defra providing misleading information, suggesting that we already have extensive levels of marine protection in English seas. This derives from inflating both the number of MPAs, as well as the level of protection they receive. The recent announcement on the first 27 MCZs stated that we already have over 500 MPAs. This was a gross inflation, as it included 377 coastal SSSIs, of which only 113 have what can be described as “a marine component”. The figure also includes double accounting - many of the 44 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and 44 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) cover the same area, and indeed almost all of those SSSIs with a marine component overlap with these SACs and SPAs. \n&#xa0;\n2.6 In addition to inflating the number of sites, the “feature based approach” to marine protection which is presently employed, remarkably, means that vast areas of a designated MPA are often afforded no protection whatsoever. \nAn MPA will be set aside for a given “feature”, such as a reef. However while the MPA may span a 100km2 area, if the extent of the feature for which the MPA is designated only covers a couple of km2, then in the majority of cases \nit is only this small area that is “protected”. This hugely reductionist approach results is grossly inflated \nfigures\n as to the extent of marine protection.\n \nWhile over 25% of inshore waters may fall within designated MPAs, far less - likely less than 1% - can truly be described as “protected areas”. The 25% figure includes Special \nProtection Areas for birds (7.5% of inshore seas) and Special Areas of Conservation (15.5% of inshore seas), neither of which presently adequately protect the seabed\n.\n \nMCZs\n therefore have a critical role in increasing\n the area of inshore \nseafloor \nhabitats under protection\n \nand to address the\n \nlack of offshore sites under adequate protection.\n Further detail on the\n impact of th\nis\n “feature based” approach \nto \nthe management of \ndesignated MPAs\n \nis set \nlater in this submission.\n However, the key point is that figures outlining the % of our seas designated as MPAs do no equate to the percentage being properly protected. The net result of grossly inflated figures drives down political ambition. \n&#xa0;\n2.7 Nonetheless, within the commitment to a second and third tranche of Marine Conservation Zones in English Seas in 2015 and 2016, the Government has the opportunity to evidence its stated ambition. Where there has been sufficient political to deliver full networks of MPAs - such as in Australia and California - the benefits are already being seen (detailed later).  Proper valuation of the marine environment would demonstrate the economic, social and environmental imperative of designating a full network. \n&#xa0;3. (Q.3) “The plans to improve the evidence base for considering potential further Zones, including the priorities and funding of the research bodies that will undertake the necessary research.\n”\n&#xa0;3.1 There are two key factors in understanding the levels of scientific knowledge for each proposed MCZ. Firstly, the difficulties in gathering scientific data in the marine realm,\n \nand secondly the unique process through which the network was proposed.  \nI\nn the absence of perfect information we should \ntake a precautionary approach to decisions affecting our\n natural capital, \nbasing\n decision\ns\n \nnot \non what we cannot prove, but\n \non \nwhat we know – that our natural capital in the marine environment is under unsustainable levels of pressure, and that the designation of \nMPAs\n represents an effectiv\ne tool to arrest this decline. \n&#xa0;Designing the MCZ Network3.2 \nTraditionally, MPAs \nhave been set up by identifying, and then designating, \nthe most scientifically important sites\n. This has sometimes resulted in stakeholders feeling isolated, and the subsequent MPAs lacking in local buy-in or understanding.\n \nHowever, \nthe\n \ntwo year stakeholder-led \nMCZ proposal process was\n \nuniquely defined by its continuous due regard for local socio-economic impact. \nWhile this\n central consideration of socio-economics result\ned\n in some scientifically robust and ecologically rich areas being dro\npped from the final proposals, it \nensured that the\n network of 127 sites represented\n a working compromise between ecological protection and mitigating socio-economic impact. \n&#xa0;\n3.3 Not only because of this approach - which sought a network that represented a workable compromise - but because of the enormous difficulties in data gathering in the marine environment, \nGovernment recognised the need for a pragmatic approach to the burden of proof on evidence requirements within its original recommendations for MCZ site selection. \n&#xa0;\n“\nN\network design should be based on the best information currently available. Lack of full scientific certainty should not be a reason for postponing proportionate decisions on site selection\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.4 This\n original approach to the burden of proof on evidence has widespread \nscientific \nsupport. \nThe \nHouse of Commons \nScience and Technology Select Committee\n’s\n Marine Science Inquiry stated:\n&#xa0;\n“We consider that the Government should adhere to its standard of best available evidence, as set out in its initial Marine Conservation Zone guidance, that “network design should be based on the best information currently available” and “lack of full scientific certainty should not be a reason for postponing proportionate decisions on site selection”.\n&#xa0;\nA balance needs to be struck between obtaining an adequate evidence base for Marine Conservation Zones and allowing the process to move forward in the face of uncertainty. Government’s initial guidance on Marine Conservation Zones required use of the best information currently available to underpin site selection.\n \nDelays to the designation process increase uncertainty amongst stakeholders, which causes anxiety, particularly to those local stakeholders who hear scare stories about draconian future management measures.” \n&#xa0;\n3.5 \nFollowing the publication of the Committee\n’s\n report, 86 eminent scientists from the UK’s marine biology community - including five members of the independent Science Advisory Panel commissioned to review the proposed network of MCZs - wrote to the Prime Minister, in support of the proposed network.\n \n \n \nDemanding “robust” science on the exact presence of every single feature represents a limitless endeavour, \nincurring prohibitively large costs\n.\n \nYet, the Government continues to point to a lack of “robust evidence” as justification for delays in implementing the full network.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.6 \nWe believe that this newfound demand for “robust evidence” as the burden of proof on levels of evidence required to designate an MCZ - and thus the attrional pace of progress to date \n-\n derives from an unduly narrow and tight interpretation of a “feature”. \nSection 116 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 sets out the scientific justification for designation of an MCZS:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmarine flora or fauna;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nmarine habitats or types of marine habitat;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nfeatures of geological or geomorphological interest.\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe protected feature or features;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe conservation objectives for the MCZ.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.7 While the Act requires there to be a protected feature, and thus to be some scientific certainty of the presence of the protected feature, “protected feature” is defined very loosely. MCZs can be designated for rare or threatened species, but can also be designed for straightforward general conservation of marine flora and fauna: you don’t need to have rare species present to designate. \nThere thus appears to be no obligation to define a “feature” for designation in such narrow terms, nor require the provision of robust evidence for each feature to justify the designation of a site. &#xa0;\n3.8 The Act also highlights a critical point regarding levels of ambition on issue of scale. Clause 123 makes clear that\n the UK cannot just consider ecological coherence and protection of features a\nt the OSPAR biogeographic scale; it is the\n UK marine area for w\nhich a network must be formed, \nand that network must represent the full range of features present in the UK marine area. As such even if \nother member states in the EU\n have good representation for a specific feature in a biogeographic zone, the UK must still designate its own site(s) for that feature. The UK network therefore needs to represent all of the broad-scale habitats and Features of Conservation Importance (FOCI) listed in the Ecological Network Guidance (ENG) to represent the full range of features and associated species and biotopes within the UK marine area. \n&#xa0;\nEvidence of Decline3.9 \nArguably the only context in which we can discuss “robust science” within the marine realm is in detailing the decline in the economic productivity and biodiversity of our seas.\n In UK seas alone, 28 species of mammals and fish are considered to be threatened\n,\n and only 11 of the 58 main commercial fish stocks found around the British Isles are known to be in a healthy state\n. \nIn the UK, it has been calculated that landings of demersal fish stocks per unit of fishing power have declined by 94% since 1884\n.\n \nCharting Progress\n and \nCharting Progress 2\n, as well numerous peer reviewed scientific studies and \nthe 201\n1 National Ecosystem Assessment\n (NEA)\n, have demonstrated the chronic widespread degradation that bottom trawling can have on benthic habitats\n,\n including rock, sediment and deep sea habitats. \nOnly recently, a study found that a single pass of a heavy fishing trawl on a pristine mussel bed resulted in a 90% reduction in the epifaunal community, and a significant loss in biodiversity.\n A year later the same site was surveyed, with virtually no recovery evident. \n&#xa0;\n3.10 \nThe NEA calculated that the contribution of marine \nbiodiversity in the UK alone at\n £1.7bn per year. Furthe\nrmore, the NEA reiterated the need\n for a network of MPAs by observing that while the UK’s seas are important to people’s quality of life, they are significantly are less well protected - of the 621 Special Areas of Conservation \npresently \ndesignated in the UK, only 81 of these are designated \nwithin the\n marine environment. \nThe scale of biodiversity degradation and disparity between levels of protection in the marine and terrestrial environment should thus be the driving \nforce behind for the MCZ policy, not agonising over but impossible pursuit of “robust” evidence for every single feature within an MCZ in order to justify its need.\n&#xa0;4. (Q.4) “What the balance of factors should be — social and economic factors, as well as environmental factors — in considering further potential MCZs.”\n&#xa0;\n4.1 \nTo a certain extent, the Committee’s reference to \na \n“balance of factors” for future tranches perpetuates a dangerous false dichotomy; decisions\n between “economy” or the\n “environment”. \nAs the \nrecently departed Fisheries Minister\n,\n Richard Benyon MP\n, commented \nduring a debate on biodiversity:\n&#xa0;\n“It is estimated that the degradation of our planet's ecosystems costs us some £42 billion each year\n \n-\n \na figure that could rise to the equivalent of 7% of global gross domestic product by 2050. We are choosing to lose the valuable benefits of a healthy natural environment on a massive scale. A vibrant natural environment is not a luxury for the good times\n \n-\n \nit is a necessity for economic recovery and sustainable growth in the long term”.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2 In selecting the first sites for designation, d\necisions taken to date \nhave been dictated by\n a very narrow definition of socio-economic costs.\n It is also important to remember the central role that socio-economics played when selecting sites and designing the network. An accurate valuation of our marine biodiversity will continue to loose out to commercial interests unless the full range of the benefits it provides to industry, the economy, the environment and wider society are properly accounted for and considered in decision-making.\n \nThe\n habitats\n proposed for protection\n are the building blocks of our marine ecosystems, providing direct\n use\n benefits for\n sustainable fishermen, anglers and\n divers, as well as \nrecognised non-use benefits to wider society\n. \nThe NEA reiterated\n the importance of recognising that the \nseafloor habitats that MCZs\n will protected\n are the foundations of the vast array of goods and services that our seas provide\n:\n&#xa0;\n“It is imperative that these plans (M\nPAs\n) consider the components of \nm\narine habitats not only in terms of biodiversity and habitats, but also with regards to ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services and benefits. The use of monetary and non-monetary valuation of ecosystem services will aid the process of considering the impacts and benefits of development on Marine habitats\n.\n” (NEA, 2011, p.462)\n&#xa0;\nThe Benefits of MPAs4.3 Increasingly, it is not only the declining health and productivity of the marine environment that has been well documented.\n A wealth of scientific \nand economic \nevidence is emerging validating the important role that \nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs)\n can play in fostering recovery. \nWell-managed \nMPAs\n can be thought of as ‘ecological bank accounts’, enabling the recovery of ‘capital’, while continuing to support local industries through the overspill of ‘interest’. \nA scientific review of \nMPA\n performance in 2009 revealed that MPAs produced on average a 450% increase in biomass, 120% increase in abundance, and 20% increase in biodiversity\n.\n Within the UK:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.4 Government’s statutory government conservation bodies - JNCC and Natural England - engaged substantial outside expertise in the latest scientific understanding and global best practice in creating the design principles set out in the \nEcological Network Guidance\n \n(ENG). The ENG represented a world-class process, the outcome of which could be a world-class network of marine protection. \n&#xa0;\n4.5 \nThese first 27 MCZS alone will not deliver the recovery of English seas that the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 was passed to achieve.\n Networks of marine protected areas - as opposed to isolated or scattered protection - are necessary in order to sustain habitats and species at large spatial scales over the long term. They are designed so as to represent the full spectrum of biodiversity, to ensure protected areas are of sufficient size and coverage to maintain viable populations, and that they are close enough to be mutually supporting through exchange of wildlife and their offspring. \n&#xa0;Society’s Values4.6 \nIt is not only the valuations of the direct economic goods and services provided by the seas that should be acknowledged\n, but valuations of society\n. In 2012, there were 163 million tourism day visits \nto the UK coast, grossing\n an estimated £9.51 billion to economy\n. \nThe Marine Conservation Society’s \nYour Seas Your Voice\n campaign\n 2012 found the public wanted healthier seas for a variety of reasons, including: \nfuture generations; aesthetic values; personal significance; emotional attachment; the wide range of plants and animals; and social responsibility.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.7 \nThe designation of an ecologically coherent network of MPAs has a broad and substantial constituency. In June 2013 eNGOs Marine Conservation Society, the Wildlife Trusts, the RSPB delivered a petition of over 350,000 signatures in support of MCZs to No. 10 Downing Street. MCZs have the full support of these eNGOs, whose combined memberships extend into the millions and whose support for MCZs has been demonstrated time and time again over the years through campaigns such as\n:\n \nMarine Conservation Society’s\n \nMarine Reserves Now, Your Seas Voic\ne and ongoing campaign for MCZs;\n \nthe Wildlife Trusts’ \nPetition Fish\n;\n and Hugh’s Fish Fight\n. These\n are\n clear public demonstrations of support for better protection of our seas which decision-makers need to take account of. The Sea User’s Development Group, whose members include UK Oil &amp; Gas and Associated of British Ports, have also signed a joint statement with Wildlife &amp; Countryside Link eNGOs in support of an ecologically coherent network of MPAs. There also remains cross party support to see the full ecologically coherent network \ndelivered. \n \n&#xa0;\n5. (Q.1) “The plans for implementing the 27 so far approved MCZs.” &amp; (Q2). “How those MCZs will be monitored, managed and enforced, and the needs of different stakeholders — including fishing, leisure and extractive industries — will be balanced against environment protection.”&#xa0;5.1 That has been scaremongering from some quarters that MCZs will be wholesale no-take zones; MCZs will only prevent activities that damage seafloor habitats, likely affording low impact fishing methods such as potting and static gear the opportunity to flourish at sustainable levels. The full network of MCZs, even when added to existing MPAs, would\n \nstill only place less than 25\n% of our seas\n in sustainably managed areas. Put another way\n, over three quarters of our seas wou\nld still be open to potentially more damaging practices. \n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nMCS recognises the importance of consulting at the local level in the development of the management plans to achieve the conservation objectives of the first 27 MCZs. However it is vital that such consultation is guided\n by two overriding objectives:\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nM\nanagement will effectively deliver the \nstatutory \nconservation objectives \nfor the site.\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInshore Fisheries/Conservation Authorities or appropriate regulators are appropriately resourced with either funding or\n the\n mandate \nto implement \nbye-laws to monitor and enforce these sites. \nWithout effective management that is appropriate funded, designated MPAs are little more than paper parks. \n&#xa0;5.3 We are extremely concerned that Defra, the MMO and IFCAs are considering a voluntary approach to the management of fisheries in sites. Voluntary measures in isolation have repeatedly been proven not to work, to provide no legal recourse, to be highly time consuming and extremely expensive\n1\n. Without some form of legal redress in enforcing these statutory conservation objectives, the good work of many fishermen can be undermined by a minority. \n&#xa0;\nAlso, the assertion that a number of successful locally \nmanaged\n MPAs are “voluntary” is often misleading. For instance, the strides being made in \nLyme Bay \nare underpinned by a statutory \ndesignation and statutory instrument \n– Lyme Bay \nis \ndesignated by law as a Special Area of Conservation.\n The original voluntary memorandum reached to protect the reefs by local scallop dredgers was not enough to prevent damage caused by scallop dredgers from outside the area. A\n regulatory fail safe\n - the Lyme Bay Statutory Instrument (2008) - was essential to ensure that \nthe good work of many cannot be permanently ruined by the few\n. W\nitho\nut some legal form of redress, achieving the \nscientifically established \nconservation objective for the site and s\nafeguard\ning it \nfrom potential damage\n is likely to fail\n. \nA recent report investigating the merits of “voluntary” vs. statutory management by RSPB and Wales Environment Link came to the following conclusions\n:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n28\n January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/03/scientists-ministers-seas-marine-life\n \n \nIUCN (2011).
