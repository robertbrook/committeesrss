Immigration detainees should be funded to challenge the lawfulness of their detention regardless of their ties to the UK. In our immigration removal centre (IRC) inspections we repeatedly find detainees held for years at a time. Several have successfully challenged the lawfulness of their detention using legal aid. Removing the right to legal aid for such individuals may increase the likelihood that these cases will remain unresolved. &#xa0;25.              The 2011 Independent Monitoring Board annual report of Harmondsworth raised significant concerns relating to the treatment of detainees suffering from mental health issues. Since 2011, the High Court has found in favour of four individuals who have brought cases against the UK Border Agency. The court found inter alia that the defendants had been falsely imprisoned and subject to inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of their Article 3 rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The introduction of a residency test makes it less likely that this type of ill-treatment will come to the attention of the courts. &#xa0;26.              Taking all this evidence into consideration, we consider that the residence test should not be introduced in civil legal aid cases to individuals who are detained. While the test would apply to UK residents, its impact would disproportionately affect foreign nationals and therefore be discriminatory. In this way, the proposals undermine the principle of equity in access to legal aid, which requires special measures to be taken to ensure meaningful access to legal aid for “stateless persons, asylum seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and migrant workers, refugees and internally displaced persons”. We are concerned at the proposed changes which will: restrict access to justice for vulnerable immigration detainees; remove funds for mentally ill detainees to challenge the lawfulness of their detention; and not assist failed asylum seekers with further representations. &#xa0;

[[[overnment’s response]]]

[[[              ]]]&#xa0;27.               In its reply to our response the government argued that:&#xa0;              ‘HMIP’s annual report contains a comparison of survey scores of prisoners who consider themselves to have a disability and those who do not; these data include prisoners with a physical disability as well as those with mental health issues and/or learning disabilities. HMIP’s 2011-12 Annual Report (latest available) indicates the following: &#xa0;

[[[Q. Is t]]]

[[[here a member of staff in this prison that you can turn to for help if you have a problem? ]]]Disabled – 76% Yes Non-disabled – 75% Yes &#xa0;              We acknowledge that HMIP’s response to the consultation contained data indicating that prisoners with mental health issues and/or learning disabilities (as well as prisoners generally) did not have confidence in the complaints system and that outcomes were poor. However, the information from the 2011-12 Annual Report referred to above suggests a different picture in terms of accessibility, willingness to use the system and the potential for reasonable adjustments to be made when comparing disabled and non-disabled prisoners. Although respondents had concerns around potential impacts on these prisoners we consider the processes set out in PSI 02/2012 (Prisoner complaints), PSI 32/2011 (Ensuring equality) and 75/2011 (Residential services) are sufficient to ensure they are able to make effective use of the complaints system and access the other alternative means of redress.’&#xa0;28. The figures quoted by the Government are incorrect.  The actual figures used in the 2011/12 annual report can be found below:              

[[[Q. Is it easy to get a complaints ]]]

[[[form]]]

[[[? ]]]Disabled – 79% Yes Non-disabled – 81% Yes 

[[[Q. Have you made a complaint? ]]]Disabled – 54% Yes Non-disabled – 46% Yes 

[[[Q. Is there a member of staff in this prison that you can turn to for help if you have a problem? ]]]Disabled – 71% Yes Non-disabled – 72% Yes &#xa0;29. In the first and second questions those who consider themselves as disabled found it significantly more difficult to get a complaints form and make a complaint, than prisoners who do not consider themselves disabled. The third question shows that there is no significant difference between those that consider themselves to have a disability and those that do not.&#xa0;30.              Our inspection evidence continually indicates that these groups of prisoners (as well as prisoners more generally) do not have confidence in the complaints system. Data in our 13/14 annual report, which is unpublished, found that responses from prisoners that considered themselves to have a disability were significantly worse than responses from their non-disabled counterparts. .  &#xa0;.

The government’s reply also raised the possibility of this inspectorate conducting a thematic inspection of the prison complaints system.  We would be open to discussing whether and how this should be progressed.              &#xa0;23 September 2013

Statistical significance is a way of estimating the likelihood that a difference between two samples indicates a real difference between populations from which the samples are taken, rather than being due to chance. The significance level is set at 0.05, which means that there is only a 5% chance that the difference in results is due to chance.
