[normal]Cinema Exhibitors’ Association – Written evidence[bold]DDB0039[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON THE DEREGULATION BILL[bold]LICENSING OF COMMUNITY FILM EXHIBITION [bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.[bold]              [bold]Summary[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Cinema Exhibitors’ Association 
[normal](CEA) 
[normal]represents the interests of well over 90 per cent of UK 
[normal]cinema operators by number and market share.
[normal] 
[normal] Our membership includes single sc
[normal]reen/owner-
[normal]managed sites as well as the largest circuit and multiplex operators.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]The CEA welcomes the Government’s commitment to deregulate
[normal] in
[normal] area
[normal]s of legislation where 
[normal]ev
[normal]idence 
[normal]exists 
[normal]that current regulation is unnecessary o
[normal]r ineffective. 
[normal] However, i
[normal]n this 
[normal]submission
[normal], which also formed its response to the DCMS consultation, 
[normal]the CEA argues that
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]In addition, the deregulation proposal
[normal] carries significant risks, including:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]              
[normal]Although it can be argued that some CEA members (who operate not-for-profit business models and/or who are firmly rooted in local community venues) may benefit from slightly reduced 
[normal]licensing costs, even those members have made plain to CEA that they do not support this deregulation proposal.  Licensing laws protect the quality of the exhibition of a film and service to customers and, having consulted with our members, there is a unit
[normal]ed view from both larger cinema circuits and smaller independent operators that the current process is logical and serves its purpose well.  The CEA and its members believe that, amongst other disbenefits, deregulation of certain venues could potentially d
[normal]evalue the cinema business and be damaging to the industry as a whole.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.5
[normal]              
[normal]The overall effect of th
[normal]e DCMS
[normal] proposal would be to reduce, not enhance, the quality of film exhibition services to the public. 
[normal]The[bold] [bold]CEA therefore [bold]has urged[bold] the Government no[bold]t to [bold]proceed with their[bold] proposal and to pursue Option 1[bold] of their consultation document[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]Comments on the Options[bold] as laid out in the DCMS Consultation [bold]on Community Film Exhibition[bold].[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The Impact Assessment (IA) suggests that the policy objectives and 
[normal]intended effects of this
[normal] [bold]proposal are as follows
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]“
[normal]1.   Remove unnecessary costs and burdens from suitable community film exhibitions
[normal] 2.   Help grow activities that encourage positive social outcomes
[normal] 3.   Ensure suitable child protection arrangements
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is suggested that these “
[normal]will reduce costs to civil society organisations and stimulate supply by removing a barrier to the exhibition of film
[normal]”.
[normal]  
[normal]However, neither the 
[normal]IA nor the 
[normal]consultation 
[normal]document offer
[normal] evidential support for these claims.
[normal]  Without s
[normal]uch evidence, Option 1 is the only sensible course of action.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal] 
[normal]No demand for deregulation has been demonstrated
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The IA goes through tortuous logic to estimate the possible number of community venues
[normal],
[normal] using a variety of survey sources and unexpla
[normal]ined assumptions.  At no point, however, does the IA – or the consultation document – give hard evidence that there is an unmet demand.  There is nothing other than assumption that the barrier to entry that the Government seeks to remove actually exists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.2
[normal]              
[normal]The Minister’s foreword to the consultation document says, “
[normal]we’ve
[normal] found many local screening and film clubs stop before they start
[normal]”.  No examples are given in the body of the document.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.3
[normal]              
[normal]No relevant data have been offered on the effect of Tempor
[normal]ary Event Notices (TENs) – which are a deregulatory target of this proposal.  Rather, the IA states that such a “
[normal]lack of data makes it difficult to assess the impact of policy measures on TEN licensing
[normal]” (IA, para 6.9)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2.4
[normal]              
[normal]It cannot be correct – and is a
[normal] negation of evidence-based policy making – to pursue any other course of action that Option 1.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal] 
[normal]No 
[normal]additional and distinct 
[normal]social benefit value has been quantified
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.1
[normal]              
[normal]No evidence has been offered that community film exhibition delivers the “
[normal]positive social outcomes
[normal]” claimed by the impact assessment.  In any case, the IA itself chooses not to make any claims for the value of 
[normal]additional or distinct 
[normal]social benefits and concedes that there “
[normal]is little research on these wellbeing effects
[normal]” (IA, para
[normal]s 6.19, 6.20).
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]4
[normal] 
[normal]Economic and social disbenefits have been ignored
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.1
[normal]              
[normal]Both t
[normal]he consultation document and the IA assert without evidence that the proposal will not affect the viability or distribution of commercial cinema operators, stating “
[normal]risks as
[normal]sociated with an increased number of film exhibitions do not materialise
[normal].” (IA, key assumptions, 
[normal]page 2)  Rather, conveniently, the IA suggests that “
[normal]any costs arising from substitution between not-for-profit and commercial cinema would be indirect and out
[normal] of scope
[normal]”. (IA, para 9.2)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.2
[normal]              
[normal]Additionally, since licensing authorities do not receive fees from community-based venues at present, any deregulation increases costs to local authorities, since they will be responsible for the administrative decision-ma
[normal]king incumbent in 
[normal]determining whether an organisation fitted within the 
[normal]‘
[normal]community premises
[normal]’
[normal] definition
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]Arguably this task is more subjective and so could be more labour-intensive and time-consuming than the current established process of granting a 
[normal]premises licence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.3
[normal]              
[normal]It is, in our view, inevitable that relaxations of the licensing regimes such as those proposed will increase the risks of film piracy. It is highly improbable
[normal] that a community venue 
[normal]will 
[normal]have the expertise or 
[normal]resources to 
[normal]enforce
[normal] 
[normal]the type of strong controls on 
[normal]illegal recording of films adopted by all 
[normal]commercial 
[normal]operators, which has seen the UK become a beacon 
[normal]of good practice in this regard
[normal]. This is quite aside from the likelihood that such a relaxation would offer implicit encour
[normal]agement to other venues such as pubs and clubs to show films, increasing the piracy risk.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.4
[normal]              
[normal]Film piracy is a real and continuous challenge for the film industry and it is a stated aim of Government - and in particular DCMS and BIS - to tackle such o
[normal]ffences. This deregulation proposal is inconsistent with that aim.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4.5
[normal]              
[normal]As stated elsewhere in this response, t
[normal]he benefit of a 
[normal]strict 
[normal]licen
[normal]sing regime for filmed entertainment is tha
[normal]t each venue would be clearly
[normal] registered and therefore on the radar of e
[normal]nforcement authorities such as FACT
[normal],
[normal] who
[normal]se 
[normal]role it is to support cinema venues in the fight against piracy
[normal], a problem which latest estimates indicate 
[normal]annually 
[normal]cost
[normal]s
[normal] the industry 
[normal]at least 
[normal]£220 million per year in lost box office alone.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal] 
[normal]Child 
[normal]protection measures remain opaque
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.1
[normal]              
[normal]Since proposals in this area were first raised,
[normal] the
[normal] CEA has been concerned to ensure that the current, effective, controls on admission of children to film exhibitions remain in place.  This proposal does not delive
[normal]r assurance.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.2
[normal]              
[normal]The IA asserts that beneficiaries of the proposal “
[normal]are likely to have a formal relationship with some form of local council and are likely to be governed by a formal organising committee
[normal]”. (IA, para 6.16)  However, a deregulated environ
[normal]ment would remove strong local authority oversight and visibility of ‘community groups’ and it cannot be realistic that all organisations wishing to take advantage
[normal] of the deregulation will be 
[normal]traditionally-constituted bodies.  Indeed, 
[normal]ad hoc
[normal] groups appear 
[normal]more likely to be created, perhaps to show material without certi
[normal]fication from dubious sources.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.3
[normal]              
[normal]The consultation document notes that age classification must be obtained for “
[normal]every film that is intended for national distribution in the UK
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal](Consultat
[normal]ion, para 12)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It is easy to envisage small populations with religious, ethnic or other special interests who might wish to exhibit films outwith this definition
[normal]. I
[normal]n
[normal] the most extreme cases, this may pose a risk to public safety and 
[normal]would not, we assume, be
[normal] the kind of activity which Government would wish to see fly beneath
[normal] relevant
[normal] authorities
[normal]’
[normal] radars
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The consultation document recognises that the proposal would lead to “
[normal]less direct licensing authority control over the operation of film content in the 
[normal]venues in question
[normal]” (Consultation, para 34)
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5.4
[normal]              
[normal]Whilst the consultation document suggests that “
[normal]films that do not have such
[normal] [a formal age] 
[normal]classification would not be permitted for exhibition
[normal]” (Consultation, para 44), the ‘education, instruction, infor
[normal]mation’ exemptions of Part 2, Sch 1 of the 2003 Act would still offer comfort to unlicensed film exhibitors if this proposal were to be enacted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]Further [bold]concerns about[bold] Option 2[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]The CEA do
[normal]es
[normal] not believe the current structure of Option 2 will me
[normal]et
[normal] the DCMS’ desired objectives. 
[normal]Rather, deregulation as reflected in the proposal would create new loopholes in strong oversight of film exhibition and may add perverse incentives to avoid such oversight.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]CEA recognises that the
[normal] upper audience limi
[normal]t of 500 is intended to reflect parity with deregulation of theatrical and dance venues
[normal].  However, this limit is far too high when considered in the context of film exhibition
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]On this basis, a significant 
[normal]majority of independent 
[normal]cinema theatres 
[normal]would fal
[normal]l within that capacity
[normal] and (as will be demonstrated) would also qualify under other requirements for this dispensation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]Paragraph 
[normal]34
[normal] 
[normal]of the Government consultation document 
[normal]would introduce a significant loophole when it comes to the sensible regulatio
[normal]n of premises
[normal]. 
[normal] The consultation document and the draft clauses are not 
[normal]clear 
[normal]on 
[normal]whether 
[normal]premises would need to self-
[normal]declare 
[normal]as 
[normal]a community venue
[normal] to the 
[normal]l
[normal]icensing 
[normal]a
[normal]uthority
[normal].  If they must
[normal] 
[normal]do 
[normal]so
[normal], enforcement authorities will then have to assess each declara
[normal]tion to determine if 
[normal]they meet 
[normal]that
[normal] definition
[normal].  If they do not, but have declared a desire to exhibit film, would they then be 
[normal]subject to
[normal] the 
[normal]normal 
[normal]licensing provisions
[normal]?  If they do not self-declare and begin to exhibit films, it is also unclear whether 
[normal]they are in contravention of any law
[normal].
[normal]  To call
[normal] the consequent position one which involves
[normal] “
[normal]less direct licensing authority control over the operation of film content
[normal]” is a considerable understatement.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Without 
[normal]such 
[normal]robust 
[normal]process in place
[normal],
[normal] many venues could fall beneath the radar, 
[normal]self
[normal]-
[normal]defining 
[normal]themselves
[normal] as operating within
[normal] a community venue
[normal] without any further scrutiny
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] We would be concerned that this poses 
[normal]a risk to public safety if authorities 
[normal]were
[normal] unaware of 
[normal]activities within venues o
[normal]pening their doors to the public
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Pubs and clubs, for example, could claim community venue status to enhance their customer footfall through the exhibition of film.  A village publican is unlikely to agree that his/her venue is not a community resourc
[normal]e. The 
[normal]“not-for-profit” restrictions outlined in the consultation document would, we submit, be almost impossible to determine in this and similar cases – such as film exhibition within local bingo venues, for example.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.6
[normal]              
[normal]Option 2 therefore deregulates t
[normal]oo far. It creates a real and considerable risk of venues open to 
[normal]the public 
[normal]without 
[normal]readily 
[normal]enforceable 
[normal]legislative control not only over film content, but 
[normal]also 
[normal]on health and safety, environmental and hazard procedures, fire safety and the many other 
[normal]public protections
[normal] which
[normal] commercial film exhibitors provide and which film-going audiences 
[normal]rightly 
[normal]expect.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.7
[normal]              
[normal]Moreover, even
[normal] with strict sanctions in place for those not following age classification guidelines, authorities would not be aware of venues ex
[normal]hibiting films and so unable to track and 
[normal]tackle any
[normal] malpractice. 
[normal] This is not, as the Minister’s foreword suggests, “
[normal]a sensible way forward
[normal]” consistent with strong child protection and community benefit.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]Variations on Option 2[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The 
[normal]CEA does not be
[normal]lieve that Option 2 should be pursued.  If the Government wishes to explore deregulation of community-based film exhibition further, we would be happy to contribute.  However, it should not be the case that the sector must work to the arbitrary timetable o
[normal]f the current draft Deregulation Bill.  It is more important to reach safe and robust decisions than to reach rapid ones.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]In this context, 
[normal]the 
[normal]CEA wishes to outline areas where options for change may be considered
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]Conclusions[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The CEA does not believe there is sufficient evidence to justify the need 
[normal]for deregulation of premises l
[normal]icenses for community premises.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal]Option 2 potentially creates a series of loopholes.  It fosters a lack of proper oversight and assurance of safety and child protection which audiences of all types have come to expect and 
[normal]demand.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]New costs and burdens on the licensing regime for venues exhibiting films could adversely affect the time spent by licensing authorities on managing queries and categorising venues.  In the view of the CEA and its members, large and small, 
[normal]this risks public safety, especially if there is no means of tracking venues who consider themselves community premises.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]              
[normal]Lack of clarity over
[normal] the
[normal] definition of community venue status in particular opens loopholes which give implicit encouragement to p
[normal]rofit-making venues to flout copyright and content controls.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]              
[normal]We do not oppose proportionate, thoughtful and well-defined deregulation to enable community film exhibition to flourish.  However, 
[normal]for
[normal] the reasons stated in this response, we strongly beli
[normal]eve that the 
[normal]proposal 
[normal]put forward 
[normal]does not meet these criteria.
