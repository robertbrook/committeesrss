default1.default              defaultSummarydefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe Cinema Exhibitors’ Association 
default(CEA) 
defaultrepresents the interests of well over 90 per cent of UK 
defaultcinema operators by number and market share.
default 
default Our membership includes single sc
defaultreen/owner-
defaultmanaged sites as well as the largest circuit and multiplex operators.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultThe CEA welcomes the Government’s commitment to deregulate
default in
default area
defaults of legislation where 
defaultev
defaultidence 
defaultexists 
defaultthat current regulation is unnecessary o
defaultr ineffective. 
default However, i
defaultn this 
defaultsubmission
default, which also formed its response to the DCMS consultation, 
defaultthe CEA argues that
default:
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default              
defaultIn addition, the deregulation proposal
default carries significant risks, including:
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default              
defaultAlthough it can be argued that some CEA members (who operate not-for-profit business models and/or who are firmly rooted in local community venues) may benefit from slightly reduced 
defaultlicensing costs, even those members have made plain to CEA that they do not support this deregulation proposal.  Licensing laws protect the quality of the exhibition of a film and service to customers and, having consulted with our members, there is a unit
defaulted view from both larger cinema circuits and smaller independent operators that the current process is logical and serves its purpose well.  The CEA and its members believe that, amongst other disbenefits, deregulation of certain venues could potentially d
defaultevalue the cinema business and be damaging to the industry as a whole.
default&#xa0;
default1.5
default              
defaultThe overall effect of th
defaulte DCMS
default proposal would be to reduce, not enhance, the quality of film exhibition services to the public. 
defaultThedefault defaultCEA therefore defaulthas urgeddefault the Government nodefaultt to defaultproceed with theirdefault proposal and to pursue Option 1default of their consultation documentdefault.default&#xa0;
default2.default              defaultComments on the Optionsdefault as laid out in the DCMS Consultation defaulton Community Film Exhibitiondefault.default&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultThe Impact Assessment (IA) suggests that the policy objectives and 
defaultintended effects of this
default defaultproposal are as follows
default:
default&#xa0;
default“
default1.   Remove unnecessary costs and burdens from suitable community film exhibitions
default 2.   Help grow activities that encourage positive social outcomes
default 3.   Ensure suitable child protection arrangements
default”
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is suggested that these “
defaultwill reduce costs to civil society organisations and stimulate supply by removing a barrier to the exhibition of film
default”.
default  
defaultHowever, neither the 
defaultIA nor the 
defaultconsultation 
defaultdocument offer
default evidential support for these claims.
default  Without s
defaultuch evidence, Option 1 is the only sensible course of action.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default 
defaultNo demand for deregulation has been demonstrated
default&#xa0;
default2.2.1
default              
defaultThe IA goes through tortuous logic to estimate the possible number of community venues
default,
default using a variety of survey sources and unexpla
defaultined assumptions.  At no point, however, does the IA – or the consultation document – give hard evidence that there is an unmet demand.  There is nothing other than assumption that the barrier to entry that the Government seeks to remove actually exists.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.2
default              
defaultThe Minister’s foreword to the consultation document says, “
defaultwe’ve
default found many local screening and film clubs stop before they start
default”.  No examples are given in the body of the document.
default&#xa0;
default2.2.3
default              
defaultNo relevant data have been offered on the effect of Tempor
defaultary Event Notices (TENs) – which are a deregulatory target of this proposal.  Rather, the IA states that such a “
defaultlack of data makes it difficult to assess the impact of policy measures on TEN licensing
default” (IA, para 6.9)
default&#xa0;
default2.2.4
default              
defaultIt cannot be correct – and is a
default negation of evidence-based policy making – to pursue any other course of action that Option 1.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default 
defaultNo 
defaultadditional and distinct 
defaultsocial benefit value has been quantified
default&#xa0;
default2.3.1
default              
defaultNo evidence has been offered that community film exhibition delivers the “
defaultpositive social outcomes
default” claimed by the impact assessment.  In any case, the IA itself chooses not to make any claims for the value of 
defaultadditional or distinct 
defaultsocial benefits and concedes that there “
defaultis little research on these wellbeing effects
default” (IA, para
defaults 6.19, 6.20).
default&#xa0;
default2.
default4
default 
defaultEconomic and social disbenefits have been ignored
default&#xa0;
default2.4.1
default              
defaultBoth t
defaulthe consultation document and the IA assert without evidence that the proposal will not affect the viability or distribution of commercial cinema operators, stating “
defaultrisks as
defaultsociated with an increased number of film exhibitions do not materialise
default.” (IA, key assumptions, 
defaultpage 2)  Rather, conveniently, the IA suggests that “
defaultany costs arising from substitution between not-for-profit and commercial cinema would be indirect and out
default of scope
default”. (IA, para 9.2)
default&#xa0;
default2.4.2
default              
defaultAdditionally, since licensing authorities do not receive fees from community-based venues at present, any deregulation increases costs to local authorities, since they will be responsible for the administrative decision-ma
defaultking incumbent in 
defaultdetermining whether an organisation fitted within the 
default‘
defaultcommunity premises
default’
default definition
default.
default  
defaultArguably this task is more subjective and so could be more labour-intensive and time-consuming than the current established process of granting a 
defaultpremises licence.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.3
default              
defaultIt is, in our view, inevitable that relaxations of the licensing regimes such as those proposed will increase the risks of film piracy. It is highly improbable
default that a community venue 
defaultwill 
defaulthave the expertise or 
defaultresources to 
defaultenforce
default 
defaultthe type of strong controls on 
defaultillegal recording of films adopted by all 
defaultcommercial 
defaultoperators, which has seen the UK become a beacon 
defaultof good practice in this regard
default. This is quite aside from the likelihood that such a relaxation would offer implicit encour
defaultagement to other venues such as pubs and clubs to show films, increasing the piracy risk.  
default&#xa0;
default2.4.4
default              
defaultFilm piracy is a real and continuous challenge for the film industry and it is a stated aim of Government - and in particular DCMS and BIS - to tackle such o
defaultffences. This deregulation proposal is inconsistent with that aim.
default&#xa0;
default2.4.5
default              
defaultAs stated elsewhere in this response, t
defaulthe benefit of a 
defaultstrict 
defaultlicen
defaultsing regime for filmed entertainment is tha
defaultt each venue would be clearly
default registered and therefore on the radar of e
defaultnforcement authorities such as FACT
default,
default who
defaultse 
defaultrole it is to support cinema venues in the fight against piracy
default, a problem which latest estimates indicate 
defaultannually 
defaultcost
defaults
default the industry 
defaultat least 
default£220 million per year in lost box office alone.  
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default 
defaultChild 
defaultprotection measures remain opaque
default&#xa0;
default2.5.1
default              
defaultSince proposals in this area were first raised,
default the
default CEA has been concerned to ensure that the current, effective, controls on admission of children to film exhibitions remain in place.  This proposal does not delive
defaultr assurance.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.2
default              
defaultThe IA asserts that beneficiaries of the proposal “
defaultare likely to have a formal relationship with some form of local council and are likely to be governed by a formal organising committee
default”. (IA, para 6.16)  However, a deregulated environ
defaultment would remove strong local authority oversight and visibility of ‘community groups’ and it cannot be realistic that all organisations wishing to take advantage
default of the deregulation will be 
defaulttraditionally-constituted bodies.  Indeed, 
defaultad hoc
default groups appear 
defaultmore likely to be created, perhaps to show material without certi
defaultfication from dubious sources.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.3
default              
defaultThe consultation document notes that age classification must be obtained for “
defaultevery film that is intended for national distribution in the UK
default”
default 
default(Consultat
defaultion, para 12)
default.
default 
defaultIt is easy to envisage small populations with religious, ethnic or other special interests who might wish to exhibit films outwith this definition
default. I
defaultn
default the most extreme cases, this may pose a risk to public safety and 
defaultwould not, we assume, be
default the kind of activity which Government would wish to see fly beneath
default relevant
default authorities
default’
default radars
default.
default 
defaultThe consultation document recognises that the proposal would lead to “
defaultless direct licensing authority control over the operation of film content in the 
defaultvenues in question
default” (Consultation, para 34)
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.5.4
default              
defaultWhilst the consultation document suggests that “
defaultfilms that do not have such
default [a formal age] 
defaultclassification would not be permitted for exhibition
default” (Consultation, para 44), the ‘education, instruction, infor
defaultmation’ exemptions of Part 2, Sch 1 of the 2003 Act would still offer comfort to unlicensed film exhibitors if this proposal were to be enacted.
default&#xa0;
default3.default              defaultFurther defaultconcerns aboutdefault Option 2default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultThe CEA do
defaultes
default not believe the current structure of Option 2 will me
defaultet
default the DCMS’ desired objectives. 
defaultRather, deregulation as reflected in the proposal would create new loopholes in strong oversight of film exhibition and may add perverse incentives to avoid such oversight.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCEA recognises that the
default upper audience limi
defaultt of 500 is intended to reflect parity with deregulation of theatrical and dance venues
default.  However, this limit is far too high when considered in the context of film exhibition
default.
default 
default 
defaultOn this basis, a significant 
defaultmajority of independent 
defaultcinema theatres 
defaultwould fal
defaultl within that capacity
default and (as will be demonstrated) would also qualify under other requirements for this dispensation
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultParagraph 
default34
default 
defaultof the Government consultation document 
defaultwould introduce a significant loophole when it comes to the sensible regulatio
defaultn of premises
default. 
default The consultation document and the draft clauses are not 
defaultclear 
defaulton 
defaultwhether 
defaultpremises would need to self-
defaultdeclare 
defaultas 
defaulta community venue
default to the 
defaultl
defaulticensing 
defaulta
defaultuthority
default.  If they must
default 
defaultdo 
defaultso
default, enforcement authorities will then have to assess each declara
defaulttion to determine if 
defaultthey meet 
defaultthat
default definition
default.  If they do not, but have declared a desire to exhibit film, would they then be 
defaultsubject to
default the 
defaultnormal 
defaultlicensing provisions
default?  If they do not self-declare and begin to exhibit films, it is also unclear whether 
defaultthey are in contravention of any law
default.
default  To call
default the consequent position one which involves
default “
defaultless direct licensing authority control over the operation of film content
default” is a considerable understatement.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultWithout 
defaultsuch 
defaultrobust 
defaultprocess in place
default,
default many venues could fall beneath the radar, 
defaultself
default-
defaultdefining 
defaultthemselves
default as operating within
default a community venue
default without any further scrutiny
default.
default 
default We would be concerned that this poses 
defaulta risk to public safety if authorities 
defaultwere
default unaware of 
defaultactivities within venues o
defaultpening their doors to the public
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultPubs and clubs, for example, could claim community venue status to enhance their customer footfall through the exhibition of film.  A village publican is unlikely to agree that his/her venue is not a community resourc
defaulte. The 
default“not-for-profit” restrictions outlined in the consultation document would, we submit, be almost impossible to determine in this and similar cases – such as film exhibition within local bingo venues, for example.
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultOption 2 therefore deregulates t
defaultoo far. It creates a real and considerable risk of venues open to 
defaultthe public 
defaultwithout 
defaultreadily 
defaultenforceable 
defaultlegislative control not only over film content, but 
defaultalso 
defaulton health and safety, environmental and hazard procedures, fire safety and the many other 
defaultpublic protections
default which
default commercial film exhibitors provide and which film-going audiences 
defaultrightly 
defaultexpect.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultMoreover, even
default with strict sanctions in place for those not following age classification guidelines, authorities would not be aware of venues ex
defaulthibiting films and so unable to track and 
defaulttackle any
default malpractice. 
default This is not, as the Minister’s foreword suggests, “
defaulta sensible way forward
default” consistent with strong child protection and community benefit.
default&#xa0;
default4.default              defaultVariations on Option 2default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultCEA does not be
defaultlieve that Option 2 should be pursued.  If the Government wishes to explore deregulation of community-based film exhibition further, we would be happy to contribute.  However, it should not be the case that the sector must work to the arbitrary timetable o
defaultf the current draft Deregulation Bill.  It is more important to reach safe and robust decisions than to reach rapid ones.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultIn this context, 
defaultthe 
defaultCEA wishes to outline areas where options for change may be considered
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.default              defaultConclusionsdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultThe CEA does not believe there is sufficient evidence to justify the need 
defaultfor deregulation of premises l
defaulticenses for community premises.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultOption 2 potentially creates a series of loopholes.  It fosters a lack of proper oversight and assurance of safety and child protection which audiences of all types have come to expect and 
defaultdemand.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultNew costs and burdens on the licensing regime for venues exhibiting films could adversely affect the time spent by licensing authorities on managing queries and categorising venues.  In the view of the CEA and its members, large and small, 
defaultthis risks public safety, especially if there is no means of tracking venues who consider themselves community premises.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultLack of clarity over
default the
default definition of community venue status in particular opens loopholes which give implicit encouragement to p
defaultrofit-making venues to flout copyright and content controls.
default 
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultWe do not oppose proportionate, thoughtful and well-defined deregulation to enable community film exhibition to flourish.  However, 
defaultfor
default the reasons stated in this response, we strongly beli
defaulteve that the 
defaultproposal 
defaultput forward 
defaultdoes not meet these criteria.
