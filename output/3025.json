"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Christopher James Longley MBE (PEX 0001)&#xa0;WHO I AM&#xa0;I am Christopher James Longley MBE. \n&#xa0;\nI am a resident of Wakefield (my postal address, email and telephone contact details are available separately to the Health Select Committee) and a patient of a Health Centre in Wakefield. I will be affected by the changes in hospital services that are proposed by the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust if they are implemented.\n&#xa0;\nOver many years I have developed an interest in the governance of public bodies. In particular my interest is in the manner in which such bodies communicate with and consult the public about things they propose to do.\n&#xa0;\nI am not, never have been, nor will I ever join any political party. I am not a member of any lobby groups, nor have I ever been a member of such a group.\n&#xa0;\nTo avoid any doubt whatsoever, the matters that I am raising in this document with the Health Select Committee have nothing to do with any other body, do not represent the views of any other body in any regard directly or indirectly, and are expressly raised at my own instigation. \n&#xa0;2              MY INTEREST IN THE HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE&#xa0;As I understand it, the Health Select Committee holds the Department of Health, NHS England and the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust to account for \n&#xa0;\n(a)\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe use to which these agencies of the state put public funds and\n&#xa0;\n(b) the manner in which their use of funds satisfies their statutory duties. \n&#xa0;\nIn the case of these NHS agencies and again as I understand it, this amounts to how these agencies secure the provision of safe and appropriate health care that is free to the user at the point of need. \n&#xa0;\nI also understand that all the above agencies of the state have as their prime directive that they should “first, do no harm”. \n&#xa0;\nI have serious concerns about the transparency and candour with which NHS England and the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust are discharging these responsibilities. These concerns extend to the consequences for (a) patient safety and (b) the reduced quality and availability of the healthcare that will be made available to patients at the point of their need in Wakefield and North Kirklees.\n &#xa0;3              THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT I AM RAISING WITH THE HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE&#xa0;Earlier this year (2013) I was given a document called “Meeting the Challenge”. It described major reductions – sometimes called reconfigurations – in health care service provisions in Wakefield and North Kirklees. This is the area in which I live. \n&#xa0;\nIn summary, these changes involve the concentration of services (including some that are transit time sensitive to some emergency and maternity patients) into the new Private Finance Initiative funded \nPinderfields\n Hospital in Wakefield and the withdrawal or down grading of services from the two other hospitals (in Dewsbury and Pontefract) that are within the control of the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust.\n&#xa0;\nIn the “Meeting the Challenge” document there is an explicit statement contained in a section called “\nMythbusters\n” and it reads as follows:\n&#xa0;\n“Are the changes really all about saving money? &#xa0;No. Like other sectors, the NHS nationally is working in a very tough financial climate and needs to make significant savings to deliver high quality services to patients now and in the future. The position locally is no different and it is no secret that our local acute trust, in particular, is facing major financial challenges.\n&#xa0;\n“It is inevitable, therefore, that some people may assume that the changes proposed in this document are first and foremost about saving money. However we can give an absolute assurance that this is not the case. The over-riding reason for wanting to make these changes is to improve quality and accessibility of clinical services across all parts of the local NHS”.\n&#xa0;\nI dispute the transparency and candour of this statement and I wish to present evidence that supports my contention. It follows that in my view this lack of candour and transparency invalidate the entire consultation process.\n&#xa0;4              THE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT I WISH THE HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AND TO PUBLICISE&#xa0;4.1              Letter to Mary Creagh MP (my MP) from Sir David Nicholson&#xa0;These are the words of Sir David Nicholson, the then NHS Chief Executive, writing to Mary \nCreagh\n MP for Wakefield on the 28\nth\n of March this year from the Richmond House HQ of the Department of Health at 79 Whitehall in London:\n&#xa0;\n“With regards to Mid Yorkshire NHS Hospitals Trust’s financial position, I understand the Trust is forecasting a deficit in 2012/2013 of £26 million. I am advised that the trust is working closely with local commissioners to tackle its financial and performance challenges and to develop a clinical strategy that delivers affordable and sustainable services in the future.”\n&#xa0;\nSir David continues thus:\n&#xa0;\n\"The Department appointed McKinsey and Company to review 22 Trusts, including Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which had indicated their PFI contracts could affect their viability and ability to meet the requirements of foundation trust status. As a result of the \nReview, Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust was placed in category 2 meaning that its PFI affordability could be addressed through local developments, in particular, productivity improvements and commissioning arrangements. All of the Trusts that were a part of the review have been made aware of their categorisations and recommended actions to address the affordability of their PFI schemes.\"\n&#xa0;\nPlease note these written words of the then Chief Executive of the NHS: \n&#xa0;\n              \n“Recommended actions to address the affordability of their PFI schemes”\n&#xa0;\nIn this letter there is not a single word about patient safety and care, nor a single word about consultations with patients and medical staff, nor with local authorities nor with all those others who have a stake in decent health care across our area. Remember this letter was written on the 28 March 2013 by the then Chief Executive of the NHS.\n&#xa0;\n4.2              The August 2011 McKinsey and Company Report about 22 PFI Trusts&#xa0;\nI therefore sought a copy of the McKinsey and Company Report referred to by Sir David from NHS England, to which Sir David had now moved as its’ new Chief Executive three days after he signed the letter above in his role as Chief Executive of the Department of Health. NHS England “did not have it”.\n&#xa0;\nI then sought a copy under FOI from the Department of Health (Sir David’s former organisation) and they told me (in terms) that it was “in commercial confidence”.  I pointed out to them that this was a difficult position to sustain since their then Chief Executive had quoted key passages from it himself in correspondence to my Member of Parliament.\n&#xa0;\nAfter I had enquired of McKinsey and Company whether they had any objections to the release of the Report and had been assured that they had no such objections, my Freedom of Information Request finally succeeded on the 18\nth\n of September 2013. The Department of Health subsequently provided a \npdf\n copy of the McKinsey and Company Report under their reference Ref:DE00000796044 - FOI - McKinsey report on PFI.\n&#xa0;\nThe full McKinsey and Company Report is now available through this link: http://rotherhampolitics.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nhs-pfi-concerns/\n&#xa0;\nIt too is devoid of all mention of patient safety and care, consultations with patients and medical staff, with local authorities or with all those others who have a stake in decent health care. It focuses exclusively on what Trusts will need to do to pay their PFI payments.\n&#xa0;\nThere are many details in the McKinsey and Company Report about what Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust should do to regain the financial standing that will enable their PFI payments to be made and for them to gain the treasured Foundation status. The trust should use “the local health economy” to secure savings, but such savings are beyond their control. \n&#xa0;\nPrimary Care Trusts had such control until recent legislation replaced them with Clinical Commissioning Groups who will pay for hospital services in future. McKinsey makes clear that \nmany £millions would have to be saved by internal efficiencies and by savings from “the local health economy”. \n&#xa0;\nThe key issue here is timing. “Meeting the Challenge” was launched in January 2013. \n&#xa0;\nBut the McKinsey Report was dated August 2011, and the section about Mid Yorkshire confirms that all parties were informed of the conclusions before publication. \n&#xa0;\nSo the “Meeting The Challenge” consultation was launched when Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust already knew it had to make very major savings from “the local health economy”, and long before that public consultation was launched. In view of this discrepancy, I submit that the “Meeting The Challenge” consultation was neither candid nor transparent, and this lack of candour and transparency lies squarely at the door of the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. \n&#xa0;\nI do not believe the service changes proposed were designed with patient care in mind as a first priority, nor that in designing them the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust adopted the precautionary principle of “first do no harm”. Paying the PFI costs is the key issue in the McKinsey and Company Report.\n&#xa0;\nAdditionally, the Joint Health Scrutiny Committee of Wakefield City Council and Kirklees Metropolitan District Council had asked for a copy of this McKinsey and Company Report but I am told they had been denied access to anything other than a redacted form of it during their statutory deliberations about the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust healthcare changes they had a duty to scrutinise. I provided them with a copy.\n&#xa0;\n At their Meeting of 9 October 2013, the Joint Health Scrutiny Committee of Wakefield City Council and Kirklees Metropolitan District Council voted unanimously to refer the proposed healthcare service cuts and reconfigurations to the Secretary of State for Health with a request that the Secretary of State should instigate an Inquiry into the changes and their consequences. No elected member supported the changes.\n&#xa0;\nI must at this point make clear that McKinsey and Company cannot be held in any way responsible directly or indirectly for any of the content or the outcomes of the report. They were hired by the Department of Health to complete a task to a specification and this they clearly did. I will not allow any of my words to be given any other meaning. The responsibilities in these matters lie entirely with NHS England and the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.\n&#xa0;\nRef: McKinsey and Company Report about 22 PFI NHS Trusts&#xa0;January 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
