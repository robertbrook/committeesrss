[[[Written evidence submitted by OFTEC (HOT05)]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]1.              The Oil Firing Technical Association (OFTEC) represents companies involved in the oil fired heating sector. Also it operates a Competent Persons scheme for oil heating technicians licensed by the Department of Communities and Local Government and currently has some 8,700 persons on its register. For this function OFTEC is accredited by UKAS (No. 4371).&#xa0;Background: &#xa0;2. Since 2008 OFTEC has been in discussions with DECC and its predecessor Departments about ways of reducing GHG emission from domestic oil boilers. It has promoted a new fuel known as B30K which is a blend of kerosene (70%) with FAME biofuel (30%). This fuel can be used in existing oil boilers after minor modifications to the boiler, and offers a comparable heat output and boiler efficiency to that of kerosene.&#xa0;However B30K has been excluded from the forthcoming domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) in England and Wales, although it has been recognized for the Northern Ireland version of RHI. OFTEC believes that a bio-liquid such as B30K would make a significant contribution to GHG reductions for rural homes.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;DECC Heat Strategy (2013): &#xa0;3.              This strategy seeks to eliminate all fossil fuel usage for heat generation by 2050. It envisages extensive use of de-carbonised electricity supplied through an enhanced electricity grid to homes and buildings as the way to achieve this. OFTEC suggests that this policy is impractical in that it would require massive capital investment and therefore would impose high costs on energy consumers which would be unacceptable politically. &#xa0; 4.              A policy advocated by the Heating and Hotwater Industry Council (HHIC) (and others) promotes a more “balanced transition” to low carbon heat. This should involve use of hybrid gas and oil condensing boilers working in tandem with heat pumps. OFTEC supports the arguments made within the HHIC report entitled “Pathways for Domestic Heat”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Hybrid Heat technologies using oil: &#xa0;5.               This HHIC report sees a continuing role for oil and gas fired condensing boilers into the period 2025 -2030 because these technologies can work well with heat pumps in an auxiliary role. The domestic RHI recognises this and allows payments for hybrid technologies providing that the renewable element of the heat is metered. &#xa0;6.              OFTEC modelling suggests that for an oil/Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) hybrid boiler, (assuming the ASHP has a Seasonal Performance Factor - SPF - of 2.5) the CO2 emissions for a 4 bedroom house would be 5.138 tonnes of CO2 p.a. This compares with 6.302 tonnes using an oil condensing boiler, and 4.756 tonnes using only the ASHP.  &#xa0;7.              Whilst the CO2 emissions for the ASHP are slightly lower than for the hybrid, independent studies have shown that an ASHP working on its own cannot achieve high SPF in a sustained period of cold weather. Therefore it is unlikely that this level of carbon output could be exceeded in a particularly cold year.   &#xa0;&#xa0;Has the Government made the right approach to reducing heat demand? &#xa0;8.              The Government’s flagship policy to reduce fossil fuel consumption in the domestic sector – the Renewable Heat Incentive - is unlikely to achieve its stated objectives.   &#xa0;9.              The domestic RHI is an innovative policy and does provide significant tax-payers funds to incentivise the switch to renewable heat. With an estimated cost of £5.09 billion and a net present value estimated at MINUS £1.836 billion over the policy Lifetime, this is an expensive policy. The DECC Impact assessment (IA) forecasts (Table 8) that 579,000 homes will switch to renewable heat technologies between 2014 and 2020 due to the RHI. However The Committee should be aware that the same IA paper acknowledges that the uptake of the incentive is unknown (due to possible consumer indifference?) and says (para 77): “however there is extreme uncertainty about how householders will make these investment decisions for renewable heating products.  …” &#xa0;10.              OFTEC suggests that the likelihood of many existing oil households deciding to switch to renewable technologies such as ASHP, Ground Source Heat Pumps and Bio-mass (wood pellet) boilers is low. The principle reason for this is that nearly all decisions relating to a new heating system are made in emergency situations when a boiler breaks down and cannot be replaced. The householder is desperate to have heating and hot water restored to their home and so makes a “distress purchase”. They do not have the time nor the money to consider a new technology which may require home adaptations.&#xa0;11. This fact may explain some of the findings of a report commissioned by DECC from Ipsos/ MORI and the Energy Savings Trust entitled “Homeowners’ Willingness To Take Up More Efficient Heating Systems” (March 2013). This surveyed 2,900 home owners and conducted a number of in-depth workshops in the autumn of 2012. lt concluded: &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;We suggest that the Committee requests DECC for sight of this Report - if they have not done so already. &#xa0;&#xa0;Cost of conversion to renewable heat: &#xa0;12.              An earlier Impact Assessment (IA) for the RHI (September 2012) stated that 38% (or 145,000) of the homes converting to renewable heat pre 2020 due to the RHI would be in rural areas. The latest IA puts the number converting to these new technologies at 579,000 which indicates that DECC now forecast that 220,000 rural homes now will convert due to the RHI. &#xa0;13.              OFTEC estimates that 80% (176,000) of these will be homes using oil heating at present.  The estimated capital costs of these conversions are shown in the table below, and the Committee will note that substantial up-front capital costs are involved installing Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP), Ground Source Heat pumps (GSHP) and Wood Pellet Boilers (Pellet). These costs compare with approx. £3,000 to replace an existing oil boiler with a condensing oil boiler.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Note 1‐ Energy Saving Trust ‐ http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/renewableselector/startAssumptions:1. RHI  IA (July 2013) predicts that 579,000 rural households will move to renewable installations (Table 8) due to the RHI. Taking the assumption in the earlier IA (September 2012) that 38% of the homes switching will be in rural areas, this means that 220,000 are predicted to convert by 2020. 2. The OFTEC model estimates that 80% of these will currently be on oil, which equates to 176,000 homes

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;14.              The cost of replacing all these boilers with a modern condensing boiler is approximately £616m: the cost of converting all the existing boilers in these homes to use B30K fuel is estimated at £528m. Both these figures are less than half the capital cost of installing the proposed the renewable technologies.&#xa0;&#xa0;Consumer resistance to Heat Pumps:&#xa0;15.              Any heat strategy designed to reduce CO2 / GHG emissions from private homes must be capable of being “sold” to home-owners. For the reasons stated above we believe that the currently favoured technologies will be a hard sell. &#xa0;16.              The favoured technology – Air Source Heat Pumps – should work well in new homes built to “zero carbon” standards and with larger radiators and / or under-floor heating. &#xa0;17.              However heat pumps will not function effectively if they are fitted onto existing radiator systems and this has been acknowledged in the recent EST trials. The full cost of installing an effective heat pump in an existing property should include the cost of a new radiator or under-floor heating system. In addition good functionality of heat pumps requires properties to be fully insulated. Many rural homes are older (pre-1914) and have solid walls. The option of cavity wall insulation is not open to these homes and the alternative - solid wall insulation- is expensive, unproven and can be unsightly.  &#xa0;18.              A further factor which should be noted regarding heat pumps is that they do not provide “hot radiators” which can be used to warm yourself on when cold or to “dry the clothes”. Consumers are used to radiators doing this and there could be negative reaction to these perceived shortcomings of renewable heat from some people. &#xa0;Running costs of preferred Renewable Technologies (pre-RHI):&#xa0;19.              The RHI is designed to compensate home owners for the capital costs of installing renewable heat and to contribute to their running costs for seven years. We note that within the RHI document issued on 12th July 2013, the examples of what payments might be expected are based upon a building heat requirement of 15,000 kWh p.a. Due to the design of many rural homes, we submit that the average building heat loss would be higher at around 24,000 to 28,000kWh p.a. Domestic RHI payments are based upon a deemed heat calculated from an energy performance assessment and not from metering actual renewable heat emitted. We suggest that customers could be exposed to the risk of having higher than anticipated electricity bills due to heat pumps cycling on and off to meet high heating demand. &#xa0;&#xa0;20.              The future costs of electricity and wood pellets for the favoured RHI technologies are unknown. Electricity prices are likely to rise to reflect the increased generating costs for nuclear and wind-power. The Committee should note that the current average fuel costs p.a. in GB for a three bedroom house in the period July 2012 – July 2013 are set out below: &#xa0;

All price in £ sterling. &#xa0;21.              For a home with an ASHP it is only £8 less expensive per annum (or 0.66%) to run on carbonized electricity than it is to use kerosene fuelling a condensing oil boiler. Wood pellets currently are approximately 3% less expensive run than oil. &#xa0;22.              The RHI will only provide subsidy to homeowners for seven years so there is a danger that people will revert back to fossil fuel technologies if their running costs are greatly in excess of fossil fuel heating. &#xa0;Rural homes - CO2 Abatement and role of Bio-Liquids&#xa0;23.              Given that DECC policy is set against Bio-liquids,  it is interesting to note that our estimates show that the CO2 abatement in the 176,000  homes that might convert from oil is LESS using the preferred technologies than it would be if these same homes converted to bio-liquid. &#xa0;24.              This is demonstrated in the table below.  Also it should be noted that if these homes convert to B30K they will save 223,155 tonnes of CO2 p.a. more than if they “do nothing”. It is OFTEC’s contention that most of these homes targeted by the RHI will “do nothing” because either the incentive is insufficient or the installation of the “renewable technology” is too disruptive / impractical.&#xa0;
