"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Jonathan Isaacs [FBB0029]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMy name is Jonathan Isaacs. I am a 54-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer and journalist born and living in London.\n&#xa0;\nI believe there is no future for the BBC and it should be wound up without delay, as Greece has successfully wound up its national \nbroadcaster.\n&#xa0;\nMy reasons are:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe continuing scandal of the 52-years of child rape and abuse on BBC premises by the late BBC DJ Sir Jimmy \nSavile\n.\n&#xa0;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe\n continuing scandal of rape and child abuse by other living BBC employees.\n&#xa0;\nc)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \n141 current unresolved legal cases of\n bullying at the BBC\n&#xa0;\nd)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe\n scandal of widespread non-payment of the BBC Â£145.50 annual licence fee, accounting for one in ten UK court cases, reports The Daily Telegraph.\n&#xa0;\ne)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nthe\n scandal of non-transparency for licence fee payers, whom the BBC Trust has not al\nlowed to investigate records relating to these scandals.\n&#xa0;\n2) BBC continuing leftist bias, notably against the democratic state of Israel, which I believe no British television watcher should have to pay for on pain of imprisonment or tolerate. This bias is\n amply evidenced in websites \"Biased BBC\" and \"BBC Watch.\"\n&#xa0;\nI believe these scandals go to the heart of Britain, involving police officers, doctors and employees at 32 British hospitals, together with as-yet-unindicted BBC senior staff and former staff. Th\ne BBC is a corrupt liability to Britain and I urge MPs to break it up as soon as possible and refuse to allow an extension to its Royal Charter.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
