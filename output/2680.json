In addition to this consultation on the Technical Housing Standards Review, Government ran consultations in 2007 and 2010-11. Details of these can be found here: \nwww.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/greenerbuildings/sustainablehomes/consultations\n Such as Element Energy 2013 study on ‘Costs of building to the Code for Sustainable Homes’, which drew learning from 5 local authorities who have implemented \nCfSH\n via policy: \nwww.brighton-hove.gov.uk/sites/brighton-hove.gov.uk/files/EP059%20Costs%20of%20building%20to%20the%20Code%20for%20Sustainable%20Homes%20(Sept%202013)%20(draft).pdf\n \n The Merton Rule was the first local planning policy to set a requirement for renewable energy generation in new buildings, developed by Merton Borough Council in 2003. The rule required any new residential development of more than 10 units, or any commercial building over 1,000m\n2\n, to generate at least 10% of its energy needs from on-site renewable energy equipment: \nwww.merton.gov.uk/environment/planning/planningpolicy/mertonrule.htm\n \nPlymouth Renewable Energy Strategic\n \nViability Study \n(\n2007\n): \nwww.plymouth.gov.uk/homepage/environmentandplanning/planning/planningpolicy/ldf/ldfbackgroundreports.htm\n Plymouth Local Development Framework 2007, Chapter 11 Natural Environment: \nwww.plymouth.gov.uk/core_strategy_4web_11_chapter_11.pdf\n Report available to download here: \nwww.bristol.gov.uk/page/bristol-citywide-sustainable-energy-study\n Bristol City Council Core Strategy policies BCS14 and BCS15, adopted June 2011: \nwww.bristol.gov.uk/page/planning-and-building-regulations/planning-core-strategy\n Report available here: \nwww.cse.org.uk/pdf/west_sussex_sustainable_energy_study.pdf\n \nRevised Draft \nAdur\n Local Plan 2013\n: \nwww.adur-worthing.gov.uk/adur-local-plan-consultation/\n Mid Sussex District Plan, Submission May 2013: \nwww.midsussex.gov.uk/media/BP1_SubmissionDistrictPlanMay2013.pdf\n \nArun\n District Coun\ncil Submitted Local Plan 2013: \nwww.arun.gov.uk/main.cfm?type=LOCALPLAN2&amp;objectid=6221&amp;searchtermredirect=Local%20Plan%202013%20-%202028%20and%20beyond#LP\n Horsham District Planning Framework Preferred Strategy 2013: \nwww.horsham.gov.uk/environment/planning_policy/14379.aspx\n \nChichester District Council Draft Local Plan Key\n Policies – Preferred Approach \n2013\n: \nwww.chichester.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=21805\n Renewable Energy and Sustainable Construction Study 2010: \nwww.teignbridge.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=33316&amp;p=0\n \nRenewable Energy Capacity Study\n 2013: \nwww.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/856/local_plan_2006-2026_formerly_ldf/1013/renewable_energy_capacity_study\n"
