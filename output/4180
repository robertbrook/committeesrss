defaultQuestion posed by 
defaultThe Transport 
defaultCommittee
defaultAnswers submitted by the West Sussex Cycle Forum
default1
defaultWhat is the rationale for the Government’s proposals to devolve to a local level decision-making on transport expenditure? 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of the Government’s 
defaultapproach? Are there better models?
defaultThere are a number of disadvantages 
defaultassociated with
default devolved decision-making in West Sussex:
default&#xa0;
defaultExpectations
default have been raised that local decision-making would direct money more effectively to the needs of cyclists, but as the rest of this response demonstrates, the 
defaultimplementation in West Sussex has largely dashed those expectations.
default&#xa0;
defaultDevolving transport decision
defaults makes it almost impossible to plan and deliver non-local transport infrastructure, even on the scale of inter-urban 
defaultcycleways
default between 
defaultneighbouring
default towns [
defaultsee 
default1].
default&#xa0;
default Transport is by its nature a very network-oriented issue, so changes in one location can ha
defaultve big impacts on another location: but 
defaultlocalised
default transport spending doesn't allow this to be taken into account at all [
defaultsee 
default2]. Transport-specific planning and design knowledge is lost, as local councils do not have the expertise and experience in transpo
defaultrt planning matters [
defaultsee 
default3].
default&#xa0;
defaultExamples - 
default[1] A county 
defaultcouncillor
default from Lancing would like to build a 
defaultcycleway
default between Lancing and 
defaultWorthing
default, to benefit Lancing residents. However most of the 
defaultcycleway
default will be within 
defaultWorthing's
default boundary, so he has to persuade 
defaulta 
defaultWorthing
default 
defaultcouncillor
default to promote his 
defaultcycleway
default, even though it has much less value to 
defaultWorthing
default residents. This means that it's unlikely to ever happen; even though there is local community need and desire.
default&gt; [2] The A27 through 
defaultWorthing
default is likely to become 
defaultsignificantly more congested when the improvements at 
defaultHandcross
default Hill on the A23 are completed, making it much easier to drive to the south coast from Gatwick and further north. If the Arundel bypass 
defaultwere ever to be
default built, 
defaultit
default would lead to significant incre
defaultases in congestion in 
defaultWorthing
default from traffic finding it easier to drive along the A27 to and from the west. The A27 at Southampton is significantly more congested since the M3 
defaultTwyford
default Down cutting opened.
default&gt; [3] Local officials recently placed a sharp-edged 
defaultdark-blue sculpture in the middle of National Cycle Network Route 2 
defaultcycleway
default in Lancing. The local officers involved were unaware of the importance of this route, or the number of people on bicycles using it daily to commute to and from work. One officer w
defaultas even unaware that the cycle route was continuous to 
defaultWorthing
default, even though it had been so for some years!

defaultDo local bodies (including local authorities, local enterprise partnerships, passenger transport executives, integrated transport 
defaultauthorities and local transport boards) have the capacity to assess, 
defaultprioritise
default and deliver local transport schemes? What would the optimum delivery body look like?
defaultI take local to mean exactly that - within a locality such as a town or borough, or a disti
defaultnct and separate rural area.   The great weakness of the current system is that local government at the County level has been subjected to cutbacks and seemingly constant 
defaultrationalisations
default (i.e. redundancies and 
defaultreorganisations
default).   This has created disconti
defaultnuity and a certain amount of corporate paralysis.   There seems to be no overarching coherent policy that requires urgency to deliver it.   For example - there is evidence that S106 money is held up by bureaucracy.   There are no longer budgets allocated 
defaultto specific means of transport which means that - for example, cycle schemes that might deliver real benefit don't get 
defaultrecognised
default as part of a core transport policy - more as a fringe and 
defaultmarginalised
default form of transport; although the talk in public is diffe
defaultrent.   The CLC process is incapable of dealing with the volume that should go through its hands.   Consequently, those schemes that are easy to understand and 
defaultquickly 
defaultdecide on - get the vote.
default&#xa0;
defaultApart from benefitting from some isolated serendipitous schem
defaultes, West Sussex County Council has not made any serious attempt to implement its 
defaultLocal Plan Transport Plan 3
default (LTP3) 
defaultand has, similarly, made no attempt to replace it with anything else.
default&#xa0;
default This, therefore, poses the question ‘what is the point of all of the 
defaulteffort put in to these plans if the Council has no mechanism to support it or implementing it?’
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultTo answer the question - 
defaultlocal bodies do not have the capacity to assess, 
defaultprioritise
default and deliver local transport schemes.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe optimum delivery body is one th
defaultat considers and values the economic, health and 
defaultsocial benefits of sustainable transport, and incorporates those benefits into an integrated policy with a 'golden thread' running through transport, health, social and economic development policies.   It sh
defaultould consult with, and take 'on the ground' information from, those who know the locality.   Those consulted should be involved in the roll out of schemes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLocal bodies (district and borough councils) are inconsistent in their approach to sustainable tr
defaultansport. Decisions made by the county council in allocating funding to sustainable transport are not backed-up by, and are even contradicted by, decisions of Council Local Committees. The co-ordination of cycle schemes at county council level has been aban
defaultdoned with the abolition of the West Sussex County Council Cycling Officer and although there is someone doing his best to work with local cycle and sustainable transport groups, the fact is that he has another full time job that takes all his time.

defaultWhat is the best way of dealing with major transport schemes that cross local authority boundaries or have wider regional impact?
defaultHave a scheme-by-scheme project led team that is charged with delivering on time and on budget and takes in all 
defaulteconomic, health and social benefits of sustainable transport.  Its members are the stakeholders in the geographical area as well as those intimately involved with the various modes of transport being considered.

defaultHow effectively do local bodie
defaults work with each other and with Government departments and national transport agencies?
defaultNo knowledge of this.
default&#xa0;
defaultFunding streams for cycling projects are more diverse than ever and are acquired and managed by different bodies. Opportunities have been missed where combining money from different funding streams (such as the Highways Agency, National Park, county and bo
defaultrough councils) could have delivered greater benefits.

default 
defaultDo the current funding streams for major local transport schemes meet the needs of local authorities? How do current funding streams compare with previous arrangements?
defaultNo knowledge
default of this.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlmost all funding streams for cycling in West Sussex have restrictive criteria and date limitations. (No funding is allocated to cycling from the Highways budget.) Because the funding might otherwise be lost, there are examples of funding being
default allocated to schemes that are not the top priority locally and which have questionable benefits.

default 
defaultWhat impact will the devolution in 2015 of funding to Local Transport Bodies and the introduction of the Single Local Growth Fund have?
defaultIt will wipe out any consideration of sustainable transport schemes 
defaultboth 
defaultbig and small.   That is because it is designed to promote jobs
default supported by road building
default.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, the 
defaultpurpose
default of creating employment is to increase the wealth and 
defaultwell being
default of 
defaultthose in an area.  The cost 
default/
default benefit ratio of sustainable transport can bring significant economic benefits if factors, such as quality of life, well-being and basic health are admissible 
defaultas equals in the discussion.

defaultHow can local 
defaultauthorities attract greater investment from the private sector for the delivery and maintenance of local transport infrastructure? What scope is there for the use of alternative funding streams?
defaultNo knowledge of this.
default&#xa0;
defaultExisting funding streams need to be pr
defaultotected as well as finding additional sources of funding. We have one example of a County Local Committee passing a motion to reallocate developer contributions away from sustainable transport.

defaultHow clear are the lines of accountability for
default local decision making on transport expenditure?
defaultThe answer is that they are unclear to most.  But you must be more precise about what is meant by 'clear'.  It's an absolute term and when you factor in the implied 'clear to whom', then it's obvious that it
default might be 100% clear to some 
default- 
defaultbut 
defaultunhelpfully 
defaultopaque to others.  
defaultSo - please be 
defaultless ambiguous
default.   But 
default- 
defaultof greater importance is whether local decision making is 
defaultappropriate, relevant and worthwhile
default.   For example, it could be crystal clear but hopeless
default,
default 
defaultinappropriate, irrelevant and worthless.

defaultIs it still a central res

default that could be used to implement cycle schemes and improve cycling safety?

defaultThe WSCF was established to

defaultic partner for the local forums and is recognised by West Sussex County Council as a

defaultIts aim - as in its constitution is:
defaultTo work towards the creation of conditions in West Sussex so that cycling is perceived as a valid and reasonable choice ofdefault transport for both utility and leisure purposes.   default&#xa0;
