"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Exmouth &amp; District Community Transport Group (TIC 075)&#xa0;Parliamentary Transport Committee –\n“People from different communities across the UK should have access to adequate transport services. We will be looking at how best to meet the needs of \npassengers in isolated communities, including rural areas, island communities, and suburban or urban areas with poor transport connections. We are particularly interested in the provision of bus and rail services, as well as the role of Community Transport\n Services.”\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nHow effectively do Community Transport services address the needs of passengers in isolated communities? How could Community Transport be improved?\nEDCTG works within a clearly defined service area comprising of the Parishes of Exmouth,\n Budleigh Salterton, East Budleigh, Otterton, Colaton Raleigh, Newton Poppleford, Woodbury and Lympstone which are within the East Devon District Council and Devon County Council. Our service area has one of the highest populations of people over the age o\nf 60yrs in the country. Therefore we have increasing demand for services for those who have a mobility problem and increasing fraility due to age. Isolation is a real issue in our community.\nEDCTG offers 3 separate services – all with Tail Lifts. These ser\nvices are for those unable to use Public Transport either because they have a mobility problem, live in a rural isolated community with NO Public Transport or have a temporary or short term health problem that means they are unable to walk to the nearest b\nus stop.\nRing and Ride: 16 seater tail lift minibus. This is a service with a Service Level Agreement with Devon County Council, East Devon District Council and the Parish/Town Councils. It has a School Contract to provide transport to a secondary School a\nnd Primary School for pupils with special needs. Provides a Ring &amp; Ride shopping service to a timetable booked in advance between the hours of 10am and 2.30pm on weekdays. It picks people up at their front door and returns then there taking them to Exmouth\n, Out of Town Tescos and an excursion to Exeter or Sidmouth on alternate Wednesdays. This bus is currently funded by DCC School Contract and Grant, EDDC Grant and all the Parishes/Towns in the service area by a formula to ensure they pay according to popul\nation size. (Budget paper enclosed). This is paid from the Parish precepts. Drivers are contracted to help passengers to travel safely and help with carrying shopping etc. In addition fundraising is a constant occupation as well as raising donations and sp\nonsorship. The vehicle is available for private hire with registered organisations who can supply a driver with the relevant Driving Certificate.\nThis vehicle has a tail lift and carries passengers in wheelchairs or have any mobility problem. Many people w\nith a mobility problem are unable to walk to the nearest bus stop or there is no public transport to their village or isolated hamlet either due to distance or the public transport company does not have a bus small enough to access the road network in the \nvillage or hamlet.  The bus does have to do ‘extras’ to enable people to have more independence. Very often it has to divert to visit a Garden Centre or other ‘out of Town’ retailer to pick up various items that are too difficult for the passengers etc. Pu\nb Lunches are very popular as it gives the people time to eat with others and socialise. Isolation is a factor in the ‘Health and Well Being’ of our clients.\nReductions in Local Authority Funding is increasing pressure on fundraising efforts and the reduct\nion in Bus Service Operators Grant. We cannot raise sufficient funds to offer a free service. We are unable to offer evening and weekend services due to cost. \nCommunity Bus: This is a 16 seater tail lift minibus. This is fully funded by ourselves. We are \nconstantly trying to raise sufficient funds to keep this bus ‘on the road’. It is more flexible as it does not have a school contract. This bus takes people to the day centres at Budleigh Salterton Community Hospital and Budleigh Salterton Age Concern. In \nbetween it offers services to Tescos (out of Town), various pub lunches, trips and regular excursions to Newton Abbot and Sidmouth. \nWhizabout Bus: This is a 9 seater  accessible vehicle and can take a maximum of 2 wheelchairs.\nThis is our most flexible \nservice. It is individually booked for specific journeys. This uses volunteer and paid drivers. This bus works in partnership with Honiton Trip in relation to Transport to Acute Hospitals to ensure coverage over the whole of East Devon District Council are\na. This vehicle is charged to ensure cost recovery but non profit making. This is used by people transferring from their own homes to residential care, residential care to nursing care, Hospital transport to mainly the acute hospitals but also to the vario\nus community hospitals and medical centres. We also have people who need this type of transport to visit relatives, attend weddings etc.\n\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nWhat are the main challenges associated with funding transport services in isolated communities? How can thes\ne services be made more affordable?\nFunding a subsidised service is becoming impossible with the reduction in Local Authority Grants, as it is not a mandatory service. The costs will have to become fully recoverable which will mean the service will be unaf\nfordable to people on low incomes. The Personal Independent Payments will mean that it will have to be included in the assessment of a PIP. Who will ensure this takes place ? GP Consortiums do not seem willing to give any grant for a transport service to t\nheir clinics. Many Acute hospitals are now specialising. In a rural area like the South West, as well as the choice of hospital, means the number of long journeys is now increasing. The NHS transport service is not mandatory for appointments unless people \nwith mobility problems or live in isolated rural communities need treatment whilst travelling. This is increasing the need for specialised transport. The costs can be very high for a person on a low income.\nLottery grants are only available for new project\ns so cannot be accessed for continuing a service.\nMany trusts and local charitable groups are reducing their grants to ‘worthy’ local causes due to low interest rates meaning they have less income on their capital and therefore do not have the funds to dis\ntribute.\nBSOG is reducing and this is a loss of income to small charities like us\nMany people are expecting our type of transport to be free due to the concessionary fare scheme. This is not  available to Community Transport but the other reason for being \nunable to provide concessionary fares is the criteria. Administration costs for a small charity would be excessive. The Concessionary Fare Scheme is not fully funded. Council Tax has to be contributed by the Local Authority to meet the short fall. Communit\ny Transport has a booking system due to having to carry wheelchairs and seating has to be removed etc before making the journey so cannot just be hailed or requested to stop.\nWe are registered for VAT but this is extra administration.\nThe driving licence \nrestrictions being introduced means that a person cannot drive a vehicle above 9 seats without a PSV licence. To train a driver to pass this test can cost a Community Transport Charity in excess of £2000 per person. Charities cannot afford to train a perso\nn for them to leave and join a commercial company. Size of vehicles will therefore be reduced to comply with the current driving licence categories.\nIt must not be forgotten that the charitable sector has to comply with any business legislation. This is an\n ever increasing burden. It seems we will have to pay for pensions out of our donations in the future. We already have to outsource payroll. We have to write contracts etc. We are a small charity employing 2 part time office staff and 5 part time drivers w\nith several volunteer drivers. The paperwork is becoming excessive.\nIncreasing cost of fuel and insurance is a very big issue.\nThe services can be made more affordable by using volunteers but they are now beginning to decrease due to the need for people to\n ‘top up’ their pensions, work until they are 67yrs, provide child care, fund their children/grandchildren through university, many grandparents are funding the deposits on homes. Many Volunteers are receiving reduced income due to low interest rates and t\nhe need to work longer.\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
