default&#xa0;defaultDraft Deregulation defaultBill :defaultSuggested Addition Reduces Bureaucracy and is defaultBeneficial .default ‘Use of Land’ defaultSuggest all Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) in National Parks defaultaredefault classified as Restricted Byways.   default&#xa0;
defaultMy suggestion relates to saving time and funds of local authority officers. It simplifies the law and safeguards special areas of countryside from noise and pollution for safe and quiet enjoyment by the public. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is to stop off-
defaultroading
default, with mechanically propelled vehicles, in all National Parks.   Probably the simplest way of stopping 4x4s and trail bikes etc. would be for all unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) in National Parks to be re-designated as Restricted Byways. This would be in line with the statutory origin of Restricted Byways under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act. Furthermore the latter Act allows National Park Authorities to apply Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) recognising the special nature of National Parks.  Having no off-
defaultroading
default with mechanically propelled vehicles would further the purposes of National Parks which are:
default&#xa0;
default1. Conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage
default2. Promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of National Parks by the Public.
default&#xa0;
defaultSavings: not having to maintain rights of way damaged by motorised vehicles.
defaultSaving officers time in considering increasing requests for Traffic Regulation Orders in National Parks. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAvoiding accidents by providing rights of way that are safe for 
defaulthorseriders
default, pedal cyclists and walkers.  
default&#xa0;
defaultI have some knowledge from living near the South Downs. When many paths were classified as RUPPS, there was increasing heavy use by motorised vehicles – trail bikes and 4x4s, resulting in damage to paths. Some 
defaulthorseriders
default feared to go there 
defaultany more
default. It was a wonderful improvement and relief when restricted byways were introduce by statute. As there 
defaultare
default no Byways Open to All Traffic in our area, we are able to conserve the natural beauty in this National Park.
