default&#xa0;
defaultSUMMARYdefaultI am a victim of the deep set corruption in 
defaultJersey
default for over 29 years. I am writing to the Committee as really a last resort of finding some sort of justice for my home island. I and my family have absolutely no faith, trust or respect for any of the factions here run by any of the corrupt regimes. They are out for themselves and themselves only. Keep the fat cats fat and the rest of my islanders in the lowly place they have been made to believe is their only place. Below is a list detailing my personal encounters with the corruption that goes on. I will be more than happy to give detailed evidence should it be necessary, at any Committee meeting held at any time.

defaultTo be honest, I could write pages and pages on the corruption of my home island and the disgust I feel at the way it is allowed to be run. 
defaultI fear for the future of my children if this continues.

defaultThank you for taking the time to review my statement of facts. Everything is appreciated.
