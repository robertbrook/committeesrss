[[[ Legal Aid Practitioners Group (LAPG) ]]]

[[[(LAI 0073)]]]The Committee seeks evidence from anyone with an interest in the human rights issues raised by the following proposals in particular:1. Legal Aid Practitioner Group is a membership body for organisations (private practice and not-for-profit) with legal aid contracts with the Legal Aid Agency. Our members are based throughout England and Wales and cover all areas of law. We meet regularly with the Ministry of Justice and Legal Aid Agency on policy and operational issues affecting our members.

[[[Summary]]]2. It is LAPG’s view that these proposals wholly undermine the fundamental common law right of access to the court for all. The changes are a direct attack on the rule of law and will have an immediate adverse impact not only on vulnerable client groups, but also on all clients seeking legal advice for a range of civil problems. In summary we consider that3. These proposals must not be rushed through with little Parliamentary scrutiny. We are concerned that these proposals will &#xa0;

[[[Residence test]]]

[[[The ]]]

[[[proposed introduction of a residence test for civil legal aid claimants, so as to limit legal aid to those with a “strong connection” with the UK]]]4. In our response to the Transforming Legal Aid Consultation LAPG took the view that this proposal is unlawful, unjust, impractical, discriminatory and unnecessary.

[[[  ]]]Despite the amendments made to the proposal we remain of this view. There are two limbs to the proposal: to be lawfully resident in the UK, crown dependencies or overseas territories 

[[[and]]] to have resided lawfully in these places for a ‘continuous period’ of 12 months. 5. We are aware that the JCHR has limited resources and that others have dealt with issues of legality e.g. Dr Nick Armstrong and Paul Bowen QC. We endorse their responses and in particular Dr Nick Armstrong’s analysis of the very limited nature of the concessions made by the Government (para 6 onwards). We would also highlight Treasury Counsel’s response to the original consultation and their concerns about the residence test.6. It is important to emphasise that 

[[[all clients]]] will need to meet the test. The scale of the task is immense both for practitioners and for the Legal Aid Agency in checking that the test is met. In 2012-13 alone there were:&#xa0; (a) 590,410 Civil Legal Help funded acts of assistance; (b) 139,083 authorised acts of certificated representation.This means that if current take-up continues, 729,493 people will have to meet the test, and prove that they do so before legal aid can be provided. It is our view that removing legal aid from people who do not meet the residence test will result in some of the neediest and most vulnerable people being placed at immediate risk of harm or even death. This is not acceptable in a democratic and civilised society, with a reputation for upholding fundamental principles of access to justice. Even those who would meet the residence test will be excluded for the reasons we set out below.7. We are a practitioner organisation and our members deliver legal aid services on the ground to clients day in, day out. We would therefore like to draw attention to the practical effect of this proposal on clients and access to justice. Clients seeking legal advice on areas which remain within scope of LASPOA are, in the main, due to the refocusing of legal aid on priority areas, those seeking advice regarding protection of the person or their home. The eligible client group is therefore by definition more vulnerable than previously. Already there have been additional burdensome requirements placed on clients to produce evidence to prove their eligibility and that their case falls within the scope of the new legal aid scheme. The more hurdles put in the path of vulnerable clients, the harder it is to reach the point where any advice is accessible and offered. Legal Action Group has highlighted the drop in the number of people obtaining advice – the reduction is far greater than the effect of LASPOA:  http://www.lag.org.uk/policy-campaigns/legal-aid-secret-service.aspx8. Clients who are vulnerable and in the stressful situations that necessitate advice can only obtain that advice at present if they:&#xa0;&#xa0;9. People seeking legal advice under the legal aid scheme are invariably vulnerable and are often facing a time of great stress. Already the number of organisations offering a legal aid service has declined drastically and it is now extremely difficult for clients to find the advice they need from someone who is skilled, able and willing to take on the case. Even if they do find a practitioner who is willing to assist, not only do they have to overcome the financial evidence hurdle, but if the residence test is introduced, clients will also have to meet a further documentary evidence threshold for even the most basic legal advice. Many clients will struggle (and fail) to provide documentary evidence of all elements of the various tests to access legal advice. This will leave them without the protection they need. Many will be homeless or placed at risk of violence or abuse as a result.&#xa0;10. We met with the MoJ to discuss what documentary evidence was being proposed by the Ministry to meet the test. On the ‘lawful residence’ limb of the test it was proposed that the following evidence might be sufficient – a valid passport or a valid visa. On the ‘continuous period of 1 year’ limb it was suggested that evidence might include audited accounts from the person’s business, a letter from their employer, letters from their children’s school etc. There was a helpful discussion however the outcome was that the test would not be met by many of the most vulnerable groups such as those in crisis, those fleeing violence, the disabled and mentally ill. These groups are highly unlikely to have the documentary evidence to meet the test and even if they are in fact eligible, would fail because of the evidence requirement.&#xa0;11. Lawful residence. The problems in proving this will include the following:12. Lawfully Resident for One Year. People will also have to prove that they have been in the country for a continuous period of year (subject to a permitted 30 day absence). How will people who are in crisis accommodation, who have fled their home, who are homeless be able to prove this? These are factors which will be hurdles:-13. In reality, many of the clients our members advise have chaotic lives. They do not bring with them organised lever arch files of bank statements, passports, visas, letters from GPs or schools. Take a person who has been discharged from psychiatric hospital without suitable housing. S/he is unlikely to have evidence to meet the residence test. Clients with dementia, learning disabilities, people who are street homeless etc. who need advice will not be able to produce the necessary proof. Everyone will be affected by the test because everyone will have to meet it to qualify for legal aid. 14. The Government’s purported concessions on excluding the most vulnerable from the residence test will not cure the problem. In particular, the removal of ‘detention’ cases will not, on the current proposals, apply for example to people lacking mental capacity who are de facto detained in care homes, hospitals or in their own homes, or who are being abused or neglected. If ‘detention’ cases only apply to, for example, persons who are being detained under the Mental Health Act, then this still leaves a whole host of other clients who are in a similar position (but not necessarily formally ‘detained’) without any access to legal advice or protection.15. These are the questions we asked before and which we still think need answering.(a)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How many people will be affected by the test? How many will be excluded from legal protection because the test is correctly applied? (b)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How many eligible clients will be unlikely to meet the test because of the evidence requirements?(c)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Is there any evidence of people coming to the UK simply to obtain legal aid for legal advice about the matters which remain within scope of legal aid (i.e. non-monetary matters)?(d)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What, if any, savings to the public purse will be achieved by the residence test? We think that it will cost far more to administer than any savings, and create satellite disputes and litigation.(e)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How have any costings been calculated?  What management Information/data did the MoJ rely on in making these calculations? This is not yet available.(f)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; What will legal representatives have to do to get relevant information to prove residence of an applicant? How will this be funded? If a person is mentally incapacitated or in crisis and cannot access the required information, who will pay for the work in obtaining the information? Will the client be turned away because this work will not be funded?(g)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; How will the test affect the ability of those with LAA contracts to use delegated powers so that the clients can be represented at initial urgent hearings? These cases often involve applications to protect the person, and it would be appalling if persons at risk could not access advice or protection because of, for example, failure to produce a passport (which they may not have), or letters showing employment (which may not be applicable).16.  Our conclusion is that the residence test on the ground represents another serious barrier to justice. While others will cover the legal points we made in our consultation response we very much want the JCHR to consider the practical implications of this proposal.

[[[Prisoners]]]

[[[: The proposed restriction]]]

[[[ on the scope of legal aid available to prisoners]]]17. We support the evidence submitted by the Association of Prison Lawyers. Our main concerns are that:Without entering into a detailed analysis of relevant case law (which others are better placed to do so), simply because a person has been imprisoned for a crime does not mean that all rights should be denied to them

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Judicial review:]]]

[[[ The proposal that providers of legal services in applications for judicial review against public bodies should only be paid fo]]]

[[[r work done on the case if the Court grants permission for the application to proceed]]]18. As with so many of these proposals the Government does not seem to have given proper consideration or thought through the true cost of its proposals and any perverse incentives created. The original responses to the TLA Consultation highlighted these and they remain. The MoJ’s response to the 16,000 consultations has been to propose that where a judicial review case has been issued and settles without permission having been granted, the LAA may nevertheless pay the lawyers provided there is a good reason why the defendant has not been ordered to pay costs.19. It is essential to highlight the effect on those seeking redress through judicial review - the system is of course designed for individuals to enforce rights, and not to ensure a good income for lawyers. However rights do not exist in a vacuum. We would highlight one practical issue of all of the recent legal aid cuts – the inability of legal aid practitioners to carry out an ever increasing amount of work unpaid or ‘at risk’. Already legal aid fees are below what is understood to be ‘the market rate’ (for example for much civil legal aid the rates are those set in 1994, less the 10% cut imposed in October 2011) but that does not explain the real cost of carrying out legal aid work. There is already considerable unpaid time which people will refer to in this response e.g. checking financial eligibility, helping clients obtain evidence of domestic violence, filling in the exceptional funding form, but also the unremitting complexity of the revised legal aid system means that it would be quite easy to work a ten hour day and only produce five definite chargeable hours which might be paid.20. As a membership organisation we know the pressures our members are under and we can confirm that the line has been reached where no further cuts to even the low levels of funding can be sustained. The rest of the work carried out by firms does not support cross-subsidisation of unpaid or at risk legal aid work. The ‘concession’ of a discretionary payment if the case settles pre permission but costs are not paid by the opponent will not help to ensure that practitioners can carry out legal aid work. This is because such work cannot reach that stage without guarantees of some payment, even at low legal aid rates.21. It is important to explain that judicial review cases, unlike other types of litigation, involve extensive work in the early stages to prepare the case for issue. Other litigation can start with a simple application form and short statement, and the costs are very low. This is not the case for most judicial reviews, because what is required in bringing proceedings is a detailed document setting out the legal grounds of challenge, supported by full evidence. The duty to the Court to make full disclosure from the start of the case means that the work is very heavy and labour intensive in the early stages of the case. All of this work will be at risk if the proposal proceeds, and the result will be that practitioners simply will not take the risk of either not being granted permission (because for example, a third party takes some action outside the practitioner’s control rendering the proceedings academic) or not receiving the discretionary payment from the Legal Aid Agency.22. There is a simple solution. The LAA is legally and contractually responsible for considering legal aid applications for judicial review, applying the relevant Merits Regulations and criteria, and deciding which cases warrant public funding to take forward. Only meritorious cases should succeed. Moreover the Judge, on considering permission, and in refusing permission in those cases could certify that the case was ‘wholly without merit’ and recommend that the practitioner’s costs should not be paid. We do not think that political rhetoric should overturn this procedure.23. To allow the LAA to have the discretion on payment, when the exceptional funding cases have been so limited, would be unlikely to persuade practitioners to take the risk. Valid cases, particularly those which are complex and therefore cost more initially to bring to permission, will simply not be brought at all. The Public Law Project has carried out considerable work on Judicial Review trends and we urge the Committee to consider their findings. 24. We do urge the Committee to consider fully the importance of judicial review as a way for ordinary citizens (some of whose dependence on the state for assistance means that they would be severely affected by this proposal) to challenge large organisations and that that is important constitutionally. It is also of fundamental importance to ensure that the laws of the country apply to everyone.

[[[The proposal that ]]]

[[[lega]]]

[[[l aid should be removed for all cases assessed as having “borderline” prospects of success.]]]25. Borderline cases are high priority but very rare cases including cases holding the state to account, public interest cases and cases concerning housing, and including asylum.26. It may not be possible to evaluate the chances of obtaining a successful outcome, because there is a dispute about the facts, the law or expert evidence.  These cases are not ones where the prospects of success are less than 50% or poor rather that the prospects 

[[[cannot]]] be assessed because the court must interpret the law, decide on the disputed facts or expert evidence. However much work is done there is no answer available in these circumstances and the matter needs to go before a judge.27. The current merits regulations provide that borderline cases can be funded by legal aid because of their importance, either to the individual or constitutionally because they are about holding the state to account. We remain of the view that they should continue to be funded, because of those reasons. If there is any doubt about the merit of the cases, then the Legal Aid Agency can (as it does at present) scrutinise the application for public funding particularly carefully.

[[[Introduction of these proposals.]]]28. The proposals to introduce these major constitutional changes by means of secondary legislation with very limited Parliamentary scrutiny is deeply worrying. 29. We also regret that the Minister has declined to delay implementation of the reforms pending the reporting by the Joint Committee on the Human Rights implications of the proposals. 30. Finally it is also of extreme concern that these proposed changes come so quickly after the detailed Parliamentary debates on LASPOA and after commitments to, for example, retaining legal aid for judicial review were made and reconfirmed by the Government.  These proposals appear to overturn such assurances.September 20137&#xa0;
