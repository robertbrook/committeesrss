[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]What impacts have the FSS closure had?[bold]Britain demonstrably lags behind the rest of Europe – international credibility is seriously damaged.
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The FSS ranked 5
[normal]th
[normal] in the world in terms of scientific citations 
[normal][
[normal]1
[normal]]
[normal].  
[normal]No other laboratory in the UK features 
[normal]as a world class 
[normal]laboratory devoted
[normal] to forensic science.
[normal] In addition
[normal], England
[normal] and Wales
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] the only 
[normal]countries
[normal] in Europe without a national forensic science centre.
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The rest of Europe has implemented new marker systems based on the 
[normal]European Standard Set of Markers
[normal] recommended by the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes 
[normal][
[normal]2
[normal],
[normal]3
[normal]]
[normal](ENFSI)
[normal] and adopted by the EU commission
[normal]. 
[normal]UK appears to be isolated in Europe by failing to move this project forward within the time-scales suggested by the EU. 
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The new systems have much more powerful discriminating power and are able to analyse highly degraded 
[normal]and compromised 
[normal]samples
[normal] (not possible with current system in use)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]UK 
[normal]is 
[normal]currently 
[normal]locked into
[normal] outdated technology that is more than ten years old
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]This means that c
[normal]ases will not be 
[normal]analysed using 
[normal]best practice methods
[normal]. 
[normal]Cross 
[normal]-
[normal]border comparisons with other countries 
[normal]will be
[normal] compromised since the systems in use will no longer be entirely compa
[normal]rable
[normal].
[normal] Is there a timetable for UK introduction?
[normal]Impact of FSS closure on quality[bold]Notable high profile errors have occurred
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The New Scientist anonymous survey 
[normal][
[normal]4
[normal]]
[normal] was strong evidence that there is concern from employees within the UK laboratories. More than three quarters of respondents believed that there was significant risk of miscarriages of justice within the current system. It is highly significant that two high profile errors were identified 
[normal]a matter of weeks 
[normal]after
[normal] 
[normal]the prophetic 
[normal]publication of the New Scientist report (see next section). The New Scientist survey demonstrated the importance of discovering the morale and opinions of 
[normal]employees. 
[normal]In the interests of restoring public confidence, I would recommend that a new survey is initiated to discover if the position has improved. 
[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The loss of quality predicted by the New Scientist review came to fruition with two high profile cases 
[normal] in: 
[normal]‘wrongful arrest of Adam Scott’
[normal][
[normal]5
[normal]]
[normal] and the 
[normal]contamination event combined with a 
[normal]transposition error in 
[normal]‘Death of 
[normal]Gareth Williams
[normal]’
[normal][
[normal]6
[normal],
[normal]7
[normal]]
[normal]. Both errors were the result of 
[normal]bad practice (clearly not following international guidelines
[normal] e.g.
[normal][
[normal]8
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal]) 
[normal]– 
[normal] in particular, 
[normal]ignoring negative controls that give DNA profiles (Scott); failure to check results before uploading to the national DNA database (Williams
[normal]).
[normal]A zero error rate is scientifically untenable
[normal]6)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The regulator review was critical of the offending laboratory but 
[normal]suggested
[normal] that no further contamination incidents 
[normal]were
[normal] present in a batch of 26,000 samples
[normal]7)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Further work is needed, however. 
[normal]To clarify the position: 
[normal]t
[normal]he
[normal]re is no test for contamination (the effect is hidden) 
[normal]and it is not possible to equate 
[normal]the
[normal] (presumed)
[normal] regulator’s view of 
[normal]‘
[normal]absence of evidence
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal]with ‘evidence of absence’.  
[normal]In a
[normal] (contradictory) 
[normal] piece of work to understand the mechanisms and impact of contamination
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]Gill 
[normal]and Kirkham
[normal][
[normal]9
[normal]]
[normal] 
[normal], working under FSS auspices
[normal],
[normal] showed that it was possible to estimate contamination rates, but 
[normal]it is 
[normal]not
[normal] possible to identify 
[normal]which
[normal] samples were contaminated. 
[normal]A review carried out under FSS auspices on a typical casework process demonstrated a contamination rate 
[normal]of 1 in 1000 samples analysed
[normal]. 
[normal]Not all contamination events lead to errors of interpretation, however
[normal][
[normal]9
[normal]]
[normal].
[normal]8)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A
[normal] zero error rate for commercial providers
[normal] is scientifically untenable
[normal] 
[normal](
[normal]note that the statistic quoted in Scott was 1 in 1 billion, and ignored the possibility of error
[normal])
[normal]. There needs to be 
[normal]pro-active
[normal] assessment of error rates that 
[normal]should
[normal] be disclosed and published.
[normal]What should be the role of the forensic science regulator?[bold]9)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Clearly the regulator role 
[normal]can
[normal]not 
[normal]properly function
[normal] in isolation but needs to be part of a coherent centralised organisation that is devoted to forensic science. 
[normal]In previous submissions to the committee I recommended that the 
[normal]core functions: research, regulation/accreditation, 
[normal]and 
[normal]standards
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]were
[normal] subsumed and coordinated centrally 
[normal]by
[normal] a national centre of excellence
[normal][
[normal]10
[normal]]
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Forensic science is rapidly changing and improving. This means that there needs to be a mechanism in place to implement research into casework 
[normal]– implementation
[normal] needs to be simultaneous across UK laboratories. 
[normal]This is difficult to achieve within a highly fragmented environment. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]necessary 
[normal]infrastructure required to validate and 
[normal]to 
[normal]implement new technology to the same standards across providers does not 
[normal]currently 
[normal]exist
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The way forward
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]10)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]W
[normal]e 
[normal]must 
[normal]accept that the FSS (as it existed) was no longer fit for purpose, but 
[normal]it seems obvious that the core functions could have been preserved in a national centre of excellence
[normal] (UK could also have retained its international ra
[normal]n
[normal]king and associated credibility by this route)
[normal]. This course of action would have resulted in divestment of routine casework activities to commercial organisations, but the new centre would have retained the ability to carry out analysis of complex casework requiring novel technology that 
[normal]is not used by any commercial provider. This is because the profit motive precludes use of any technique that 
[normal]is loss-making
[normal]. 
[normal]This has resulted in a 
[normal]rapidly growing technology-gap 
[normal]in the UK. For example implementation of 
[normal]latest 
[normal]new body fluid markers (RNA), mitochondrial DNA analysis; Y chromosome analysis; informative SNP ancestry markers are not in routine use
[normal]11)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a concern that the Home Office exerts undue influence over the regulator and the role should be remote and independent from 
[normal]this government body
[normal]. 
[normal] Otherwise conflict of interest may arise.
[normal]12)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There is a concern that the regulator role is restricted to committee discussions without the necessary resources to implement recommendations
[normal].
[normal]13)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]There should be much more focus on discovery of error rates and limitations of evidence. The information should be in the public domain.
[normal]14)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]As a prime example: t
[normal]here needs to be much more 
[normal]pro-active
[normal] assessment of laboratories to prevent errors 
[normal]occurring
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Note that the laboratory involved with the Scott and Williams cases was fully accredited by the authorities, but this did not prevent catastrophic failure. 
[normal]The 
[normal]regulator 
[normal]response to the 
[normal]Scott case 
[normal]was
[normal] 
[normal]mainly 
[normal]re
[normal]-
[normal]active
[normal]. 
[normal]However, we must recognise that t
[normal]here is an implied 
[normal]weakness 
[normal]within the 
[normal]accreditation
[normal]/regulatory process 
[normal]itself 
[normal]in that it failed to detect major deviance from acceptable laboratory practice
[normal] in the first place
[normal] . 
[normal]In a recent review by Gill et al
[normal] 
[normal][
[normal]11
[normal]]
[normal], under 
[normal]UK 
[normal]regulator auspices, 
[normal]it was proposed to develop three over-arching ‘assessor’ roles
[normal] (if properly resourced, this will  begin to address the concerns)
[normal]. The new roles are
[normal]:
[normal]15)
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]However, s
[normal]ignificant resources are required to implement the points above (in a purely commercial environment this is quite challenging
[normal]).
[normal] 
[normal]Also this is further evidence of the need for a UK centre of excellence to take over the combined roles of research/implementation/ standards etc.
