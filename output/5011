[normal]Written evidence submitted by the 
[normal]International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Summary
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists (IAJLJ) is an 
[normal]international NGO 
[normal]founded in 196
[normal]9 by Nobel Prize Laureate 
[normal]René Cassin
[normal], U.S. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, and Israeli Supreme Court Deputy Chief Justice
[normal] 
[normal]Haim Coh
[normal]en.  The IAJLJ
[normal] is
[normal] 
[normal]an 
[normal]accredited
[normal] NGO
[normal] by the 
[normal]United Nations and the Council of Europe
[normal] 
[normal]and has 
[normal]members in 
[normal]3
[normal]5 countries. 
[normal]We were
[normal] established, primarily, in order to further the cause of human rights, to act against Anti-Semitism and the denial of the Holocaust
[normal], and to act against all forms of racism manifested against any people.  
[normal]As such, 
[normal]the
[normal] IAJLJ has been
[normal] monitoring 
[normal]matters relating to 
[normal]UNRWA
[normal] that have
[normal] implications on human rights.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. 
[normal]Britain
[normal] 
[normal]is UNRWA’s second largest
[normal] donor
[normal] 
[normal]nations
[normal] after the 
[normal]United States
[normal].  
[normal]T
[normal]he IAJLJ submits this 
[normal]document
[normal] therefore
[normal] in response to
[normal] 
[normal]the British Parliament’s
[normal] 
[normal]International Development Committee inquiry on The UK's Development Work in the Middle East
[normal] call for experts to submit evidence regarding its
[normal] questions
[normal] of “w
[normal]hether the Bri
[normal]tish Department for International Development’s (DFID) funding to the Palestinian Authority aides the twin goals of state building and achieving a negotiated peace
[normal]” and “w
[normal]hether DFID is currently funding the right sectors and working with the right organis
[normal]ations, or whether there are sectors and organisations that do not receive UK funding, but should do
[normal].”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal].
[normal] The IAJLJ is d
[normal]isturbed to conclude that
[normal] UNRWA in effect
[normal] works against human rights by 
[normal]its financial support o
[normal]f
[normal] Palestinian entities that
[normal] 
[normal]incite
[normal] its 
[normal]youth to murder Jews and Israelis 
[normal]and 
[normal]which 
[normal]work against promoting peace and
[normal] a
[normal] two-state solution
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]This situation not only 
[normal]contradicts the stated use of British contributions to UNRWA 
[normal]but also
[normal] arguably am
[normal]ounts to support of child abuse
[normal] 
[normal]in violation of the
[normal] UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The IAJLJ has appeared twice at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva in support of Syrian refugees and submits that a more effective
[normal] and
[normal] equitable use of funding is to support this refugee problem
[normal] rather to fund UNRWA entities which contradict the goals of peace, good will, and a two-state solution.
[normal]Evidence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal].
[normal] A review of textbooks used in UNRWA schools and these video clips entitled 
[normal]Camp
[normal] 
[normal]Jihad
[normal]and Inside the UNRWA Classroom
[normal] 
[normal]provide ample evid
[normal]ence that UNRWA entities support incitement to murder Jews and Israelis, inculcate
[normal] 
[normal]Palestinian children with the belief that a Palestinian “right of return”
[normal] to Israeli cities is
[normal] viable and expected,
[normal] and 
[normal]negate Israel’s right to exist
[normal] 
[normal]explicating the use of
[normal] violent means to achieve this 
[normal]goal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.
[normal] The result is 
[normal]a generation of 
[normal]many 
[normal]young Palestinians 
[normal]who would oppose any two-state solution and have been brainwashed into thinking that violence and death in order to destroy 
[normal]Israel
[normal] is laudable and the only acceptable option.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.
[normal] 
[normal]In the material reviewed Palestinian children, with rare exception, are taught to make refe
[normal]rence 
[normal]to Jews, not Israelis or 
[normal]Israel
[normal].  
[normal]The two video clips contain numerous examples of children from 
[normal]Gaza
[normal] speak in 
[normal]highly inflammatory language that children could know only if taught by adults.  When asked what the “right of return” means, 
[normal]children
[normal] answered
[normal] it means
[normal] 
[normal]Jews are the “enemy of Allah, must kill all of them
[normal],
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]“it means throw stones at Jews and also
[normal] slaughter the Jews”
[normal] and 
[normal]“we will kill the Jews and 
[normal]defend 
[normal]our homeland.”
[normal] 
[normal]  
[normal]Teachers at these schools and camps
[normal] promote this attitude 
[normal]by routinely and openly refer
[normal]ring
[normal] to the Palestinian “right of return” to 
[normal]Haifa
[normal], Acre, 
[normal]Jaffa
[normal], and 
[normal]Nazareth
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]One clip show
[normal]s a teacher clearly stating in an interview that Jews never had any right to any land in the region and showed children in Gaza referring to their envisioned state 
[normal]as 
[normal]extending “from 
[normal]river to the 
[normal]to sea” (the Jordan 
[normal]River to the Mediterranean Sea).  The en
[normal]tire narrative taught at these UNRWA-supported entities apparently is that Jews never had any right to any land, Palestinians lived their honorable until the Naqba when Jews deported them, 
[normal]the Palestinian 
[normal]“right of return” will materialize through violence
[normal] and death whereby all Jews will be liquidated, creating 
[normal]a Palestinian 
[normal]state “from sea to sea.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.
[normal] 
[normal]These clips also show
[normal] Palestinian youth saying “I will defeat the Jews
[normal].  They are a gang of infidels and Christians. 
[normal]They do not 
[normal]like Allah
[normal] and worship Alla
[normal]h.  And they hate us
[normal],”
[normal] “weapons will accelerate the right of return,” 
[normal]“collect stones, throw them at the patrol,” 
[normal]“I want to return to Kafar Kassem whether the Jews like it or not,”
[normal] “there will never be peace between us and 
[normal]Israel
[normal],”
[normal] 
[normal][games children play ar
[normal]e] “Palestinians against Jews.  We shoot each other,”
[normal] a Palestinian child
[normal]ren
[normal] repl
[normal]y
[normal] to the question “how will you defeat the Jews by answering “with missiles,”
[normal] “
[normal]as Palestinians we must defend our honor and recapture our land,” 
[normal]“no to negotiations, attacking stage-by-stage is not the right way, 
[normal]if we attack them altogether at once, that will be the answer,”
[normal] “the resistance in Gaza wasn’t enough, we need to unite and fight together in order to return,” 
[normal][a song] “when we die as mar
[normal]tyrs we go up to heaven
[normal] . . . children have obeyed the command
[normal],
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]“we learn about Britain which gave our land to the Jews
[normal],
[normal]”
[normal] “[at school] they teach us that Jaffa is our land is it is forbidden to give it up,” 
[normal]“
[normal]Jews . . . fought against Allah and became 
[normal]the 
[normal]enemy of Allah.  
[normal]We
[normal] must kill all of them.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. Teachers
[normal] 
[normal]speak 
[normal]clear
[normal]ly
[normal] whether teaching children or in interviews.  A
[normal] Palestinian teacher e
[normal]xplain
[normal]s to her class
[normal] that Jews are “the wolf [that] expelled and deported us
[normal].  They killed us and 
[normal]shot our families
[normal],
[normal]” 
[normal] “we off
[normal]ered martyrs, suicide bombers . . 
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]who here is related to a martyr?  Why were the
[normal]re
[normal] martyrs?  In order to 
[normal]liberate Al-Aqsa and return to Haifa and Jaffa
[normal];
[normal]” 
[normal]teacher
[normal]s
[normal] ha
[normal]ve their students 
[normal]repeat “Palestine is an Arab land from the river to the sea,
[normal] 
[normal]we want Haifa we want Acre,
[normal]”
[normal] another teacher has her students repeat
[normal] 
[normal]“Glory to a liberated and an Arab Palestine, 
[normal]glory and eternal life for martyrs and the righteous,
[normal]” “
[normal]we will liberate Jerusalem
[normal],
[normal]” 
[normal]in interview
[normal]s
[normal] teacher says “the right of return is an integral part of 
[normal]the
[normal] curriculum,” 
[normal]“if 
[normal]students are taught by religious teachers,
[normal] they will be taught that Israel must be wiped out
[normal],” “the land never belonged to the Jews, not in the past and not in the present
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11
[normal]. In one clip Palestinian education minister,
[normal] 
[normal]Lamis al-Alami
[normal] who taught in UNRWA for twenty years
[normal] before her appointment as 
[normal]head of education for all UNRWA schools and colleges
[normal],
[normal] said these schools do not teach the right of return.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12.
[normal] 
[normal]Th
[normal]is
[normal] 
[normal]clip also show
[normal]s UNRWA school students attending the memorial ceremony for
[normal] Awad al-
[normal]Qiq
[normal], 
[normal]headmaster at an UNWRA
[normal] school in
[normal] 
[normal]Gaza
[normal] 
[normal]and head of the Islamic Jihad’s rocket engineering unit
[normal] 
[normal]and hearing 
[normal]“you were a great educator and you departed as a great warrior
[normal].
[normal]” 
[normal]  
[normal]Of note, 
[normal]in 2004 UNRWA head Peter Hansen stated to the Canadian Broadcasting Company: 
[normal]"Oh, I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll, and I don't see that as a crime. Hamas as a political organization does not mean that every member is a militant,
[normal] and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal] I
[normal]n 2010 
[normal]Canada
[normal] decided to redirect some of its aid from UNRWA to specific projects.

[normal]Conclusions
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]4
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The evidence brought herein clearly shows that 
[normal]UNRWA
[normal] has
[normal] veered form its mandate as a
[normal] United Nations
[normal] organization created to assist Palestinian 
[normal]refugees
[normal] to
[normal] an
[normal] organization that
[normal] promotes radicalism among the refugee community it purports to assist, a radicalism that inculcates
[normal] in 
[normal]children a mentality of death and martyrdom and against 
[normal]a
[normal] 
[normal]peace process
[normal] 
[normal]that 
[normal]leads to a two-state solution.
[normal]  
[normal]Further, by its support of radical Palestin
[normal]ian entities, UNRWA not only violates its mandates but works in contradistinction to the UN Charter.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]5
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The evidence brought herein should be viewed in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Children
[normal].
[normal]  
[normal]              
[normal]Article 3
[normal](
[normal]1
[normal])
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n all actions concernin
[normal]g children . . . the best interests of the child shall be a
[normal] 
[normal]primary consideration.
[normal]Article 6
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life
[normal] . . .
[normal] 
[normal]States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and develop
[normal]ment of the child.
[normal]Article
[normal] 28(2): 
[normal]States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity and in conformity with the present Convention
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]6
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The inquiry 
[normal]commission ought
[normal] to
[normal] prioritize 
[normal]that 
[normal]British funds are appropriated to proper 
[normal]humanitarian projects
[normal] and 
[normal]that 
[normal]funds 
[normal]which
[normal] 
[normal]could
[normal] 
[normal]be 
[normal]save
[normal]d
[normal] from inappropriate projects
[normal] such as UNRWA
[normal] be invested in
[normal] these, 
[normal]the best of example of which is 
[normal]the 
[normal]humanitarian crisis i
[normal]n 
[normal]Syria
[normal] which led to millions of refugees in the last two years
[normal].
