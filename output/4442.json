"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (CMI0014)&#xa0;The \n Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) is a not-for-profit organisation with \nmore than\n 20\n \nyear\ns’\n history of working to help injured people gain the access to justice they need and deserve.  \nWe have more than \n4,\n0\n00 members \nwho \nare committed to suppo\nrting the association’s aims, and all are signed up to APIL’s code of conduct and consumer charter.  Membership comprises mostly solicitors, along with barristers, legal executives, paralegals and some academics.\n  &#xa0;Medical evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\na)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nroad traffic claims where the only injuries are soft tissue ‘whiplash’ injuries to the back, shoulders and neck;\nb)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nroad traffic claims involving \nall \nsoft tissue injuries, whether caused by whiplash or otherwise (for example knee strain);\nc)\n              \nroad tr\naffic claims where there are mixed injuries including whiplash injuiries, such as whiplash plus a broken leg;\nd)\n              \nall road traffic claims up to a specified value which are covered by the current protocol, whether or not whiplash is included (such as psychol\nogical damage).\n              \n \n              \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.  The Government favours a stan\ndard medical report form for use in all claims, but\nthis will inevitably mean that reporting doctors would have to confine their  remarks to a standard template or a drop-box option which will limit the amount of     information provided.\n&#xa0;\n7.  \n              \nLack of det\nail will not advance the Government’s objective of address\ning \nfraud. The \nr\neporting expert must be free to describe in his own words the claimant’s account \no\nf his injuries, how they affected him and for how long. There must also be an\n \nopportunity\n \nfor the expert to provide \nhis \nimpressions\n \nof the claimant and the account he has provided.\n&#xa0;\n8.  The Government also favours a system in which the medical report is sent \nsimultaneously\n to the claimant and defendant. This is completely inappropriate as medi\ncal reports contain confidential medical information\n,\n requir\ning\n the individual’s informed consent\n \nbefore being passed to a third party.\n&#xa0;\nPre-medical offers&#xa0;\n9.   A\nPIL has argued from the outset that offers of compensation made to claimants without a \nmedical report should be banned\n, and we were therefore enormously encouraged by the comments of the Transport Select Committee and the Government in relation to this\n. The APIL research \nreferred to in paragraph 5 \nfound that half of respondents questioned be\nlieved that this practice \nis in itself fraudulent. We were  encouraged, therefore, to hear from the Association of British Insurers recently that “the industry is willing to consider stopping pre-med offers…”\n \n&#xa0;\n10.\n              \nIt is unfortunate that this sentiment \nwas conditional on other developments, but still represents welcome progress, particularly when some in the industry have expressed their disquiet publicly about the practice\n.\n&#xa0;\n11. I\nt is\n is clear that t\nhis practice should be banned by means of legislation\n.\n \nT\nhere \nare\n, however,\n rule changes which c\nan \n \nbe \nintroduced\n \nmore \nquickly\n \nwhich \nwill\n help to change behaviour in relation to this practice and we are, at the time of writing\n, \n in dialogue\n with the Government\n on necessary changes\n.\n&#xa0;\n12. \nA\n medical report should not be required at the very beginning of the claim process\n as a\n requirement to produce a medical report at the outset would generate unnecessary costs and delays in claims which do not proceed.   \n \n&#xa0;\n13. O\nnce\n an improved system of med\nical reporting \nhas been\n developed, it must be used. \n \nWhile the practice of pre-medical offers persists in whiplash cases, fraud can continue undetected. To stop fraud, pre-medical offers must be banned, and the quality of medical reporting must be higher –\n the two will work in tandem.\n&#xa0;\n14. \nThird party capture is another route by which fraud can take place undetected. Insurers should also commit to obtaining medical evidence\n if\n dealing with people direct.\n Injured people must be protected from \nthe \nabuses whic\nh do take place when insurers deal with the\nm\n direct, including \nthe exertion of \nundue influence and inequality of information and bargaining power.\n \n     \n&#xa0;\nFraud data &#xa0;\n15. \nC\nlaimant lawyers \ncan\n be gatekeepers against people who try to make fraudulent claims if relevant information held by the insurance industry \nis\n made available to \nthem\n. \nClaimant solicitors could be of \nreal \nvalue in the fight against fraud if they  have access to the number and \ntype of accidents \nin which \na potential client has been involved, and \ninformation about \npersonal injury claims arising from them.\n This information is currently held by insurers\n and there is no logical disadvantage to it being made available to claimant soli\ncitor\ns\n.\n The date any previous injur\ny was\n \nsustained would also be very helpful as, if the case is genuine, this information could assist medical professionals to provide the best treatment for patient\ns\n. \nWe are greatly encouraged\n to learn \nthat discussions\n about \nthis are ongoing in the insurance industry\n and that information may become available in due course\n.\n Ideally, this data would need to be available at the time of implementation of the new medical reporting system.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Small Claims Court Limit&#xa0;\n16. \nThe announcement that there would be no change to the small claims court limit at this \ntime\n was very much welcomed by AP\nIL. T\nhe small claims court was not designed for people who represent themselves in personal injury cases; raising the limit would have h\nad no impact on fraud whatsoever, \nand this was, after all, \na \nkey\n \npurpose \nof the Government’s consultation; it would have had an enormous \nand negative \nimpact on the courts, which would have been overwhelmed by litigants in person who would have struggled to\n understand the court system; and it would have led to another explosion of spam calls and texts from claims management companies who would have exploited the situation of people who would no longer be able to afford legal representation.\n A\nn increase\n in th\ne limit would\n, therefore,\n \nhave \nbe\nen\n wholly counterproductive\n.\n&#xa0;\n17. \nIt is to be hoped that proposals can now be developed which will assist all concerned in ensuring fair compensation for those \ninjured people\n, while working to eradicate fraudulent\n and exa\ng\ng\nerated claims.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n  \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;\nPage \n1 of \n5&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nThe Whiplash Report 2012, page 12, available here: \nhttp://files.apil.org.uk/campaigns/the-whiplash-report-2012.pdf\n&#xa0;\n \nSpeech by Rob Cummings to the \nManchester\n Law Society Autumn Personal Injury Conference, 11 November 2013\n"
