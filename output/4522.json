Rather, innovation must occur across a broad front \nfrom generation through to use, at a component and system level.\n  \n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLow carbon technologies can take decades to develo\np, with inherently high costs and risks during pre-commercial stages. \nMarket failures and barriers include p\noor market signals, long payback periods, under-developed supply chains\n,\n and knowledge spill-overs that make it cheaper to replicate existing techno\nlogies than to develop \nthem\n from scratch. \nThese\n barriers have meant that businesses have tended to under-invest in low carbon innovation\n.  \n At the same time, while market incentives provide confidence to technology developers that there will be a return on\n investment, in many cases these are not \nsufficient t\no drive the required innovation.  Low carbon innovation is normally taken forwards by different businesses with different skills sets to those deploying the technologies which receive incentives.\n \nFor exa\nmple, bioenergy technologies requires considerable up-front investment across the entire agricultural supply and value chain to realise future benefits as well as investor confidence and a \nsupportive policy environment.  To fully realise the benefits will \nrequire a thirty year time horizon, but \nonce established the returns from well managed energy crops are effectively sustainable indefinitely.\n8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFor these reasons, \npublic sector\n investment is a critical component in addressing market failures, managing risk a\nnd achieving technological breakthroughs, while leveraging substantial funding from the private sector or other governments. \nPublicly funded programmes\n range from fully funding the most uncertain phases of primary research through to joint funding and risk\n sharing in the later stages, as technologies approach commercialisation. \n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe aim of these policies and programmes is to take key technologies to the point at which they are sufficiently proven\n, that the market,\n \npotentially \nwith the support of market mech\nanisms\n (such as the Renewables Obligation), or in partnership with the Green Investment Bank can\n deploy them widely. \nInnovation can support growth and deployment by reducing risk and costs by :\nThis section provide\ns\n evidence against the Committee’s \nquestion\n 4\n: \nAre the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the \ninnovation process, including over the long-term?\n 10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment\n \ns\nupports\n UK based companies \nto \ndevelop low carbon innovation technologies.  The funding is focussed on developing low carbon technologies which \ndeliver economic benefit to the UK and\n/or\n reduce the cost of energy\n while reduc\ning greenhouse gas emissions to meet legally binding targets\n that stretch out to 2050\n.  \nThe energy system is highly complex with multiple technologies interacting through multip\nle interfaces. Supporting innovation across the whole energy system and the full innovation journey is therefore also complicated. Energy also touches on many government policies and priorities including \nI\nndustrial \nStrategy\n, regional economies, environment\n, housing and transport. No single support mechanism or programme could deliver the range of support needed to deliver the diversity and scale of technology innovation required across the system.\n11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment support therefore is provided in a range of ways \nby a range of Departments and Agencies\n. \nFunding for low carbon innovation \nin the UK \nis primarily channelled\n through the Department for Business\n,\n Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)\n, and the Scottish Government\n.  \n \nThe following section sets out the\n roles of these organisations, \nand\n \nthe organisations they sponsor, which \ntogether \nmake up the core membership of the \nLow Carbon Innovation Coordination Group (LCICG).\nIn addition, associate members of the LCICG also play a fundamental role within the innovation landscape, such include Ofgem, which manages \nthe £500m Low Carbon Ne\ntworks Fund\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nFigure1: HMG low carbon energy innovation sponsors and the technology stages they are most engaged in       \n12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBIS \nmainly delivers its energy innovation support activities through its arms\n’\n length \nbodies\n \n- \nthe Research Councils UK (RCUK), \nthe \nTechnology Strategy Board\n,\n and \na public-private partnership -\n the\n Energy Technologies Institute\n (ETI)\n. \n \nBIS also run schemes, including the Regional Growth Fund\n and Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative\n, which \nare not innovation specific\n,\n but \nare \nopen to innovative businesses. \n13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nScottish Government also has arms’ length bodies with funding \npredominantly\n channelled through \nScottish Enterprise and \nHighlands and Islands Enterprise.  \n14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n \nDECC\n’s\n innovation \nsupport \ni\ns \nlargely\n d\nelivered \nby an \nin-house\n \nteam\n with some\n programmes\n being delivered in partnership with the \n \nTechnology Strategy Board\n.\n \nE\nxception\ns are\n DECC-\nCarbon Trust\n \nlegacy\n \nprogrammes\n,\n which\n \ninclud\nes\n industr\ny\n led accelerator programme\ns for technologies such as\n offshore wind\n.\n \n15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDECC and the ETI are the only\n core\n LCICG members which \nsolely \nhave a\nn\n energy focus with both seeking to reduce the cost of energy\n as their primary innovation objective\n.  DECC and ETI offer different but complementary approaches to innovati\non support\n represented by their differ\ning\n skills mix and governances\n.  \n16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDECC supports innovation by inviting companies to express interest in specific “technology calls” such as components for offshore wind turbines and assesses bids based on their merits.\n  Most of its funding is \naimed at\n later stage innovation to support the demonstration of technologies.  DECC provides grants to companies which part fund the development of the technology (in line with European state aid rules) and incubation support to he\nlp smaller companies develop sufficient skills to commercialise technologies. \n17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n The ETI is a public-private partnership which receives half of its funding from Government and the remainder from 7 large industrial companies (BP, Caterpillar, EDF, E.ON, Roll\ns Royce, Shell and Hitachi).  The ETI seeks to identify solutions to a particular technology issue\ns\n, such as a novel floating wind turbine.  Its solutions \ngenerally \nfollow a procurement approach where it invite\ns\n companies \nand academia \nto submit proposals t\no demonstrate how they would deliver the \noutput the ETI seeks\n,\n or it \ntarget\ns\n business development approaches such as taking \nequity stakes in businesses while providing direct input into how the business \nis \nrun\n.\n18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nRCUK and \nTechnology Strategy Board \nboth \nadopt an interdisciplinary approach to enabling technology\n innovation.  They \nprioritise\n their in\nnovation on different stages \nof development and audiences.  \nRCUK \nfunds energy research in early stage technologies to help define and underpin future energy sup\nply options; enhance the understanding of the social, environmental and economic implications of future energy options; reduce energy consumption and demand through the development of behavioural, governance, market and technological advances; and build ca\npacity of skilled people.  \n \nMore information on RCUK’s energy programme can be found at Annex A.\n19.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \nTechnology Strategy Board\n \nis \nthe UK innovation agency, stimulating economic growth by helping UK businesses innovate more effectively.  It \nprovides funding\n and collaboration support\n across the \nUK \neconomy, with energy\n, built environment and low carbon transport\n being \namongst its key\n \nfocus areas.\n \n \n20.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nScottish Enterprise’s focus is on stimulating economic growth; exploiting low carbon opportunities; improving Sco\ntland’s business infrastructure; and supporting business\n, with Wales and Northern Ireland’s governments having similar interests within their own geographical boundaries\n.\n21.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOther members of the \nLCICG\n which form the “associate” membership \ntypically \nprioritise\n on a sub-set of technologies and/or do not focus\n on providing direct funding support\n, such as grants\n,\n to aid technology development,\n but have other innovation\n-\nenabling levers.  For example, the Crown Estate\n’s offshore wind\n \ntest and demonstration leasing p\nrogramme facilitate\ns\n successful demonstration of technology breakthroughs, through existing sites, new sites and non-grid sites, \nallowing offshore wind manufacturers greater flexibility to deploy and test wind turbines alongside existing projects in UK wat\ners.  The Department for Communities and Local Government uses\n regulation and policy to ensure the construction of low carbon buildings\n. The Department for Transport has a renewable transport policy including support for the most sustainable biofuels, in a\nddition to innovation in freight and low emission vehicles.\n The Welsh Government , with ‘low carbon , energy and environment’ as one of its three science grand challenges, makes extensive\n&#xa0;\n use of its EU Structural Fund programmes to support low carbon innovation.”\n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment and members of the LCICG have strategies and delivery plans which have been developed with and disseminated to the low carbon sector.  The LCICG will develop a shared strategy in \nearly 2014 \nwhich \ndefines the agreed priorities for future programm\ne delivery.\n23.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSignificant public sector RD&amp;D investment in low carbon technologies is needed to accelerate deployment and to capture economic gains. With constrained resour\nces, government needs to prioritise and target its investments in those technology areas that promise to deliver maximum value both in terms of cost, carbon savings, and economic impact\n for the UK\n.\n  Inevitably some technologies will be required to be bough\nt in from abroad.\n  \n24.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nTINA project was launched in autumn 2010 \nby\n LCICG, combined with input from sector experts and organisations. Its aim is to create a robust shared knowledge base to inform coordinated programme planning and to support a portfolio ap\nproach to innovation investments. The TINAs consolidate existing research and experience across government and apply a consistent methodology to identify and value the potential for innovation within those technologies likely to be most important in achiev\ning our energy and emissions targets and in delivering economic benefits. For each selected technology area, the TINAs identify key innovation needs out to 2050, including an assessment of:\n&#xa0;\n25.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe TINAs have already been used extensively by a number of LCICG organisations, for example in \nthe development of current programmes, in the drafting of strategy documents such as the Off-shore Wind Industrial Strategy and in the des\nign and launch of specific initiatives such as the Off-shore Renewables Catapult\n.\n26.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe TINAs\n focus\n on those technologies that previous modelling and analysis (by individual LCICG members, the Energy Research Partnership and the Committee on Climate Change) \nsuggested were of particular importance to government objectives\n and where significant and coordinated UK government support was likely needed. These are:\nBioenergy\nCarbon Capture and Storage\nDomestic Buildings\nElectricity Networks and Storage\nHeat\nHydrogen for Transport\nIndustrial \nProcesses\nMarine\nNon-domestic Buildings\nNuclear Fission\nOffshore Wind\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis is not \nintended to be \na definitive list\n \nof all technology families that could contribute to the UK’s energy and growth objectives. \nThe LCICG\n \ncontinue\n to monitor technology developments\n and we will expand the TINA evidence base to include other technologies if \nthe Group identifies\n a need for TINA \nanalysis.\n \nCurrently \n3 areas for further work – Solar PV, Industrial CCS and Heat Networks – \nare bein\ng considered for\n 2014.\n28.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBuilding on \nthe LCICG’s joint work to date the LCICG members are drafting a strategic document that will help the Group work closely together to develop its future work programmes. That document will\n describe ho\nw public \nsector-\nbacked innovation support is delivered in the UK, summarise the progress made to date in strengthening coordination, \nwill\n set out \nthe Group’s\n shared aims and objectives and \nwill \ndetail how \nthe Group\n plan to work together to further strength\nen \ntheir\n coordination and impact in the future.\n29.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrioritising our resources on those innovations where the need is most pressing and where our investment can have the most impact is a key challenge for the Group. \nThe \nTINAs\n described above\n analysed and quantified the impact of technology innovation needs for a dozen technology sectors\n. The \ndocument \nwill \ntake that analysis a step \nfurther by\n set\nting\n out what \nthe Group\n believe are the key innovation needs in each of those dozen technology sectors and assess\ning\n the scale of support that would be needed to address those needs.  \n30.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe document will provide a framework for future prioritisation\n,\n it will not however set out a\n prioritised work programme. The UK government alone cannot support all the innovation needs identified and difficult choices will have to be made. \nT\nhose choices will need to be informed by the success or otherwise of current innovation programmes, the dev\nelopment of the technologies over the next few years, the development of wider energy policy and the availability of funding in future spending rounds. The future investment decisions made by members of the Group will be informed by the analysis in the doc\nument and the principles set out in it.  \n&#xa0;\n31.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs outlined in the NAO\n’s Public Funding for Innovation in Low Carbon Technologies in the UK\n report, m\neasuring the return on innovation RD&amp;D programmes is complex, not least due to inter-linkages \nwith deployment support and other policies, though there is some evidence\n that such programmes can result in significant returns.\n32.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LCICG have developed a common set of seven low carbon energy innovation metrics\n which are being piloted\n.  The metrics \naim\n to\n \nevaluate the impact and outcomes the LCICG’s programmes have had against the core themes of \ndelivering: affordable, secure, low carbon energy for the UK; UK economic growth; and the UK’s capabilities, knowledge and skills.\n33.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe metrics will \naim to \nident\nify projects \nand programmes \nin which significant cost reduction or improved efficiency has been achieved. By tracking the estimated costs of technologies we \nlook to\n \nshow progress towards commercial viability. \nThe vision is for \nLCICG \nto\n \nuse this data to loo\nk for longer-term evidence that LCICG-supported innovations are having a beneficial impact on cost reductions in commercial technology.\n&#xa0;\n34.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe metrics \nlook to\n \ncapture the contribution of the LCICG to UK growth, where commercial sales or increased company val\nuation occurs within 3 years of receiving LCICG support. \nIncreased international sales also contribute to this measure. \n For\n less commercial technologies, by tracking estimated years to market the LCICG can forecast when it expects economic impact to occur\n.  \nAnalysis will \nsupport \nthe LCICG to spot valleys of death in technology sub areas which has not been possible with a top down approach.\n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LCICG needs to \nenable\n a healthy UK innovation system if it is to succeed in delivering \nits\n aims. \nAdoption of t\nhe metrics will measure the generation of unique knowledge and inventions, the mobilisation of financial capital and perceived UK skills gaps. \nIt\n will also\n support\n identify where LCICG collaborations have \nprecipitated new innovation ac\ntivity and identify k\ney players in the landscape.\n36.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to the LCICG metrics\n,\n individual members adopt \nin-house \nevaluation processes to measure their programmes successes against their original objectives.   \nThi\ns section aims to provide evidence against the Committee’s\n question\n \n5\n: \nWhat is the impact of the short-term funding timelines on private sector investment?\n37.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK Government investment leverages substantial funding from other sources and private sector funding\n for development or demonstration projects usually matches or exceeds the government investment.\n  The balance of \npublic and private \nfunding is dependent on the project type\n and European State Aid limits.\n38.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrivate investment in low carbon generation and \nenergy efficiency technologies plays a crucial role in innovation, and is influenced by expected returns, the cost of capital and its availability, the degree of regulatory certainty, perceived risks (demand, technological and political), and the extent to\n which firms can enter and exit markets with ease. Al\nt\nogether, a ‘productive ecosystem’ is required to encourage innovation, including conditions in which risks can be understood, managed and anticipated. For conventional private funds, \nsuch as commercial \nbanks, \nwhich generally have a low appetite for risk, the uncertainties inherent in the development of energy technologies will often be sufficiently large to dissuade investment.\n \n39.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe LCICG members seek to reduce these risks by offering a range of interve\nntions which may benefit different innovations such as capital grants, equity investment and incubation.  The members also play a different role in the commercialisation of technologies at different stages of development.  \n40.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInnovation, particularly in the \ne\nnergy sector, can take a long time. Most public sector funding for low carbon\n innovation \nis constrained by the \nspending r\nound timetables which limit commitments beyond the current spending round. This lack of long term certainty that support will be avail\nable can be a barrier to investment by private sector innovators. Some public-sector \nbacked bodies such as \nthe Energy Technologies Institute and the Catapult Centres and \nhave\n,\n however\n,\n been able to plan activities on \na \nlong\ner time horizon. \n41.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nUK \nGovernme\nnt’s industrial strategies\n,\n published in 2013\n,\n set out how \ngovernment aims to overcome specific barriers faced by businesses developing their technologies, including for the offshore wind, construction and nuclear sectors.  These include access to finance;\n partnerships with sectors; support for emerging technologies; creating a pipeline of skilled workers; and government procurement to support the development of supply chains.\n \nSome specific \nrecent \nexamples:\n42.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition to the UK industrial strategies \nScotland developed \nspecific strategies for its key strategic sectors such as the \nOffshore Wind Ro\nute Map.\n43.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMany\n low carbon\n innovations are driven by \nvery small businesses\n which can\nno\nt raise capital from banks as their businesses are pre-revenue\n generating\n.  They often seek support from Angel or \nV\nenture \nC\napital \ninvestors.  The public low carbon innovati\non landscape offers a range of solutions to support different type of businesses, third sector organisations and academia \nto \nget the support they need, \nmainly in the form of\n capital grants\n and\n procuring their \ntechnology\n but also to a lesser extent equity and business incubation\n.\n \n44.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is through coordinated \na\nnd strategic investment that government can catalyse greater levels of private sector innovation and unlock the resources required to achieve improved efficiencies and\n reduced costs for low carbon technologies, while delivering economic benefits from growing businesses and supply chains\n.\n45.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n  \nThe \nTechnology Strategy Board\n and RCUK\n are developing \nthe \nconcept \nof an ‘energy catalyst’ fund that could support the best new energ\ny technologies from concept all the way through to commercialisation in a continuous manner and at the time when needed.  This kind of mechanism could provide greater certainty of public support to low carbon technology developers.\n  \nFor example, t\nhe RCUK a\nnd TSB are to launch the Industrial Biotechnology Catalyst (IB Catalyst) in January 2014.  The IB Catalyst will fund proposals to support the early translation of research (including gaseous and liquid biofuels) from groups led by academics only, academic-\nindustrial collaborations and industrialists.   \nThis section provides evidence against the Committee’s\n \nquestion\n 7\n: \nHow is the Government maximising opportunities to learn from and partner with i\nnternational partners within and beyond the EU?\n46.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe LCICG members \nhave increasingly looked for opportunities to\n collaborate with foreign partners to research, develop and demonstrate low carbon technologies of mutual interest. There is good potential to ma\nke more of the UK’s reputation for high quality research and our attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment. \nThe UK can\n build on this to work with others in addressing challenges that nation states cannot tackle alone, to share costs and\n risks, accelerate technology development and \ndisseminate\n lessons learned.\n47.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK also works in partnership with other countries, with RCUK offices in China, India and USA. Over the last few years RCUK has funded activities in key technologies with China i\nn renewable energy generation technologies, CCS, fuel cells\n, energy storage\n and smart grids worth \n£30m\n, and with India in fuel cells, smart grids\n, energy storage\n, solar energy and bioenergy, worth £23m, as well as collaborations with India in nuclear resea\nrch.\n&#xa0;\n Members of the LCICG are working together to identify new collaboration opportunities in technology areas where the UK has shared interests with other countries.\n&#xa0;\n \n48.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the EU level, Horizon 2020 has replaced the Framework Programme. Horizon 2020 is intended as a \nsingle integrated mechanism for supporting EU research and innovation, \nand will run from 2014 until 2020. Funding for energy \nresearch and innovation\n will be a\nround €1bn a year, \nmore than double\n the amount available previously. Subject to certain conditions, the new mechanism is also open to entities from all over the world, and therefore provides more collaboration opportunities for researchers, scientists and \ninnovative businesses.\n49.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHorizon 2020 presents opportunities for LCICG members to build on the progress made under the Framework Programme - to make greater use of the funding on offer while bringing industry and academia together in productive international\n collaborations\n50.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has been successful in positioning itself at the heart of the EU’s processes for setting energy priorities, under the \nCommunitie\ns\n’\n \ncoordinated technology programme - the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan). However, there is \nscope to do more: in addition to LCICG members collaborating with each other and with private sector partners, they are increasingly seeking to forge international partnerships to pool resources and share risks in taking forward joint programmes. Internati\nonal collaborations help UK companies to gain technical expertise from their foreign counterparts and provide access to new markets.\n51.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOne such example in practice is the ‘BESTF’ ERA-NET \n(Networks Emerging from European Research Area) \nPlus\n, a consortium of \neight EU Member States, including the UK, and associated countries. This venture is providing funding and support to collaborative bioenergy projects that demonstrate one or more innovative steps resulting in pre-commercial demonstration. \nMembers of the LC\nICG are \nalso engaged in ERANETS in Solar and Marine energy technologies\n \nas well as Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy\n52.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK is also engaging in European \nindustry-driven, bottom-up approac\nhes\n aimed at facilitating transnational cooperation on technical\n innovation \nsuch as Eurostars, managed by the \nTechnology Strategy Board for SME collaboration in Europe and \nEUROGIA \nunder\n EUREKA\n which has been linked and managed through DECC’s Energy Entrepreneurs Fund.\n53.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe devolved Governments \nand Local Enterprise Part\nnership (LEPs) \nuse\n \nthe European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as a springboard to launch and establish low carbon energy innovation programmes\n in assisted areas\n.\n54.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe European Commission has identified that a new impetus is needed to join up energy techn\nology policies across the EU. Implementation plans for 2013-15 under the SET Plan European Industrial Initiatives are to be drawn up to help identify the priority areas for Member State collaboration in the short term. For the longer term, Horizon 2020 - t\nhe EU’s new, simplified research, development, demonstration and deployment support programme - includes international cooperation as an important cross-cutting priority. The expectation among LCICG members and beyond is that exploring productive partnersh\nips and finding common interests with others will in future play a much bigger role in low carbon innovation activity\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThis section provide\ns\n evidence a\ngainst the Committee’s question 2\n: \nDoes \nthe Government have the right balance of focus between energy efficiency, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies?\n and \nthe \nquestion\n 4\n: \nAre the Government &amp; LCICG targeting investment towards the most effective stages of the innovation process, i\nncluding over the long-term?\n 55.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe RCUK Energy Programme aims to position the UK to meet its energy and environmental targets and policy goals through the support of world-class research and doctoral training.\n&#xa0;\nThe Energy Programme \nis investing more than £540M in research and skills in the current spending \nreview period to pioneer a low carbon future.

The SUPERGEN programme’s mission is to bring the UK’s academic community together in each field to address the underpinning r\nesearch challenges holding back the deployment of low carbon technologies. The programme also provides an easily accessible point of contact for industry and government. The programme was renewed for a third phase in 2011, moving from large fixed consortia\n to a hub and spoke model that is more open, more flexible and easier to manage.  \n&#xa0;\n73.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Offshore Renewables (wind, wave and tidal) Research Programme (2011-2014) is jointly funded by NERC and DEFRA and contributes £3.6M to essential research on environment\nal interactions with offshore renewables technologies.\n&#xa0;\nIn addition, the NERC Marine Renewable Energy\n&#xa0;\nKnowledge Exchange programme is focussed on accelerating uptake of NERC research by businesses as well as policy/regulatory organisations\n&#xa0;\nand facilitating \ndevelopment of innovative tools and methods for\n&#xa0;\nenvironmental monitoring and assessment (2011-2015). \nWhole energy systems – UK Energy Research Centre 74.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunded \n(£20M, 2009-2014) \nby the Research Councils UK Energy Programme (EPSRC, ESRC and NERC), the \nUK Energy Research Centre \n(UKERC) carries out world-class research into sustainable future energy systems. \nUKERC \ntakes a whole-systems approach to energy options\n, supply, and\n usage in order to enhance understanding of their social, environmental, and economic implications\n.\n It is the hub of UK energy research and the gateway between the UK and the international energy research communities. The centre's\n&#xa0;\ninterdiscipl\ninary, whole\n-\nsystems research informs UK \nand international \npolicy development and research strategy. UKERC\n&#xa0;\nwas established in 2004. \n75.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current total RCUK whole energy systems portfolio is £42.5M.\nDoctoral training in energy\n76.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEPSRC currently supports 12 \nCentres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in energy (£82M investment) involving over 100 industrial partners. Eight new EPSRC energy CDTs have recently been announced as part of a £350M investment in cohort-based PhD training.\n77.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNERC is funding a CDT in oil and g\nas\n (see above) and as\n part of a £100M investment in environmental science doctoral training NERC is funding a Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) led by the University of Manchester which will fund a number of studentships in the area of radioactivity and \nthe environment.\n&#xa0;\nLarge \nf\nacilities and \ne\nnergy \nr\nesearch\n78.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK supports large scientific facilities used by researchers in a variety of disciplines\n, many of which relate to low carbon energy studies\n. In particular, the STFC funds and operates the following \nfacilities at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory: the \nISIS Neutron and Muon Source\n, the \nCentral Laser Facility\n and, in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust, the \nDiamond Light Source\n synchrotron. \nVarious e\nnergy\n-\nrelated research \nis carried out \nat these facilities, including nanomaterials for low carbon energy\n, extending the lifetime of nuclear power stations\n and investigations in\nto inertially confined fusion\n.\nThis section provide\ns\n evidence against the Committee’s\n 6\nth\n question: \nHow should DECC ensure that its remaining capital allocation for low carbon innovation will \nbe spent wisely, after two years of underspend?\n79.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe 2010 Spending Review announced \nDECC \ncapital \nfunding of over £200m for low carbon technologies. This included up to £60m for the development of offshore wind manufacturing at port sites. The remaining capi\ntal funding is supporting innovation in low carbon technologies and systems. Using the \nTINAs, \nthe programme has prioritised key technology families, to inform innovation plans and properly target spending.\n80.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NAO’s\n \nreport into Public funding for innovatio\nn in low carbon technologies in the UK\n,\n stated that DECC’s spending in 2011/12 and 2012/13 was substantially less than budgeted and that the department was looking to accelerate spending in 2013/14 and 2014/15.\n  The report stated that DECC had forecast (ca\npital and programme) spend for four year spending review of £173.2m against a budget of £181m.\n81.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDECC’s\n technology\n innovation \n“\ncalls\n” or “requests for proposals”\n requ\nire\n companies to submit bids for funding.  Funding is \ndistributed\n on the basis of the best i\ndeas\n, \nwhich fit with\n the objectives of the\n specific call\n while aligning with DECC’s broader agenda, and offer value for money, rather\n than \nfully utilising the DECC innovation\n budget.\n82.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInnovation projects are innately ris\nky and challenging to forecast becaus\ne they are unique and dealing with unknowns in \ntheir \ndevelopment and construction. F\nlexibility to adapt to the realities of the project as it develops is important to maximise the chances of successful delivery. Part of the challenge for the \nprogramme managers \nis to track the comm\nitted funding levels and actual \nspend \nwhile making\n adjustments and trade-offs between \nprojects\n to maximise\n value for money\n,\n \nwhile\n ensuring we can fund as many good projects as possible. \n&#xa0;\n83.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDECC’s initial innovation bud\nget profile \nallocation from the spending review settlement \nwas identified as being suboptimal \nand was modified\n \nto become\n flatter\n and aligned to suit\n an innovat\nion programme that maximises value for money\n.\n  \nD\nespite over programming to take account of the in\nherent risks \na small underspend consistent with what is contained within the NAO report is forecast. \n84.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll the schemes in DECC’s innovation programme were successfully launched in 2012.
