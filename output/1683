[normal]About the Society for General Microbiology
[normal]The Society for General Microbiology (SGM) is a membership organisation for scientists who work in all areas of microbiology. It is the largest learned microbiological society in Europe wi
[normal]th a worldwide membership based in universities, industry, hospitals, research institutes and schools. The SGM publishes key academic journals in microbiology and virology, organises international scientific conferences and provides an international forum 
[normal]for communication among microbiologists and supports their professional development. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, t
[normal]hrough a comprehensive framework of communication activities and resources.
[normal] 
[normal]Further information about SGM is provided in Appendix 1.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In early 2013, the Council of the Society for General Microbiology agreed to establish a short-term Working Group to make recommendations to Council to improve the equality of opportunity and diversity of representation in the Society’s membership. The Wor
[normal]king Group is chaired by Professor Hilary Lappin-Scott, E
[normal]quality and Diversity Champion. 
[normal]The Working Group is currently preparing 
[normal]the SGM Policy on 
[normal]Equality and Diversity
[normal] for Council to consider
[normal].
