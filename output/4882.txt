[[[ [CT 13]]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;Whether the Government has the capability to examine and combat the use of communications (including via the internet) in terrorism-related activities.&#xa0;1. Yes.&#xa0;2. We below note a separation between capability, and institutional ability to use such a capability effectively. Privacy should not rely on State incompetence or disinterest.&#xa0;Whether the UK has sufficient capability to detect, investigate and disrupt terrorist threats.&#xa0;3. The UK has sufficient capability to detect, investigate and disrupt threats, but a lacks adequate capability to protect innocent citizens from the side effect of intrusion. There is a lack of clear legal framework over how these powers are used, and what rights individuals have to know about and question their use. Such a clear legal framework would also allow for an independent authorisation for surveillance.&#xa0;4. More explicitly, the UK does lack sufficient capability to detect, investigate and disrupt institutional thinking that threatens civil liberties and the values of the UK. The UK has an independent reviewer of terrorism which substantially depoliticised terrorism laws; why not an independent reviewer of civil liberties? We need an institution that is separate from politics, is able to comprehend modern technologies and capabilities, with a mandate to protect civil liberties.&#xa0;5. Legacy of the Communications Data Bill&#xa0;6. When advocating for the Communications Data Bill, the Home Office made a number of arguments that the UK lacked capabilities to deal with serious crime, paedophiles, and terrorism. Since the work of the Joint Committee on the Draft Communications Data Bill committee concluded, it has become increasingly evident that the explanations given to both committees of the capabilities available to law enforcement and especially the Counter Terrorism Agencies were critically lacking, to the point of potentially being misleading  .&#xa0;7. The Home Secretary’s refusal to allow the Intelligence Agencies to give evidence to the Joint Committee looks founded in continuing institutional secrecy, with the result that two Committee of both Houses was left with an inaccurate impression by the Head of the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism. Of how many capabilities revealed this summer, those directly relevant to their Terms of Reference, were the Committees informed? &#xa0;8. The legislated remit of Agencies is substantially different to the rhetoric used for the Bill's support, for example around "economic well-being", which can be interpreted incredibly flexibly (yet did not appear in the Communications Data BIll debates) - in short, "Terrorists should be priority, not commercial rivals". In light of this discrepancy, resources may have been diverted from counter-terrorism efforts, on a priority basis not considered by Parliament. &#xa0;9. During the deliberations over the Draft Communications Data Bill, the Home Secretary argued that it was simply metadata that was being collected, and not content. Recent revelations about metadata processing in the US has been treated with much greater concern, both domestically and internationally, being cited in the cancellation of a State Visit to the US, partially as a result of metadata derived surveillance of the President-Elect of Brazil.  &#xa0;10. We are in urgent need for a general recognition of the sensitivity of metadata (beyond agencies who very much recognise the sensitivity). Every transaction we make in modern society generates metadata. For instance, it is now routine for organisations to request donations online, be they political contributions, or in support of a civic campaign. Emailed receipts will contain information within that is politically sensitive -- the size of donations or type of causes, for example. Equivalent surveillance outputs, from the same social network analysis tools as used to target the Brazilian President-Elect, would immediately produce such information of interest to the Intelligence Agencies. Companies are required to surrender the communications data fed into such tools - "communications data is about the who, when, where, and how", as the Home Secretary says.&#xa0;11. We note that while the Internet companies (Yahoo, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Dropbox, et al) have been quite public about their interest in protecting the privacy and rights of their users against widespread government access requests, the telephone providers have been silent about any steps they have taken to protect the privacy of UK citizens. The Communications Data Bill was replaced with a voluntary programme of work by the Home Office with the telephone providers (Vodafone, EE, O2, 3, BT, TalkTalk, et al) to look at IP address resolution. The suggestion of the next generation IP addresses (IPv6) would provide individual addressing per device continues to be valid. If the committee receives oral evidence from the mobile telephone companies, we hope they would be willing to put on record a justification for their reluctance to take a (small) technical step to meet the Home Office's stated national security need, a step which does not impinge on wholly innocent individuals or require new and large publicly funded databases and interconnections. The internet companies have done the preparatory work, it is the telecoms companies who are preventing resolution of what the Home Office claim is a critical national security issue. We do however appreciate that it is difficult for the phone companies to speak on steps they refuse to take, in line with their refusal to publish a transparency report.&#xa0;Safeguards are ineffective&#xa0;12. There was a large amount of debate beyond the Communications Data Bill Committee about safeguards. Safeguards have been shown to be fundamentally ineffective: absent confidence and evidence to the contrary, safeguards will be circumvented. Transparency and integrity are required. Currently, the UK has neither and is well behind international standards that include judicial authorisation, intercept evidence used in courts, limitations in law on collection and use, transparency and notification regimes, and rights of redress.&#xa0;Mobile telephones and Policing13. Innovations in technology have provided the state with powers of surveillance previously unimagined. Police and security agencies are now capable of directly conducting mass surveillance, and targeted invasive surveillance, without the need of interacting with any third party. It remains unclear what legal framework governs these activities. For instance, we are concerned that the Metropolitan Police has begun routinely duplicating all data off a cell phone of a suspect irrespective of charge. This mass interrogation of individual's call history, contacts, messages and the other material held on a modern mobile device. The rules on the use, retention and distribution of such material are secret, and without adequate public scrutiny, are quite likely to be of concern when publicly examined.&#xa0;14. Similarly, the indiscriminate use of mobile phone surveillance through the deployment of police-controlled base stations appears to be unregulated. All attempts to identify the rules under which these ’IMSI catchers’  (aka IMSI grabbers) are used by police have been unfruitful as the authorities claim that disclosing anything about their use would hinder the prevention of serious crime and protection of national security.&#xa0;15. In this respect, little has changed in the security debate since the Intelligence Services Act 1994, which put GCHQ on a legal footing. We look forward to working with Parliament identifying the areas where greater scrutiny, protections, and oversight are required.&#xa0;Sam SmithPrivacy InternationalSeptember 2013&#xa0; Theresa May, HC Deb, 8 January 2013, c166. http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2013-01-08b.166.0 "Track crime on net or we’ll see more people die.
