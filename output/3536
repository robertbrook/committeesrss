default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSince April 2011, The King’s Fund has published a quarterly monitoring report which analyses NHS performance against key indicators and tracks progress in 
defaultimproving productivity
default based on a regular survey of NHS finance directors. Although the survey is 
defaultnot a representative sample
default, 
defaultand
default 
defaultsome 
defaultcaution should be exercised in comparing results
default between quarters
default, it does provide valuable insight into how the NHS is responding to the Nicholson Challenge.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe reports 
defaultshow
default that NHS organisations made good progress in meeting productivity targets
default during the first two years of the Nicholson Challenge
default. In 2011/12,
default an average saving of 4.7 per cent was reported by those responding to 
defaultour
default survey, against an average cost improvement programme (CIP) target of 5.1 per cent. In 2012/13, an average saving of 4.6 per cent was reported against an average CIP
default target of 4.9 per cent. These findings are 
defaultbroadly 
defaultconsistent with other evidence about the 
defaultprogress 
defaultmade in meeting the Nicholson Challenge
default,
default including the National Audit Office’s assessment of 
defaultsavings
default made in 2011/12.
default&#xa0;

defaultHowever, our 
defaulttwo 
defaultmost recent reports reveal a significant 
defaultfall 
defaultin
default confidence among those surveyed about whether CIP targets can 
defaultcontinue to be met
default. 
defaultOur most recent report, in September 2013, found that only a third 
defaultof NHS trust finance directors were confident of meeting 
defaultan average
default CIP target for 2013/14 
defaultof 4.9 per cent. 
defaultThis

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCCG finance leads - surveyed for the first time for our September report – were much more confident
default than their counterparts in NHS trusts
default, with nearly 70 per cent expecting to meet an average 
defaultQIPP 
defaulttarget of 2.5 per cent in 2013/14. 
defaultNHS England and CCGs are forecasting a combined surplus of £596 million, although the number of CCGs predicting a deficit has increased from nine to 24.

defaultWith NHS England in particular still finding its feet,

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe 
defaultnote the assurances given to the Committee’s previous inquiry and the findings of the National Audit Office report that
default the bulk of the savings made in 2011/12 were recurrent.
default Nevertheless, we 
defaultremain concerned that 
defaulta significant element
default of the progress so 
defaultfar has been delivered through
default 
defaultpay restraint, reductions in the tariff and cuts in management costs 
defaultrather than genuin
defaulte improvements in productivity. We also reiterate our concern that too much emphasis has been placed on generating financial savings, rather than on improving

default It remains to be seen whether the government is successful in deferring the planned 1 per cent pay rise 
defaultdue 
defaultin April 2014. 
defaultOpportunities remain to reduce the costs associated with the use of agency staff, locums and staff sickness. 
defaultHowever,
default pay restraint i
defaults
default not a long term substitute for efficiency gain. With staff costs making up the bulk of the NHS budget and significant pressures on providers to maintain staffing levels following the shocking failures of care highlighted by the Francis report, there is little or no 
defaultfurther 
defaultroom for manoeuvre in reducing staff costs.
default&#xa0;

default 
defaultAlongside this, year-on-year reductions in the tariff mean that it 
defaultwill have
default been cut by nearly 7 per cent in real terms by 201

default, increasing pressures on providers
default. As the Committee pointed out in its previous report, the tariff is a blunt instrument for driving productivity improvements which does little to drive efficiencies among commissioners.

defaultajor reconfigurations of services are essential to improve quality of care
default and have the potential to improve financial sustainability (although they often result in significant short term costs, 
defaultas is
default the case with the proposed changes to services in South London and Mid Staffordshire)
default. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultprogress continues to be slow and has been hampered by notable setbacks such as the failure to bring the long-running review of children’s heart surgery to a conclusion. The picture is further complicated by the 
defaultincreased involvement of the competition authorities in decisions about mergers and service changes. There are clearly lessons to be learned for the NHS from the Competition Commission’s recent decision to reject the proposed merger between Bournemouth and Poole hospitals. However, the risk is that this and other decisions 
defaultresult in
default competition law 
defaultbeing seen as
default an impediment to service change
default.
default&#xa0;
default12)
default 
defaultWe remain concerned about the lack of capacity in the new health system 
defaultto undertake large-scale reorganisations across wide geographical areas, especially in London, where the need for change is particularly urgent. We have proposed that 
defaultNHS England's London office takes on a city-wide planning role, working with CCGs, and that hospitals work together in large-scale networks based on the three existing academic science networks 
defaultto drive change. This would have the benefit of ensuring that major changes to services are overseen by the most experienced leaders and is 
defaultan approach we 
defaultbelieve
default could be replicated elsewhere in the country.
default&#xa0;
default13)
default 
defaultThe Department of Health has previously indicated that 20 per cent of the productivity improvements needed to meet the £20 billion target will come from transformational change, with the bulk of this due to be delivered during the second half of the Nicholson Challenge period. 
defaultGiven the difficulties experienced so far in delivering transformational change, the lack of capacity for driving large scale 
defaultreconfigurations
default, the additional complexity created by the interventions of the competition authorities and the political difficulty of agreeing changes 
defaultto services 
defaultin the run up to a General Election, 
defaultthe risk is that
default

default 
defaultNHS England is currently review
defaulting
default the NHS allocations process, having rejected 
defaultproposed 
defaultchanges to the 
defaultcurrent 
defaultallocations 
defaultformula as being inconsistent with its duty to reduce health inequalities. 
defaultWhile recent debate has largely focused on the relative weight 
defaultthat should be 
defaultgiven to age a
defaultnd deprivation in the formula, more fundamental questions should be asked about whether the current process, which has remained largely unchanged since the 1970s, is fit for purpose.
default 
defaultAt the heart of this is whether the resource allocation process is simply a mechanism for distributing funding
default or 
defaultshould be

default for supporting wider NHS objectives
default. 
defaultAs we set out in a report on this earlier this year, 
defaultthere is 
defaultsignificant

default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default15)
default 
defaultIn the short term, immediate improvements could be made to reduce

default, increase transparency and improve

default.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe prospects for the long term viability of NHS trusts and NHS foundation trustsdefault&#xa0;
default16)
default 
defaultDespite the challenging financial environment, 
defaultNHS
default 
defaultproviders have
default so far held up 
defaultreasonably 
defaultwell at the aggregate level
default. Overall, the NHS in England reported a surplus of just over £2 billion in 2012/13. Our latest quarterly monitoring report found that nearly 
default90 per cent of NHS trust finance directors and CCG finance leads surveyed expect to break even or record a surplus in 2013/14. However, the
defaultse
default figures obscure 
defaultthe fact that 
defaultan increasing
default number of trusts 
defaultare struggling - seven of 42 NHS trust finance directors reported that they are forecasting a deficit.
default&#xa0;
default17)
default 
defaultThese findings are

default Smaller hospitals face particular challenges because they have a higher proportion of fixed costs and lower margin non-elective work. We note that Monitor is looking at the issues faced by smaller providers - we will be undertaking our own work in this area too.
default&#xa0;
default19)
default 
defaultAn added pressure for many acute trusts is 
defaultcaused by 
defaultCCGs seek
defaulting
default to shift outpatient activity in
defaultto
default community settings. While this can make care more accessible to patients, evidence suggests that initiatives 
defaultto move care closer to home can 
defaultdrive up costs.

default 
defaultWith 
defaulta growing
default number of trusts in deficit, others may be forced to follow the recent example of Barts 
defaultwhich has been forced to cut staff, including 161 nursing posts, in the face of significant financial difficulties
default.
default Meanwhile, many hospitals are struggling to 
defaultmeet 
defaultthe fo
defaultur hour A&amp;E waiting time target, underlining how difficult it will be for providers to continue to
default maintain quality of care and balance the books.
default 
defaultThere are also significant pressures in the mental health sector, with recent evidence suggesting that more than 1,700 mental health beds have been closed since 2011.
default&#xa0;
default21)
default 
defaultThe pressure will increase in 2015/16 following confirmation of another year of essentially flat funding and the announcement of the new £3.8 billion Integration Transformation Fund
default (ITF)
default.
default 
defaultWhile 
defaultthis provides
default 
defaultan 
defaultopportunity to drive 
defaultforward 
defaultintegrated care, it will result in an average reduction in funding 
defaultfor CCGs 
defaultof approximately £17 million
default, adding significantly to pressures in the provider sector
default. As the graph below shows, while 
default‘healthcare’ spending will 
defaulthave 
defaultincrease
defaultd
default over the period up to 2015/16, once the ITF and transfers to local authorities are accounted for, 
defaultthis translates to

default1.4
default per cent
default cut over the period from 2009/10 to 2015/
default16.

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default22)
default 
defaultBeyond this, t
defaulthe prospects look even more challenging. Overall, NHS England has forecasted a potential funding gap of £30 billion by 2021, based on current trends in funding and demand. While this may be unduly pessimistic, it is clear that the NHS will remain under significant financial pressure and will need to continue to find year-on-year productivity improvements for the rest of the decade.

defaultThe impact on adult social care of the 2010 Spending Review settlement defaultand ability of local authorities to make efficiency savingsdefault&#xa0;
default23)
default 
defaultWhile the government’s decision to allocate additional resources to adult social care in the 2010 spending review was welcome, this has been more than offset by an overall reduction in financial support to local government of 
defaultmore than
default 30 per cent. 
default2

defaultthat

default to
default a cumulative reduction of £2.68

default 
defaultAlthough c

default of this year’s savings coming from the
default direct withdrawal of services.
default 87 per cent of councils now only respond to needs classified as substantial or critical under the Fair Access to Care (FACS) criteria. 
defaultThe decision in the 2013 Spending Round to impose a further reduction in grant funding of 10 per cent in 2015/16 will add to these pressures. 
default&#xa0;
default25)
default 
defaultAs a result, t
defaulthe number of 
defaultolder 
defaultpeople receiving publicly funded services has 
defaultfallen 
defaultby 
default26
default per cent since
default 
default2009/10, with an equivalent reduction of 21 per cent among working age adults over the same period.
default Given the overriding imperative to provide care 
defaultcloser
default 
defaultto 
defaulthome and reduce the need for 
defaultresidential care and 
defaulthospital admissions, it is particularly worrying that the 
defaultlargest 
defaultreduction has been in the use of community-based services such as home care (down 25
default per cent
default) 
defaultcompared to nursing home care (down 
default4
default per cent) and residential care (down 1.7 per cent
default).
default&#xa0;
default26)
default 
defaultSince the Committee’s previous report, t
defaulthe government
default has 
defaultannounced its decision
default 
defaultto implement the 
defaultDilnot Commission’s 
defaultproposals
default, albeit with a higher cap 
defaulton individual costs 
defaultthan the Commission recommended of £72,000. We welcome this as 
defaulta 
defaultsignificant 
defaultmilestone and a 
defaultstepping stone to wider r
defaulteform. 
defaultHowever, i
defaultmplementing the proposals 
defaultwill be challenging, with high risks
default 
defaultof confu
defaultsion, complexity and complaints.
default 
defaultWithout a major public awareness campaign, there is a real danger that many people will see the reforms as worse 
defaultthan
default the current system, rather than an improvement on it
default. 
default&#xa0;
default27)
default 
defaultImplementing the 
defaultDilnot Commission
default’s recommendations will not solve the social care funding challenge. As the Commission
default concluded 
default‘…
default 
defaultthe government must devote greater resources to the adult social care system. As well as funding for new reforms, additional public funding for the means-tested system is urgently required’.
default 
defaultThe central challenge is to assess the total quantity of resources needed to ensure that people have access to the right level of support
default. For many people it is eligibility for help, not protection from co
defaultsts
default that is the primary issue. Setting the national eligibility threshold at the moderate level under the FACS criteria would increase the number of people helped by 23 per cent. However, at an estimated cost of £2 billion, it is hard to see this happening in the current financial climate. 
default&#xa0;default28)
default 
defaultThe combination of unremitting financial and demographic pressures is undermining the government’s aim of putting social care on a stable footing through the Care Bill and the additional resources from the NHS. The House of Lords Committee on Public Services and Demographic Change was not exaggerating when it concluded that the social care system is in crisis.

default29)
default 
defaultThe 2010 Spending Review announced that £1 billion would be transferred to local authorities from the NHS 
defaultover the four years to 2014/15, with further transfers of 
default£100 million and £200 million pledged 
defaultfor
default 2013/14 and 2014/15 in t
defaulthe White Paper 
defaultCaring for our Future
default. 
defaultE
defaultvidence 
defaultsuggests 
defaultthat CCGs and local authorities are working well together to agree how the transferred money is used. 
defaultHowever, o
defaultf the money allocated this year, 
default£366 million (
default46
default per cent
default) is being used to offset cuts to services and help meet demographic pressures
default, rather than to drive transformational change
default.
default This is another indication of the pressure on budgets and a lost opportunity to promote integrated care.
default&#xa0;
default30)
default 
defaultDelayed transfers 
defaultof care

defaultwith t
defaulthe proportion of delays attributable to social care 
defaulthaving 
defaultfallen 
defaultto 27 per

default. 
defaultAlthough we share the Committee’s concern about the reliability of 
defaultthe national
default data given 
defaultthe strength of 
defaultanecdotal evidence that delayed transfers are a significant problem in some areas, this 
defaultdoes suggest that local authorities are prioritising hospital discharge, possibly at the expense of support 
defaultfor
default pe
defaultople living in their own homes.
default&#xa0;
default31)
default 
defaultAs set out above, the 
defaultcreation of 
defaultthe
default Integration Transformation Fund from 2015/16 represents a major opportunity to drive forward integrated care
default, although it will increase pressures on NHS organisations
default.
default Expectations 
defaultabout 
defaultwhat the 
defaultF
defaultund will achieve are high – 
defaultnational conditions that must be addressed in local plans include
default 
defaultprotecting
default social care services, relieving pressure
defaults
default on 
defaultemergency care and ensuring seven-d
defaultay working to 
defaultsupport
default hospital discharge. Robust plans to achieve this will almost certainly involve reductions in hospital activity
default, adding to financial pressures in the acute sector
default. 
default&#xa0;
default32)
default 
defaultThe Committee’s previous report was enthusiastic about the potential for health and wellbeing boards (HWBs) to be the forum for developing integrated care, a view that we share. Our recent report based on a national survey of HWBs found that they have made good progress in establis
defaulthing themselves
default.
default However, there
default 
defaultis 
defaultlittle sign that they have begun to grapple with the most pressing local issues such as service reconfigurations and
default 
defaultonly nine of 65 responses to this question in our survey identified integrated care as a priority.
default 
defaultBoards appear to recognise the need to change gear, with 62 per cent of respondents saying they would like to play a greater role in commissioning services. T
defaulthe requirement that boards sign off local plans will be an important test of their readiness to take on a stronger commissioning role across all services.
default&#xa0;
default33)
default 
defaultThe long term ambition should be to plan with 100 per cent of NHS and social care resources, not just the 
default3 per cent represented by the 
defaultITF
default. 
defaultThis raises bigger 
defaultquestions about 
defaultwhether
default 
defaultthe post-war settlement
default,
default which established the NHS as a universal service, free at the point of use and social care as a separately funded, means-tested service
default, remains fit for purpose
default. 
defaultThis is why we have
default established an independent commission
default,
default chaired by Kate Barker
default,
default to explore 
defaultwhether, and if so how, the NHS and social care system should be brought closer together
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultProgress on making efficiencies through the integration of health and social care servicesdefault&#xa0;
default34)
default 
defaultThe Committee’s previous report emphasised the need to increase the scale and pace of integrated care. 
defaultSince then, the government has signalled a more ambitious approach to delivering integrated care with 
defaultkey national bodies
default signed up to a shared definition and commitment on integrated care, the creation of the ITF and the recent announcement 
defaultthat 
default14 pioneer areas 
defaultwill
default lead the way in developing integrated care.
default&#xa0;
default35)
default 
defaultIntegrated care not only improves patient outcomes and experience, but also offers significant opportunities to make more efficient use of resources by reducing waste, duplication and fragmentation. However, it is important to recognise that transformational change take
defaults
default time to demonstrate results. The 
defaultpotential 
defaultfor integrated care 
defaultto deliver financial savings remains to be seen, and there may be a need to invest in new models of care before resources can be released from existing models. 
default&#xa0;
default36)
default 
defaultP
defaultrogress in implementing integrated care locally remains variable. Anecdotal evidence indicates increasing interest, with some parts of the country making good progress in developing 
defaultand delivering 
defaultambitious plans. However, the 
defaultfinding from our survey
default 
defaultthat
