defaultSecretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
default gave evidence.  
defaultQ1default 
defaultChair:default Good afternoon. This is the Committee’s regular session taking evidence from the Secretary of State. We intended to do one last year, but we spared the Secretary of State because she had only been in post for about two weeks and it seemed a little premature. I welcome Maria Miller to her first appearance as Secretary of State on a general brief—we talked about press regulation a few weeks ago.
default              
defaultPerhaps I can start off. The number of staff employed by your Department has fallen dramatically. Do you think that that has had any impact on the effectiveness of the Department or on its ability to conduct its remit? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Clearly, Chair, we have had significant challenges as a Government in ensuring that our budgets are sustainable in the long term. As a Department, we felt that it was important that when we addressed that problem we did everything we could to ensure that the money—the public funding—reached the front lines and the services that make a difference, particularly in the areas of culture, media and sport, but also in our responsibilities of equality and women’s issues. To minimise the impact on those budgets, we felt that it was important to take a long, hard look at the structure of our Department. I have read through the comments my predecessor made to you when he appeared before the Select Committee, and they paint an accurate picture. We wanted to ensure that we reduced administration costs in the Department to maximise the amount of money that goes out to arm’s length bodies, the other bodies we fund and all the other work we do.
default              
defaultI cannot say that it has been straightforward or easy. It has been difficult to implement the changes that we have put in place, but we have done it successfully. I pay particular tribute to the staff of my Department, who have gone through significant reorganisation this year and have come out of it in very good form indeed. Part of the answer, Chair, is that we have used our arm’s length bodies—organisations that are experts in the work they do. The challenge for the 
defaultDepartment is how to continue to use our arm’s length bodies as sources of expertise to inform the policy development we do in the Department. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ2default 
defaultChair:default You have been there for a year and had the chance to think about the role of the Department. This is a perennial question, but do you remain of the view that there needs to be a DCMS? 
default              defaultMaria Miller:default I think, Mr Whittingdale, that what we have done in the past 12 months is proof that my Department is absolutely at the heart of the Government’s economic growth agenda. Of course, culture, arts and heritage define who we are as citizens, and they have an intrinsic value in their own right. That, in itself, is reason enough to have a Department for Culture, Media and Sport. 
default              
defaultOver and above that, we have proved the Department’s economic worth, too. The days of special pleading for the Department are well and truly over, and I think that came through strongly in the spending review round in which I was involved. We demonstrated very clearly the value to the country of the Department’s work in terms of issues such as driving tourism and attracting people to come to the country and, over and above that, ensuring that culture and the arts are recognised as the soft power force that they are. The Department’s work also presents 
defaultBritain
default as a strong player overseas in our developing export markets, which was perhaps most ably demonstrated by the important role of the Department and the creative industries in the Prime Minister’s recent delegation to 
defaultChina
default, where we played a very strong role in cementing an important trip for our 
defaultUK
default industries.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ3default 
defaultChair:default Do you feel that the restructuring that you have talked about has now been completed, or would you see further changes?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default The restructuring is in place, although we are still finalising the staff who will take up those positions. I would like to point out to the Committee that, although the overall headcount has reduced, we have considered the Department’s structure, so we have reintroduced a director general-level individual to provide more strategic oversight for the Department and we have restructured BDUK, which as you know has an important role within the Department for delivering the Government’s most important infrastructure plan. We have restructured BDUK to increase the seniority of the management within that part of the Department.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ4default 
defaultChair:default Is the director general separate from the permanent secretary?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Correct. We also have a new permanent secretary this year.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ5default 
defaultChair:default Isn’t the permanent secretary there to take the strategic overview?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, but, as you will be aware, we also have a very diverse cross-section of responsibilities. The permanent secretary is there to ensure that the Department is running soundly on a staffing level and a financial level and, yes, to provide strategic oversight. Up until this point we had no director general-level staff in the Department, and I felt that we could very 
defaultmuch benefit from somebody who can provide additional management support to the permanent secretary. I think that will prove to be a very valuable addition to the Department.
default              
defaultChair:default You have referred to your vast range of different responsibilities, and we will move through those, if we may. First, we will talk about perhaps one of the most controversial responsibilities.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ6default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Press regulation. The charter was granted on 30 October. Will you tell us what has happened since the charter was granted along the road to setting up a recognition body?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, of course. I am delighted to do that, and I am sure that many members of the Committee will have been following it closely. Since the charter was put to the Privy Council and approved, there has been a process whereby the charter had to be sealed. We are not particularly in control of those processes, which are set by the Privy Council Office. The charter was sealed earlier this month, and since that point we have been able to commence finalising the details of the work that will be done by Sir David 
defaultNormington
default to appoint the chair of the Recognition Panel. It is clearly important to get that process right. 
default              
defaultI had, prior to the sealing of the charter, a meeting with Sir David Normington to discuss some of the challenges that that would present to his organisation. We have had to take some time to finalise the procedures that will be followed, because, as the Committee is aware, the Government feel that it is important that this is done outwith the Government. We had to finalise issues around funding for the work that was being done, which had not been accounted for within Sir David’s organisation.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ7default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default So it took a number of weeks for some wax to be applied.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default With respect, it is not really to do with the wax; it is much more to do with the processes that the Privy Council Office follows. I am sure that they would be able to talk to you more fully about that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ8default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I understand that the Commissioner for Public Appointments needs a letter for him to start the appointments process. He has to have a letter from you to add this to his duties. Has that letter been sent to him?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default That letter has been drafted, and approved by me. I apologise, Mr Chairman, because I have been out of the country for the past two days, but it has either just gone or it is about to go. I have certainly seen the draft. It is important for the Committee to understand that we have taken the decision that the Government should not have an involvement in the establishment of the Recognition Panel. Our involvement started and finished with the establishment of the charter, and now it is for others to take that forward, whether it is through the Independent Press Standards Organisation on the press self-regulation side, or whether it is through the Director of Public Appointments on the Recognition Panel. It will take a little time to be able to be confident that we have got things established as they should 
defaultbe. As the Committee knows, the process has been going on for some months, and perhaps years.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ9default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default So the Commissioner for Public Appointments will have that letter before Christmas, will he?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I would say yes. I cannot see any reason why that would not be the case.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ10default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Did you not know all along that he needed that letter?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default With respect, I do not think that it is to do with the letter; it is to do with ensuring that the processes are correct. Rightly, until the charter is sealed, it is not possible for us to enter into those final discussions with the commissioner, although as I indicated, I had a meeting with him a little while ago to discuss whether in principle there would be any problems with his performing this role. As you have already indicated, it required us to clarify his remit and clarify how his functions will be funded. Of course, I always hope that these things can be carried out swiftly, but inevitably, given the nature of the organisations, it does take a little time to resolve. As you have said, it was 30 October when the charter was approved by the Privy Council, so it has not exactly been a long period of time between then and now to get an important process refined and established.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ11default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default But we had months and months of delay beforehand. People can be forgiven for thinking that a letter like that and those discussions could have happened in tandem. The process should have started by now, but instead we are going to be waiting until 2014, it seems.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default To a certain extent, the processes were running in tandem, as much as they could be, but the Committee cannot underestimate the importance of getting this process right. It is not only the process of establishing the Recognition Panel; it is also about its working at arm’s length and very much separate from the Government. The last thing I would want to do was request Sir David to start his work and then for it not to have been thought through well enough for it to be able to be concluded. This is important and we have taken the necessary time to get it right.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ12default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Meanwhile, the industry is pressing ahead with its own regulator. I come back to your remarks on “The Andrew Marr Show”, which were reported by 
defaultthe
default Daily
default Mail
default 
defaultas: “Let industry’s watchdog go ahead, says Miller: Culture Secretary says Charter to regulate Press could be redundant if papers make success of their own regulatory body”. 
defaultThe Daily Telegraph
default reported those remarks as: “Culture Secretary admits ‘
defaultp
defaultress charter could be redundant’”. Is that reporting accurate?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default As you will be aware, the process that has been presented by Lord Justice Leveson is a process of a self-regulation. It has always been the case that it is for the industry to decide how that self-regulation is established. They can choose to seek recognition under the 
defaultcharter, or they can choose not to. By definition, that is what self-regulation is about. It is determined by the industry. 
default              
defaultI very much feel that the process that we have put forward, and the incentives that have been put forward, in accordance with Lord Justice Leveson’s report, provide very great incentives indeed for the industry to be involved, and I very much think that those will be incentives that will play strongly in the press’s mind. I am very pleased indeed with the progress that the press has been making in setting up IPSO, and the support that is being garnered within the industry for the approach that is being taken.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ13default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Did you mean to indicate, in those remarks on “The Andrew Marr Show”, in answer to his questions, that the whole royal charter could be redundant if the press just pressed ahead with IPSO regardless?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default What I think I clearly set out, not only there but in coming to the Committee earlier this year, was that we are talking about a system of self-regulation, and it is not possible to mandate press involvement in a self-regulatory process; otherwise, you would be having statutory regulation. Now, the Committee may agree or disagree with me—it is for Members to determine this themselves—but I think both the Prime Minister and I, earlier this year, made it very clear indeed that the Conservative party would never be in the position where we would want to see statutory regulation of the press. So if you are indicating that you would want to see a process where you would have to mandate the press to be involved in this charter approach, then you would in essence be advocating mandatory statutory regulation of the press, and that is not something I could agree with you on.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ14default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default So what is Government policy? Is Government policy that a press regulator should seek recognition, or not?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default The policy is that we have a charter, which establishes a system of very powerful incentives for the press’s self-regulatory body to seek recognition. We believe that there will be very powerful reasons why the press might wish to do that, but very simply, Mr Farrelly, it is really for them to make that determination; otherwise, you are talking about statutory regulation, and that is not Government policy, and it is not something I would advocate.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ15default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default So you are pleased, you say, with what the industry is doing. The industry is setting up a regulator that will be run by the same people as the PCC, with the same processes, pretty much, overseen by PressBoF mark 2: a regulator that does not satisfy the test—independence from the industry—and a regulator that has a lack of arbitration. You are pleased at what the industry is doing. I fail to see how that matches with previous statements that the status quo is not an option.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think it is clear, if the industry’s self-regulatory body wishes to seek recognition, that they will have to adhere to the rules set out, the framework set out, within the charter. That is pretty clear. If people choose not to seek recognition that is their choice, but ultimately they will not be able to benefit from the costs advantages that they would get if they were within the system. I cannot make it any clearer than that. It is ultimately for the press to 
defaultdecide how they wish to operate in this sphere. What I say I am pleased about is that there is a very clear willingness and understanding of the need to move forward on this; and yes, I am very content with the fact that IPSO is moving forward in a way which has got a great deal of support from the industry.
default              
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I have got one final question, Chair, before I hand over to colleagues. Another group of people—some of them press journalists, former journalists, backed by Sir Harold Evans—have come forward with the intention of setting up their own rather more Leveson and charter-compliant regulator, which they are calling Impress. You have met the people who are involved in 
defaultIPSO
default. Will you meet the people who are proposing this new regulator, Impress, to talk about their proposals?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Okay. So Lord Justice Leveson made clear in his report that it was very possible—and, indeed, maybe he even used the word “probable”—that there would be more than one regulator that would come forward. But, look, this is for the industry. It is not for the Government to decide whether or not there should be regulators. You may have missed the point if you feel—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault16default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default If they asked to come and see you, would you meet them?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am always delighted to meet a huge array of different organisations. I am sure if they asked to meet me, I would see if I am able to do that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault17default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Is that a yes?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am sure I would be delighted to meet anybody who is interested in press regulation, but that would in no way imply that they would need to seek my approval to be able to do that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault18default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default But you have met 
defaultIPSO
default, who are boasting about the fact that they are not Leveson-compliant, have no intention of seeking recognition from the new recognition body and would not want to, because they do not think that what they are setting up is complaint with the royal charter. You now have an alternative organisation run by freedom of speech campaigners, led by the very highly regarded former editor of 
defaultThe Observer, 
defaultwho intend to set up a regulator which will be compliant with the royal charter and will seek recognition, and you are saying you will not meet them.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, Mr Bradshaw. What I was trying to say was that they did not need to seek my approval to be able to move forward.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault19default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default No, he was asking if you would meet them.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think I said I was happy to meet a whole range of organisations. If they ask—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault20default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Just answer the direct question. Will you meet them?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Okay. Yes, Mr Bradshaw.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault21default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default I would like a little more clarity on this. Could you please confirm, Secretary of State, that it is Government policy, as enshrined in the royal charter, that any press regulator should, first, be able to receive recognition from the independent recognition panel and, secondly, seek such recognition?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, I think that is what is set out.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault22default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Okay. As I was just saying, 
defaultIPSO
default have already made clear that it does not intend to meet the requirements which would deliver recognition under the charter and it has also stated that it will not seek recognition under the charter by the recognition panel. Why did your Department put out a statement welcoming 
defaultIPSO
default?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Because I think it shows an intention from the industry that they understand the importance of having a system in place for when mistakes are made. There is no indication at all, from either Lord Justice Leveson, or from the Government, that all organisations need to seek recognition. I think you may have misunderstood the premise of Lord Leveson’s recommendations if you feel that all organisations need to do that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault23default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default I am sorry, you have just answered my question in the affirmative. When I asked you whether it is Government policy that any press regulator should be able to receive recognition and should seek recognition, you said yes. 
defaultIPSO
default had made it quite clear that their approach to both of those is no, and you are still putting out a statement welcoming them. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default But they are still able to seek recognition if they wish to do so.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault24default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default So your hope is that they will seek recognition?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Perhaps if I could finish the point. They are, of course, able to put themselves forward for recognition if they choose to do so. I think you are also, Mr Bradshaw, running the risk of prejudging what 
defaultIPSO
default are doing. I am certainly not trying to do that. What I am doing, and I hope you will join me in doing, is welcoming some very positive moves from the press in, first, understanding that there is a need for a system of redress when mistakes are made and, secondly, that that should be led by the press. To quote Lord Justice Leveson, “any successful system is only going to be a success if it takes the press and the public with it”. I am sure you would not want to advocate a system which tries to do anything other than that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault25default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default But would you welcome 
defaultIPSO
default seeking recognition?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Of course I would. I think, perhaps, you may not want to prejudge what they are or are not going to do.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault26default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Okay. That is very helpful. My colleague has just referred to this alternative regulator. From your previous statements, both before the Committee and elsewhere, you seem to believe there is only one game in town. As you have acknowledged today, there could be more than one game in town. There is now another game in town that has made it absolutely clear that it supports the Leveson principles, would like to set up a regulator which would be compliant with the royal charter and would be seeking recognition. Your Department put out a statement welcoming the formation of 
defaultIPSO
default. Why has DCMS not put out any press statement welcoming the formation of Impress?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Again, for clarity for the Committee, Lord Justice Leveson made it very clear indeed that there was no requirement for there to be simply one regulator, so I think we should be very clear on that. The charter makes no such determination either. To suggest that the Government would only be expecting that or in some way would predetermine that would, first, forget the fact that the Government does not have a role to play in the establishment of either self-regulatory bodies or the recognition of those bodies or, secondly, that that was something that we had a predetermined policy on, because we do not.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault27default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default No, but your Department put out a statement welcoming the formation of 
defaultIPSO
default, so will you welcome the formation of Impress?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I have to say, Mr Bradshaw, I may have missed something here, but I have not yet received any information about the establishment of that organisation. I have read in broad principles—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault28default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Partly because the press have not reported it, understandably. But surely, your officials have made you aware of this. This is a very exciting movement; it is what a lot of people have been waiting for: the setting up of an organisation of self-regulation that will be Leveson-compliant, that will seek regulation and hopefully get it, and that will then kick in with all the wonderful incentives you talked about earlier.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default And as we have already agreed, it would useful to have a meeting with them. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault29default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Okay, but do you welcome the fact that such a body is being set up? You welcomed 
defaultIPSO
default, so will you welcome Impress? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It would be inappropriate for me to say anything further until I know a little more about how their approach is going to work. In principle, of course, it is always good to see the press engaging in this issue, but I think what I really need to underline again, Mr Bradshaw, is that this is not something the Government feel is Government business. 
default              
defaultMr Bradshaw:default No—
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Sorry, can I finish my point? It is really important that press self-regulation and the recognition body are things which are outwith Government. Maybe this is something we disagree on. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault30default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default No, we don’t disagree at all. Earlier, you said it would be your preference for the regulatory body to seek recognition. That is exactly what this new organisation says it will do, so the implication would be that you should welcome it and that you would prefer its model to the old PressBoF model, which is the one already on the table. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default And as I have made clear, it would be great to have more details about that. 
default              
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Excellent. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault31default 
defaultChair:default On that, is it still the Government’s wish that newspapers that subscribe to a regulatory body that is not recognised should be subject to the sanctions recommended by Lord Justice Leveson?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Just so I am clear, are you saying they would not be subject to that because they were not—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault32default 
defaultChair:default No, but is it the Government’s wish that, if a newspaper joins a regulator that is not recognised, it should be subject to all the penalties Lord Justice Leveson recommended? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Well, by definition, they would not receive the costs protections. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault33default 
defaultChair:default That is only if there is an alternative in place, which is potentially Impress.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, that’s right. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault34default 
defaultChair:default So if Impress goes ahead, and 
defaultIPSO
default remains outside, the Government think it right, therefore, that the whole penalty system will come into play.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default That is what is clearly set out in the charter. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault35default 
defaultConor Burns:default Can I take us right back to try to get clarity over two things that I have previously sought to get clarity on? First, on the ancient history of the meeting in Ed Miliband’s office, who invited Hacked Off to the meeting? Do you know? Brian Cathcart, who has incredible recall on everything, cannot recall and seems to have been unable to answer several e-mails subsequently, despite a pledge to this Committee that he would.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I wasn’t present at the meeting. My recollection of events is that the Prime Minister and I had agreed that there was a clear way forward, that that had been given to the Labour party and that they had then, over that weekend, gone into some sort of negotiation—we thought perhaps it was with themselves, but it now transpires it was with Hacked Off—to come out with an agreed position. I think it therefore must have been the Labour party who invited Hacked Off to their meeting, but that is only my supposition, because, obviously, it was their meeting. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault36default 
defaultConor Burns:default You would concede, I imagine—you indicated as much on the Floor of the House—that the fact that Hacked Off was present at the meeting, which was the birthing of the royal charter concept, while the press were not, added to the suspicion and absence of good will on the press’s part regarding that process. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I certainly think that it proved to be deeply unhelpful. I have to say that we had been working closely with Harriet Harman prior to that point. I thought we had, through very exhaustive and extensive meetings over a number of months, got to a position where—referring back to my previous comments—an effective system was going to take the press and the public with us. I thought we had reached that stage before that weekend. I think it was a great shame that that was not more sensitively handled, and it became quite a destructive force in the perceptions of the press. It took a great deal of work to get things back on track, and I hope, through some of the amendments I put in place to the charter, that some of that good will was re-established with the press. But, unfortunately, there was some lasting damage. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault37default 
defaultConor Burns:default When you look at the terms of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, the press have travelled an amazing distance down the road from where we thought they might be at the beginning of this process, 18 months ago. With somebody of the esteem of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Chancellor of Bournemouth University, heading that up, they were almost there in terms of agreeing a deal. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think you are right, Mr Burns. Let’s remember that when the Conservative party put forward the idea of a charter, this was not something that was accepted by either the Labour party or, indeed, others in Parliament. It was certainly not something that was accepted by the press. Through a great deal of hard work, by Mr Oliver Letwin and myself, we managed to get to a stage where I believe we were on the verge of an agreement. I feel that some of the interventions around the weekend that you mention created a great deal of bad will and some changes that were very difficult. I think we have recaptured some of that position, but still there is some lasting damage there. I am an optimist on this; I really feel that we have a good position with the charter. It is something that is beneficial to all parties concerned—I do not mean political parties
default;
default I mean parties, the industry and the consumer—and gives a system of redress when mistakes are made. I hope that it works well, as we move forward and we move into a practical mode of implementation. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault38default 
defaultConor Burns:default Given the progress that 
defaultIPSO
default was making, even at the point of that meeting, which was the birthing meeting to the coming into being of the charter, what was the desperate rush to the charter at that point? Why do you judge that Hacked Off, the Labour party 
defaultand some other people who sit on our side were in such a rush to have the charter, rather than give more time to push the press to go that little bit further? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I cannot really answer that for others. I can say from my own perspective that what we could see happening very clearly was the hijacking of Government business through amendments to impose statutory regulation of the press. That was not something that either the Prime Minister or I were willing to accept. It was very important for us to have in place something that would absolutely not see that happening. I think that that was a very difficult situation. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault39default 
defaultConor Burns:default In a sense, the logic of that is that the charter was born out of parliamentary arithmetic and the absence of a Conservative majority. We would not have had a charter had there been a Conservative majority.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default You are hypothesising now. I can deal only with the situation as it is. The situation as it was was that we were facing, I feel, the very real probability of statutory regulation of the press. It was not something that I felt was at all the right answer—absolutely philosophically the wrong thing to do. I think that if we had not proceeded with the charter as an approach at that stage, there would have been a great deal of certainty in a coalition of different forces on the Floor of the House where that would have come into play. I think that would have been wholly wrong. I think that with the charter as it is now, amended since the fateful weekend—we tried to get back some of the very important provisions that are in there now—we are in a good place. I will just remind you that we are still not a majority Government, so we are still dealing with the reality of coalition Government.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault40default 
defaultConor Burns:default So the charter was born out of the fact that had we—the Government—not conceded the charter, the arithmetic in Parliament was such that we could have had statutory regulation imposed. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Correct. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault41default 
defaultConor Burns:default So we would not have brought in a charter voluntarily if there were a Conservative majority. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think it is difficult for me to hypothesise on that. There are too many variables, Mr Burns, but I think you are right to say that the arithmetic was clear. Even more importantly, our parliamentary agenda is important
default,
default and we have to make sure that our legislative agenda goes forward as well. I think that is very important. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault42default 
defaultConor Burns:default I have one final question, which, again, I put to you on the 
defaultf
defaultloor. You said correctly that regulation of the press is not Government business. The charter is not Government business, but we have made it Parliament’s business. The Prime Minister has repeatedly heralded the fact that the charter could be amended in the future only by a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament. What advice, guidance or clarification did the Prime 
defaultMinister, your Department or others engaged in drafting that seek from the parliamentary Clerks as to its constitutional position? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default If I could just take a step back, the reason why that provision is important and why I think it is perhaps sometimes not quite understood is that, of course, if it wasn’t in there
default,
default the charter could have been amended by Privy Councillors without any discussion whatsoever. So that amendment actually is an important way that we put a lock on to the charter, so that it cannot be tampered with. I am sure that would not be the case with present Privy Councillors who are in Government, but we want to put in place a lock to ensure that that could not happen in the future. To my recollection, Mr Burns, and I can always write to you with a little bit more detail, that was very much in discussion with those people who would be able to advise us on the constitutional correctness of that. But perhaps I could drop you a note with a bit more detail. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault43default 
defaultConor Burns:default It would be very kind if you would, because the advice that I have had when I have gone to talk to very senior Clerks is that the two-thirds is a parliamentary nonsense—that no Parliament can bind a successor Parliament and that if a successor Parliament decided that they wanted to amend or change the charter, or bring in a different charter, they could do that by a simple majority. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Mr Burns, if I draw you back to my initial comment, it was that the essence, or the principle, behind that provision was to very much ensure that the charter could not be changed simply at the whim of Ministers who were Privy Councillors at the time. So, you are right, of course, that a majority Government can pass any law that they like
default—
defaultindeed, of course, that would be the case
default—b
defaultut the principle there is to make sure that there is some protection for the charter, because it needs to be 
defaultthere, 
defaultand I think it is absolutely vitally important that when it comes to press freedom and ensuring the freedom of our press in this country is a critical part of our democracy, that we need to ensure that anything to do with the self-regulation or the oversight of the press is very much outwith the control of this Government. And I think that that is something that perhaps others don’t feel as strongly about, and hence they weren’t willing to press things so heavily in the House of Commons earlier this year, and it is only earlier this year that we are talking about. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault44default 
defaultConor Burns:default I understand and accept that, but the way that that has been constantly presented—that it would require a two-thirds majority in both Houses of Parliament to change it at all—has given the impression that this is a sort of eternal lock, as it were. So, in reality, it is only a guarantee to this charter for the next 16 or 17 months
default,
default until we are into a new Parliament. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, but Mr Burns you have answered your own question, I think, by saying that of course a Government can pass laws and can—with a simple majority in the House of Commons—change really anything they want to change.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault45default 
defaultConor Burns:default Absolutely. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default But what we are doing in putting that provision in place is giving Parliament a very clear ability to press any Government on why they might not adhere to that, and I think that is a really rather important thing to have done. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault46default 
defaultConor Burns:default Again, I totally accept that. I was just trying to get the answer to the question, which is: it is really only a guarantee for this Parliament and it is not—as the mood music has been—this eternal lock, that the concept that we can tell a future Parliament that it could only be changed by a two-thirds parliamentary majority is a nonsense. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default But I am sure there will always be the ability to look at that provision and argue very strongly that the will of the House in passing that provision, or being aware of that provision, was very much to ensure that any change was only done in extreme circumstances. And I think that the House is a pretty articulate body that would be able to make that case very well indeed. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault47default 
defaultMr Leech:default We have had a lot of questions on this area, so I have just one very quick question. You said that you hoped that 
defaultIPSO
default will still seek recognition, but is it not the case that
default,
default now that it has finalised its articles of association, it cannot go for recognition and it cannot fulfil the Leveson requirements? You are saying that you hope they will do so, but are we not talking about something that cannot possibly now happen? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am not sure that 
defaultIPSO
default are up and running yet. I believe that they have issued more details about how they will run. Look, Mr Leech, I cannot be clearer in saying that these are not matters for the Government; these are matters for the press. It is their decision, and that is why it is called self-regulation. If we wanted statutory regulation—I am not sure whether you feel that that is the route we should have taken, but it is not the route we have gone down. If it is not statutory regulation, the Government cannot determine that. That is ultimately for the press body to decide. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault48default 
defaultPaul Farrelly:default So why welcome it? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Because I welcome progress, Mr Farrelly. 
default              
defaultPaul Farrelly:default If you are not just giving them a green light to ignore the charter and everything that has gone on. 
default              
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Just stay out of it completely. 
default              
defaultChair:default Order. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I do not know whose question I am answering now. 
default              
defaultPaul Farrelly:default I think they are both about the same. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I welcome the fact that there is progress, and I think that that is important. 
default[
defaultInterruption.
default]
default 
default              
defaultChair:default At that point
default,
default we will suspend for 15 minutes. 
default              
defaultPaul Farrelly:default Chair, can I just put on record our implication of concern, because I have to leave the Committee to attend a meeting on 
defaultStafford
default hospital?
default              
defaultChair:default It is on the record. 
default              
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House. 
default 
default              
defaultOn resuming—
default              
defaultChair:default Ben, had you finished?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault49default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Not quite. I had one other question on Leveson. What progress has your Department made in implementing Sir Brian’s recommendations on media plurality?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Mr Bradshaw is absolutely right to say that media plurality was another aspect of Lord Justice Leveson’s report. A consultation on plurality closed on 22 October
default,
default and we are due to publish the consultation report early next year. I think that that will give us a foundation from which we can move forward on that really important issue. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQdefault50default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Another of his recommendations was on freedom of speech. Has any progress been made on legislating to protect that?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am not familiar with—
default              
defaultMr Bradshaw:default His recommendation 33 was that a law be introduced to protect freedom of the press. When the Prime Minister welcomed the recommendations, he welcomed this one in particular, but I am not aware that the Government has made any progress in implementing it.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default 
defaultWell, w
defaulte feel very strongly that freedom of the press is critical. It is implici
defaultt
default and
default,
default indeed
default,
default explicit in the approach that we have taken by not having statutory regulation of the press. At this point, we have no particular plans to legislate for freedom of the press, because it is implicit in our approach.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ51default 
defaultChair:default On Mr Bradshaw’s first question about media plurality, your communications and creative industries Minister said to the Lords Communications Committee that it is unlikely that there would be any legislative measures taken on media plurality in this Parliament. I take it you would agree with him on that.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default What we are focusing on, Chair, is the importance of understanding how we deal with media plurality in what is a very different and ever-changing environment. Our consultation has been seeking views on the scope of a measurement framework, and then, when we have got through that particular part of our deliberations, we intend to commission the development of a clear measurement framework and work that up in partnership with the industry.
default              
defaultThis is a highly complex area which is, frankly, only getting more complicated, but at the heart of our approach is ensuring that British people have the ability to access a wide range of news and views, and information about the world in which they live. We believe that that plurality of information is at the heart of having a healthy and vibrant democracy.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ52default 
defaultChair:default From what you say, it sounds as if it is unlikely that it will be in the next Parliament either.  It is going to take a long time.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Again, I think it is important that we get it right. I think the Committee would be urging us to get it right and it is certainly a complicated area.
default              
defaultChair:default Let us move on to something completely different.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ53default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I would like to ask a few questions about sport. Undoubtedly, the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games were a great success, but there have been reservations and questions raised about the legacy of the games. The Lords Committee recently reported that aspects of the legacy were in danger of faltering and that some had fallen by the wayside completely. How would you respond to that?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I would say that we have a very strong legacy indeed and that we should be very proud, as a country, of what we have achieved as a result of the London 2012 games. We have certainly seen a significant increase in participation in sport. I believe we are the first country to have achieved that and it is important. I particularly draw the Committee’s attention to the most recent figures showing a significant increase in participation among disabled people in sport, which I think is a real testament to the particular impact of last summer’s Paralympic games.
default              
defaultWe have also seen, I think, a considerable legacy not just in the regeneration of the site of the Olympics and that part of 
defaultLondon
default, but also in terms of the way 
defaultBritain
default is viewed in the world. I have recently, as I said in my earlier remarks, been part of the delegation to 
defaultChina
default, but I also spent Monday and Tuesday of this week in 
defaultRussia
default. Whichever country you visit, the cut-through that the Olympics had is really incredible.  Our reputation as a country was considerably enhanced through how the games were staged. Not only the opening ceremony, but the handling of the entire games
default 
defaultwas, I think, seen as being a gold standard for others to reach in the future. I think that that legacy is strong and we should not underestimate it.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ54default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I want to drill down into some of those things because, as I say, the Olympic games themselves were spectacular and the hosting of the event was good for the UK in some respects. However, you mentioned the increase in participation in sport. Unfortunately, the only figures we really get to see compare participation rates today with 2005. Can you disaggregate those and make a comparison with what it was looking like in 2012? I suspect that there wasn’t such a giant leap in participation—just perhaps nudging those who were already inclined to participate in sport actually to get out there and do so.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default And I know, Ms Crouch, that you have huge expertise in the area of sport and are personally involved yourself. You will know that the sorts of changes that we want to see 
defaultin British society, in terms of participation in sport and becoming an even more active nation, are not going to happen over a 12-month or 24-month period, but will be part of a long-term legacy from these games.
default              
defaultI think it is absolutely right that we look at the long-term impact of becoming the host nation, as well as the impact of the games itself. Going back to 2005 is the right thing to do because I think that was when the country became gripped with the anticipation of what this might mean. The games themselves certainly created additional momentum, and I was in a gym club quite recently in my own constituency hearing how its participation rates had significantly jumped since the Olympics. They felt very strongly that this was directly as a result of the excitement and the anticipation around the games, but I think it is right that we look at those figures over a longer period of time. Indeed, I think Lord Coe would even say that we won’t see the full legacy of the Olympic games—whether it is in participation or in other respects—for a 10-year period. So I think that looking at the period between 2005 to date is important, but actually the long-term impact of legacy, particularly around participation, we probably won’t see until we get to 2022.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ55default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default It is interesting that you say that, because we often talk about how the televising of major events encourages people immediately to rush out to the tennis courts after Wimbledon, or on to the football pitches after the World cup. Why are you saying that about the legacy of the Olympics, which was obviously on our televisions for a significant period of time, which was across both genders and which involved multiple sports, events and activities? Why are we therefore not seeing that immediate jump into participation into some of those sports and events?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default What we need to recognise is that we are trying to generate not a short-term fix, but a long-term habit for life. We can focus, as you have done, on the participation figures, but I will also focus on the very strong plans that we have for supporting increased participation at school level, with the additional funding that we have recently announced. I think the short answer to your question is that we don’t want a short-term fix; we want a long-term habit for life. It is important that we do not just look at 12-month figures—or indeed 24-month figures—but look over a longer period of time.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ56default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I can accept that in some part, but only last week the Department published figures showing that 15.5 million people were playing sport once a week and championed it as an increase of more than 1.5 million since 2005. The participation rates for playing sport once a week are still incredibly important, so we should be seeing an immediate reaction and response to things like the Olympics and Paralympics. We should have seen a spike in the figures over the past 12 months, but I suspect we have not.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default As I say, the goal of the legacy is to see not simply short-term spikes, but that increase over a longer period of time. I think that that is when legacy starts to prove itself. Simply seeing short-term gain will not necessarily lead to the sort of habit changes that we need.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ57default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Do you think the legacy is London-centric?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Certainly not in terms of participation. One of the direct programmes that we have as part of our legacy programme is particularly around increasing women’s participation in sport. We have a pilot in Bury at the moment to look at how we can maximise that participation, but in a non-London way. My Department is certainly very focused on the importance of driving participation throughout the country. Indeed, the Sport England participation strategies are 
defaultEngland
default and Wales-wide. Our programme reflects the importance of increasing participation in whatever part of the country.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ58default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default You briefly mentioned that I am involved in sport—indeed I am, at the grass-roots level—but we have not seen any significant increase in participation at grass roots. In part, the cost of clubs remains an expense that some families cannot afford. What are the Government doing to try to support that grass-roots participation?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default As I have indicated before, an important part for me of getting kids hooked on sport is through schools. We have put £150 million a year into schools and we have extended it by a further year, so I think some £400 million in total is going into that project. We will help to ensure that from primary school age we have the expertise going into exciting youngsters about sport at a time when we need to get them hooked, excited and active in their lives, but it is then about keeping that going through secondary school, particularly among young women. That is why I welcome the changes in the curriculum recognising the importance of having choice, especially for young women, and taking part in different sorts of sports to get them and keep them active. That and the Sport England £1 billion plan for grass-roots activity in our communities all add together to provide an extensive programme to make sure that we are a nation of active people.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ59default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default I am keen to ask some detailed questions on school sports, but keeping on the Olympics at the moment, there is a Cabinet committee that is tasked with co-ordinating the Olympic legacy. How often does it meet?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It meets on a regular basis, but obviously that is only one part of the activity of the group of people it brings together.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ60default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Can you define “regular” for those of us who have never been a member of a Cabinet committee?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It is on a regular basis. The Government do not tend to talk about the frequency of meetings—indeed, I think that many members of the committee would agree that meetings should be only a culmination of a report back on activity. What is more important is that Ministers are actively involved in legacy as part of their day-to-day work. I very much welcome the commitment from my colleagues throughout a wide range of Departments to delivering on the Olympic legacy, whether that is through our schools Department—I have already outlined some of the work we are doing at school level—or, indeed, through the work of our communities Department. We have wide participation and of course, very importantly, participation from Lord Coe, who continues to work as the Prime Minister’s adviser on Olympic legacy.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ61default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default You might not be able to comment on the frequency of the meetings, but can you tell me when the committee last met?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Very recently indeed. I think that it was probably last month, from memory.
default              
defaultTracey Crouch:default November.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ62default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Why is it shrouded in so much secrecy? It is an incredibly important committee. It brings benefits from a health perspective, from an education perspective and obviously from a sports perspective, so why is it so secretive in what it is discussing?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I don’t think you should misinterpret my comments about the committee—it is just a protocol in terms of the way we deal with talking about the frequency of meetings. There is no mystery at all. Indeed, I should also mention that the Mayor and the Mayor’s office are very active participants in our Olympic legacy committee. We meet very regularly and have a clear plan of action set out by our five key themes of legacy. That is very open and available. In fact, the Sports Minister produces a regular report to Parliament on the progress that we are making, particularly on the sports legacy of the Olympics, so we are actually very transparent and open about the workings of the committee. I would like to thank all my colleagues, particularly the Mayor, for the incredible work that we are doing. We should be very proud indeed that the IOC now sees the legacy approach that London 2012 has put in place as a gold standard and the way forward for countries in future.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ63default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default You have talked about how important school sport is to the legacy. Do you therefore think that it is somewhat curious that school sport sits within the Department for Education and is not part of your own remit?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, not at all. If we want to have success in ingraining strong and effective sports into our schools, it has to be part of the schools Department. That is part of its responsibility.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ64default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default The Department for Education has been very keen on traditional sports, which has not necessarily benefited all pupils in schools. School sports partnerships enabled a more diverse offering in schools. Were you disappointed that the original scrapping of school sports partnerships had rather an important impact on some children in schools?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Let us be really clear about the approach to school sports. You used the word “traditional,” which I don’t think reflects the situation as it is. We have had a reform of the curriculum for school sports, importantly recognising that there is need for a broader scope of sports in schools, particularly to keep young women involved in sports who may not be that interested in competitive sports. We are putting more emphasis in the curriculum on non-competitive sports. I very much welcome that.
default              
defaultYou talked about school sports partnerships. I think that there was not the success that we needed to see given the investment levels for those partnerships. What I am pleased to see not is not only the investment that has been put in, particularly at primary school level through the primary school sports premium, but the clear recognition that the best schools are doing sports well. That is what we should be seeing in schools across the board. Indeed, Ofsted now has a very clear role, particularly at primary school level, in seeing how that premium is used. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ65default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default School sports partnerships were not perfect, but they did offer variety and there were fantastic examples, particularly within women’s sport, about how girls were being offered things like Arabian dance lessons which got them involved in physical activity. The Secretary of State mocked and condemned that at the time as a misuse of school sports partnership funding and said that that should be focused more on things like rugby, football, netball and hockey. Do you not agree that what is really important is to ensure that we do have that diversity and variety in schools and, if that is not available in schools, the specialist clubs should be accessible to those who wish to participate?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Actions speak very loudly in this respect. The reform of the curriculum would demonstrate very clearly that the Education Department understand the importance of a diverse range of sports and the importance of activities like dance, particularly for young women. Their actions would demonstrate that they do put great store by importance of diversity for the very reasons that you outline.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ66default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default Do you think that the Department for Education really take school sports as seriously as you do when more than 50 school playing fields have been sold since 2010?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I know that your knowledge of football in particular is extremely strong and that you would understand—probably with first-hand experience—the importance of delving deeper into some of those figures. Clearly, you know that the use of artificial surfaces can increase the utilisation of space, so there may be a whole host of reasons why the number of sports fields has declined. 
default              
defaultBut certainly there is a very clear policy in place to ensure that those sorts of changes have to be very visible to the Department. I think you would need to look at some of the details about why those changes were made, particularly if some of those sports fields were being replaced with artificial pitches where the utilisation rates can be significantly higher than on non-artificial pitches—from memory, I think they can be up to 80% higher. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ67default 
defaultTracey Crouch:default That is true for the 4G pitches and the 3G pitches, but the school fields have more importance than just playing sports on them. There is importance in creating space around the school and creating that physical activity. And sometimes a divide between the boys and the girls playing sports is something that in a co-ed school is very important if you want to encourage girls to participate in activity. 
default              
defaultIt is disappointing that we are seeing a continued sale of school sport fields. That indicates that the Department for Education might not be the best Department to understand 
defaultthe value of sport at that particular age group. Do you think that it would be better placed in a Department that fully understands the value of sport, such as yours?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, I have to disagree, because we have to ensure that our Education Department is unfettered in its work. I think the Education Secretary is absolutely right to say that it is the head teachers who are the people best placed to know what is right for that school. 
default              
defaultI think I would find trying to micro-manage the work of schools in this country very difficult indeed, particularly from my Department. I do not think that that would be effective at all. You are right to say that we believe that successful schools have strong policies when it comes to sports and activities for young people of all ages. We have to be clear that that is the sign of a successful school: one that has strong sports offerings for youngsters who have many different sorts of interests and ways of expressing themselves when it comes to their sporting life. For me, that is something best determined at a local level, and I would be very reticent indeed, in looking at the figures you are talking about, about giving you a forthright point of view on particular situations, because each individual case will have a story attached to it. I know the Education Department looks very closely indeed at the sales of the sites you are talking about, and I do not think you can immediately jump to the conclusion that this is necessarily something that will not benefit the youngsters at the school.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ68default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default If headmasters and headmistresses are best placed to decide locally what is in the best interests of their school in regard to the sale of playing fields, why do you have highly paid advisers in the Department? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think you are now straying into the role of the Department for Education. This is something which is very firmly in my colleague Michael Gove’s territory. Obviously, that is a question for him. What I would say very firmly, though, is that when you look at well-performing schools—the excellent schools that we have in this country—the role of sport in the life of those schools will be extremely important. That is something which goes across the board. If you want to know about the role of advisers in the Department for Education, you probably need to direct that question at the Secretary of State for Education. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ69default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default Have you not previously served in that Department? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ70default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default You have not been in the DFE? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ71default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default But you understand, for instance, that the advisers on school playing fields have, on six occasions, been overruled by the Government in regard to the sale of playing fields? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default What I can say is that, as the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, I absolutely understand the importance of sport in young persons’ lives and that schools need to have facilities to be able to help youngsters to participate in sport in a great variety of ways. Clearly, the space to be able to do that is important as well. I know from my own experience of visiting schools in many different parts of the country that those facilities can look very different indeed. Indeed, I can remember having been a governor of a school in central 
defaultLondon
default where the sporting facilities were extremely limited, but, my goodness, they were made very good use of indeed. It is difficult for me to respond directly to a question about officials in a different Department, but that would be my general view. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ72default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default There appears to be a disconnect between the two Departments. While your Department is trying to encourage increased participation in sport, the sale of the playing fields children could play on is not within your remit. Don’t the Departments speak to each other? 
default              
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Of course the Departments speak to each other. The work we do through organisations like Sport England, where we have a £1 billion youth sport strategy that is very much about developing community-level sports, means that many schools, increasingly through the sports premium that is available under this Government, are able to work with local sports clubs or, indeed, expert advisers and trainers on training up sports teachers in schools. Of course we work together, particularly around the Olympic legacy, but if you come to particular issues, like the role of officials, it is quite difficult for me to comment directly.

defaultQ73default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default I will come to the Olympic legacy. But, first, the role of Secretary of State is obviously wide and varied. We know from your previous career that you have an interest in PR and, ergo, media. We also know you have some interest in culture. What is your interest in sport? How often have you been to sporting events outside the Olympic games? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I was actually in advertising, not PR.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ74default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default Do you get paid less for that? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default People who come into Parliament with business experience actually have a great deal to offer. I would agree with you that I am very interested in media and extremely interested in culture, and I have a good interest in sport as well. My last sporting occasion would actually have been watching my local rugby team play Tring recently. It was not a great success for 
defaultBasingstoke
default, but we have a fantastic ground there. It is a great example of how local clubs are seeing a huge groundswell of demand as a result of some of the international sporting events that we are staging in this country. In 
defaultBasingstoke
default, we have an enormously active youth programme that the rugby club run. I pay tribute to the volunteers who make that happen. The reality up and down the country is that we have vibrant sports clubs providing that youth activity for youngsters outside of school, giving them more choice than ever.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ75default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default What other sport are you interested in?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I like cycling.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ76default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default So, cycling and rugby, anything else?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Gosh. I do watch the television occasionally when the football is on. Does that count? I like watching tennis.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ77default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default No, it seems that you have an interest in media, and we understand your cultural interests, but is sport the Cinderella of the three hats that you wear?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, I completely disagree. I do not know why you would think that. Perhaps because I am female and you think that I must—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ78default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default No, we have got a sports Minister who does not know an awful lot about sport, in all honesty.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think, Mr Rotherham, that I would completely disagree with you there. I think that in our sports Minister we have someone who is a truly accomplished sportswoman in her own right. I urge you to read her CV before you make those accusations.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ79default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default I was not questioning her ability on the sports field; it was about her understanding of sports in general.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think that Ms Grant is an extremely strong and able sports Minister.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ80default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default Perhaps we can agree to disagree on that.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default In answer to your question, the glory of being Secretary of State is that you can be interested in all sorts of sport. In fact, one of the great things is that you are able to dip into a whole range of sports. It would not necessarily be advantageous to be an enormous fan of one particular sport. Perhaps that is what you are expecting. I also quite like watching rugby. Having been brought up in south 
defaultWales
default, that does sometimes leave me supporting the Welsh on the odd occasion.
default              
defaultChair:default Just to interrupt for a second, we have to cover a lot of ground and we are making slow progress. Can we be slightly briefer?
default              
defaultSteve Rotheram:default I think my other question has been covered under Olympic legacy.
default              
defaultChair:default Very good. In which case, Conor Burns.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ81default 
defaultConor Burns:default Can I take you on to tourism? I declare an interest, as I represent a town that prides itself on being 
defaultBritain
default’s premier destination resort. Some people within the 
defaultBournemouth Accommodation and Hotel Associatio
defaultn
default 
defaultwere slightly surprised in the immediate aftermath of the recent reshuffle that, when departmental responsibilities were published by your Department, we seemed to go a little while without someone having specific responsibility for tourism. Should we read anything into that?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, you should not at all. For me, tourism is one of the important ways that the Department demonstrates its ability to be central to the Government’s growth agenda. Tourism is growing in importance and there is a significant link between tourism, culture, art and, indeed, sport, which Mr Rotherham will be rather relieved to hear. I would not read anything into that at all.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ82default 
defaultConor Burns:default The Government have massively cut the budgets of VisitEngland and VisitBritain within the overall austerity agenda. Tourism 
defaultIreland
default now spends more on marketing in the 
defaultUK
default than we do on marketing internationally. How are you, the Government and your Department helping the tourism sector to get more for less?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I would agree—budgets are under some pressure. I think that you would find that across the board, with almost every single Minister saying the same thing. The recognition of the importance of tourism is clear. In the recent autumn statement from the Chancellor, there was an increase in funding of £30 million for the GREAT campaign, which I am sure you are aware is the main marketing campaign for 
defaultBritain
default. That is important, because it gives us a consistent way to present our country abroad in the whole variety of markets that we are targeting to grow our tourism numbers. We have reason to be investing behind that campaign because we want to see a significant increase in the number of people visiting our shores. So far we have seen more than 1.5 million extra overseas visitors since 2011, which is ahead of the target we set for ourselves. We are seeing not only more people, but more people who spend more, which is significant—it is almost £1 billion of extra visitor spend. While you cannot directly tie it back only to the impact of the GREAT campaign, I think it has given us the opportunity to market ourselves more consistently.
default              
defaultI shall give you a simple example. When I was recently in 
defaultShanghai
default, I was able to take the opportunity to focus on the GREAT campaign and use it as a way of explaining our enhanced visa offer in 
defaultChina
default which, as you may be aware, has been something of a concern in the past.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ83default 
defaultConor Burns:default One of the complementary things to attracting more foreign visitors to the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default is to increase the number of domestic citizens who choose to take either their main holiday or an extended short break in the 
defaultUK
default. One proposal in the strategy paper was to move the May day bank holiday to October, which would extend the tourism season. In April 2012, the Government stated that the decision about the outcome of the pre-consultation on that move would be made in due course. Can you update us on any progress on that?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am not aware of the status of that consultation. I can get back to you on the detail.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ84default 
defaultConor Burns:default The pre-consultation was launched by the Government on 12 May 2011. On 26 April 2012—at column 974W of 
defaultHansard—
defaultthe Government stated: “A decision 
defaultabout the outcome of the pre-consultation will be made in due course.”  Perhaps you would have a look.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Absolutely. However, while I can understand the importance of looking at the phasing of bank holidays and how that can affect destinations such as the one that you represent, I think it is even more important to focus on the importance of a staycation. That is why we have been at pains to protect and continue to invest in the “holidays at home” GREAT campaigns, as well as those that are international in their outlook. We invested £8 million in VisitEngland’s domestic campaigns between 2012 and 2014, which will directly benefit constituencies such as the one that you represent, and throughout the country. We have a fantastic offer in terms of domestic tourism, which is enhanced enormously through our fantastic cultural and heritage offerings.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ85default 
defaultConor Burns:default Another great way to extend the season in Bournemouth without moving the bank holiday would be—I say this on a cross-party basis—for the party conferences to come back to 
defaultBournemouth
default. All colleagues would be warmly welcome at any time.
default              
defaultI have a question about making domestic tourism more attractive. We have higher rates of VAT on bed-and-breakfast and hotel accommodation in this country than many comparator and competitor overseas destinations. Have you been in any talks with the Treasury? I know it is a major bugbear for the industry that it is at a comparative competitive disadvantage.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I have made it a priority, through VisitEngland and VisitBritain, to talk to the tourism industry. I know that one area that it is particularly keen for the Government always to keep under review and to look at is the various tax regimes to which it is subject, whether that is VAT or air passenger duty. It is right that we continually look at all these things and make sure that we are not putting our tourism market at a disadvantage. I know that there are no plans at the moment to make any changes around VAT, particularly, but I think you are right that there are things that we need to look at. Tourism is not only important now, but growing in its importance. As we market our country even more effectively both at home and abroad, of course we will want to make sure that we are looking at these issues, but given the economic circumstances that we face at the moment, these are not things that we feel can particularly be addressed.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ86default 
defaultConor Burns:default I agree with that. Given that the economic situation—please God—will not last indefinitely, would there be merit in your Department pushing the Treasury to undertake some studies of what the revenue advantages or disadvantages might be in a change to the VAT regime on smaller bed and breakfasts and small hotels?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think there has actually been work done in that area, particularly given the differences in our near neighbours’ approach to these things. Again, I am very happy to look at the detail of that, and if I am able to give you any further detail, I am willing to do so, although that might be difficult.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ87default 
defaultConor Burns:default My final question relates to—this may seem tangential—Government energy policy and how that can impact on certain areas of our country where the 
defaultlocal economy depends on tourism. Yesterday, for example, I heard a Lib Dem colleague talking about the potential impact of fracking on the Mendip hills. In Bournemouth, we have a proposal for one of Europe’s largest offshore wind farms in 
defaultBournemouth
default bay, adjacent to the Jurassic coast. The figures on that indicate that a third of our tourism visitors would not return during the five-year construction phase and that over 14% would never return, which would completely decimate our tourism. Does your Department undertake any lobbying when potentially disadvantageous proposals are made that could significantly impact on 
defaultBritain
default’s offering?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Certainly we want to ensure that 
defaultBritain
default remains a destination of choice and that we grow our popularity as a destination for our own citizens and also for people coming from abroad. A great deal of the focus of my Department’s work is around culture and the arts and how we can even better link tourism into culture and art, and also sports, especially our international sports events. Clearly there is a need for us to remain abreast of the sorts of issues that you talk about, although they are probably best dealt with by the people representing those areas. It would be quite difficult to get involved in the impact of particular events in areas. I am not quite sure how the Department would contribute to that.
default              
defaultConor Burns:default You are very welcome to come and visit the Bournemouth tourism academy at Bournemouth university and to meet the Bournemouth Area Hospitality Association—we are Britain’s premier destination resort—to see how some of these could potentially impact on not only our local economy, but the local economies of the New Forest and the whole of Dorset more widely—
default              
defaultChair:default I don’t think we need an entire tour of the 
defaultBournemouth
default constituency.
default              
defaultConor Burns:default We have some culture in 
defaultBournemouth
default, Chair, although I know your constituency doesn’t.
default              
defaultChair:default We will not get into a constituency war—
defaultBritain
default’s first recorded battle was in Maldon.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ88default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Speaking for my constituency, the Ealing studios are at its heart, so we have plenty of culture going on there and tourism, too.
default              
defaultMay I turn your attention to the society lottery sector? Last December you announced a plan to launch a consultation into that sector. How is it going?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Clearly society lotteries are very important. We want to make sure that we understand the impact of the evolutions in that sector.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ89default 
defaultAngie Bray:default How is the consultation going?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am not sure that the consultation has been launched, but I can check.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ90default 
defaultAngie Bray:default You certainly announced last December your plans to consult on society lotteries.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, but I am not sure that it has actually been launched yet. I think it might be launched next year. Again, I can get that confirmed.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ91default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Is there a date you have got for next year that you could perhaps let us have, or is it still a bit up in the air?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Let me look into that. I haven’t got it in front of me. I am sure I would be delighted to give you the date when it happens.
default              
defaultAngie Bray:default Thank you.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default But you are right to bring that up. It is important that we keep abreast of society lotteries.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ92default 
defaultAngie Bray:default What are you trying to achieve with the consultation?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It is making sure that we understand the impact of the evolution of that market and the new players coming into it.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ93default 
defaultAngie Bray:default What does that mean? What does it mean in terms of what you are looking at for the lotteries themselves?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It is understanding the impact of those lotteries on the lottery in total.
default&#xa0;
default              defaultQ94default 
defaultAngie Bray:default On the national lottery?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Correct.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ95default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Would you say that they have a great impact? I have figures here that suggest that the national lottery raises about £1.8 billion and society lotteries raise about £155 million. It does not seem to me that there is a great threat there. They seem to me a very small prick on the bigger body.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultThe 
defaultkey 
defaultissue
default is about whether, if more organisations decide to take part in society lotteries, that would have a longer-term impact on the national lottery.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ96default 
defaultAngie Bray:default A negative impact.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultYes. It is something that we need to keep under review. Clearly it is not seen as a priority here and now, and hence the consultation has not been undertaken this year. Perhaps going back to Mr Whittingdale’s initial question about the structure of our Department, because we are a relatively lean Department, we have to take decisions about when we undertake work and we have to prioritise the work that we undertake. If there is something that we feel is 
defaultnot a priority right now and can wait a little time, unlike in the past, perhaps we have to make those sorts of decisions.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ97default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Okay, but the point would be that one of the areas that you will be wanting to look at is the minimum amount that society lotteries should be giving to their good causes. That will have quite an impact on them. You may say, “Well, we don’t really know when we might do it,” but the fact is that you still have a plan out there, and it may have quite a depressing effect on them.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultI understand the point that you are making, but I think that the fact that we do not currently feel there is a pressing need to undertake that work would send a clear signal that we do not feel there is a pressing need to take action.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ98default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Would you accept that some of these lotteries feel you are trying to regulate them at the top and at the bottom? You are limiting them in terms of turnover and at the same time looking at whether you should increase the minimum amount that they give to the cause for which they are collecting. In many ways, you are squeezing them at both ends, and that is going to be problematic for their ability to build their own charity.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultYes, and I can understand the point that you are making, hence we do not think that we should leave it alone completely.  My understanding, certainly from the lottery organisations, is that at this point there is no pressing need to take action. We need to watch how things progress, but I take the point about intervention and regulation, and the impact that that can have on running an organisation.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ99default 
defaultAngie Bray:default They do good work; we don’t want to put them off. Can anybody seriously think that it is more important to protect the national lottery than to ensure that these smaller society charity lotteries are able to take place? They do a lot of good.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultYou are absolutely right to say that a lot of good is done. However, we have to ensure that the national lottery remains the great success that it is.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ100default 
defaultAngie Bray:default It is a great success, so why does it need further protection? It makes a massive amount of money.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultIt provides enormously important funding for a whole host of organisations, so people would expect us to ensure that that continues.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ101default 
defaultAngie Bray:default But is there any evidence that other lotteries are doing any damage? I have just quoted those figures to you.
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultNo, and hence we have not undertaken the consultation at this stage.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ102default 
defaultMr Leech:default Can we move on to other areas of gambling? Everybody welcomed the summit that you held on spot fixing in football last week. From that meeting, can you tell us what you estimate to be the scale of the problem in football and other sports in general?
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultT
defaulthe meeting I had earlier last week was a reasonably low-key meeting with organisations from a number of sports, along with the Gambling Commission, to discuss a growing trend of reports in the press about problems of match fixing—to use a term—in a number of sports: cricket, football and others. I really wanted to hear from the sports themselves how effective they felt that they were being in tackling the problem, as well as the Gambling Commission’s perspective. It was a useful fact-finding meeting.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ103default 
defaultMr Leech:default Do you get a sense that the events that have been in the media recently were isolated incidents, or is it the tip of the iceberg?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default What is clear to me is that any of this sort of criminal activity is at risk of undermining the integrity of sport. We know that sport is hugely important in this country, not only for sports fans and people who enjoy watching sport, but on an economic level. Sport is an important part of our economy, too. We have to send a very loud and clear signal that there is no place for this sort of activity in the 
defaultUK
default.
default              
defaultIn terms of the prevalence of this activity, from what I can see, there is no data available about the overall prevalence of activity. What I wanted to do was to get a feeling for how sporting organisations felt this was being addressed. What was clear to me was that, across the board, there is activity undertaken to help people to report untoward, potentially criminally activity. There was also a consensus—indeed there are plans in place—to help to educate sportsmen and women about the unacceptable nature of that sort of activity. The agreements coming out of that meeting, and my overwhelming feeling, was that we needed really to look at the effectiveness of those education programmes and that is what we have agreed to do with the sporting bodies. We also need to look at whether there is potential for an improvement in the reporting mechanisms, and potentially at whether a third-party reporting mechanism might help people to be able to report problems as and when they occur.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ104default 
defaultMr Leech:default Was there any discussion about whether the penalties in different sports for being caught doing spot fixing are severe enough? Particularly in football, for instance, a lot of people at the top of the pyramid earn a lot of money, yet that doesn’t seem to have put people off. Was there any discussion about whether there needed to be permanent bans or tougher penalties in general for people caught?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default There was discussion of the importance of understanding effective action, although I think it is very anecdotal. I think this is probably one of the areas that I am quite interested in looking at further, because it is important for us to understand those that are most at risk of being caught in this sort of potentially criminal activity. I don’t see at the moment that there is very much other than anecdotal evidence around this. I tend to sympathise with your view that you need to have a penalty that is really going to have an effect. Certainly if you look at someone who is at the beginning of their career, somebody in the middle of their career and somebody who is at the end of their career, the penalties that might be in place could be very different, depending on the individual circumstances in which people find themselves.
default              
defaultI have to pay particular tribute to the work of the National Crime Agency in this respect as it has been incredibly effective at throwing the spotlight on this right from the beginning of its work. Certainly, in the cases that have come through, many of the individuals involved appear to fall into distinct groups and perhaps we just need to spend a bit of time understanding that and making sure that the sporting organisations can understand that the penalties that are in place are effective.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ105default 
defaultMr Leech:default Was there any discussion about whether or not trying to clamp down on gambling on specific events and games was an option that could be explored, and the challenges of doing something like that?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Obviously it is not in anybody’s interest—not gambling organisations, sports clubs or anybody—for this sort of activity to go on. I think that one thing that is very clear is that there are some very robust procedures in place for identifying trends in terms of these sorts of activities. I think it would be difficult to say at this stage what further action needs to be taken, but certainly what would strike me is that there are some very robust procedures in place to monitor trends. Rather than simply dealing with the problem, I want to try to deal with some of the causes. Certainly the education campaign for me is really important.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ106default 
defaultMr Leech:default The gambling Bill that is going through Parliament has fairly strong support across the House. Was there any discussion about whether the change in rules on the regulation of betting will help to tackle this problem? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I agree with you that the gambling Bill has some very strong support throughout Parliament. It has been extremely well received, but I am not sure that it will directly impact on this area.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ107default 
defaultMr Leech:default I was thinking in terms of the reporting of suspicious betting. If some offshore betting organisations are not reporting in the same way as others, perhaps there is a feeling that it might provide more evidence of illegal activity.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, although obviously, if these are offshore organisations, there may be some limitations on what action can be taken against them. As I said earlier, I am not sure it is a lack of information about the trends data. I think that is generally available. What I have felt from the conversations we had was that it was important to prevent the problem in the first place and to make sure that the education campaigns are as strong as they can be and that there is some robust evaluation of how those are working. That, for me, is where there is possible room for improvement.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ108default 
defaultMr Leech:default Very briefly on FOBTs and the work that is being done to look at their impact on problem gambling, when will we expect to get some sort of report and decision by the Government on whether action needs to be taken?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default As you know, both the Gambling Commission and the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board have advised me that there is no available evidence at this point to take 
defaultaction with regard to stake and prize limits for FOBTs—the B2 gaming machines we are talking about. We are not waiting for that evidence to emerge. We are proactively working with the industry to collect evidence about the impact of these machines. We are already in the process of gathering that information together and we won’t hesitate to take action as and when that evidence comes forward, if it shows a negative impact. That is a point that has been made clear not only by me today in Committee, but by the Minister responsible—Helen Grant—in the discussions in the House on a number of occasions this year.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ109default 
defaultMr Leech:default Have there been any discussions with the casino industry about this issue? I have certainly had e-mails from at least one of the casinos, which says that it has quite a lot of evidence on whether FOBTs are a problem. Have those discussions taken place?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I know that there have been discussions with the casino industry with regard to FOBTs and their role within casinos. I am not aware whether those discussions have extended to gathering research, but I presume that it would be through the Gambling Commission. The gathering of that evidence is being led by outside bodies.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ110default 
defaultMr Leech:default Finally, during the passage of the gambling Bill in the Commons, there was some discussion about whether casinos would be allowed to operate their own remote terminals. Has there been any movement on this, and is there likely to be any movement when the Bill goes into the Lords?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default You are absolutely right. There have been discussions around this and I think they have been very clear. We do not believe that there is a need for primary legislation to make the sorts of changes that are being discussed. It is not something we think needs to be addressed within the Bill, but it is something we are talking to the industry about. I believe that those conversations will be coming to a conclusion very early next year.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ111default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default Briefly on FOBTs, although I am no fan of FOBTs, I only supported this Committee’s report because it included a caveat about local authorities and planning committees being given the opportunity to decide whether there was an increase. In October, the Prime Minister promised a proper look at whether high stakes betting machines should be banned from betting shops. It is 18 months since that post-legislative scrutiny took place, and in your earlier answer to John Leech you didn’t give a time scale on when the Government would be likely to report back. Is there a time scale? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default We have asked the industry to work with us to collect that data. I think we have challenged the industry to make sure that they are doing everything that they can already to
default 
defaultenhance player protection.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ112default 
defaultSteve Rotheram: defaultIs it months or weeks?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It is happening right now. We are working with the industry right now.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ113default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default So it will be ready for early next year?
default 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ114default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default I noticed that in some of your responsibilities you talk about the big society. What is meant by that with regard to your role, and what is your role in boosting it? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Within our Department the big society is alive and kicking when we look at the importance of things like volunteering and the delivery not only of sports but in many of our cultural and arts institutions. If I look at an institution like the National Trust, that organisation is always defined by the role of the volunteers in helping deliver that service. So if we say it is about involving individuals in the life of our country, nowhere more so can that be demonstrated than through arts, culture, heritage and sports. Day in, day out, in each and every one of our constituencies—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ115default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default But that has gone on for millennia.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I don’t think anyone suggests that big society is—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ116default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default So it is rebranding what is already going on?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Well, nobody suggests that the idea of big society has been invented from scratch, but it is a way of capturing the richness of the contribution of people to their own communities and increasingly empowering people to do that. When you look at the work that we are doing with organisations like English Heritage, enabling it to become its own charitable organisation and taking it away from Government control directly, all these things are ways that we are trying to empower communities and organisations to be stronger from the grass roots up.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ117default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default I agree it is nothing new. I am just asking how you are going to boost it. In 
defaultLiverpool
default, for instance, we have had a big society for ever. That is what people do. You look after each other. What is your role in boosting that? That is what it specifically says: “boosting the big society”. What is the Department doing to facilitate that?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Okay, so if you look at the legacy from the Olympics, volunteering is one of our strands within that. It is something that my colleague, Nick Hurd, is leading on. You will see that our volunteering figures are the highest they have ever been. The trend is increasing. That is a very demonstrable way that we are adding to that through our legacy work. But then if you look at the work we are doing through organisations like Sport England and our youth sports plan, we are investing more into sports clubs to enable them to expand and to take up the growing appetite for involvement in sports at a community level. Those are just two examples of the way my Department is very much at the forefront of this, but there will be a whole host of others that I could draw on, I am sure, through the Arts Council and any number of our arm’s length bodies.
default              
default&#xa0;
defaultQ118default 
defaultSteve Rotheram:default Might there also be cuts to libraries, so that they have to have volunteers to run them?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I obviously look after libraries on a sort of superintendent level, in terms of strategy, but the running of libraries is done through local authorities. I must say that when I look at how my own local authority in Hampshire has reinvented libraries as discovery centres, I think that there has never been a more important time to have libraries in our communities. Well run authorities are actually investing more in the library sector, where they are able.

defaultQ119default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Did you read the Committee’s recent report into the creative industries?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I have to say, Mr Bradshaw, that I have not read the whole of it, but I have read the summary.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ120default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Did you approve the Government’s response?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Yes, that will have come through me.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ121default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default What did you think of our report?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think that the creative industries are very important, but I am struggling to remember exactly what the findings were. Can you remind me of the key findings of your report?
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ122default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default I don’t want to take up too much of the Committee’s time; but in summary, you do not seem to have supported any of our recommendations whatever. It was a very important report, for which we took evidence for several months. Do you not think that Select Committees’ views have something helpful to offer to Ministers?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Mr Whittingdale will know that I absolutely believe that your Committee has an enormous amount to offer. You will have to excuse me for not remembering the exact, precise recommendations that you put forward, but as you have already identified, the Department’s work has a great scope. Our commitment to the creative industries is demonstrable inasmuch as we are doing an enormous amount of work in conjunction with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to support the creative industries. As has been previously noted, this is something for which I have a great deal of regard.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ123default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default You will be relieved to hear that I do not share Steve Rotheram’s expectation that you have an encyclopaedic knowledge of sport. However, I would have thought, given the importance of the creative industries to our economy and to your Department, that you would have read this report, looked carefully at your Department’s responses to our recommendations and taken them very seriously—no?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think you can see very clearly that we are taking very seriously the creative industries. We are doing work supporting the funding of the creative industries, work around IP, and also the work that we are doing to ensure that we have, through creative skills sets,
default 
defaultthe right talent for the future. So I think our actions are actually pretty strong in this area, and I would hope you would welcome those.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ124default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default But we were very critical of the Government’s policy on IP, because we felt that your policy was far too close to the internet service providers and not nearly supportive enough of our creative sectors.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Obviously, our policy is very much based on the Hargreaves report, and working with the creative industries, I think we have got a very strong way forward.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ125default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default We were withering about the Hargreaves report.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Well, perhaps that is where we can agree to differ.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ126default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Can you update us on progress towards establishing a system of warning letters to individuals who infringe copyright online?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default You hopefully will be aware of the work that we have done with the industry to try to work our way around the Digital Economy Act, which has been so problematic in its implementation. Obviously, I think the concern now is that that Act was pushed through in the dying days of the last Government and perhaps more scrutiny was required in Parliament before it was passed. I am very pleased to see that the industry has been working on a way of trying to implement an industry-led approach on this. We recently had a round table with the industry and the Prime Minister, where we went through what I think were some very strong proposals from them on introducing a VCAP system, I think, very similar to the system that is in place in the States. That is working through the system very well, and I believe that will be implemented at the beginning of next year.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ127default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default So no date for the first warning letters to go out.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default As I say, it is industry-led, and I have had the indication that that is going be implemented at the beginning of next year. If you would like me to press them for a specific date, I am very happy to do that, but I would hope that you, too, would welcome the excellent work that is being done by the industry in trying to work around the problems that have been encountered by the Digital Economy Act.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ128default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default One of the other very strong concerns that we expressed in our report, because we heard a lot of evidence on this from the creative sector, was about the Government’s downgrading of the importance of arts and cultural subjects in schools. It goes back to a point that Tracey Crouch was making about sport in schools. You don’t appear to share our concern; you’re the Culture Secretary.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, I don’t agree that there has been any downgrading in the way that you suggest. I think that the EBacc gives schools the absolute opportunity to ensure that all young people are able to study more creative subjects. Indeed, all of the evidence would suggest that successful schools would be doing just that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ129default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default But you don’t agree with our recommendation that arts subjects should be given a similar status to the sciences?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default It depends what you mean in terms of “similar status”. I think that good schools do absolutely rate arts subjects in the way that you would suggest. After all, the most important arts subject of all is English and that is a core subject for young people to study. The role of Shakespeare in the curriculum now is something that this Committee should applaud. Again, going back to my recent visit to Russia, where the studying of Shakespeare is widespread and seen as being one of the best ways to study English literature—or to study literature, full stop.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ130default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default But the very clear evidence that we got from the creative industries was that the effect of the Government’s new measuring system on school performance is already squeezing out arts and creative subjects from schools. Is that not something you are concerned about as Culture Secretary?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default What I am concerned about is to make sure that young people in this country get a good education. I think that the Department for Education’s focus on making sure that young people have those core subjects in place first and foremost is of primary importance, not just to those employers who might be in the areas of science, but to all employers and all of those who are interested in supporting the arts as well.
default              
defaultWe have to have young people in this country who have good, strong, basic education. Unfortunately, under the previous Administration, too many young people were leaving school without those basic educational qualifications. As I have said before, and I don’t want to repeat myself, good schools are ensuring that young people have access to subjects like music, art, drama, alongside those core subjects. That would certainly be as everybody would expect.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ131default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Have you had any conversations with the Education Secretary about this subject?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I have. It is something I am immensely interested in.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ132default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default So you’ve lobbied on behalf of the creative sector?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default No, I would have conversations with the Secretary of State for Education on a great many things, but I am certainly
default 
defaultparticularly fascinated by the role of music, drama and art.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ133default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default You’ve never expressed concern to him about arts, cultural and creative subjects in schools?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I’m fascinated by the role of music, drama and art in a successful school life. I personally think that music and singing have an incredibly important role to play in giving children confidence and also in both their artistic and neural development. So I have had those conversations with the Secretary of State for Education, and I have always found him extremely supportive of that. When you look at the investment of the Department for Education in things such as music hubs, you can see that that interest and support is shared.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ134default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default What did you think about the recent report that said that arts funding was skewed to 
defaultLondon
default and the English regions got a bad deal?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default As you will know from first-hand experience, the Arts Council has a pivotal role to play in allocating funds for the arts. You will probably have heard Sir Peter Bazalgette being interviewed and talking about the fact that he, too, wants to ensure that we get the right balance of expenditure when it comes to 
defaultLondon
default and outside of 
defaultLondon
default. I am sure that you will be aware that the Arts Council already spends around 70% of its budgets outside of 
defaultLondon
default, and indeed that is a percentage that has increased under this Government, because we believe that it is important that we support regional arts organisations.
default              
defaultI don’t think the Committee should be under any illusion about the fact that London-based organisations, who still receive around 30% of Arts Council funding, also have a huge role to play in the development of regional arts and culture as well. I think of the work of the National Theatre or the 
defaultVictoria
default and 
defaultAlbert
default 
defaultMuseum
default, and many others, in ensuring that they support non-London organisations and also that their collections and works are touring around the country. 
defaultLondon
default is one of the biggest cultural hubs on this planet and we have to ensure that that remains the case. You are right to raise the point on the importance of regional arts funding as well. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ135default 
defaultMr Bradshaw:default Do you accept, though, that the cuts from both the Arts Council and local government have led to organisations in provincial England and the regions having difficulties in getting private support, compared with their high-profile colleagues in London? 
defaultLondon
default has its own international global economy, so it is much easier to get private sponsorship and support there. It is a particular problem for the arts in the regions, and that is why a lot of people are very worried about them.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Certainly, I understand what you are saying in terms of philanthropic giving outside of 
defaultLondon
default. That has been something that people have expressed concern about to me. When I go to places such as Manchester and Birmingham—I was recently in Manchester talking to the Hallé orchestra about some of their fundraising—I see the support that organisations like that are receiving now and have received over the years, from corporate sponsors as well as from philanthropic giving. It is considerable. The Catalyst fund, which was launched a couple of years ago, has been immensely successfully. It is a match-funding fund to encourage more philanthropic giving. You are right, however, that there is still more to do in that area. We will always be looking at ways to encourage even more philanthropic giving in the 
defaultfuture. Not only is it a really important way of supporting institutions, but it is a great way of getting people involved in those institutions, too.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ136default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default Can I refer people to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests? I have a couple of points on gambling. Will you give an absolute guarantee that, while you are the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, any decisions on gambling in general and, in particular, things like FOBTs will be based on evidence and evidence alone?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Mr Davies, they have to be based on evidence or evidence alone, because otherwise we might not get the right decision and we might be subject to challenge. However, can I put an important caveat in there? We need to have the help of the industry in gathering that evidence. If that evidence was for some reason not forthcoming, because of problems we might encounter, it might be important for the Government to take a precautionary approach on some of these issues.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ137default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default But no matter how many dodgy figures the 
defaultDaily Mail
default throw at people and however many dodgy figures large donors to the Lib Dems provide, you will resist that, if there is no evidence to back up their dodgy assertions.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think I have just made it very clear. It is for you to make assertions about the nature of the figures that might be put forward; I would not want to comment on that. You are right to say that any policy making needs to be based on fact and not supposition. The important point here is that we have a need for the industry to engage in collecting the research. If I have any evidence that the industry is not engaging, I might be forced into taking a precautionary approach as a result. I hope that the Committee, or you, will always want to encourage the industry to ensure that all information is forthcoming in a timely manner.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ138default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default I absolutely agree with that. Can I just encourage you to read the health survey for 
defaultEngland
default that has come out in the past day? For the first time ever, questions on gambling activity were included. It is totally independent and has nothing to do with anyone in the industry or anyone with any agenda. I encourage you to read it, because the findings are quite striking. 
default              
defaultAccording to the survey, the levels of problem gambling, if they have moved in any direction, have gone down rather than up. It states: “Gambling prevalence was highest in the top quintiles of equivalised household income…and lowest among the lowest income households.” That flies in the face of the evidence that other people would like you to believe. The survey continues: “Exceptions to this general pattern were bingo and scratchcards”. They were the only two exceptions. This is in the health survey that was carried out, so it has nothing to do with betting shops or anything like that. People would have you believe the role of betting shops in the local community is that they target the poorest areas and these machines in bookmakers are being gambled on. The evidence in here is quite clear, and I hope you will therefore go away, read this and consider it, because I think it will be quite striking.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Obviously, you are right; all the evidence needs to be analysed in full. What I would say, though, is that it is important to understand the impact of problem gambling wherever it falls. I would also say that it would be wrong to discount people’s anecdotal concerns in advance of having that evidence base put together. Of course, I will always listen to people’s concerns, and I know that there are some very real concerns about the impact of machines that may involve potentially very large stakes. The absence of any evidence does not mean to say that there is no harm to be had. What you have just cited is simply one piece of research. It is not necessarily constructed to delve down into the detail of those that may be experiencing problems with gambling, because I believe it is a broad and national survey on very broad health issues.
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default It is quite a detailed survey, actually. If you read the findings, it is very detailed. You have not inspired confidence that you will be governed only by evidence when you say that anecdotal evidence is going to be just as important as hard, factual evidence. That does not really inspire confidence.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I didn’t say—
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default Well, you did say that. It does not really inspire confidence.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I said you cannot discount that in the absence of any hard data. Obviously, I really hope that we will continue to work very much with the industry in establishing that hard evidence base. Hopefully, you could support us in the need to assemble that.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ139default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default I will do what I can. 
default              
defaultOn a different tack, I am sure Mr Sheridan would want me to ask why you feel that the Government’s preferred candidate for the new chairman of Ofcom, who already has a BBC pension of £119,000 a year, is worth an extra £142,000 a year for doing up to three days a week?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I believe this Committee had a role in scrutinising that candidate, so—
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default We’re able to scrutinise the candidate, but not the salary, which was your bit.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Can I finish? You had a role in scrutinising that candidate and I hope—well, I know—that you found that candidate acceptable. I hope you are able to give her your full support. I certainly think she has the credentials to be able to do the job. In terms of remuneration, it would be inappropriate to take people’s existing financial situation into account when you determine their income. I certainly do not think that this would be particularly acceptable.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ140default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default But why do you think that role deserves £142,000 a year for up to three days a week?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default We want to make sure that we attract the best candidates to do what I believe is one of the most important jobs.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ141default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default If the Government go down the line of asking Ofcom to regulate the BBC, do you think it would be appropriate for the chairman of Ofcom to be in receipt of a £119,000 a year pension from the BBC?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default We haven’t got that plan on the table at all at the moment.
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default I did not ask if you had the plan on the table. I said, if you went down the route of Ofcom regulating the BBC, would you think it was appropriate for the chairman of Ofcom to be in receipt of a BBC pension of £119,000 a year?  It is a simple philosophical principle view as to whether you think it would be appropriate or not?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I can understand the point you are making. We would obviously have to take advice as to whether there are any conflicts of interest. But as that is not an issue on the table on the moment—and I cannot foresee that it would be—that is, I think, a hypothetical question.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ142default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default Well, as you say you can’t see it, can you tell us your view of how Lord Patten is doing as chairman of the BBC Trust?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I am glad that the Committee has raised the BBC. It has been a very difficult period for them. I very much welcomed the recent announcements around the reform of the governance of the BBC. The chairman of the trust has a very difficult job to do, and I think Lord Patten, in putting in place the review of BBC governance, has done a very important thing indeed. I want to ensure that those governance reforms are translated into actions. I have made it clear to the BBC that I want to review the impact of those recommendations in the coming months. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ143default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default If you looked back on Lord Patten’s time as chairman of the BBC Trust, would you look back at it as a period of triumph or failure? 
default              
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Look, I think the BBC is an unwieldy organisation to manage, and the problems with the governance structure have been plain to see. There are very few individuals that I can think of who would be able to navigate through that, and I think Lord Patten, with his experience, has been able to help the organisation through a difficult time. Clearly, I have said myself that it has been an a
defaultnnus horribilis
default for them. The changes that they have put in now and some of the staffing changes that they have made put them better placed than they have been in the past. But let’s be absolutely clear that the BBC needs to command the confidence of the British licence fee payer, and so it will be vitally important the governance changes that they have made are effective and seen to be effective. 
default              
default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default What help—
default              
defaultChair:default Angie Bray has to go in a second, and she wants to ask a question. 
default              defaultPhilip Davies:default Fire away. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ144default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Taking you back to communications, we have already said that we were speaking to—interviewing, if you like—and scrutinising the appointment of the new chairman of Ofcom. One of the key issues that arose in yesterday’s discussion was around how we improve competiveness or competition in the mobile industry, and I think that we all identified switching as a very important step forward, which we need to make, which would benefit consumers and competition in general. What we got back was a message very clearly that Ofcom had been slowed up enormously by the threat of litigation and that they need Government support to help drive through some changes to ensure that they are safe from appeals that upset the apple cart. What is the Government going to do to get on to this and make it a priority, because, without that, we will not get the change to gaining provider-led switching that we want?
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultI think we have a very competitive mobile phone market in the 
defaultUK
default in terms of pricing, but I know that there are deep concerns around how easy it is to switch between companies. I know this is something that Ofcom is looking at, and if they feel that they need any further support—and it is something I have spoken to mobile operators about as well, and I think there is a general feeling—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ145default 
defaultAngie Bray:default They have made it very clear. We heard yesterday that we need reform to the appeal system for them to get the changes we need. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultWell, I will look forward to talking to the new chairman about that more. It is not something that Ofcom has directly raised with me, although it is something that mobile companies themselves—
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ146default 
defaultAngie Bray:default If that is a conversation you have, will you make it clear that it is a priority for you, because we are not going to move forward without it?
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultYes, and I think we have already stated that we see switching as a priority in the market. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ147default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Have you had any conversations with BIS about this? 
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultNo. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ148default 
defaultAngie Bray:default Is that something you should be doing? Presumably, they will be part of any changes here, because it is part of the BIS package as well. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultObviously, if there is a need for us to be working with Ofcom on this, I am able to take that further.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ149default 
defaultAngie Bray:default But we can get your assurance that you will make it a priority if necessary. 
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultYes.
default              
defaultChair:default I don’t want to keep the Secretary of State much longer. 
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ150default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default I was reflecting on whether it is more noteworthy that you could not bring yourself to say that Lord Patten had been a triumph as the chairman of the BBC Trust or that you could not bring yourself to say that he had been a failure as the chairman of the BBC Trust. I am trying to work out which is the most noteworthy of those two notable things. Do you still have confidence in Lord Patten as the chairman of the BBC Trust? Would you encourage him to stand for a second term as chairman of the BBC Trust?
default              
defaultMaria Miller: defaultI have absolute confidence in Lord Patten’s position. What I want to see now is the BBC implementing the governance changes they have talked about. It is very easy for us all to throw stones at an institution like the BBC. I happen to think that it is an incredible organisation that has the ability to be very powerful indeed in terms of the way people perceive our country around the world. We all need to do everything that we can to ensure that it gets back into the position that we want it to be in, in terms of having the trust of the great British public. My focus is on that. I think that it is a sideline to continually focus on individual people. We need to make sure that the institution itself is robust and strong.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ151default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default I have two final questions, which only need very simple answers. The first one is, if Lord Patten were to say he wanted to stay on for another term as BBC Trust chairman, would you support him?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I don’t think that that’s the situation as it stands. I don’t think he is intending to do that.
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default Okay. It doesn’t answer the question, but I think we can take our own view from your answer to that question.
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Mr Davies, it is rarely useful to answer hypothetical questions.
default&#xa0;
default              
defaultQ152default 
defaultPhilip Davies:default The second question is that Lord Patten appointed George Entwistle, spent hundreds of thousands of pounds appointing George Entwistle, and then effectively fired him and paid him off double what he was entitled to. We have £3 million spent on the Pollard review, ending in an absolute farce over the fact that the report is clearly flawed by everybody’s own admission. You still have confidence in Lord Patten. Could you just outline to us what it would take for you to lose confidence in Lord Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust? What would he have to do for you to lose confidence in him as chairman of the BBC Trust?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default I think Lord Patten has also put in place a superb new director-general, in Lord Hall, who I believe has a very strong vision for the future of the BBC. Lord Patten has also, I think, taken very important steps to ensuring that the flawed and broken governance structure of the BBC is changed, improved and strengthened for the future. What I want to do is to focus on that because, by focusing on positive improvement, we can help the BBC get back to the position we want it to be in. But you can have my absolute assurance that I will be looking 
defaultcarefully at the effectiveness of those governance changes. It is important now that we focus on that and not simply continually snipe from the sidelines.
default              
defaultPhilip Davies:default I notice that didn’t answer my question either, Mr Chairman, but I think I will accept that I am not going to have my question answered. I will have to reluctantly accept that.
default              
defaultChair:default It is Christmas and that is probably right. Secretary of State, thank you for your tolerance. You will be depressed to know that we have covered about half the ground that we were intending; but nevertheless, I do not think we can possibly keep you any longer, so can I just wish you a very happy Christmas?
default              
defaultMaria Miller:default Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.
