"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire [CST0064]&#xa0;Crime Statistics&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 6\nth\n December 2013.\n&#xa0;\nPlease find below my response to the two questions posed.\n&#xa0;\n1. What, if any, targets do you set for your police force? What impact do you think this has on police recording crime practices?&#xa0;I do not set targets for my force. Targets are, in my opinion, counter-productive\n \nbecause they\n \nbecome an end in themselves.\n&#xa0;\nInstead I set out very clearly in my Police and Crime Plan the views of the people of\n \nLincolnshire on how they believe their county should be policed. This takes into\n \naccount the\n \nconcerns, suggestions and aspirations of the communities that the force and I serve.\n&#xa0;\nSince there are no targets, there should be no impact on the way crimes are\n \nrecorded. I\n \nbelieve there is no impact My force is involved in preventing and detecting crime, not target\n-\nchasing.\n&#xa0;\n2. How do you assure yourself that the recorded crime figures for your area are correct? To what extent can you trust the crime statistics for your area?&#xa0;I have never had any reason to doubt the way in w\nhich crime figures are recorded.\n&#xa0;\nI have examined the methodology of crime recording and I have monthly meetings with the\n \nChief Officer team. I meet the Chief Constable far more frequently on a one-to-one basis.\n \nAmong other things, this enables me to have a firm grasp on those areas of performance\n \nwhere the most recent data or an emerging trend indicates that action needs to be taken. As\n \nan example, this approach led a rising trend in shoplifting to be visible to me, enabled me to\n \ndiscuss with senior officers their plans for addressing it and monitor and challenge the\n \nimpact their actions were having.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe point is that I am able to scrutinise the latest data at any time, not simply at\n \nmeetings\n \nconcerned with performance. I take full advantage of this - I think to the benefit of the people\n \nI represent, which of course includes my force's officers and staff; they, too, along with\n \nvolunteers are my constituents.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
