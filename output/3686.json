"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Political and Constitutional Reform C\nommittee\nOral evidence:\n \nReadiness for Individual Electoral Registration\n H\nC \n7\n9\n6\nThurs\nday \n7\n \nNovem\nber\n 2013\nOrdered by the House of Commons to be published \non\n \n7\n \nNovem\nber \n2013.\nWatch the meeting\n \nMembers present:\n \nMr Graham Allen (Chair)\n, \nMr Jeremy Browne, Mr Christopher \nChope\n, Tracey Crouch, Mark \nDurkan\n, \nPaul Flynn\n, \nFabian Hamilton\n, \nMr Andrew Turner\nQuestions \n1\n-\n6\n7\nW\nitness: \nJenny Watson, Chair, Electoral Commission, \nPeter Wardle, Chief Executive, Electoral Commission, and \nPhil Thomson, Research and Evaluation Manager, Electoral Commission,\n gave evidence.\n  \nQ1 &#xa0; \nChair: Is there anything you want to say to kick us off, or shall we jump straight into questions that colleagues have?\nJenny Watson: No, I do not think so. You have the report we did of our assessment for preparedness for the next phase of IER. We flagged up nine areas of concern. We said there was no reason to delay, but that Government needed to manage this carefully going forward, so we are happy to take any questions that you have.\nQ2 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: Can I pick up on that first point, which is that many people might think that, if you have \nconcerns, that is\n a reason to delay, so will you just explain why you think that your concerns will be allayed in a way that makes delay unnecessary?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: It will clearly be for the Minister to make sure that he thinks that the concerns that we have raised can be addressed. He is the person who will have to sign the commencement order. W\nhat w\ne are saying is that, with the concerns that we have raised, some of those do pose a risk, but there is no reason to delay moving ahead, providing that those risks can be mitigated.\nQ3 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: If you were the Minister, you would be able to say to the Deputy Prime Minister or the Prime Minister with absolute confidence, “June 2014, all systems go” and it would be \nyour\n head on the block if anything goes wrong? There would be no reason for the person to be anything other than completely 100% reassured that that deadline would be met?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: No. I think there will be some questions to be asked around the areas where we have concerns. You can see, for example—\n&#xa0;\nQ4 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: I am not saying that there are not concerns, but if you were the Minister, would you feel that there is sufficient time, expertise and knowhow so that there is no reason why all those concerns cannot be addressed by 2014? The scale of the concerns is not sufficiently great that that need delay us I suppose is my question.\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: It is difficult for me to answer that question when I am not the Minister and I do not have the information that the Minister will have from the Cabinet Office team that might reassure me about that. You will have an opportunity to ask Cabinet Office officials some of those questions. What I am saying is, from the information that we have and the work that we have done, there are areas where we have some concerns. We think there is work that needs to be done to address the risks behind those concerns, but there is no reason to delay at this point in moving ahead, provided that the Minister can assure himself—\nQ5 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: So from a purely technocratic point of view, all systems go by 2014 is entirely deliverable? People can have an argument about whether it is a good idea or not, but from a functional point of view, it is doable?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: There is no reason to delay it at this point.\nQ6 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: The funding allocations for local authority chief executives, are they adequate? Are they going to oil the wheels in such a way that there will not be mishaps in constituencies like mine?\n&#xa0;\nPeter Wardle: We said in our report that the Government should make the funding allocations available to electoral registration officers as soon as possible. They did that on 29 October and we have so far heard no adverse reaction from electoral registration officers. Indeed, I was at a meeting earlier this week attended by regional representatives across \nGreat Britain\n, and to the extent that they had managed to canvass opinions since the funding allocations were sent out, it sounded very positive and the electoral registration officers were pleased to have had the allocations. There was a little bit of, “About time too” but they have come through and I certainly did not hear concerns.\nQ7 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: Regarding this quote—not from you personally, but from your organisation—saying, “Indicating that they are unsure whether the funding to be allocated by the Cabinet Office will be sufficient to meet the challenges they face in their area”. That is the electoral reform officers, but given that everybody in the public sector always thinks that they just need a little bit more money, if we are being realistic about it, they have enough to get on with their job, that is not going to be an excuse? If the wheels fall off in June 2014, it will not be because the Government has not given them enough money?\n&#xa0;\nPeter Wardle: I do not think the Commission at the moment would see funding now— I mean\n,\n the issue we reported on was the absence of information. That information is now there. We do not see any reason to be concerned about that.\nQ8 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: One final question on this point: is the funding adequate in a differentiated way for different parts of the country? I said “a constituency like mine” but I have a constituency in Somerset, which I suspect is probably easier to do the registration process in than it would be with a more transitory population and more people living in multiple occupation properties, more people who do not speak English as their first language, all of the complicating factors are not particularly prevalent in my constituency. Are there parts of the country that have a justifiable anxiety that they have so many complicating factors that it might be going all swimmingly in 90% of the country, but those 10%—not due to incompetence by them, but due to just having more issues to resolve—will struggle to a greater degree?\nPeter Wardle: That point is absolutely right. It is very clear from the analysis of the confirmation dry run, the dry run of the data-matching that took place this \nsummer, that\n the average figure of matching of 78% across \nEngland\n, \nScotland\n and \nWales\n hides some starkly low match figures. The electoral registration officers and their teams in those local authorities are going to have a lot more to do, to write out, contact those unmatched electors and get them back into the system before December 2015. But that is a topic that is well understood, I think, in the programme board that is managing this programme, on which I sit. I am confident that it is well understood by the Cabinet Office, and the Cabinet Office will be able to tell you a bit more about this later. There is further funding available and that has been made clear to electoral registration officers, so that if an ERO can show from the data that they expect to have a higher hill to climb, they can confidently claim more funding.\nQ9 &#xa0; \nMr Browne: Thank you. I am not a Labour MP, but I have heard Labour MPs make a complaint, which seems to me quite a justifiable or plausible—it may not be justifiable, but it is certainly reasonable—complaint, which is that the people who are going to fall out of the process are likely disproportionately to be poorer people, people with more mobile lifestyles, if I can put it in those terms, and are more likely to be in inner cities, more likely to be, bluntly put, in seats represented by Labour MPs and more likely to vote Labour, if they vote. Therefore, the whole process could have a distorting effect on the outcome of any given election if it disproportionately disadvantages a group of people who have a disproportionate propensity to vote for one particular party, in this case Labour. I am not encouraging people to vote Labour, but we should have a level playing field, which is why I understand that they are raising a reasonable concern. I do not know whether you can allay those concerns by saying that you do not think that the transition to a new system will lead to a distorting effect on election outcomes, because it will build in a differential propensity to vote from one party to another, based on the registration of voters.\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: We know two things from our research. One is that there are certain groups of people who are less likely to be registered per se. That would be younger people, people from some black and ethnic minority communities and people in private rented accommodation. We know from the analysis of the confirmation dry run that there are people who are less likely to be confirmed directly on to the new register through the individual registration transition and there is some correlation between the two, so they would be students, people in private rented accommodation and recent home movers. Everything that all of us do during the transition to Individual Electoral Registration in the public awareness work that we do, that local authorities are doing, the work that they will need to do on the ground, any other activity that takes place will target those groups.\nThe confirmation dry run results—and indeed the data-matching next summer when this happens for real, assuming that things go ahead in the transition as planned—will give electoral registration officers and their teams the clearest information that they have about where they need to target their resources to make sure that they are focusing on the people who are confirmed to get them on to the register. So every bit of activity is designed to make sure that they are focusing on the people who are confirmed to get them on to the register and to ensure that we have a register that is as complete and accurate as possible.\nPeter Wardle: On a slightly more political level—the May 2015 general election— nobody who is on the register going into the transition that starts next summer will lose their right to vote because of the carry-forward provisions. The Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform immediately after the general election has a decision to make, and that decision is whether to close the transition to IER in December 2015, as is currently the intention, or to stick with what is on the face of the Bill, which is to let it run to December 2016. The Commission will make a report publicly to Parliament that analyses the progress. I think it will be very easy then for parliamentarians to have a debate along the lines you introduced as to whether we have made sufficient progress by then.\nMr Browne: Thank you.\nChair: Very helpful, Peter. Andrew.\nQ10 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: Ms Watson, you said earlier that there is no need for delay now, but you were not able to be certain about the future. Is that correct?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: I am \nsorry,\n I did not mean to imply that at all. Let me go back to what we said in our assessment. We said that there are issues that give us some concern and we have set those out very clearly. Some of those, around things like announcement of funding, have already happened; on others, more will need to be done. We said that the Minister’s decision to sign that commencement order will need to take full account of that, but even given our concerns, if Government can give assurances about carefully managing the process and if the Minister can read this and assure himself that our concerns have been answered or that he has the information to see that those risks are mitigated, there is no reason to delay at this point.\nQ11 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: But “at this point” means now, or does it mean—\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: There is no reason to further delay the progress along the transition.\nMr Turner: So it is not just now, it is for the future?\nJenny Watson: Peter has just made the point that there will be a decision for the Minister to make in 2015 about the point at which the register becomes the Individual Electoral Registration register rather than a combination of the two. That is the future and there will be a decision at that point about whether to press the button to go fully to the Individual Electoral Registration register.\nQ12 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: Right, but you are confident that you would not need to delay it for anything leading up to the next general election?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: What we are saying is that the Minister has to make a decision now about whether to sign a commencement order. We have set out our concerns. Some of those will need more careful questioning and probing from the Minister than others. You will have an opportunity to ask the Cabinet Office about those. We do not see a reason for the Minister to delay that, provided that he can assure himself that the risks that we have identified can be managed. That is for him to decide. There is information he will have that we will not have, because it is a Government programme.\nQ13 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: In that case, what are those things that the Cabinet is doing that you are not aware of—or fully aware of—that may or may not change the Minister’s view?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: For example—and Peter may want to say a little bit more about this—one of the issues that we have raised is around the testing of some of the IT. I hasten to say that we sometimes have in our minds Government projects and IT; we see that in the media. This is perhaps not one of those kinds of projects, but nevertheless there is an issue with the testing of the IT in terms of the verification of electors and in terms of what lies behind the online registration portal, which will be, if that can be made to work, a very good new service to make available to voters. That testing is being carried out by the Cabinet Office. They are much closer to that than we are. We have raised issues about the timing of that testing. That is properly for the Cabinet Office to resolve.\nPeter, do you want to say any more on that?\nPeter Wardle: That is probably the best example. To go back to the line of questioning that Mr Browne opened with, if you are an electoral registration officer, there were probably two main \nquestions in your mind. One was, “Will I have sufficient resources?” and that question has been answered, and the other is, “Will the IT work?” Whether the IT will work is entirely out of the EROs’ hands until the IT system is delivered to them. The Cabinet Office \nare\n confident that it will work when it is delivered. We are saying it had better work when it is delivered, because the delivery point is very close to when EROs are going to have to start using it, and between delivery and go live, they will have to manage the May 2014 elections. The history suggests that it is very likely that it will work, because the Cabinet Office have delivered very successfully the IT to EROs that was used for this summer, this dry run of the bulk data-matching process.\nWhat EROs next \nneed—\nthe two other bits of IT—one is the daily data-matching process that will be used for every new applicant for the register. They have to provide details that are automatically checked against the DWP register, and also that will be supported by a very positive new development in the system, which is the opportunity for people to send in their application online without using paper. Those are both great things, EROs welcome them, but until they see \nthem\n and they can touch them and they can see them working, there will be an element of doubt. I think we are in a similar position, “Show it to us working and all our doubts will go away”. I think it would be foolish of us to say that we can have no doubts until we see it working. I hope that gives you a sense of where we are.\nQ14 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: I think so. You say in your assessment that Government needs to engage more effectively with EROs and their staff on funding and other issues. How do you suggest they go about this?\n&#xa0;\nPeter Wardle: This is not rocket science. The issue is that the electoral community is hard-pressed; they are not immune from local authority funding cuts. Nobody in the public sector is. They have a heavy agenda of polls over the next few years: so in 2014 we have the Europeans; we have all the major metropolitan elections; in 2015, we have the general election; in Scotland we have the Scottish Independence Referendum next year, and in 2016—important to remember—there is a very heavy programme of polls right across the UK, the London mayoral elections, the next round of PCC elections, for example, and polls in Scotland and Wales. The next three years is a very busy period anyway, and we have Individual Electoral Registration to deliver. It is therefore more important than ever that EROs feel they have very reliable, real-time information from the Cabinet Office about the changes.\nThere have been some concerns over the past 12 months that things have happened without being fully consulted on. I think the Cabinet Office themselves would acknowledge that. It has certainly been discussed at the programme board that I mentioned earlier, and from my perspective, the Cabinet Office has very much responded to those concerns and taken a number of very positive steps to address that. What we are saying to the Cabinet Office is, “Based on our experience of working with the electoral system over years, you cannot underestimate the need to continue that and the old rule of communication. You just need to keep on reassuring people and telling people and answering their questions”. It will never be enough simply to assume that the message has been heard and you can move on.\nJenny Watson: If I could just briefly answer that, there is a point in our assessment about communicating with EROs, as well as with their staff teams. That is another important message to get across, because many of the challenges that the electoral services staff are facing may well need skills that are available in other parts of their local authority, but perhaps not in their immediate team. For example, thinking about some of the work that they have done in analysing data, it may well be that there are great skills available in other parts of the local authority, but perhaps not in the immediate electoral services team. The electoral registration officer is more likely to be either a chief executive or pretty senior in the local authority and have access to what they can see and pull in from elsewhere within the local authority. It was both a message about—as Peter says—the \nimportance of communication, but also about communicating with the right people at the right time, not only the electoral services teams, but the electoral registration officers themselves.\nQ15 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: Jeremy mentioned those areas that may have more difficulty with registering people, yet it seems to me, looking in your reports, they are not mainly non-UK origin people, but people such as students and they live in \nCambridge\n, Ceredigion, Aberystwyth, \nCarfax\n or \nOxford\n and \nKeele\n and that sort of place. Are those the real problems, rather than people who are from other parts of the world? \n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: There is a range of people who are less likely to be matched. Perhaps I will ask Phil to say a little bit about that.\nPhil Thompson: Yes, you are right. When we looked at the data that came through from the dry run of the matching process, it was predominantly student wards, so wards that have a very high proportion of students had the lowest match rates. There was also evidence that in general, younger people were slightly less likely to match and people in private rented accommodation, \nwho\n were more likely to move house more frequently, were less likely to match. I think that is the confirmation-matching process not picking up students, for example, at their term-time address as opposed to at their home address, where they may also be registered. They may match there and be retained on the register there, because the Department for Work and Pensions database may well hold the students’ details at their family home, for example, rather than at their student halls of residence and that may well be why they do not match when the process is run.\nJenny Watson: That is a particular challenge for students, who may be registered to vote in the place where their parents live. They may not be registered to vote in the place where they are at university, so that is why the matching process is sometimes difficult for confirming them.\nPeter Wardle: It is worth saying that one of the difficult terminological issues over the next couple of years, talking about Individual Electoral Registrations, is one Jenny mentioned before: there is a difference between people who are not registered currently and people who are currently registered but do not match against the Department for Work and Pensions database when the checks are made. While there is some overlap between those two groups and the nature of the people who are likely to be in those two groups, it is not an exact overlap and that explains the difference that you picked up at the beginning, Mr Turner.\nQ16 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: Finally, what is it about \nScotland\n that makes them our least effectively registered people other than \nLondon\n?\n&#xa0;\nPhil Thompson: I think what we said in the analysis report is that when you look at the regional breakdowns, Scotland is disproportionately affected by Edinburgh and Glasgow, so Edinburgh and Glasgow both have high student populations and so you have issues that we think affect confirmation, so private renting and a mobile population. They make up about 20% of \nScotland\n’s population, whereas if you look at the north-west, somewhere like Liverpool only makes up about 7% of the north-west population, and even with \nManchester\n it is only about 13%. I think that is what is happening in \nScotland\n. We have not found any evidence that there is anything else going on in \nScotland\n. One of the things we looked at was whether Scottish addresses, which can be slightly different in tenement addresses, were causing problems with the matching, but it does not appear to be the case.\nQ17 &#xa0; \nPaul Flynn: My constituency has the rare, possibly unique, distinction: in the last public vote we had, on the Police and Crime Commissioners, one of our polling booths recorded a nil vote. That is something that cannot be beaten—possibly equalled—but it is a disturbing trend. It is the Commission’s role, I understand, to design the household inquiry form and the application to register form. These have to be approved by the Minister and there is this tight timetable that is going on and \nit’s the time of the European elections. You say that you need the Cabinet Office to share with you its detailed cost modelling work on the forms in order to make decisions. How is it done? If you have not been told, when can you expect be told what the procedure will be? How likely is it to be concluded in time?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Parliament gave us the responsibility to recommend the form that should be used for the Individual Electoral Registration. I guess some of the context is that we have made a lot of progress, looking at things like ballot papers over recent years to make sure that they are as easy for voters to use as possible. We are now able to put the same kind of analysis and experience into getting the form right for voters to use to register. We are asking them for more information; there are more people having to fill the form in. Obviously, by its nature, it is individual registration. We want to make that form as accessible as possible and that is the role that Parliament has given us. We are working with the Cabinet Office to get a shared understanding of the costs that might be involved in the modelling and production of different types of forms so that we can be clear about achieving the right kind of balance between cost and accessibility. We can then have a shared understanding with the Cabinet Office, so that when we make our recommendation, it is on the basis of transparent and clear information.\nQ18 &#xa0; \nPaul Flynn: The person who fills out the form at the moment is usually one member of the family, head of the household, who is strongly motivated about making sure that everyone is registered. Other members of families and groups are weakly motivated. How will you avoid the likely reduction in the number of people who are applying, because it is up to the weakly-motivated ones to fill out their own forms and they are less likely to do so?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: That also works the other way round. If in a household that is shared, the person who sees that form first is not motivated, that form can go in the bin without anybody else in the household being aware that it is there, so there is an important point about the individual aspect of it. How will we address that? I said earlier in my answer to Mr Browne that the activity will go on right through the transition to IER, assuming that the Minister signs the commencement order—including the work that local authorities will be doing, which is probably the single-most important thing, engaging with people in their local area. They are best-placed to know their local area and we are monitoring that work through our performance standards. They are sending us copies of their engagement plans. We will publish the performance standards so you will all be able to see it. It is probably a little early to say, but I am encouraged by what we have seen so far. They are clearly working very hard to make sure that they use the dry run results to show them where to best focus their efforts. We will also have work with local organisations that people already trust, for example, employers, other charities, and we will have a public awareness campaign. All that will provide a context within which people are aware, I hope, that there will be a letter coming through their door and they need to act on it and they need to fill that form in, or they need to respond to the letter that the local authority sends them to tell them that they have not been automatically put on the register and they need to provide some more information.\nQ19 &#xa0; \nPaul Flynn: Thanks. In the bilingual form that will be distributed in \nWales\n, what are you going to do to make sure that they are readily understandable? Will you have the Welsh one a different size; will you have the languages together; will you use different typefaces? What criteria do you have in mind to make them understandable?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Peter may want to say more about that, but the answer is that, whatever we do, we will test on voters. When we are developing forms, we test those forms with voters and see how they engage with them and what they tell us about whether those forms work for them.\nPeter Wardle: I was going to say something very similar. They will be fully tested. We have a lot of experience, of course, of developing bilingual forms and we would certainly talk to people with \nthe expertise in \nWales\n and our own Welsh-speaking staff to make sure that those tests are well-carried out.\nIf I could just add two points on your initial concern, there are two things about the system that help with your initial worry. One of course is the confirmation process itself, so we are not asking 40 million currently registered electors to reapply. The majority of them, the vast majority of them, will transfer through to the Individual Electoral Registration system without having to rely on a form to do that. The other thing that I mentioned before of course is that we will have online registration, so in terms of motivation for people who do not fancy filling in paper forms, there is an important new way of sending your application in, which I think may appeal to some of the people who do not fill in the forms at the moment.\n&#xa0;\nQ20 &#xa0; \nPaul Flynn: You say there would be a significant issue for the Commission if the Minister did not accept the proposed designs because there would be little time to develop alternatives. We can understand that, but what contingency plans do you have in order to deal with this? It is a worryingly short period, when so much else will be going on. We have seen this cautious optimism before and sadly it has often had sad outcomes.\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Parliament has given us a role to recommend the form that is most accessible to voters, most easy for them to use, which incidentally also will cut down on follow-up time from local authority staff. That is an important point. If the form is not well-designed, staff in local authorities will have to spend more time following up than they would otherwise have done. We will make a recommendation. The Minister will decide whether to accept that recommendation or not. I would expect that there would not be a difficulty with accepting our recommendation, particularly given that Parliament has asked us to make it in the first place. By law, we will have to provide electoral registration officers with the form that the Minister finally chooses. That is what the law requires of us. I am not sure it is quite a contingency; it is more that that is what the law would require us to do. What we are trying to do ahead of making that recommendation is to make sure that we and the Cabinet Office have shared as much information as we can about the cost assumptions lying behind the production of that form.\nQ21 &#xa0; \nPaul Flynn: Mr Jeremy Browne made the point about the different responses from different groups—this comes out clearly in your report—that in certain areas there are very large differences in the way people respond. Your campaign is tailored to deal with those difficult areas. What are the areas, what differences do you encounter and what will be the differences in resources you will invest in them to make sure you get a fair response?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Our public awareness work, and indeed the work that local authorities will do on the ground, will be tailored to two particular—there is no way to avoid calling them “audiences” I am afraid, which makes me sound like some terrible marketing-speak person, but I am going to do that, because it is faster, so a quicker answer to your question. There is one set of audiences who are the people who are least likely to be confirmed through the process, as Peter was just saying. We know who those people are most likely to be; Phil has just set that out for you. The other set of audiences is the people who are less likely to be on the register, so the under-registered groups, and again you have heard in our answers to both Mr Turner and Mr Browne that we know who they are. There have not been any surprises in the process so far. We are finding what we expected and all our public awareness work and the work that local authorities do will be targeted at addressing the needs of those people.\nPeter Wardle: We have a very clear view that what matters is the local contact, so the extent that the Electoral Commission can directly communicate with those people is limited. We are giving a great deal of best practice advice and a great deal of monitoring oversight to local electoral registration officers to ensure that they have a local plan that is tailored to fit the circumstances of \ntheir local area. That is the whole point of the way we run our electoral system in this country—you draw on that local knowledge.\nJenny Watson: We will be able to share some of the good practice that we are already seeing authorities put in place with others so that they can learn from each other and so that a local authority with a similar kind of challenge might be able to learn from what other people are doing. As I have said already, we will publish the next performance standards report in March and you will all be able to see the conclusions that we have reached and we will be happy to come and talk to you about that in due course if you wish.\nPaul Flynn: We will live for the day, thank you very much.\nQ22 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: I wanted to raise the issue of the EU Referendum Bill—\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Topical.\nMr Chope: —which has its Report stage tomorrow. You have put forward some comments on the question proposed in that Bill and you do not criticise the existing question, but you raised the issue of whether it is going to be confusing for all those people who do not know whether we are currently members of the European Union. To quite a number of us, that comes as quite a surprise, that there are a lot of people who do not know whether we are in or out of the European Union at the moment. The question I want to put to you is whether you believe, if there is a referendum campaign, that at the time that people come to vote, they will still be in doubt about whether we are currently in the European Union. Surely at that stage there will not be any doubt about whether we are in the European Union, so the question as proposed in the Bill will be perfectly adequate for that circumstance, would it not?\nJenny Watson: I am concerned about the premise of your question, because I have in front of me what we said, “Clarifying the current status of the UK within the EU is necessary to help voters better understand the choice of actions proposed for the UK and would also reduce the risk of ambiguity about the consequences of the referendum, which could mislead some voters”. So I think that is a little way from saying that we did not criticise the original question. The original question in Mr Wharton’s Bill is confusing for voters. It is confusing on two points. One is that in our testing—which is a robust methodology, we have now used that on many occasions; I think we have now done nine reports on referendum questions—we have not yet had a recommendation not be accepted, including most recently, you will all be aware, in Scotland. We certainly found that there were voters who did not know about our membership of the European Union. As importantly, we found voters who thought they were clear in their minds that we were members, and when they read the question in Mr Wharton’s Bill they became confused, because the wording of his question, “Do you think the UK should be a member of the EU?” made them doubt their own knowledge, so the question as in the Bill is not appropriate for use in a referendum because it leads to confusion.\nI am sure you will be there ahead of me: if you want \nthen\n to use a yes/no question, you have to either introduce the word “leave” or the word “remain” and we tested both; you would expect us to have done. The word “leave” produced a very strong reaction from people and was seen to be leading, including from those people who wanted to vote to leave. The word “remain” was seen as more neutral. There is a small low-level risk of a perception of bias, which is why we have said to Parliament\n:\n t\nhe question needs to be changed;\n \ny\nou could move away from the recent tradition of yes/no questions to one that gives people options, so, “Should the UK remain in the EU or leave the EU?” the options being leave the EU/remain in the EU. We did not have time in the time available to us to do the next iteration that we would have liked to do, to try to simplify that option question, and we would like to seek the views of campaigners, which we also did not have the time to do. We could do that very quickly if Parliament were to decide that it wanted to accept that recommendation.\nYou are right about the context being now and voters also said to us that they would expect by the time a referendum came that there would have been campaigns. We are given, by law, a responsibility to test questions on referendums that appear in Bills before Parliament. That is what we have done. This question is not suitable for use in a referendum from our testing, because it confuses voters.\nQ23 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: As of now?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: That is the responsibility that we have. I am not prepared to predict the situation that might exist when a referendum might be held. We also said in our report—and Phil will correct me if I am wrong—if Parliament wanted to say to us, “You have tested it now. We would like you to test it again closer to the time and in that context”, we would of course be happy to do so. But the question that we have tested with voters is confusing and likely to mislead them.\nQ24 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: So because you think that both the existing question proposed is inadequate and you accept that the use of the word “remain” can be regarded as loaded one way or another, you are suggesting that there should be two questions in the alternative, would we stay or whether we should leave. Is that your preference, because it is not clear from your report—or it certainly was not clear to me—that you were coming down strongly in favour of a two-question referendum so that people could see that there were two questions, “Do you want to stay?” or, “Do you want to get out?”\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: The question we tested that was seen as the most neutral was the question that had the options rather than yes/no. That approach would work. Another approach that would also work is a yes/no question, and of the yes/no questions that we tested, the most appropriate was the one, “Should the \nUK\n remain a member of the EU?” It did not cause anybody to change their vote in the work that we did. That is direct testing with voters, one to one with a ballot paper, “Tell us, \ntalk\n to us about the question. Did you vote in the way you intended?” So you get a lot back from it and you always learn something about what voters understand and do not understand. It may seem strange in this place for voters to say that they do not know that we are members of the EU, but that might be perhaps the case if people are engaged with an issue. We have found that in the past in relation to other topics. \nQ25 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: Do you think that people in Scotland realise they are part of the United Kingdom?\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Yes. We tested that. We thought we might find something different. We tested that and we did not find any misunderstanding about the fact that \nScotland\n is currently part of the \nUK\n. Had we found that, we would have recommended a change, but we did not find it.\nMr Browne: If we spend 300 more years in the EU, we would not have Christopher’s question.\nJenny Watson: I am \nsorry,\n I did not quite answer you. You were asking whether we came down on one side or the other. What we are saying is there are two approaches, both of them could work. One has a risk of a perception of bias. It is low-level, but it is a yes/no question. That is the most neutral yes/no question, but the most neutral question that we tested in the round is the option question. The model here is a slightly unusual one, because this is a private Member’s Bill. More usually, it is question that is put by Government, we test it and Parliament decides, but the second part of those steps still hold true: we test and Parliament decides and we think it is rightly for Parliament to decide whether we move away from that model of yes/no questions.\nChair: I think 100% of the members of the Committee know we are here to talk to you about Individual Electoral Registration, but after that nice interlude, a little visit to \nEurope\n, just to break it up a little bit, I am sure Mark will bring us back to the topic.\n&#xa0;\nQ26 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: Yes, and I will not be tempted off by experiences of Irish referendums and the power of, “If you do not know, vote no”.\n&#xa0;\n              \nBoth Peter and Jenny mentioned decisions that would have to be taken in 2015. I know that is stepping a little beyond and into the next Parliament, but how conscious is the Electoral Commission that, when decisions have to be taken in 2015, that will be in circumstances where, under an Act already passed by this Parliament, there is meant to be a boundary review triggered—a boundary review, as the Act currently stands, based on 600 seats to be allocated to the four jurisdictions of the UK on a Sainte-\nLaguë\n basis. The assessment and the decisions that will have to be taken will just be about the relative quality of individual and quantum of Individual Electoral Registration, they are going to fundamentally have political implications for the distribution of seats across the \nUK\n.\n&#xa0;\n              \nIf there is a significant drop, as some people fear, with electoral registration in the first instance, the number of seats that would be allocated to England would go down and the number of seats under the Act as passed at the minute that go to Northern Ireland and Scotland I assume would go up because it is a fixed quantum of 600. If \nEngland\n’s share of the registered electorate is down, then other places go up. Obviously, that has its pertinence, as well as the sense of the partisan sensitivities within \nEngland\n. The decision that has to be taken then is not going to be a technical decision; it will be quite a loaded political decision. The Electoral Commission’s advice in that situation will then become something of heavy political import, maybe putting the Electoral Commission in a much more \npartisanly\n sensitive context than it has ever been before.\n&#xa0;\n              \nIf your advice currently is, “Yes, there are problems, but let us proceed” how conscious are you of the problems that we possibly get into based on existing legislation, or of course the choice will have to be to dispose of some of that legislation at that point. Again, that becomes quite a political question, but all these issues then of electoral arrangements become a direct political decision of the new Government. That is exactly what I thought the whole concept of the Electoral Commission and everything else was meant to be getting us away from.\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: We are acutely aware of the context in which that decision will be made. Peter made a point earlier that I would reinforce at this point: in the work that we will do before we give any advice to a Minister, we will be holding in our minds not only a national level of the register’s completeness, but what we will know from local authorities through Great Britain about how that process of transfer to individual registration has gone within the different parts of their local authority. For example, the confirmation dry run results have already been published, broken down by ward. \nAll that is available to people.\n It is there, it is transparent and it shows us the expectation of percentages in different wards that can be matched. We will be acutely conscious of the local variation around the country and that will be in our minds when we give that. Phil may want to say a little bit more about the research that we are doing.\nA frustration for me is that I am very happy to answer any question that you have about this process as it relates to voter registration. What I cannot do is speak for the Boundary Commission and I think there is a conversation that you may want to have with the Boundary Commission about what they are doing and thinking about the information that we are putting in the public domain.\nQ27 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: The Boundary Commissions.\n&#xa0;\nJenny Watson: Indeed.\nMark Durkan: The Boundary Commissions do not have a decision to make. They will be told how many seats they have to come up with in each of their areas.\nJenny Watson: We will have a great deal of information about the state of the register at that time. Phil might want to say a little bit more about that, so that we can reassure you about what we are looking at. We are acutely conscious of the context in which that decision will be made and obviously we are going to want to make a decision that ensures that the register is as complete and accurate as possible. We will always have both of those things in our minds. The Boundary Commissions will then have access to—I think we have talked to the Committee about this before—all the information that we have on the state of the register in different parts of the country.\nPeter Wardle: So will parliamentarians and so will Government policy-makers. If I can try to sum up the critical information that we will be reporting on, we will be able to give you a pretty good idea of how many people who were eligible to vote, registered to vote at the May 2015 general election, were registered to vote only because of the carry-forward protection that is built into the transition to IER, and therefore, one might reasonably assume when the December 2015 register is published—\nto\n which current legislation points \nto \nthe Boundary Commissions—how many of those are at serious risk of falling off that register. There will be further efforts between the 2015 general election and the publication of the register to try to catch what I hope will be that diminishing number of people who have still not made the transition to Individual Electoral Registration, but when we publish those figures, it will be pretty clear what the potential for any deterioration in the register across the country will be when it is published in December 2015. I am not sure that as the Electoral Commission we can take that much further, except to say that information will be available to people who make the policy about how the boundary review will be conducted.\nJenny Watson: We also said in our initial assessment, which is the reason that we are here, that we will analyse that likely impact and make clear how it will affect the next scheduled review of parliamentary boundaries. I think that is us doing everything that we can do. I do understand the concerns. It is not the first time that we have been asked the question and I suspect that we will be asked it with increasing frequency as we move from now on through the transition to IER. We will provide all the information that we can as transparently as we can.\nChair: Jenny, Peter, Phil, thank you so much for coming this morning. It has been very helpful, as always, and we look forward to the next time we see you and no doubt interacting a little bit more on the Lobbying Bill as we go on, which thankfully we did not get into today. Thank you so much.\n&#xa0;\nWitnesses:\n \nCiaran Martin, Constitution Director and Senior Responsible Owner for the Electoral Registration Transformation Programme, Cabinet Office, \nColin Dingwall, Programme Director, Electoral Registration Transformation Programme, Cabinet Office, and \nPiers Harris, Digital Project Director for the Electoral Registration Transformation Programme, Cabinet Office, gave evidence.\nQ28 &#xa0; \nChair: Welcome, \nCiaran\n Martin, Colin \nDingwall\n and I think we have a late addition, Piers Harris, who is the Digital Project Director for Electoral Registration. A latecomer, but very welcome, Piers, and you may well have some very helpful things to tell us. Nice to see you all.\n&#xa0;\n              \nWe are going to kick off, unless, \nCiaran\n, you want to say anything to start us off?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Very briefly, if I may, Mr Chairman.\nChair: Please do, yes.\nCiaran Martin: First, I wanted to put on record our thanks to the Electoral Commission for a good and fair report and also very high-quality engagement in both their role as our \nscrutineer\n, but also in an important part of the programme as a delivery partner in things like public awareness. Also I also welcome the Committee’s continuing interest in the programme. Ministers have said in the \npast how helpful the Committee have been in the course of the pre-legislative scrutiny and in other areas.\nThe second and final point I wish to make by way of introduction, if I may, Mr Chairman, is that since you last took evidence on this from the Commission in April on the data-matching pilots, I think the one very significant development that we have touched on here, what I think needs to be drawn out is the importance of the confirmation dry run and just to spell out for the Committee what happened. This was a full “as it will happen” test in all local authorities in Great Britain and all 380 of them matching, testing 46.4 million electors against DWP name and address data with a return rate of 78%, in other words, 37.7 million electors. While there is still much work to be done, that can give us some confidence that for the majority of people currently on the register, the transition to the new system can be, we would hope, a straightforward experience, so now our focus will be on addressing the issues in the Electoral Commission’s report at this important point, as we advised Ministers on the decision ahead on proceedings. Thank you.\n&#xa0;\nQ29 &#xa0; \nChair: Fantastic. \nCiaran\n, you mentioned the role of the Committee. We always attempt to be constructive and of course that is helped by knowing at the earliest possible opportunity what people are thinking and what things are in the pipeline. We are \nable,\n I hope, then to make some constructive contribution and thank you for pointing that out. The only time we get tetchy is when we find out about stuff way downstream and are not then able to make a constructive contribution. That has never happened in our relationship, but it has happened elsewhere, and I just thought I would put that on the record so you know that we are very grateful for the way that you involve us.\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Thank you.\nQ30 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: You have obviously read the Electoral Commission’s assessment and you have listened to the oral evidence that they have given us this morning. They raise in their report the fact that they consider some significant issues to still be within the process of implementation for IER. Do you agree with the Commission at this point that there are still significant issues that need to be addressed?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: I very much think, as I have said in the opening remarks, that the Electoral Commission report is a very good and fair one. That means I do accept that there are significant issues to work through. This is a very significant change programme, affecting 46.4 million and more people, with other electors coming on and people currently not on the register that we want to get on the register. I frankly would be quite surprised if at this stage, getting well into the second half of a major national change programme, there were not significant issues, which I think are brought out in the report. I welcome the Commission’s assessment that while those issues are there, they do not amount, in their view, to a reason to delay implementation of the Government’s timetable. It now will be in a relatively short time a decision for Ministers whether they agree to proceed on that basis, and that is a decision for them that is not yet taken, but I accept that there some issues to work through.\nQ31 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: Are you confident that those issues can be addressed by June next year for the transition to begin?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: I believe that we have plans in place to meet all the areas identified by the Commission. As you have just heard, it is not quite written in this way, but funding uncertainty was clearly within the top two issues identified, and clearly what you have just heard in relation to a work period that was significantly \nameloriated\n to the satisfaction—I would agree with what Peter Wardle said—of the electoral registration and administration community at large.\n&#xa0;\nQ32 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: Have you had any feedback on the funding?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Yes, we have. We have, for example, met the Association of Electoral Administrators board. We are in close touch with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives elections representative and, frankly—and no doubt we will touch on this later—we have a continuous \nroadshow\n type process of engagement with electoral administrators and EROs up and down \nGreat Britain\n. I would share what the Chief Executive of the Commission has just said, that the reaction has been broadly positive. There has been a bit of, “About time too” rather than, “This is not enough”. I would probably agree with that assessment and I think that is fair.\nThe other one of the top two is IT. I would say that we are confident that we have a plan in place for further testing of the IT verification system. I welcome very much what Peter Wardle just said, that the history of the programme so far suggests that it will work. I will not stop worrying about the IT at any point in the programme. It is important to recognise that what we are doing is connecting up things that DWP already do at scale very well and we are connecting that up to local authorities and we are building in flexibility and contingency, so there is no giant new IT database under construction in that respect, but it is a significant and complex IT programme that will need a lot of attention right up to its end.\nQ33 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: So the transition will begin in June 2014?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: That will be up to the Minister laying a commencement order in the House and—\nQ34 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: But you are confident that all the issues that have been raised in the Electoral Commission’s report will be addressed and therefore the Minister should not have any good reason not to lay the commencement order?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Put it this way: you have in front of you an assessment from the Commission that says the issues that they have identified that need to be addressed do not amount, in their view, to a reason to delay. Given I am sitting in front of the Committee today, if I knew otherwise in terms of issues in this report that I felt were on a track that would mean that that position would change very soon, I would feel it incumbent upon me to tell the Committee now, and I do not feel that. I do not feel I can give a blanket guarantee of success, because there is a lot of work to be done in the coming months, and while we can be as confident as we can be at this stage, there is always the risk of the unexpected failure or unexpected external event or whatever it may be, but I do not know of anything now that would give me reason to warn the Committee that I think that broad assessment is going to change.\nQ35 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: That is good news. One of the other issues that \nwas\n raised by the Electoral Commission was about the need to engage more effectively with EROs. You obviously mention your \nroadshow\n, but do you think that is enough to address this recommendation from the Commission?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: The Commission has said that they feel that this is an area that needs some further work and that is something that we will take very seriously. We have done a significant amount. I did mention a sort of \nroadshow\n type approach within the team. We have also appointed 10 regional delivery managers who are largely based across the regions of \nEngland\n and one for \nScotland\n and \nWales\n and we have within the team people designated for individual counties to support the delivery managers. Their job essentially is to go out and about and meet and assess and see what can be done to support. We always engage at the big ticket events of the electoral administration community, the major conferences of local government, the Association of Electoral Administrators and so on. We have a weekly newsletter and so on, we have all the surgeries. We do quite a lot of it. I would hope that by the next time you ask the Commission about this, they will \nsay that it has continued to improve and we will be talking to them about their further ideas to make sure that it is working. I agree broadly with what Peter said, that you cannot over-communicate in this area. Particularly I acknowledge the stretch on electoral services throughout the country, as with many other parts of the public sector.\nTracey Crouch: Okay, thank you.\nQ36 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: Can I ask about how the follow-up funding system is going to work?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Yes. I might ask Colin to come in \nin\n a moment, but there are two aspects to this. There is the formula, where we have asked people to make representations as to their specific area. I think you are talking about the challenge from the £4.2 million for—\nQ37 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: The Electoral Commission mentioned the possibility of top-up funding for local authority areas that needed extra resources.\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Yes.\nMr Chope: I just wondered how it was going to work.\nColin Dingwall: Shall I come in on that? The allocations that went out at the end of October are based on a national funding formula. We took the view that we had to keep it as simple as possible, to be as transparent as we could be about the funding given to local authorities, but we acknowledged in doing that that there will be a whole host of circumstances in areas that have very large rural areas, lots of second homes, large numbers of students, particular circumstances in those areas that will bring extra cost. Because of that, we have set aside money in our programme budget for local authorities to bid for additional funding based on what they think they need. Now, over the course of this month, we will be telling local authorities how they can make a bid for that, but what we have already been doing on the back of the allocations that went out at the end of October is that we have said to authorities, “Look, if you are concerned about the amount you have been given, please just talk to us. Talk to the regional delivery manager, talk to us, tell us what you are concerned about and we will work with you and we will help you create the funding bid and submit it to us”.\nQ38 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: As a result of all that, will all the local authorities have all the funding that they think they need?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: I am confident we can work with them to get them enough funding, yes.\nQ39 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: So there will not be any complaints from local \nauthorities\n later saying, “We could have done it if we had been properly funded”?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: There are two elements to this. First, a number have been in touch with us to say, “Look, we think we need more” and we will work with them until we reach a point where we think we have identified what the real cost is, hopefully to their satisfaction and our satisfaction. During the course of the transition here, things may happen and we have contingency as well, so that if there are additional costs not anticipated, at the end of the year, we can look at them and say, “Did this cost more than we expected?” as well. As well as giving people the upfront amount and the bid formula, there is also contingency money for people to bid for extra amounts that come up during the course of the transition.\nQ40 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: What contingency plans do you have in place if the IT systems do not deliver as you hope they will?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: We have contingency plans through the programme at both technical and manual levels, so in terms of the ongoing verification system, there are provisions where you can verify at DWP, if need be, so if anything happens in the January to March period, there are workarounds in that respect.\nThroughout the programme, we have also taken legal powers, where EROs can use alternative means of verification—driving licence, passport and so forth—and of course there is a carry-forward provision on ensuring that people already on the register do not drop off if, for whatever reason, several layers of safeguards do not work.\n&#xa0;\nQ41 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: Will these systems be able to cope with the volume of registration, which is quite likely to be very significant?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Yes. Because of the confirmation system that we have already tested, that is where the bulk of the volume comes in. That is where 78% or so of the electors will be \npassported\n or parachuted on to the new system and we know, because we have tested that fully and it is something that has been reported on by the Commission, that that works. So the rest of it, we are testing at volume, we will be testing right the way through up until March, around the volumes and we will report back at the end of that, but we will be testing that fully and thoroughly.\nQ42 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: So by way of an example, when your systems are in place, will you be able to tell whether somebody who is on the register has a foreign nationality perhaps and is therefore ineligible to vote?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: That is not part of the test we are doing with DWP. There are existing duties on electoral registration officers to check applications and request further information from people they have cause to question whether they are making a valid application, but there is not going to be an automatic test of that information.\nQ43 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: So we could still have a situation where people get on the register because they have a National Insurance number, but they are foreign nationals and they are not entitled to vote or in fact \nbe\n on the register?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: The National Insurance number is about providing evidence to the ERO that the person is indeed a legitimate person and that they do indeed exist. The other duties that the ERO has still apply in relation to them making a judgment about, “Do I have any suspicions about whether this person is indeed eligible to go on the electoral register?” The National Insurance number check is purely about giving them evidence in order to make a determination to add them to the register, based on them being a real person.\nQ44 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: It would be quite clear to people that just because the data-matching has enabled them to be confirmed on the register, they still have a separate obligation to make sure that they are entitled to vote?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: That is part of the EROs’ existing duties and that is not going to change. They will still be obliged to carry out the tests they currently carry out.\nQ45 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: But to what information are they going have access to enable them to carry out that test, because if you are an ERO and you have a register, how do you know from looking at that register who is a British national entitled to vote and who is not?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: They are entitled to request further information from individuals. I know that EROs hold registration reviews where they invite people to come in, they have an interview with \nthem, \nthey\n invite them to provide evidence of who they are. They are entitled to ask for evidence of nationality. There is a whole range of different things they are entitled to ask for. What there is not is a systematic way where unambiguously every single person in the country can be required to provide something they can test against a list to tell them if they are eligible. That does not exist.\nQ46 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: There is no requirement on EROs to carry out all those extra tests?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: There is a general duty on them to assure themselves, but no, not to audit, if you like, every individual elector on nationality or other grounds. That is the situation now and that is the situation in the future.\nQ47 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: Wouldn’t this all be made much easier if the DWP collected data about nationality when people apply for National Insurance numbers?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: I cannot speak for DWP. I believe they have begun collecting that information, but it is not a complete record, so one of the reasons why we do not have that functionality is because if you made it a requirement for somebody to give their nationality to DWP, you would have incomplete information to make that judgment, so it would not be appropriate for an ERO to make a judgment based on that information.\nQ48 &#xa0; \nMr Turner: You said they have a general duty. How many times is it given? Is it made specific, in other words, that people are questioned about their eligibility?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: Do you want me to come in? I do not know off the top of my head. We can find out if there is any information we can share with the Committee about how that is applied. All I can say is anecdotally I know from the conversations I have with electoral service managers, they say, “A number of cases, I have invited people in and I have done this and I have asked these questions” so I know that individual electoral service managers do pursue this and do take that duty seriously, but I am afraid I do not have any systematic information.\nCiaran Martin: I think it comes back to something the Chief Executive of the Commission said. This is a locally-run electoral registration system with the duty at local level to each ERO to satisfy him or herself that they have fulfilled their duties to get as good a register, a complete and accurate a register as possible. In this programme to change the basis of those registers from household to individual, we are not changing that, so the duty about completeness and accuracy of individual registers still falls on EROs, with a significant discretion as to how they discharge that duty. It falls to each individual ERO.\nQ49 &#xa0; \nChair: Piers, anything to throw in on the digital project stuff?\n&#xa0;\nPiers Harris: I think you have both covered it quite well. There is a lot of work to do. I feel that our plans are robust, both to get the development done and for testing as well. Obviously we have a large-scale test plan for March, but we are continually testing from now until then and the lion’s share of the testing. Obviously the system has different elements to it and you can test things individually or you plug them all together and test end to end, and all the elements will have been well-tested before we get to March and then we plug the whole thing together and test it end to end. I am not denying the amount of work we have to do but I have quite a high level of confidence.\nQ50 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: You have referred a number of times to the confirmation dry run. Given the variation in match rates and different areas, is there any work on assessment of reasons for that, and in turn, what resources are being targeted at areas with low match rates?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: There is a lot of work going on analysing the variation and I think it will have confirmed quite a lot of what you have heard from the Commission. This is all publicly available \ndata, but if we can give it to the Committee in a more helpful way, we will, but looking at the bottom 20 match rates in front of me, London boroughs with high rates of turnover in the private rental market, big university towns, they are all there, so those areas of high rates of house-moving and students are jumping out at you as areas that require attention. There are also areas where we can work with local authorities individually, as we are. We have direct bilateral engagement with many of them on what they can do with locally-held data because this is a problem for them under the existing system and therefore they have devised ways, and through the legal powers they have taken on, we have hopefully assisted this process of enabling them to think about ways of dealing with a more fast-moving population. I think given the likely success of the confirmation dry run and the overall programme budget, frankly strategically what we are now doing is focusing the money as far as we can on those harder to reach groups and areas, while making sure obviously through the formula that every area has enough. Anything you want to add on that?\nColin Dingwall: No, I think that sums it up nicely.\nQ51 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: You mentioned earlier that it is obviously a responsibility at a local level. Is there any question of performance or capacity at a local level being an issue in these variations?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: There will be and there is some way to go. As Peter Wardle mentioned, we have a programme board that meets monthly and a staple of those discussions is local reports, trying to identify areas where either geographically or thematically that might need attention. That is the purpose of the regional ERO manager network that we have set up. The Electoral Commission have their own global, if you like, covering all aspects of the electoral system performance and standards. We do discuss and try to address things where typically a \nLondon\n borough will have a larger electorate management services function working for it, but will have a tougher task trying to keep track of people. In many rural authorities, the problem will be not so much a fluid population, because the population is going to be fairly static, but it will be capacity, just having a very small electoral registration function. We try to deal with all of those as best we can. We try to give guidance that is as flexible as possible and provide whatever support we can.\nQ52 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: So July 2014, EROs are meant to send out these letters to everybody telling them what it means and what it means for them. The Electoral Commission are saying there must be no slip-up on that and we have heard the emphasis on communication this morning. Are you confident there will be no slip-up on that?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: We take the point that it is very important to get those letters out in July. We hope that—\nQ53 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: Is July the best time?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: The Electoral Commission have said, “Do not do it in August” and we take that very seriously. We hope to get them out as quickly as possible, and of course the Commission have said they want it in an intensive period to maximise the effectiveness of it. Based on the dry run that I keep talking about, with apologies, existing electors will be getting letters saying, “You do not need to do anything”. So we know that if there are other challenges—and I do not particularly want to speculate as to what might go wrong—we would have to think very seriously. We have, on the record, a very strong warning from the Commission not to decide, “Let’s slip this into August” and that is something that we would have to take very seriously.\nQ54 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: The Electoral Commission has recommended data-sharing between upper and lower-tier authorities. When can the plans for that be clarified?\nColin Dingwall: We are currently working that issue through with Ministers and hopefully very soon we will be able to say what the position is on that, so that is still outstanding, but we hope to resolve that shortly.\nQ55 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: Beyond that on data-sharing, the fact is we are talking about this, about EROs and local authorities, but the reality is that electoral services is a very significant market. EROs are procuring services, local authorities are \nhaving\n to buy in services when it comes to running postal voting, running all sorts of things. How sure are you that the data formatting is compatible as to make sure that that market is able to operate fairly, because it has not always operated fairly to date?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: We work very closely with all the suppliers who are in the market and there have been new entrants in recent years. There have been people who have exited that market in recent years and we work—\nMark Durkan: Yes, take them out.\nColin Dingwall: We work with whoever is in the market, essentially, so we are neutral about that and the way that we are doing the digital development—and Piers may want to assist me on any technicalities of this—it is to try to ensure that the code is available to anybody who wants to come in and enter into the new system. It is not designed to be \nproprietorial\n, based on those suppliers. Sorry, correct me if I—\nPiers Harris: Which bit are you talking about?\nColin Dingwall: So this is the integration of a new supplier into the digital service.\nPiers Harris: Oh right, of course. Yes, so if somebody new came in the market, could they join in?\nColin Dingwall: Yes.\nPiers Harris: Yes. The API would have to be made available to them to connect to the system and we have a specification for how a system interacts with the digital services, and so yes, if a new supplier came along, they could be accommodated.\nQ56 &#xa0; \nMark Durkan: So people are not going to be told by EROs in future, “We would love to give you the contract, but unfortunately somebody else is telling us they will not let us into the dataset”?\n&#xa0;\nPiers Harris: No. If you are talking about a new entrant into the EMS—which is the Electoral Management System—that they run at the local authority level, for them to build a product, it has to work with IER obviously, so part of their initial product build and design and so on would be integrated with the digital service.\nQ57 &#xa0; \nChair: You did mention, \nCiaran\n, that one of the groups who \nregister\n least on the electoral register are students. Are there any particular things that you are doing to try to ensure resources are targeted at those areas to ensure a higher rate of registration?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: Yes, certainly in terms of maximising registration from the £4.2 million in this financial year that we have announced, £400,000 of it has already been allocated, and of the remaining £3.8 million we would expect a good chunk of it to be targeted at areas with high degrees of students. We are working with student groups; we are working with local authorities in areas where there are high levels of student population. It is a major priority over the next year to hone in on those areas and it will be a key aspect of the public awareness campaign. We are working on primarily the Electoral Commission’s lead, but clearly we have an interest. It is going to be a hugely important issue for us, already is.\nColin Dingwall: Just to add as well to that, we have set up a student forum involving the local authorities who have high student populations and the National Union of Students, representatives of university bodies. The Commission are involved in that as well to try to identify what ideas, approaches, best practice can be disseminated to try to help people learn from each other. So we are trying to support the community to help itself as well.\nQ58 &#xa0; \nChair: The ability to register online presumably will be a boon?\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: We hope so. We have the second version of that and I know that the Committee were offered a demonstration, those who were on it at the time of the first iteration. Very happy to offer you a demonstration of the next version if any of you would like it so you can see, maybe bring some student constituents with you and see how they found it, but we are doing extensive user testing of it as well.\nChair: Okay. I think I have played to the gallery enough. I will ask Fabian if there are any final comments.\nQ59 &#xa0; \nFabian Hamilton: A number of thoughts: we have looked and you have explained why there might be very low registration. We have talked about students, as the Chair mentioned, and also the high turnover in inner city/urban areas, high turnover of populations. I wonder whether you have looked at wards like, for example, Manor in \nMansfield\n—not an area I know—where the match rate was 92.6% and looked at what good practice is there. Clearly something is going right, either it is very small or it is very stable. Have you looked at the factors that make for a very, very high match rate rather than just the low match rate and learnt lessons from that?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: There is detailed work going on. I cannot speak exactly for if the Commission will be looking at \nMansfield\n, that particular ward. I know that there is ward level analysis still going on in the Commission, including regression testing, to find out why outcomes were as they were. The characteristics of areas with high match rates and areas with lower match rates seem reasonably clear in terms of population turnover, high population turnover causing lower match rates; the opposite is true. Type of housing tenure appears significant as well, so it is not just a question of rented, it is whether it is privately rented versus local authority rented is a significant factor as well. I do not know that particular ward either myself, but I am assuming it will have many of the characteristics.\nQ60 &#xa0; \nFabian Hamilton: But \nMansfield\n itself has an 86.4% match rate—\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: That is right, yes. It is the top—\nFabian Hamilton: —so clearly that ward reflects the best practice in a best practice area.\nColin Dingwall: Or the demography of the area is consistent with other areas, so towns of that size, settled population tend to have a similarly high match rate.\nQ61 &#xa0; \nFabian Hamilton: Can I make a suggestion though on the student registration? When students arrive at university, they have to register for their courses. Would it not be easy to ask them to register at the same time for voting?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: I believe this is one of the issues that \nhas\n been raised in the student forum. I am afraid I cannot report on the technicality and other compliance issues around that, but I know that question has been raised and that some of the university authorities and universities are discussing how they can align the process of student registration, but at the moment, I am afraid I do not have anything to report on whether or not that is technically feasible. But I know the question has been \nasked and that conversations are taking place between universities and local authorities \nabout\n the practicalities of that.\nCiaran Martin: If it would help, we would be very happy to put that to this group explicitly and just ask them when they have concluded their deliberations. I cannot commit to a very quick timescale, but just to give you the assessment of feasibility.\nQ62 &#xa0; \nFabian Hamilton: It just seems to make sense, that given that they have to register anyway, that extra registration with the university authorities’ collaboration would perhaps increase registration rates generally.\n&#xa0;\nCiaran Martin: There is clearly an obvious case for looking at it, as you suggest. We are looking at it. When you dig beneath, there are always some technical complexities and the assessment will be whether there are sufficient not to proceed with what is clearly quite a good idea. So we will complete the assessment and send it to you.\nQ63 &#xa0; \nFabian Hamilton: Finally, Chair, we have discussed National Insurance numbers. Is it true or can you comment on the fact that one of the reasons National Insurance numbers are not used more generally—we will not talk about immigration, but in electoral registration terms—is because the DWP charges other Government departments for the use of that data?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: We are meeting DWP’s costs for this, so we are financing the people who work within the DWP data centre.\nFabian Hamilton: That is not what I meant.\nColin Dingwall: We have not been charged per National Insurance number, no, but we are meeting the costs of DWP in administering the system.\nCiaran Martin: Nor have we. In terms of deciding what dataset to use, charges or otherwise by other parts of Government have not been a factor. The factor of what to use has been what would work.\nQ64 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: It can be distressing, if not embarrassing, for people during an election to find people calling on them when a member of their household has recently died. When people die, the DWP is immediately informed and does that mean that the information given to DWP on people who die will immediately be translated to the ERO so that there will be a tangible benefit from this system, which will be delivering real-time the information so that the person does not then find in their family that they are being canvassed for somebody who has already died?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: The ERO has access to the same information that DWP has access to, which is reports from the Registrar General about deaths, so they have no need to receive it from DWP in that way, so they should receive the information automatically anyway and then update the register.\nQ65 &#xa0; \nMr Chope: But if that is happening at the moment, it does not appear to be happening in practice.\n&#xa0;\nPiers Harris: When our confirmation runs do the transition, one of the fields that comes back to the ERO during the confirmation is an indicator whether DWP knows whether somebody is deceased or not, so if you have deceased while you are on the register, you will not be automatically taken over to the new register.\nCiaran Martin: But that is a one-off. In terms of your question, will this delivery system have something that automatically pings up, if you like, in an electoral registration office that proactively \ntells them to call off a house call, I am afraid I do not think that is the case. As Piers said, it will take off a number of people on the register and there will be a benefit during the confirmation in bulk as a one-off. There will be the means for the electoral registration officer to corroborate with DWP data at times of verification and canvasses and so forth, but it does not do the prompt to say someone is planning to go out on a Thursday and they should not—\nColin Dingwall: That is absolutely right. I think the point is that the basic information that DWP uses is the basic information the ERO currently has access to already and ought to be using to update their register on a monthly basis. There may be a lag in terms of the register being used by people who are door-knocking, because the register is only published and updated on a monthly basis.\nQ66 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: Just quick questions. You have outlined very clearly what you are doing to support students and ensure that they get on the electoral register, but arguably the forms are quite complex and I just wondered what you are doing to support the elderly and perhaps other vulnerable groups as well.\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: Obviously we are working very closely with the Commission on the design of forms and to come back on the conversation you had with the Commission earlier on, we are working day-to-day with the Commission team. I think these forms, when they are put to the Minister, will be a huge improvement. There are many forms that are very good already; there are many forms that could be improved significantly on what is out there, so I am pretty confident that will give a marked improvement for those groups for whom the accessibility and readability of the form is a current problem. Obviously we have had conversations through the whole process. I think you may have had evidence at an earlier stage from people like Age Concern and Scope. We talk to those groups on a regular basis and the web application is being user-tested at the moment. Part of that will be dealing with people for whom accessibility or understanding is an issue, so all these factors are going to be taken into account as part of the user-testing for how an application is made.\nQ67 &#xa0; \nTracey Crouch: But you appreciate that online registration will not be necessarily appropriate, particularly for more elderly members of society?\n&#xa0;\nColin Dingwall: Potentially not, but interestingly, RNIB, for example, said to us, “Online registration, fantastic” and the chap who I met brought out his \niPad\n and showed me exactly how it worked for him, so there are groups for whom this will help; there are other groups for whom it will be more of a challenge.\n              Chair: \nCiaran\n, Colin, Piers, thank you very much for coming today. Thank you to the Cabinet Office for the seriousness with which you are treating this subject. The franchise has been hard-won in this country for all people and we should do everything humanly possible to ensure that everybody registers and everybody participates in our democracy, not least in an era of falling turnouts, so we appreciate the work you do and more power to your elbow. Thank you for com\ning this morning.\n              \nOral evidence: Readiness for Individual Electoral Registration, HC 796\n              \n12\n&#xa0;\n"
