"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Electrical Safety Roundtable (BRC 41)&#xa0;SummaryThe Electrical Safety Roundtable (ESR) was initially formed in response to widespread concern over poor promotion of competent registered electricians\n and a lack of Building Regulation enforcement. It is run by and independent secretariat has four board members and is chaired by Chris Bielby, Chair of Trustees at the Gas Safety Trust.  The group works collaboratively with industry and other relevant interested stakeholders to improve electrical safety in the home. \n&#xa0;\nThe ESR notes that whilst awareness of the Building Regulations and Competent Person Schemes has been historically low, improving enforcement of building regulations and simplifying the message to consumers of the benefits of using a Competent, Registered Electrician is the best approach to improving this. \n&#xa0;\nHistorically, the standards required of competent electricians have varied. The ESR believes that this will be remedied to a significant degree by the new DCLG conditions of authorisation that all CPS providers must adhere to by June 2014 which include compliance with EAS 2012 standards, which have been revised and improved compared to the 2010 ones. However, we also note the current inadequacy of the specification’s emphasis on competent \nenterprises \nrather than individuals. \nThe ESR is of the view that requiring all electricians carrying out notifiable work under the Building Regulations to demonstrate their competence individually would improve levels of safety, as is the case in Ireland.\n&#xa0;\nDCLG currently sets strict, uniform terms for all Competent Person Scheme providers\n and t\nhere is evidence of the positive impact of competition between CPS providers (EC Harris Report 2012)\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nThe ESR believes that better promotion of competent, registered electricians is vital to improving levels of consumer awareness and therefore safety. It \nsupports the idea of \na single consumer facing register, fed into by all electrical Competent Person Scheme providers to retain the positive aspects of competition.\n&#xa0;\nThe ESR considers that the issue of DCLG supervision has already been addressed; from June 2014, the responsibility for scheme supervision will transfer to UKAS and all scheme providers will be required to achieve/maintain UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN ISO/IEC 17065:2012 by that date.\n As a minimum, UKAS has committed to conducting surveillance of CPS providers annually and ensuring they are fully\n r\ne-assessed every fourth year.\n \n&#xa0;Section 1Background to the Electrical Safety Roundtable1.1\n&#xa0; \nThe Electrical Safety Roundtable was formed in response to widespread concern over poor promotion of competent registered electricians and a lack of Building Regulation enforcement. It is run by an independent secretariat; has 4 board members and is chaired by Chris Bielby, Chair of \nTrustees at the Gas Safety Trust.  The roundtable aims to work collaboratively with industry and other relevant stakeholders to improve electrical safety in the home. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0; \nCurrently signed up participants of the ESR include:\n&#xa0;\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nChief Fire Officers Association\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nStroma\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBEAMA\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBSI\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nJELF\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nMegger\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOFTEC\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNHIC\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLABC \n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNAPIT\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNAPIT Trade Association\n•\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCity and Guilds\n&#xa0;\nOther stakeholders also support the ESR by attending meetings and contributing to the work of the Group. These include the All Party Parliamentary Home Safety Group, Rospa and Trading Standards/Buy with Confidence.\n&#xa0;Section 2The committee is keen to establish the extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent persons scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations &#xa0;\n2.1 Public awareness of the Competent Person Scheme has been historically low. The Electrical Safety Council commissioned nationwide research, during the process of consultation for the recent revisions to Part P, to assess awareness of the Building Regulations. It found that only 20 per cent of respondents had heard of Part P of the Building Regulations. Moreover, only 25 per cent were aware of the need to notify major electrical installation work to the Local Authority Building Control.\n The recent findings of an ElectricSafe survey campaign suggest the figure for recognition of Competent Person Schemes may even be lower, with only 18.71 per cent of 668 respondents saying they had heard of them. \n&#xa0;\n2.2 This may be the result of a number of influencing factors, including:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.3   \n \nThe ESR does not support the reduction in the number of notifiable areas in PART P, especially due to the increased risk to safety due to the proximity of water in kitchens and outdoor areas remains. The ESR is also concerned about the confusion which is caused to both installers and consumers due to the different requirements in England and Wales.\n2.4 Public awareness of the competent persons scheme and of the need to review and certify certain domestic work would be improved by having one register, where householders can find a competent\n registered electrician.  All CPS providers would need to feed into this one register and advertise it in order for this approach to be effective. \n&#xa0;\nSection 3 The Committee is keen to establish the extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills. &#xa0;Adequacy of training3.1 Levels of training and/or experience required for CPS registration have historically varied widely. However the ESR is confident that this variation is currently being addressed. In the DCLG conditions of authorisation 2012, CPS providers for the electrical industry must comply with the Electrotechnical Assessment Specification, which are the minimum technical competencies (MTC’s).\n Competent Person Scheme providers are required to meet this minimum standard of entry by June 2014. There are a number of different routes to competency that satisfy this specification, all of which require significant knowledge and understanding of current requirements for electrical installations and evidence of work carried out that demonstrates competency in the scope of electrical work for which they have applied.\n  The ESR believe that CPS policing of the experience and training requirements set out in this document, combined with proper UKAS supervision, will improve on any previous inadequacies.\n&#xa0;\n3.2 There have also been recent efforts within the industry to further tighten certain routes to competency through the EAS standards e.g. those applying to a CPS provider having undertaken  a 5 day training course for example, must also provide evidence to demonstrate 2 years of appropriate experience. (See appendix 4a- option 4, EAS 2012)\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3 It is important that the cost involved for an electrician to be deemed competent is minimised- this is one of the reasons why having a number of certification bodies is essential- however the level of safety afforded to the householder is paramount.\n&#xa0;Individual Competence3.4 The Electrotechnical Assessment Specification is an industry specific guide to the Minimum Technical Competencies required under DCLG conditions of authorisation. It was put together by bodies representing electrical installation industry and consumer safety interests in order to enhance the standard of safety of \nElectrical installation work.\n \nT\nhe ESR is concerned that the interpretation of BS EN 45011, set out in the EAS, includes the understanding that these competency requirements apply to \nenterprises\n as opposed to individuals. This means scheme providers are currently only obligated to ensure and assess the competence of one individual in each company, the Qualified Supervisor (QS).\n&#xa0;\n3.5 This individual is able to sign off the work of the other electricians working for the registered enterprise, which may or may not have demonstrated an equivalent level of competence. \nThe current conditions of authorisation for scheme providers state that the scheme providers “shall, under a risk-based approach, undertake a minimum of one on-site inspection of each \nmember’s\n work every three years.” But the current interpretation iterated above means that the member is currently defined as the enterprise rather than the individual by the majority of CPS providers, in other words, regular assessments and satisfaction of initial entry criteria are only required of the \nQualified Supervisor\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.6 One competent, registered electrician being able to sign off the work of those who may not have demonstrated their competence has the potential to be dangerous. This is especially true if the Qualified Supervisor does not inspect the job during and after completion, or signs off work as compliant without actually checking it; which has been known to happen. One way to improve that system would be to ensure that the QS being assessed was able to provide not only the names of his/her operatives but original copies of their qualification certificates and copies of the calibration certificates of their test equipment.\n&#xa0;\n3.7 The ESR believes that requiring each electrician, carrying out work which is notifiable to building regulations, within a registered company to be assessed to verify their ongoing competency would be another way to improve on this model.  \n&#xa0;Section 4The committee is keen to establish the extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations.4.1 As highlighted in 3.5 above, the QS model could in some instances mean that some employees of registered companies may be carrying out electrical works to which the Building Regulations apply \nwithout having had regular assessments to ensure their work meets the requirements of these regulations.  \n&#xa0;\n4.2 The ESR is of the view that requiring all electricians carrying out notifiable work under the Building Regulations to demonstrate their competence individually would improve levels of safety as is the case in Ireland.\n&#xa0;\n4.3 As stated above Competent Person Scheme providers may have slightly different policies and procedures. However, from June 2014, they must all “under a risk-based approach, undertake a minimum of one on-site inspection of each member’s work every three years” in line with DCLG’s conditions of authorisation.\n An example of what an inspector would ask to see during this assessment would be a minimum of two new circuits, recently completed by the electrician. \n&#xa0;Section 5The committee is keen to establish the effect of competition between accreditation bodies, and the two separate registers of electricians, on the standards of review of domestic electrical work Competent Person Schemes5.1 It has been highlighted in a report, published during the 2012 review of Part P of the Building Regulations, that the competition between scheme providers has had a positive impact on the cost to electricians who opt to join.\n&#xa0;\n5.2 The report, compiled by EC Harris on behalf of DCLG, noted on page 9 : \n“The  cost  to  contractors  of  participation  in  a  Competent  Persons  Scheme appears to  have been overestimated.  This seems to be due to competition between the various schemes (NICEIC, NAPIT etc).”\n&#xa0;Electricians Registers 5.3 Both registers exist to promote electricians that are assessed regularly in compliance with the standards set out in the DCLG’s conditions of authorisation.  \n&#xa0;\n5.4 The two registers impact on these standards seems only to be the promotion of competent, registered electricians to householders.\n&#xa0;\n5.5 The ESR is of the opinion that better promotion of competent, registered electricians is vital to improving levels of consumer awareness and therefore safety. We propose that a single register, fed into by all electrical Competent Person Scheme providers to retain the positive aspects of competition would represent the best conclusion to this debate for all concerned. \n&#xa0;Section 6The committee is keen to establish the adequacy of the supervision by DCLG of the accreditation schemes. 6.1 This point is being addressed via t\nhe Governments response\n \nto\n \nrecommendation 8 of the\n Communities and Local Government Select Committee Report: Building Regulations applying to electrical and gas installation and repairs in dwellings\n (July 2012) – a recommendation that current arrangements need greater independent supervision to offset the pressures to compromise safety standards –\n stated:\n&#xa0;\n“The Government accepts this recommendation. There are nine [sic - currently 7] Competent Person Schemes authorised for Part P of the Building Regulations. It is true that most of the income of the scheme providers comes from fees levied on installers registered with the schemes. The Department has recently published new conditions of authorisation for competent person self-certification schemes.\n \n6.2 Therefore, the Government has already accepted that DCLG may not be best placed to supervise the schemes adequately and, as the scheme providers are currently in a transition period to complying with UKAS requirements, are doing something to rectify this.\n&#xa0;\n6.3 The implications of this change are that, from June 2014, the responsibility for scheme supervision will transfer to UKAS and all scheme providers will be required to achieve and maintain UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN ISO/IEC 17065:2012 by that date.\n As a minimum, UKAS has committed to conducting surveillance of CPS providers annually and ensuring they are fully\n r\ne-assessed every fourth year.\n The ESR understands that all CPS providers should currently either have gained or be in the process of gaining UKAS accreditation under DCLGs current Conditions of Authorisation. \n&#xa0;\n6.4 The ESR supports this change, and hopes that it will result in improved supervision of CPS providers.\n&#xa0;\nPlease note this response reflects the agreed views of the group but may not necessarily reflect the views of individual members.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n \nWhere this document uses the term “electrician”  this refers to a “Registered Installer” as defined by DCLG.\n http://www.safeelectric.ie/\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n \n \nEC Harris (\nJanuary 2012).,\n Economic and analytical support for impact assessment of proposals to amend the Building Regulations in 2013\n, \nDepartment for Communities and Local Government\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n UKAS Agreement (p2, 1.5) \nhttp://www.ukas.com/about-accreditation/apply-for-accreditation/accreditation-category-forms.asp\n \n Electrical Safety Council consultation response \non the Government’s proposed changes to Part P of the Building Regulations\n \nhttp://ow.ly/qavbF\n \n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n \nhttp://www.lv.com/about-us/press-media/article/unauthorised-building-works\n \nEC Harris (\nJanuary 2012)\n,\n Economic and analytical support for impact assessment of proposals to amend the Building Regulations in 2013\n, \nDepartment for Communities and Local Government\n \n \nI\nET (October 2012)., ELECTROTECHNICAL \nASSESSMENT \nSPECIFICATION FOR USE BY \nCERTIFICATION \nAND \nREGISTRATION BODIES \npp 14-27\n I\nET (October 2012)., ELECTROTECHNICAL \nASSESSMENT \nSPECIFICATION FOR USE BY \nCERTIFICATION \nAND \nREGISTRATION BODIES\n,\n \nAppendix 4 p18\n \nhttp://electrical.theiet.org/building-regulations/eas/index.cfm\n \n \nhttp://www.safeelectric.ie/\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-sche\nm\nes\n \nEC Harris (\nJanuary 2012)\n.,\n Economic and analytical support for impact assessment of proposals to amend the Building Regulations in 2013\n, \nDepartment for Communities and Local Government\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n \nCommunities and Local Government., BUILDING REGULATIONS: COMPETENT PERSON SELF-CERTIFICATION SCHEMES - CONDITIONS OF AUTHORISATION FROM 6 JUNE 2012 \nhttps://www.gov.uk/building-regulations-competent-person-schemes\n UKAS Agreement (p2, 1.5) \nhttp://www.ukas.com/about-accreditation/apply-for-accreditation/accreditation-category-forms.asp\n \n"
