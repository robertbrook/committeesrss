[normal]Further written evidence from Dave Holladay (CYS0102)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]My name is Dave Holladay I have been involved in transport and cycling since the age of 12 when I began a delivery round using a bicycle, and riding widely around London &amp; Home Counties.  I have followed a career in engineering and transport, working 
[normal]variously for British Rail, Sustrans and CTC over a period of 38 years. I now work as an independent integrated transport specialist.  My main modes of transport are on foot, cycle, and train, although I have held a driving licence since 1970, and driven a
[normal] variety of vehicles including motorcycles, and towed trailers
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to my earlier submission I would like to highlight some other agencies whose approaches to crashes and incidents ijn places other then the workplace, and the agency charged with re
[normal]gulation of the use of large goods vehicles and the prevention of harm through that use..
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Government Agency which could ’prevent harm’[bold]  the 
[normal]Traffic Commissioners[bold] act as the regulators of both drivers and operators of the vehicles which you are investi
[normal]gating with regard to cyclist and pedestrian deaths and serious injuries.  The Commissioners have powers to revoke the vocational licences of drivers who fail the test of having good repute, and even enforcing a complete ban on driving. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However their abi
[normal]lity to gather and respond to the intelligence available is hampered by the lack of a formal conduit which can feed information on driver behaviour back to the Traffic Area Offices. Discussing this with 
[normal]Nick Denton[bold] (Commissioner for the Metropolitan &amp; Sout
[normal]heastern Area) he highlighted that his Scottish counterpart 
[normal]Joan Aitken[bold] had a Memorandum of Understanding with Police Scotland to get all traffic offences committed by drivers with C, D, E licences reported automatically to her office. The English and Wels
[normal]h Commissioners are apparently unable to do likewise because of the 43 separate Police Authroities they need to get a common agreement with.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With such powers we might have saved 
[normal]Catriona Patel[bold]’s life by removing the Class C licence from 
[normal]Denis Putz[bold] who had
[normal] a litany of driving bans and serious traffic offences to his name well before he killed her when driving drunk and using a mobile phone. We might even have picked up on the poor driving of 
[normal]Darren Foster[bold] before he killed 
[normal]Hope Fennell [bold]and we hope that the r
[normal]estoration of his C1 standard licence does not automatically see the C licence restored, without a formal review of his fitness to hold that class of licence.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Commissioners can also call in operators who fail the conditions of good repute as well as 
[normal]the set criteria for management of their operations, if they get appropriate recognition and support in this work, but tellingly it is the restricted licence operators who are reported to be a prevailing feature of disciplinary hearings. These operators, c
[normal]arrying only their own goods, are exempt from the requirement to have a qualified transport manager, and various other provisions placed on domestic and international operators. Many waste management operators are operating with restricted licences, a deta
[normal]il highlighted by Jack Semple of RHA in his evidence to the Committee. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]There are also vehicles which weigh up to 40 tons that require no operator’s licence nor a driver with more than a car licence, and have no limits on drivers hours. many are classed a
[normal]s ’plant’ and can often be used on the road with duty-exempt ’red’ diesel. An example is here http://www.utranazz.com/Portals/0/files/Kimera-K55-batching-plant-
[normal]brochure.pdf .   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]I believe that it would be useful to 
[normal]call in[bold] and hear from the 
[normal]Traffic Commis[bold]sioners[bold] on how they can act to regulate the use of HGV’s and deliver their objective to ’prevent harm’ from the operation of commercial vehicles.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Investigation of Rail Crashes (Rail Accident Investigation Branch). [bold]This system delivers an non judgement
[normal]al report, which is transparently available in the public domain. The reports list the sequence of events, and their outcomes, and quantify the details of the vehicles, and people involved and the various site measurements, followed by an analysis of the c
[normal]ausal factors and hazards relating to the incident, concluding with a list of recommendations to prevent a recurrence.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]10[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It doesn’t always deliver perfectly – notably the issue of single lead junctions, where a crash at Bellgrove in Glasgow was followed 2 y
[normal]ears later by a similar crash at Newton before the need to provide a more positive measures, or eliminate the arrangement at the junctions where it had been designed in.  However the road crash equivalent is just not of a matching standard.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]11[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A road crash m
[normal]ay be investigated by Police or an Insurer but these reports are not automatically published, and will generally have the objective of identifying one or more of the parties involved in the crash as being liable for prosecution or providing recompense to o
[normal]thers who suffer loss or injury.  There is no clear setting out of the hazard(s) at the root of the crash, and the risk management (or failure of the risk management systems) that played their part in the crash under investigation. There is no clearly spel
[normal]led out action to prevent recurrence of the same type of crash, which a roads authority should consider for implementation.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]12[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As a result of this even a brief trawl of incidents that were known to me, over the past 13 years, brought up 2 examples of where a
[normal] basic hazard as not been eliminated, and risk management regimes are clearly inadequate
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]13[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Example 1) the left turn from the offside lane across ALL traffic travelling in the nearside lane – from a brief check in minimal detail 5 identical circumstances whe
[normal]re for keeping speed up or the basic lack of space the truck or bus/coach driver has made a left turn from a traffic lane designated for vehicles travelling straight ahead. In only one case I have checked was action taken to remove the hazard (Ellie Carey 
[normal]– killed December 2011, and as a result, HGV left turns banned between Tower Bridge Road and Abbey Street)
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Of the 6 deaths in November both Richard Muzira and Francis Golding died when a truck driver approached the junction in an offside lane and cut across the nearside lane, more tellingly, the death of Francis Golding was a repeat of the death of Wan-Chen McG
[normal]uinness almost exactly 5 years earlier with a large truck making the same left turn from Vernon Place in to Southampton Row from a lane over to the right hand side – signed for travelling straight ahead. Two fatalities, and potentially other near misses I’
[normal]ve yet to uncover shout that the large vehicles should not be permitted to make left turns at this junction, in its present layout.  Large vehicles should be sent round via High Holborn, where the space to make wider turns is available, make their Northbou
[normal]nd turn at 
[normal]Tottenham Court Road, or the junction made suitable for large vehicles turning from the left turn lane.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]This hazard exists at many junctions across London, and the move for improving cyclist and pedestrian safety has to be a review of places 
[normal]where the potential hazard exists, and a risk management plan for each individual location drawing on known crash reports, the conditions in which large vehicles attempt this manoeuvre, and the practical options for modifying the junction geometry, or dive
[normal]rting left turning large vehicles via a safer route. I would also hope that delivery of published crash investigation reports would  highlight those locations where the greatest risk and greatest urgency for action exists in this respect.   
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]16[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Example 2) Bo
[normal]w roundabout. An analysis of the hazards on the CS2 route here will show that 
[normal]100% of the motor vehicle traffic[bold] circulating on this roundabout 
[normal]WILL drive through the path of any cyclists[bold] using CS2 as this traffic joins or leaves the A12. From observation a
[normal]round 80%, and possibly more of the motor traffic travelling on the East-West axis uses the roundabout to join or leave the A12.  Managing the risk of this motor traffic colliding with a cyclist relies entirely on the human factor detail of compliance with
[normal] the instructions given by traffic signs and signals.  There is no fail to safe position whereby the failure to observe a signal or sign by either a driver or cyclist does not create an inevitable crash, or near miss incident.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]17[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]By contrast TfL’s own survey
[normal] shows that around 60% of the cycle traffic actually goes over the flyover where there is almost a 0% potential for the hazard of a motor vehicle turning through the path taken by a cyclist. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]18[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The type of report required is very much set to the same templa
[normal]te as used by RAIB, and HSE, for dangerous and fatal incidents where the locations are on the railway or the workplace.  HSE has for over a decade been highlighting the flawed situation where the employer and employee’s duties of care at work vanish when t
[normal]he workplace is on the public road.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]19[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The HSE work notes that at least a third of road crash KSI’s are liked to use of the road as a workplace and this figure is around 10% of their annual reported KSI at work incidents.  This makes the road an area where H
[normal]SE wants to deliver the safety improvements delivered on construction sites and in factories by their regime.    
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]20[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]With TfL committing almost £1bn to cycling I suggest that  a budget be included in this to deliver published and impartial investigation repo
[normal]rts into fatal and serious cyclist and pedestrian crashes, and draw on those reports to inform and deliver on effective design which;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]       identifies the hazards, 
[normal]       eliminates those hazards where possible
[normal]       provides an effective risk manageme
[normal]nt regime when the hazards cannot be    
[normal]       completely eliminated
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]21[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]To inform the Committee I would suggest that a 
[normal]representative from HSE[bold] describes their work on management of road risks in their efforts to get the safety culture of the workplace extended to embrace the use of the road as a workplace. Failing the HSE the RAIB could be invited to describe how their regime can be applied to r
[normal]oad crashes and dangerous incidents.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]22[bold]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Truck design [bold]The recent CLoCS event had an example of a tipper truck with a low level driving position which gives direct vision between those outside and inside the cab. Not only does it enhance the safety of cyclists
[normal] and pedestrians, but also the safety of drivers – falls from trucks with high cabs are a major source of driver injury – A PQ on this might be very informative. TfLcould introduce a requirement for such cab designs with a 5 year horizon in exactly the sam
[normal]e way as they already have done for emissions, and low floor accessible buses.  Mercedes and Dennis Eagle are supplying such vehicles, and they are discussing the wider adoption of low cab designs for urban trucks with SMMT and TfL. It would be useful to h
[normal]ave such input to the Inquiry·
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Truck definition[bold] – there are vehicles which look to all intents like trucks, can weigh the maximum permitted weight of a truck and yet be driven with no operators licence, by a driver with Class C1 (standard driving licence)
[normal] and no drivers hours regulation. the Committee should be aware of vehicles such as
[normal] [bold]Mobile [bold]Volumetric [bold]Batching [bold]Plant[bold] which have been noted to be pulled over at up to 25% overweight for the chassis they are being used on.  At the same time a major legislati
[normal]ve change could have serious impact on specialist firms operating such vehicles and plant in a responsible way within the current system.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Reducing ton miles[bold] [bold]Concrete mixer trucks travel relatively short distances, but tippers are often doing 70+ mile round trips and this activity cannot be shut down. Some machinery – like Tunnel Boring Machines could seize in the bore if they stop moving forward. and produce t
[normal]onnages that should be put on rail or water – we have NO serious strategy to provide railheads and wharves, and instances of promised alternatives have failed to be delivered because the co-ordination cannot be delivered for the sporadic demands of individ
[normal]ual developments. TfL say that they cannot, as a public body underwrite or operate such a transfer/consolidation  facility with public funds but we have the conundrum of being able to maintain such a facility for a few £’000 per year and the very unlikely 
[normal]position that a £2-£3m facility taking 2-3 years to deliver would be viable for each new project.  Reducing ton miles reduces risk, reduces pollution, reduces road damage. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Inviting 
[normal]TfL Freight Unit[bold] may be a useful way to give an insight into describing h
[normal]ow large volumes of building materials could be moved other than by road or 
[normal]Lynch of Brentwood[bold] who are already 
[normal]removing up to 500 trucks per day[bold] from the roads by using the river and canals in London.  The 
[normal]Rail Freight Group[bold] can equally describe how their 
[normal]facilities already reduce the number of truck trips and ton miles to depots like that at St Pancras. They can describe what is possible now and the issues which are limiting their ability to move more by rail or river, which are I believe a major stumbling
[normal] block in reducing the number of large trucks moving around in London.
