[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5. [bold]              [bold]Solution[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]The simplest and most robust solution to 
[normal]the above 
[normal]problems is to find a way to reliably and systematically 
[normal]verify the age of Users when visiting certain websites and, at the same 
[normal]time, to protect their privacy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This can be easily done using a unique code that is issued based on 
[normal]a face
[normal]-to-face and ID verification and then used regularly by Users when visiting c
[normal]ertain websites.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are suggesting utilising the 
[normal]Post Office’s 
[normal]vast network of 
[normal]branches 
[normal]across the UK to verify the age of Users so Users can generate these unique codes automatically.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. [bold]              [bold]Implementation[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]We have 
[normal]developed 
[normal]a website that enables each 
[normal]authorised Post Office employee to verify the age of any User who presents a valid ID in person.  This verification enables the User to generate a unique Code online.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]If the User would like to visit a third-party website that requires age verification, th
[normal]ey can enter this generated Code on that website. This Code will then be authenticated by our servers without revealing the name or details of the User as 
[normal]we don’t hold this information.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Therefore, third-party websites will be able to grant access to real
[normal] Users with the appropriate age, at the same time that the privacy of these Users will be protected.  Furthermore, for additional safety, Users (or their parents) will receive an email or an SMS notification each time the Code is used.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Post Office can
[normal] charge a fee for verifying the accounts of Users in a similar manner to how it processes passport applications.
