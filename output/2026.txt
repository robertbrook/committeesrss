[[[Proposals]]]1.1              All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs) and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs) should be recognised as not being parts of the ordinary roads network and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.1.2              When a local authority declines to impose a Traffic Regulation Order, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector or to a magistrate.

[[[Background and reasons]]]2.1              The National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Beauty (AONBs) of England and Wales are important assets and valuable parts of our national heritage. They contain landscape and wildlife of international importance. They are treasured for their great beauty and for the opportunities they provide for healthy outdoor leisure activities. They attract large numbers of tourists, both from this country and abroad, creating an important source of income. Many people live and work in the National Parks and the AONBs.2.2              The National Parks and AONBs require protection from activities which can damage them or interfere with the above activities. Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the core activities described above and the presence of recreational motor vehicles, mainly four-wheel drives and motor cycles, on unsealed roads and adjacent land.2.3              North Yorkshire Fell Club is a club with 46 members who participate in frequent walks in the National Parks and AONBs of northern England and Wales. We have direct experience of the damage caused by recreational off-road vehicles on unsealed roads. Serious damage is caused to the surface and ruts several feet deep are created. Drainage is adversely affected and damage progressively spreads over a wide area as the offending vehicles widen their area of activity. Eventually, walking, cycling and horse-riding on these ancient routes become impossible. Areas of the National Parks and AONBs cannot then fulfil their functions as areas for recreation. Tourists are deterred from visiting them and an important source of income is forfeited.2.4              Recreational vehicle users bring very little income into the National Parks and AONBs. They buy fuel elsewhere, drive into these sensitive areas, cause damage and leave. Noise, fumes and interference with other activities exacerbate the nuisance which they cause and act as further deterrents to legitimate leisure activities, work and tourism.2.5              Highways authorities have a responsibility to maintain many of these unsealed roads. As soon as repairs are carried out, the users of recreational vehicles resume their activities and the cycle of damage and repair begins again, at great public expense.2.6              Attempts by the National Parks and AONBs to control and eliminate this nuisance are expensive and time-consuming.2.7              This damaging and anomalous situation results from archaic laws which were developed before motor vehicles were invented. Their application in a modern situation is anomalous, damaging and expensive. By revoking legislation which is no longer of practical use, the proposals made above will clarify the responsibilities of National Parks, AONBs and highway authorities, solve a serious problem, make savings and promote economic growth.

[[[Specific advantages of the proposals]]]3.1              Environmental improvements and the prevention of serious damage to our National Parks and Areas of outstanding Natural Beauty.3.2               Reducing the work of the National Park, AONB and highway authorities in investigating legal rights, consulting interested parties, controlling damaging activities and managing repairs to damaged unsealed roads.3.3              Saving repair costs.3.4              Removing an obstacle to legitimate leisure activities such as walking, cycling and horse-riding.3.5              Encouraging economic growth in the National Parks and AONBs by removing a deterrent to tourism.
