[normal]WE SUPPORT THE CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT COMMITTEE IN THEIR CONCERN THAT THE INTERNET NEEDS TO BE A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED, FOR [bold]EVERY ONE OF US.[bold]My wife and I
[normal] write 
[normal]as mature
[normal] citizens
[normal] and active grandparents
[normal] who have considerable family responsibili
[normal]ties – towards our children, 
[normal]grandchildren
[normal] and the wider community
[normal]. 
[normal]We support the Inquiry which we believe
[normal] could lead to greater
[normal] 
[normal]prot
[normal]ection,
[normal] safety 
[normal]and co
[normal]hesiveness
[normal] 
[normal]in t
[normal]he family setting
[normal]. 
[normal]We believe there are many parents, concerned about what their children can access on the internet, who would love to have some kind of filter to protect them, even from unintentional access to 
[normal]defiling material, but don’t have the know-how to install it. By providing such protection by default, the Government will protect these vulnerable households.
[normal]We 
[normal]write as having 
[normal]participated 
[normal]in the governorship of an independent
[normal] school – Focus School, Bra
[normal]mley 
[normal]Campus
[normal] -
[normal] responsible 
[normal]for the safety and welfare of successive 
[normal]annual 
[normal]intakes of school children
[normal],
[normal] entrusted to our care by their parents and guardians
[normal].  
[normal]T
[normal]hese young people
[normal] are our future – the developing potential who will give c
[normal]haracter and strength 
[normal]to our country in oncomin
[normal]g years
[normal].
[normal]We acknowledge the tremendous advantage that young people have in being able to access the internet to tap the stores of information. They can use this positively in their education to produce intelligent responses to ques
[normal]tions in any of their subjects.
[normal] Thus they
[normal] develop intellectually and academically
[normal].
[normal] We should however 
[normal]protect them during their 
[normal]years of study so that they keep
[normal] their minds fresh and
[normal] clear
[normal] focus
[normal]ing
[normal] on academic achievement and developing into responsible adu
[normal]lts. Nothing will debilitate and detract more than 
[normal]hours of 
[normal]occupation with 
[normal]online programs which arouse
[normal] lust and 
[normal]can lead to 
[normal]impure relationships.
[normal]We write as
[normal] Christian
[normal]s, treasuring
[normal] the message of the Holy Bible
[normal] -
[normal] the word of God – it provide
[normal]s light to ou
[normal]r path and shows what’s right and what’s
[normal] wrong.
[normal] 
[normal] Two
[normal] very simple,
[normal] brief example
[normal]s
[normal] from scripture:
[normal] in his letters to Timothy,
[normal] a younger person,
[normal] the apostle Paul 
[normal]says
[normal] 
[normal]‘Keep thyself pure’ (1Tim 5 v23) and ‘B
[normal]ut youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness...
[normal]’
[normal] 
[normal](2 Tim 
[normal]2
[normal]v22)
[normal].
[normal] These injunctions 
[normal]would 
[normal]powerfully support 
[normal]the expressed concerns of the CM and S Committee.
[normal]And
[normal] then
[normal] I write as having 
[normal]some 
[normal]years of experience in Health and Safety 
[normal]at my workplace
[normal]; you
[normal] identify hazards, eliminate or reduce them and ensure 
[normal]that residual risk is managed
[normal] for the health and safety and well-being of all concerned.
[normal] The Government
[normal] has a DUTY OF CARE, expressed
[normal] 
[normal]initially in
[normal] legislation, to eliminate as far as possible the 
[normal]hazards of moral and physical corruption[bold], [bold]which are
[normal] to be fo
[normal]und on the internet.
[normal]So
[normal] 
[normal]we are 
[normal]very 
[normal]concerned about the danger lurking
[normal] only a few clicks away 
[normal]from every child 
[normal]– what 
[normal]is regarded 
[normal]as legitimate adult material is defiling and damaging
[normal], especially
[normal] to the minds and 
[normal]morals of young people
[normal] – and a very large percentage of our young have viewed such material before they have reached the age of 16
[normal]!
[normal]It is most disturbing to see that while the Government 
[normal]has legislated to protect under-
[normal]age persons from the sal
[normal]e of tobacco products, alcohol, 
[normal]dru
[normal]gs, knives etc, they are left to their own devices when exploring the internet – and less than half of parents have taken the trouble to install filters on their home IT equi
[normal]pment to protect their children!
[normal]WE FULLY SU[bold]PPORT THIS MOVE BY THE GOV[bold]T [bold]CULTURE ME[bold]DIA AND SPORT [bold]COMMITTEE TO INTRODUCE POLICY CHANGES AND TO INVEST IN RESOURCES OF A TECHNICAL NATURE[bold],[bold] AND POLICING[bold],[bold] TO REST[bold]R[bold]ICT THE TOO EASY ACCESS TO ADULT MATERIAL[bold].[bold]WE SUPPORT DEFAULT BLOCKING OF ALL ADULT CONTENT AS THE STANDARD SETTING ON ALL INTERNET [bold]ENABLED DEVICES SOLD IN THE UK TO STOP CHILDREN SEEING WHAT IS NOT SUITABLE.[bold]WE ASK FOR THE PROVISION OF BETTER AGE-VERIFICATION SOFTWARE [bold]WE SUBMIT THAT WE AS MATURE AGED PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO ACT TO PROTECT OUR YOUNGSTERS – DO NOT TAKE THE EASY OPTIO[bold]N OF [bold]ALLOWING [bold]‘FREEDOM OF CHOICE’[bold].[bold]&#xa0;
