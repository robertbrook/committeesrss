defaultUK
default is committed to reaching CO
default2
default emission targets, retaining flexibility in the energy mix, retaining a stable energy system with sufficient power margin and achieving this at the lowest cost. CCS is an important component allowing maximum use of fossil fuels. Current CO
default2
default capture technol
defaultogy gives 50% to 80% increase in cost of electricity (COE). This will result in less fossil fuel use and higher expensive renewable and nuclear components with high electricity costs requiring large subsidies in the future. It is timely to review CCS techn
defaultologies and strategy to reduce costs and increase the contribution fossil fuels can make in future.

default1.  CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY FOR FOSSIL FUEL POWER GENERATIONdefault&#xa0;default1.1  defaultCoaldefault&#xa0;defaultCurrently coal is the most widely used fossil fuel for electric power generation worldwide.  The method is almost exclusively pulverised coal combustion in steam generation boilers with condensing steam turbines. There are 3 methods for CO
default2
default capture propose
defaultd for immediate implementation.
default&#xa0;
default1.1.1default  
defaultCOdefault2default removal from flue gasesdefault&#xa0;
defaultAmine solutions are used to scrub CO
default2
default from the flue gas which has previously been treated with limestone slurry wash to reduce sulphur dioxide to about 10 ppm.  The amine solution is heat
defaulted with low pressure steam to regenerate CO
default2
default at near atmospheric pressure.  The steam is taken upstream of the final condensing steam turbine. The equipment required is very large, the regeneration steam lowers overall station efficiency by about 8 percent
defaultage points, capital costs are proving to be very high and CO
default2
default removal is typically 85% to 90%.
default&#xa0;
default1.1.2default  defaultOxy-fuel Coal Combustiondefault&#xa0;defaultPowdered coal can be burned with pure oxygen diluted with recycled flue gas so that the flame temperature is about the same as 
defaultair combustion.  The result is a boiler operating with low nitrogen and some excess oxygen plus impurities in the system. The flue gas comprises mainly CO
default2
default and water.  Following cooling and water separation, the CO
default2
default is compressed and the inert O
default2
default and N
default2
default ar
defaulte removed in a low temperature gas separation module.  The compression process results in the chemical conversion of SO
default2
default to sulphuric acid and the nitrogen oxides to nitric acid which can be removed and dealt with cheaply and efficiently. Mercury is also r
defaultemoved by reaction with nitric acid.  Oxy-fuel combustors of 50 MW capacity have been tested in the 
defaultUK
default by Doosan-Babcock.  No demonstration power station has yet been built.  Overall station efficiency is approximately the same as an amine scrub system wit
defaulth about 8 percentage points reduction.  Projected capital costs are about the same as an amine system.  CO
default2
default removal is typically 90%.  The system can be used to retrofit existing power stations having sulphur flue gas scrubbers.
default&#xa0;
default1.1.3  defaultCoal Gasificationdefault (defaultIGCC)default&#xa0;defaultPowdered coal can be converted to a fuel gas comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide (H
default2
default+CO) by partial oxidation using pure oxygen at a temperature of about 1450
defaulto
defaultC and pressures of 40 to 60 bar. Ash is removed, the fuel gas is cooled producing 
defaultsteam.  The contained CO reacts with steam over a catalyst to produce H
default2
default+CO
default2
default.  The CO
default2
default and sulphur compounds and other impurities are selectively removed in a multi-stage solvent gas scrubbing system leaving a hydrogen stream which is diluted with steam an
defaultd nitrogen and used as fuel in a gas turbine combined cycle power generation system. Gasifiers using dry coal or water-coal slurry feed  and gas purification systems are commercially available. The feature of hydrogen production and CO
default2
default removal is well pro
defaultven in commercial coal based ammonia plants.  For power generation the overall efficiency would be in the range 36% to 44%.  The plants are complex, have low availability and high capital cost.  Several plants are in operation
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.default2  Natural Gasdefault&#xa0;defaultThe natur
defaultal gas fuelled combined cycle system (NGCC) uses a gas turbine with an exhaust temperature of 500
defaulto
defaultC to 600
defaulto
defaultC producing high pressure steam in a waste heat boiler for additional power production with a condensing steam turbine. Efficiencies are 57% to 60% a
defaultnd capital costs are low.  
default&#xa0;
default1.2.1  defaultCOdefault2default Removal from Flue Gasdefault&#xa0;defaultThe CO
default2
default concentration in gas turbine exhaust is about 3%, much lower than the 12% in coal power station flue gas, but there is virtually zero SO
default2
default and low nitrogen oxides content.  The use of am
defaultine CO
default2
default scrubbing which requires low pressure steam reduces the efficiency of a typical current system from 58% to about 49% overall.  The amine systems will have high capital costs. They could be retrofitted to existing units.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.2  defaultHydrogen Productiondefault&#xa0;defaultThe conversion of natural gas to hydrogen in large capacity systems with solvent scrubbing to separate CO
default2
default is a well proven industrial operation with hundreds of systems worldwide.  It can be applied to produce fuel gas comprising hydrogen plus diluent steam and nitrogen for use in the NGCC unit. The efficiency will be in the range 44% to 48%.  Capital cost is
default increased by about 100%.
default&#xa0;
default1.2.3  defaultCarbon Dioxide Gas Turbinedefault&#xa0;defaultThe air used in a conventional gas turbine as the working fluid can be replaced by CO
default2
default when the exhaust from the steam generator is routed back to the gas turbine compressor inlet.  The natural 
defaultgas fuel is burned with pure oxygen diluted with CO
default2
default and CO
default2
default product is removed at near atmospheric pressure from the system for compression and storage.  The projected efficiency is about 45% with about 150% increase in capital cost.
default&#xa0;
default1.3default  defaultNovel Ceramic Rdefaulteactor Systemsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThese depend on the development of robust complex high temperature ceramic and metallic components.  They are in the research stage.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.1default  defaultSolid Oxide Fuel Cellsdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe generation of electricity from natural gas in a solid oxide fuel cell 
defaultoperating typically at 800
defaulto
defaultC to 1,000
defaulto
defaultC has been demonstrated and several small systems have been built.  Theoretical studies have shown the potential for integration with a gas turbine in a two stage system to give high fuel utilisation and efficiencies a
defaultbove 60% with CO
default2
default capture.  These systems require very large development efforts to perfect complex ceramic/metallic cell components.  They scale linearly in cost since the capacity of individual cells will be only a few hundred kilowatts.
default&#xa0;
default1.3.2default  defaultOxygen Idefaulton Transport Systemdefault&#xa0;defaultOxygen can be separated from compressed air by using a ceramic mixed oxide membrane system at a temperature of 800
defaulto
defaultC to 1000
defaulto
defaultC.  The membranes can be integrated with the gas turbine in an IGCC system replacing the conventional cryogeni
defaultc oxygen plant.  If the permeate side of the membrane has a fuel gas present the diffusing oxygen will react and combust the fuel.  This system is equivalent to the natural gas combustor in a conventional gas turbine, but since pure oxygen is used for comb
defaultustion, pure CO
default2
default can be separated from the combustion products.  An efficiency of 49% with 100% CO
default2
default capture has been estimated.  The problems of development of the complex high temperature combustor and heat exchange modules are severe.
default&#xa0;
default1.4default  defaultSystem with CdefaultO2 as the Working Fluiddefault&#xa0;defaultThe NET
default P
defaultower system uses CO
default2
default as the working fluid in a high pressure low pressure ratio oxy-fuel power cycle. Natural gas is burned with pure oxygen diluted with a heated recycle CO
default2
default stream. This produces a predominantly CO
default2
default strea
defaultm entering a power producing turbine at typically 300 bar and 1150
defaulto
defaultC.  The 30 bar exit stream at about 725
defaulto
defaultC is cooled in a heat exchanger providing heat for the recycle CO
default2
default stream.  A large additional heat input at less than 400
defaulto
defaultC heats the recycle CO
default2
default en
defaulttering the cold end of the heat exchanger. This heat is derived from adiabatic compressors used for compressing CO
default2
default recycle gas and air feed to the cryogenic O
default2
default plant.  The combustors are mounted within the turbine casing as in a conventional gas turbine. 
default The result is a very simple low cost compact unit with 100% pure CO
default2
default recovery available at 300 bar pressure and a current efficiency of 58%.  Natural gas will often be supplied by vaporising imported LNG.  A NET
default P
defaultower system integrated with LNG vaporisati
defaulton would have about 64% efficiency at a capacity of 2000 MW.  A coal fuelled system would use a conventional water quenched powdered coal partial oxidation reactor with ash removal producing H
default2
default+CO fuel gas which includes CO
default2
default hydrogen sulphide and all other
default impurities.  No fuel gas purification and H
default2
defaultS+CO
default2
default removal is required.  This fuel gas is used in the gas turbine combustor which burns the fuel gas to CO
default2
default and water plus oxidised impurities largely sulphur dioxide (SO
default2
default) and nitric oxide (NO).  These 
defaultimpurities are removed at the exit from the heat exchanger as condensed water containing H
default2
defaultSO
default4
default and HNO
default3
default.  The system only requires a coal gasification and ash removal system resulting in a much lower capital cost than an IGCC system.  The efficiency with 1
default00% CO
default2
default recovery at 300 bar is 52%.  
defaultThe cost of electricity from both the natural gas and coal fuelled systems is lower than the best available current power plants without COdefault2default capturedefault.  The NET Power system is under development by a consortium comprising
default 8
default 
defaultRivers Capital, Toshiba, Exelon and 
defaultCB&amp;I
default.  The system and Intellectual Property have been developed by 8
default 
defaultRivers Capital who act as consortium management.  Toshiba are responsible for the turbine and combustor system, Exelon will provide the operations s
defaultupport, CBI are the EPC contractor.  A US Gulf coast 50 MW demonstration plant detailed design has been completed and costed by 
defaultthe consortium
default plus a study for 
defaulta
default 300 MW production 
defaultcommercial 
defaultsystem.  Development work on the system continues. A second turbi
defaultne and combustor expanding from the first turbine exhaust pressure of 30 bar down to atmospheric pressure would increase the power output of 
defaulta
default 300 MW system to 700 MW with no loss in efficiency and a 30% reduction in capital cost £/Kw. This system will all
defaultow future cheap power generation with CO2 capture using a large proportion of fossil fuelled capacity in the total supply system. The NET Power system can be retrofitted to existing coal fired units.
default 
defaultThe NET Power consortium sees benefits to siting these d
defaultemonstration plants in the UK at Teeside where a site has been identified. Benefits would be faster development time and a climate in the UK geared to implementation of clean power technology now.
default&#xa0;
default2.  CONTRIBUTION OF CCS TO CO2 EMISSION TARGETSdefault&#xa0;default2.1  defaultCostdefault of Electricity (COE) and COdefault2default Emissionsdefault&#xa0;defaultAll of the current methods of carbon dioxide capture from fossil fuel power generation being considered for immediate implementation have one common feature.  They all increase the cost of electricity from 50% to 80
default%.  They all significantly increase the complexity and hence lower the reliability and availability and increase maintenance costs.  The projected capital costs for these systems are 
defaultvery poorly understood because of the lack of reference operating units a
defaultnd the inability of contractors to guarantee costs.  The 38% efficiency of a new supercritical coal power station with 85% CO
default2
default capture results in a CO
default2
default emission of about 105 gm/kWhr.  An NGCC system with 48% efficiency and 85% CO
default2
default capture emits about 60 gm
default CO
default2
default/kWhr.  Even with CO
default2
default capture, emission rates are still significant from existing technology system while the NET Power gives 100% CO2 capture.
default&#xa0;
default2.2  defaultStrategy for the Futuredefault&#xa0;defaultThe need for reliable electricity supply at affordable prices with diversity 
defaultof energy sources requires that fossil fuels continue to supply the bulk of our energy needs in the next few decades.  Current policy and currently available carbon capture technology outlined above, plus the need to drastically reduce CO
default2
default emissions, will 
defaultinevitably lead to a rapid phase-out of coal based plants and the introduction of a large number of NGCC stations to lower our overall CO
default2
default emissions.  This will be complemented by wind power and nuclear systems. This scenario exposes us to price and supply
default uncertainty for future natural gas requirements and a large expensive wind and nuclear component in our energy mix.  Even with this scenario the UK will still emit significant CO
default2
default and the overall cost of electricity will be high due in part to the large s
defaultubsidies required for wind and nuclear.  For us to meet our CO
default2
default emission objectives a significant fraction of new natural gas capacity will need to be built with CO
default2
default capture.  All the currently available systems for CO
default2
default capture still result in significant CO
default2
default emission.  Our objectives for CO
default2
default emission and fuel diversity can be met with these systems but only with a huge increase in the cost of electricity which will result in significant social problems and affect the co
defaultmpetitiveness of the UK economy.  There is an urgent need for new concepts of fossil fuel based power generation with CO
default2
default capture since the current technologies available are simply not capable of giving cheap reliable high efficiency power generation with
default near 100% capture of CO
default2
default and other impurities.  As shown in Section 1.5, the use of the NET Power system for both natural gas and coal fuelled electric generation plants would result in the ability to use fossil fuels, meet our CO
default2
default emission targets, secur
defaulte freedom to switch between coal and gas and achieve much lower cost of electricity than wind or nuclear powered systems. In this scenario the incentive would be to maximise the use of fossil fuels using NET
default P
defaultower systems to limit electricity costs with si
defaultgnificant social and economic benefit to the UK.  This would lead to CCS based technology applied to fossil fuelled systems being the largest portion of total power generation capacity by 2050.
default&#xa0;
default3.  BENEFITS TO THE UKdefault&#xa0;defaultThe UK has the possibility of becomin
defaultg the host country for the prototype NET Power 50 MW thermal system plus 
defaultinitial large-scale commercial 
defaultunit
defaults
default.  The test programme would be based on natural gas fuel plus demonstrated operation with a simulated coal based fuel gas.  A site on Teesside has 
defaultbeen identified. Natural gas and oxygen are available as pipeline supplies together with site operation and maintenance services.  The site is in an enterprise zone.  Hosting the initial NET Power demonstration facility would provide enormous benefits to t
defaulthe UK.  Should the system perform as expected, the UK will be able to accelerate the deployment of low-cost power stations with full carbon capture, enabling the production of low-cost electricity while meeting all emissions targets.  Perhaps as important,
default hosting the initial facility will position the UK as the global centre for the development of NET Power facilities, offering engineering, design, and manufacturing opportunities, while a UK-driven enhanced oil recovery and sequestration industry, to be ut
defaultilized by much of Europe, would be enabled in the North Sea. There would be opportunities 
defaultfor UK firms to be major worldwide suppliers of heat exchangers, compression systems, turbine components and overall system design procurement and supply services for
default complete power stations.  The UK would become a world leader in clean power technology.  The deployment of new power systems are large undertakings and require that governments work with industry for the deployment of the first system so that future syste
defaultms can stand on their own.  Support can come in the form of grants and loan guarantees that back the technology and enable the initial facilities to be financed. The NET Power system already has the support and involvement of several industry-leading compa
defaultnies, and thus the opportunity is ripe for the UK Government to involve itself and aid in the deployment of this vital technology. The development of the coal based system is particularly important as this fuel currently produces such a high proportion of 
defaultthe total emitted CO
default2
default worldwide. This will provide markets particularly in China, India and the US.
default&#xa0;
default4.  BARRIERS TO CCS IMPLEMENTIONdefault&#xa0;defaultThe main current barriers to the implementation of CCS technology can be divided between power generation and CO
default2
default transpo
defaultrtation and storage.  The high COE of fossil fuel power generation using current CO
default2
default capture technology compared to existing systems together with reduced efficiency and up to 20% reduction in power output from a given sized boiler or gas turbine system re
defaultquires a very high government subsidy to justify investment by power companies. No subsidy would be required for NET Power systems. In general, current CO
default2
default capture technology produces CO
default2
default at near atmospheric pressure requiring expensive compression systems
default delivering high pressure CO
default2
default into pipelines.  The most attractive disposal sites are offshore in depleted gas reservoirs or for use in enhanced oil recovery.  EOR opportunities exist in the North Sea area but offshore pipelines would be extremely expensiv
defaulte and require that the massive investment is made well in advance of potential extra oil production benefits.  The problem arises that unless these pipelines are built no investment in the new power stations with CO
default2
default capture will be made.  The situation ca
defaultn be remedied with the production of liquid CO
default2
default for delivery by tanker to any offshore oil platform with no up-front investment except tanker charter costs.  The NET Power system is unique in producing its CO
default2
default product at 300 bar pressure (or lower with inc
defaultreased overall system efficiency).  The very high internal energy of CO
default2
default at this pressure plus the use of existing CO
default2 
defaultrecycle compressors for additional refrigeration energy production makes it very easy for the production of ultra-high purity liquid CO
default2
default 
defaultat about 6 bar pressure for tanker transportation.  CO
default2
default export from the first UK prototype 50Mw thermal unit on Teeside, which could produce CO
default2
default at a rate of 8 tons/hr, would demonstrate the system in conjunction with an interested oil company.  This would
default significantly reduce the requirement to subsidise CO
default2
default pipeline systems.  The problem of responsibility for CO
default2
default storage reservoirs over multi thousand year timescales means in practice that the governments of countries surrounding the North Sea would have 
defaultto take liability for monitoring and remedial action if necessary.  The social impact would be very positive for the general population who would benefit from much cheaper power with much reduced environmental impact compared to existing power either fossi
defaultl 
defaultfuel, wind or nuclear systems.
default&#xa0;
default5.  SAFETY ISSUESdefault&#xa0;defaultCO
default2 
defaultis an asphyxiating gas with a density about 1.5 times greater than air.  It is inert.  High pressure pipelines and production systems designed using current engineering and safety standards would eli
defaultminate any significant potential risks.  The integrity of geologic storage and structures needs careful initial analysis and long term 
defaultmonitoring.
default 
defaultCompanies in the United States have been pumping high-pressure CO
default2
default into underground reservoirs for over forty
default years for enhanced oil recovery and have seen extremely high reliability and retention rates, with almost no issues reported.

default&#xa0;
default7.  THE CURRENT ROADMAPdefault&#xa0;defaultThe interventions outlined in the roadmap provide an excellen
defaultt pathway for the rapid deployment of a new system such as NET Power.  The challenge is to ensure that these provisions are implemented rapidly and available now in order to fund and launch development programmes.
default&#xa0;
default8.  INTERNATIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF CCSdefault&#xa0;defaultRapi
defaultd deployment and demonstration of
default new cost effective CCS system
defaults by the UK will greatly influence worldwide
default plans for deployment
default 
defaultand would position the UK at the centre of that development. The markets in China and India are vital for significantly impacti
defaultng total global CO
default2
default emissions targeting both new plants and retrofits.
default&#xa0;
default9.  CONSEQUENCIESdefault&#xa0;defaultFuture levels of predicted world power demand are impossible to achieve without majority use of fossil fuels. If CCS is not widely adopted atmospheric CO2 levels will become unsustainable with grave risk of 
defaultmassive global disruption, co
defaultnflicts and trauma.
