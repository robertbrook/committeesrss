"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by the Welsh Language Commissioner (JRR 0036)&#xa0;\nThe Welsh Language Commissioner welcomes the opportunity to comment on the \nimplications for\n \naccess to justice\n \nof the Government's \nproposals to reform judicial review\n. This comme\nnt should be taken as evidence to assist the Joint Committee on Human Rights in scrutinising the Government's proposals in an area where meeting the needs of individuals, including their languages needs, is integral to the quality and effectiveness of serv\nices. \n&#xa0;\nThe principal aim of the Commissioner is to promote and facilitate the use of Welsh. This entails raising awareness of the official status of the Welsh language in Wales and imposing standards on organisations. This, in turn, will lead to the estab\nlishment of rights for Welsh speakers. \n&#xa0;\nTwo principles underpin the Commissioner's work: \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Wales, the Welsh language should be treated no less favourably than the English language; \n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPersons in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium \nof the Welsh language if they choose to do so. \nIn due course, secondary legislation will introduce new powers allowing the setting and imposing of standards on organizations. Until then, the Commissioner will continue to inspect statutory Welsh language s\nchemes through the powers inherited under the Welsh Language Act 1993.\n&#xa0;\nThe role of the Commissioner was created by the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. The Commissioner may investigate failure to implement a language scheme; interference with the free\ndom to use Welsh in Wales and, in future, complaints regarding the failure of organizations to meet standards. \n&#xa0;\nOne of the Commissioner's priorities is to scrutinise Welsh language policy developments, acting as an independent advocate on behalf of Welsh \nspeakers in Wales. This evidence is provided to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in that capacity.\n&#xa0;\nThe Commissioner’s comments, and the issues which the Joint Committee may wish to address, may be summarised as follows:-\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are many references in th\ne Government's recommendations (\nJudicial Review: proposals for further reform\n) \nto assessing the impact of the proposed changes on various groups, as well as assessing the impact in accordance with the Ministry for Justice's duties under the Equality Act 2010. In terms of the Welsh language, there is no specific mention of it in the c\nonsultation documentation. \nThe Government's proposals raise fundamental questions on access to justice. \nThe Welsh Language Commissioner believes that the Government should not introduce any changes without first considering the significance of the plans to minority groups, including Welsh speakers.&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are already arrangements in place in Welsh courts (as noted in Section 22 of the Welsh Language Act 1993) which allow individuals to speak Welsh during court cases (including judicial review hearings), tra\nnslating those contributions and related papers into English for those in court who do not understand Welsh. However, Welsh language provision in courts is often fragmented and arbitrary. \nFurther to the above comment, it should be ensured that the Courts and Tribunals Service offers Welsh language services in a proactive manner, in accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Language Schemes prepared by the Courts and Tribunals Service and Ministry for Justice.&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is not clear from the Govern\nment's recommendations what\n \ncriteria\n \nthe\n \nGovernment\n \nintends to\n \nuse in order to ensure that\n \nlegal support\n \nresources are\n \n'properly targeted \nat\n \nthose judicial review cases\n where they are needed\n \nmost\n?' \nWe ask for assurances that no reforms will undermine the availability of legal services and resources to individuals or parties who wish to submit an application for, or conduct a judicial review hearing in Welsh.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights will normally, when scrutinising British legislation, consider\n the sufficiency of considerations relating to human rights and equality legislation. \nWe ask, where appropriate, for the Joint Committee to consider to what extent the Government's proposals are compatible with the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. \nThank you once again for the opportunity to contribute to this consultation. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Joint Committee on Human Rights.\n&#xa0;\n25 November 2013\n"
