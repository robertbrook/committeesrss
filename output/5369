[normal]On
[normal] our arrival at the North Terminal at about 8.30amwe encountered chaos at check-in and immediately joined a very long queue. It had taken us over two hours by taxi to get to the airport from our home in 
[normal]Tadworth
[normal], Surrey, a journey which would normally have
[normal] taken about twenty minutes. There was no information on any of the electronic boards, and no staff to make verbal announcements. We stood for about three and a half hours before reaching a check-in desk, only about three of which were manned. During this 
[normal]time we saw no representative from the airline, and were offered no refreshment.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Once checked in we were issued with boarding passes, but we had to manually take our luggage and deposit it in the middle of the check-in area. We then proceeded through immi
[normal]gration, security and to the departure lounge.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The information desk was manned by one Thomson employee, who could provide no information about our flight. During the whole afternoon, the desk was manned by armed police. There was no information on the ele
[normal]ctronic boards, and no sign of any airline representative. The lounge was very full, and at no time were we offered any form of information, or refreshment. Fortunately we had taken food with us to consume on the plane, and by the time we got to the depart
[normal]ure lounge we were starving and very thirsty. It was just as well because we had no idea if the flight was going or not, and therefore it was far 
[normal]to
[normal] risky to buy a sit down meal.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We discovered from another passenger that our flight was not leaving Christm
[normal]as Eve and we were being put up in the Sofitel. This information was unofficial, since there was no Thomson, or any other official to impart this information. We had no option but to believe the rumour, so at about 6.00pm we decided to abandon the departur
[normal]e lounge and take the passage out, which was manned, through immigration and the exit. There was no Thomson representative at the exit, so we proceeded to the hotel, but via Boots the chemist to buy some essential toiletries, toothbrushes, paste, deodorant
[normal], at our own cost, since we did not have our luggage. We had tried to find our luggage, unsuccessfully, since there were still many cases piled up at check-in. There was absolutely no information about our luggage, although we had already enquired at the 
[normal]S
[normal]wissport
[normal] desk at luggage reclaim. They were unable to provide any information, and did not know where any luggage was located.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The Sofitel were expecting passengers, and their check-in process was reasonably 
[normal]smoothe
[normal], but there was no information about our
[normal] flight. We were advised that dinner would be provided, but only between 6.30 and 8.30pm. We purchased some very expensive drinks, and then went to dinner. Dinner was not in the main dining room, but in a large room in the basement. It was a shambles, not 
[normal]enough seating so some people were standing up eating. The food was meagre. Tables were strewn with dirty plates etc., and we had to ask a member of staff to clear us two places to sit and eat. There was no choice, the soup was 
[normal]luke
[normal] warm (no bread, althoug
[normal]h some people had rolls),a very small piece of chicken, mixed vegetables and potatoes which we had to wait for because they had run out. Absolutely no choice, thankfully we are not vegetarians. After that, we treated ourselves to another very expensive dri
[normal]nk.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Whilst at the hotel we sent an internet message to Thomson Airways from their website, requesting information about our flight. We eventually received a standard reply on 27
[normal]th
[normal] December, which was not at all helpful, and of no use.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We decided to see i
[normal]f we could find our luggage, so we returned to the airport check-in at about 9.30pm. We managed to find a very helpful 
[normal]Swissport
[normal] employee who arranged for us to go through security and to baggage re-claim where it seemed all the checked-in baggage was now 
[normal]located. Baggage re-claim was a mass of people, with suitcases everywhere, all over the floor and on the carousels. Using our ingenuity, we eventually managed to find our two suitcases, and returned to the hotel via immigration.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]When we arrived back at th
[normal]e hotel at about 10.30pm, there was now a notice displayed in the lobby advising us that the flight was now expected to leave from the south terminal at 8.20am on Christmas Day. It said we should be at check-in three hours before departure.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We discovered 
[normal]that passengers on our flight who booked flights direct with Thomson Airways had received an e-mail from Thomson, advising them about financial compensation and details of the new flight on Christmas Day. We were booked with a tour operator (Prestige Holid
[normal]ays) through a travel agent (Castaways in 
[normal]Tadworth
[normal]) and received nothing from any organisation. There was a ‘Dunkirk spirit’ amongst passengers, which is how many people found out information. We went to bed !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We arrived at the hotel lobby at 5.00am hopin
[normal]g to get a bit of breakfast or at least a cup of coffee before setting off for the south terminal. The staff were very off hand with us. Breakfast was not available for us, although the main breakfast room was manned and ready for service. We were forbidde
[normal]n from using it. Packed breakfasts were supposed to be available, but there were none ready. So we left with no breakfast or drink, shortly after 5.00am. The staff were not helpful, regardless of the fact that it was Christmas morning. We felt during the w
[normal]hole of our stay that we were second class citizens, which is how we were treated, and the staff were only interested in full paying clients, who had all facilities available to them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]So, we made our way to the south terminal, where things seemed reasonab
[normal]ly normal. We checked in, and were given two five pound vouchers to spend in the departure lounge. This was the only ‘give away’ and it did not even provide us with a breakfast, but we did use it towards our breakfast.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We took off at about 8.45am and were
[normal] given one free drink during the flight. Our holiday from then on went smoothly.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In conclusion, it was an awful experience, and it appears that whatever contingency plans the airport and Thomson Airways had (if any ?) did not work, and there were just not
[normal] enough staff on duty to cope with the situation. We appreciate that the situation was caused by the weather, but there was enough notice in the news about the expected bad weather, for the 
[normal]management’s
[normal] of both Gatwick Airport and Thomson Airways to have f
[normal]oreseen likely problems and taken remedial action. In the event, it was chaos !
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]To date, although we have been in contact with our travel agent, who have been in contact with the Tour Operator on our behalf, we have had no communication from anyone regard
[normal]ing compensation and out of pocket expenses.
