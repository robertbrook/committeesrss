[[[Written evidence from Bailey Pollock Electrical Services Ltd]]]

[[[ ]]]I watched the recent Committee meeting where you took evidence from Certsure, Napit and others over the single register. As a registered electrician, I have a number of concerns on this matter and how it is currently operated. &#xa0;Put simply my main concerns are:I would advocate and support a single register but not by a body such as the NICEIC. &#xa0;I hope this information is of some use to you and I will be very happy to provide further information or explanation should you need it.October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
