defaultI have a first class honours degree in physics from

default and a PhD in physics from 
defaultSheffield
default 
defaultUniversity
default.  I am retired and have no interests to declare.
default  My interest is that of a physicist with vast experience of complex systems involving heat transfer, fluid flow and thermo-dynamics (of which the climate system is a
defaultn
default example)
default and computer modelling of such complex systems.

defaultMy evidence is based on a lifetime experience of working in the real world of engineering, which relies on

defaulty evidence thus calls into question the vague and unsubstantiated hypotheses of those who call themselves “climate scientists”
default and the poor state of the evidence on which they appear to rely for their forecasts

defaultQ
default              
defaultWhat is the current state of public understanding of what is meant by climate change? How has this changed in recent years?default 
default&#xa0;
default1
default              
defaultThere is no definition of “climate change” as used by the Government, the media and all official bodies
default, so how can the public 
defaultbe expected to 
defaultunderstand 
default“
defaultwhat is meant by climate change
default”
default?
default  
defaultIt seems that there has been a deliberate policy to confuse the public into thinking that the climate didn’t change until recently.  
defaultThe problem is that the climate has always changed and
default always will.  M
defaultankind has always had to adapt to living with a changing climate, be it an ice age or benign warm conditions.  So the Government declaring that 
default“climate change is 
defaultthe biggest problem” we face is pure nonsense.  The public is quite reasonably getting fed up of all the propaganda
default about climate change
default, which is not borne out by their everyday experience.
default  If the 
defaultGovernment
default sees the problem as “man-made global warming”, it should say so and stop using the term “climate change”
default,
default which is meaningless
default.
default&#xa0;
default2
default              
defaultAny unusual weather event is now widely blamed by politicians and the media as caused by “climate change”.  The public includes people who have a longer memory than politicians and know that there is nothing new under the sun.  If severe weather has existed in the past and was not then caused by “climate change”, then the public’s understanding is only going to become more sceptical, as it has, of all the propaganda.
default  One minute the public is told we are in a drought due to “climate change” – a few months later we are suffering floods and we are told this is due to “climate change”.  Then 
defaultheat waves
default are due to “climate change” and then severe winters are due to “climate change”.  No wonder the public distrusts politicians.
default&#xa0;
default3
default              
defaultIf the Government wants the public to understand what is meant by the mythical “atmospheric greenhouse effect” then it should provide an explanation based on physics – noting that the atmosphere does not behave like a greenhouse.  There is no basis in physics for the “atmospheric greenhouse effect”, it was something dreamt up by “climate scientists” who don’t seem to have an understanding of the laws of physics – for them to say that a gas such as carbon dioxide “traps heat” is just laughable and shows their ignorance.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault              defaultWhich voices are trusted in public discourse on climate science and policy? What role should Government Departments, scientific advisers to Government and publicly funded scientists have in communicating climate science? default&#xa0;
default3
default              
defaultThe public quite rightly distrusts organisations such as the BBC
default,
default which blame every weather event on “climate change”
default and introduce “climate change” in virtually every programme they produce
default.  Politicians are, quite understandably because of all the recent scandals, trusted by very few members of the public.  
defaultScientific and engineering institutions are not trusted because of their perception as Government propagandists
default being funded by Government (he who pays the piper calls the tune)
default.  Most members of the public who have an interest in “climate change” get their information from widely trusted internet websites and a few 
defaultindependent 
defaultmedia correspondents
default who do not have vested interests
default and tell the truth about how the political obsession with “climate change” is damaging the economy, ruining peoples’ live
defaults and leading to an acute problem
default with regard to our future energy supplies
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault              defaultHow could public understanding of what is meant by climate change be improved? What are the main barriers to this? Does the media have a positive role to playdefault? 
default&#xa0;
default3
default              
defaultIt would help if “climate change”
default,
default “
defaultman-made global warming”
default and all the other phrases such as “climate disruption” “catastrophic climate change” etc were not use
defaultd as if they have some defined meaning
default.  
defaultA simple definition of the problem should be provided and the terminology should then be exclusively used.  
defaultLabelling anybody who disagrees with Government propaganda as a “climate change denier” 
defaultor even “climate denier” 
default(who would deny that the climate changes
default or that there is climate
default?) does not help public understanding.
default  The media should tell the truth; that would make a positive change.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault              defaultHow important is public understanding in developing effective climate change policy? default&#xa0;
default4
default              
defaultThere will always be public resistance to “climate change” policy as long as the public are not convinced that “climate change” is a problem and as long as they see that a few are 
defaulthugely 
defaultbenefiting from “climate change” policy
default,
default whilst the vast majority of the public see themselves 
defaultand the economy 
defaultgetting ever poorer.  
defaultThe cure is seen to be far worse than the disease.  
defaultA bit of honesty about the fact that Government-funded “climate scientists” don’t have a clue about what the future climate will be
default,
default because the computer models on which they rely are based on false physics
default,
default would help public understanding.  It has to be remembered that the IPPC has said “
defaultIn climate research and modelling, we should recognise that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that the long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible
default”.  The public is aware that all long term forecasts are wrong and no amount of propaganda will change this fact.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault              defaultWhat evidence is there that public attitude to climate science affects their engagement with energy policies or initiatives? default&#xa0;
default5
default              
defaultThe fact is that anybody who understands “climate change” can see that the energy policy measures and initiatives 
defaultput in place to tackle the supposed 
defaultproblem
default 
defaultare counter-productive and are slowly ruining the country
default.  
defaultThe fact that energy policies have been virtually non-existent for 16 years and that all policy measures that have been put in place increase energy costs, increase fuel poverty, enrich a few with vested interests and damage the countryside, all in the name of “tackling climate change”
default,
default cannot be helpful.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault              defaultDoes the Government have sufficient expertise in social and behavioural sciences to understand the relationship between public understanding of climate science and the feasibility of relevant public policies? default&#xa0;
default6
default              
defaultUntil the Government c
defaultontinues to have this religious
default, non-scientific belief in “climate change”
default (aka man-made global warming)
default, against all the scientific evidence to the contrary, then no amount of propaganda and brain-washing will affect public understanding.  The public are not fools and can see through the “climate change” scam.
default  Continual propaganda from Prime 
defaultM
defaultinisters and other Ministers that “the science is settled” and “we have X
default 
defaultdays to save the planet” are not believed by the public, who are not as stupid as politicians think.  Statements like “snow is going to be a thing of the past; children aren’t going to know what snow is” just add to the public rejection of the propaganda.
default  Social and behavioural “sciences” are quite rightly seen by the public as just more nonsense
default; using the advice of such people for more propaganda purposes will be counter-productive
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQdefault              defaultCan lessons about public engagement with climate change policy be learned from other countries?default&#xa0;
default7
default              
defaultThose countries that put the interests of their citizens and the
defaultir
default economy ahead of the attempts to “tackle climate change” should be emulated by the UK Government.
default  The public knows that a “low carbon” economy is a third world economy.  The public knows that copious cheap energy provides wealth and the wealth can be used to adapt to whatever form
default the future climate happens to tak
defaulte – whether it’s warmer and more benign or colder and harsher (as in the Little Ice Age).
