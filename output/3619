[normal]1
[normal] through the then Asia Regional 
[normal]O
[normal]ffice 
[normal]based 
[normal]in Bangkok
[normal]. 
[normal]ActionAid Myanmar 
[normal](AAM) was formed 
[normal]in 2007, 
[normal]reflecting 
[normal]the belief that influence should be nurtured from within the country. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Over the last 10
[normal] 
[normal]years, 
[normal]AAM
[normal] 
[normal]has 
[normal]engaged with the most marginalised ethnic minorities
[normal]. 
[normal]As of January 2013, AAM’s programme covers more than 700 communities in 26 townships 
[normal]in
[normal] 
[normal]8 states/regions
[normal]. It
[normal] supports around 180 000 people in partnership with 17 local organisations. Along with community-led 
[normal]empowerment
[normal] work, AAM is 
[normal]also heavily
[normal] involved in national policy 
[normal]discussions
[normal]. Our current annual budget is around 6 million USD.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The underlying principle of ActionAid’s approach in Myanmar is to develop the leadership skills and potential of committed Myanmar youth, particularly young women
[normal],
[normal] through an innovative Fellowship Programme
[normal] that is
[normal] central to all our work. The programme aims at identifying young people (Fellows) in rural communities and equipping them with the skills, knowledge and confidence needed to stimulate participatory development in their villages and engage with local authorities to ensure sustainable local development.

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]SUMMARY[bold]&#xa0;[bold]ActionAid welcomes this inquiry. Myanmar, with its long history of political struggle, is now at a juncture where people want to take an active part in the change process. Since 2011 there have been remarkable changes in Myanmar yet despite the political progress it remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. Only the right type of development and the full and active engagement of the population will help ensure a transition to justice, peace and sustainable development for all 
[normal]of 
[normal]Myanmar’s people. 
[normal]&#xa0;

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The multiple transitions 
[normal]that 
[normal]Myanmar is 
[normal]rapidly 
[normal]undergoing – from a military government to a multi-party democracy, from a centralized to a market economy and from engaging in multiple conflicts to striving for peace – are
[normal] 
[normal]extremely demanding. Ministers, senior government officials and parliamentarians are grappling with complex reforms that will have a profound impact on the future shape of Myanmar. However, few have had the chance to develop the skills and experience necessary to manage such far-reaching reforms
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is critical that the international community supports the government in its efforts to bring positive political, social and economic change. However, for the international community to maximize their contribution, their support must be balanced - respecting the leadership of the Myanmar people and not imposing ideals from 
[normal]outside
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Currently much of the support being provided by the international community is not focused on building the capacity of the government to deliver services and secure the rights of citizens. Much development aid remains targeted towards other agencies such as the UN and International NGOs. While we understand the need to fund a stable transition, one consequence of this is the creation of parallel
[normal] 
[normal]services 
[normal]rather than 
[normal]investing in the capacity of 
[normal]the government 
[normal]to provide
[normal] essential 
[normal]public 
[normal]services such
[normal] as free universal primary education.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The UN and International NGOs are well placed to help the people of Myanmar, but development aid should 
[normal]reinforce rather than 
[normal]bypass government
[normal] completely
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]It 
[normal]should aim to facilitate long-term state-building and the development of capacity to deliver stable and high-quality public services, especially for the poorest and most marginalized people in the country. 
[normal]Budget 
[normal]or sector 
[normal]support is one key way of doing this.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Throughout its history, the goal of sustainable peace in Myanmar has remained unreachable because of identity-based differences, leading to long-standing conflicts and displacement. It is clear that conflict will continue until all people in 
[normal]Myanmar, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, feel that they are being respected and treated as equals
[normal]. They need to
[normal] have
[normal] confidence in the justice system, 
[normal]enjoy
[normal] 
[normal]equal human rights, and be able to access education, healthcare, a livelihood, 
[normal]while having religious 
[normal]freedom
[normal] and
[normal] political autonomy.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Through their aid and technical support, the international community should encourage the government to be inclusive and ensure justice and equality for all. Donor countries should promote fiscal and administrative decentralization and more autonomy for 
[normal]both 
[normal]state and regional governments. Direct bilateral aid and partnership with state and regional governments would promote more equal development and empower the 
[normal]levels of 
[normal]government 
[normal]that work
[normal] most directly with the people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The prevailing economic model focuses on increasing industrialization, with the promise of “quick wins” through economic growth 
[normal]which,
[normal] it is hoped, will provide employment opportunities for a huge, unskilled and un/under-employed workforce. 
[normal]However, 
[normal]all 
[normal]t
[normal]oo often there is a tendency to ignore the potential marginalizing impact 
[normal]that 
[normal]such an approach to “economic growth” 
[normal]can have 
[normal]on the majority of the population
[normal]:
[normal] rural farmers engaged in the agriculture sector. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is critical that the international community supports a model of economic development which is inclusive of the majority, and which ensures their continued access to and control over their resources. Too 
[normal]great a
[normal] 
[normal]focus on “quick growth” and too rapid a transition from an agricultural to an industrialized 
[normal]economy
[normal] 
[normal]could
[normal] 
[normal]result in widespread marginalization, inequality and shocks to society which 
[normal]may
[normal] 
[normal]be irreparable. Too rapid a transition might be detrimental to the achievement of just and sustainable development.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]At the same time, the investment and trade interests of the international community must consider the development needs of Myanmar. Investment should 
[normal]at the very least 
[normal]“do no harm”. For example, it should ensure that it does not exacerbate conflict; contribute to land grabbing or similar confiscation of people’s resources
[normal]. It should go further and promote inclusion 
[normal]and avoid 
[normal]marginalization
[normal] of local business
[normal]es
[normal] and local entrepreneurship. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Myanmar’s transition to a modern, developed nation is threatened by persistent and widespread gender inequalities. Patriarchy is deeply rooted in the culture, society, governance systems and institutions
[normal]. This has been
[normal] reinforced over decades by a male dominated
[normal],
[normal] militarized society. Institutional arrangements have been accepted and leadership generally perceived as a male prerogative. A clear manifestation of this is the severe under-representation of women in leadership and decision making roles in parliament, in government and in the private sector. Typically women’s rights are regarded as not being an issue in Myanmar, or secondary to the pursuit of ending ethnic conflict or pursuing economic development etc. That women’s participation and leadership are not understood to be integral to the achievement of such processes is highly problematic. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Specific and targeted budgets and 
[normal]program
[normal]me
[normal]s
[normal] are critical to ensure there is solid investment in promoting women’s participation and leadership at all levels so that gender inequalities can be challenged and women’s rights 
[normal]abuses addressed. 
[normal]M
[normal]ain
[normal]streaming gender across sector budgets and programmes is
[normal] not sufficient
[normal] on its own
[normal] to achieve the necessary access to opportunities and justice for women and girls.
