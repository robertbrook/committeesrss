defaultAs of January 2013, AAM’s programme covers more than 700 communities in 26 townships

defaultThe underlying principle of ActionAid’s approach in Myanmar is to develop the leadership skills and potential of committed Myanmar youth, particularly young women
default,
default through an innovative Fellowship Programme
default that is

The programme aims at identifying young people (Fellows) in rural communities and equipping them with the skills, knowledge and confidence needed to stimulate participatory development in their villages and engage with local authorities to ensure sustainable local development.

default&#xa0;defaultSUMMARYdefault&#xa0;defaultActionAid welcomes this inquiry. Myanmar, with its long history of political struggle, is now at a juncture where people want to take an active part in the change process. Since 2011 there have been remarkable changes in Myanmar yet despite the political progress it remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. Only the right type of development and the full and active engagement of the population will help ensure a transition to justice, peace and sustainable development for all 
defaultof 
defaultMyanmar’s people.

default&#xa0;
defaultThe multiple transitions 
defaultthat 
defaultMyanmar is 
defaultrapidly 
defaultundergoing – from a military government to a multi-party democracy, from a centralized to a market economy and from engaging in multiple conflicts to striving for peace – are
default 
defaultextremely demanding. Ministers, senior government officials and parliamentarians are grappling with complex reforms that will have a profound impact on the future shape of Myanmar. However, few have had the chance to develop the skills and experience necessary to manage such far-reaching reforms
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is critical that the international community supports the government in its efforts to bring positive political, social and economic change. However, for the international community to maximize their contribution, their support must be balanced - respecting the leadership of the Myanmar people and not imposing ideals from 
defaultoutside
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently much of the support being provided by the international community is not focused on building the capacity of the government to deliver services and secure the rights of citizens. Much development aid remains targeted towards other agencies such as the UN and International NGOs. While we understand the need to fund a stable transition, one consequence of this is the creation of parallel
default 
defaultservices 
defaultrather than 
defaultinvesting in the capacity of 
defaultthe government 
defaultto provide
default essential 
defaultpublic 
defaultservices such
default as free universal primary education.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UN and International NGOs are well placed to help the people of Myanmar, but development aid should 
defaultreinforce rather than 
defaultbypass government
default completely
default.
default 
defaultIt 
defaultshould aim to facilitate long-term state-building and the development of capacity to deliver stable and high-quality public services, especially for the poorest and most marginalized people in the country. 
defaultBudget 
defaultor sector 
defaultsupport is one key way of doing this.
default 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThroughout its history, the goal of sustainable peace in Myanmar has remained unreachable because of identity-based differences, leading to long-standing conflicts and displacement. It is clear that conflict will continue until all people in 
defaultMyanmar, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, feel that they are being respected and treated as equals
default. They need to
default have
default confidence in the justice system, 
defaultenjoy
default 
defaultequal human rights, and be able to access education, healthcare, a livelihood, 
defaultwhile having religious 
defaultfreedom
default and
default political autonomy.
default&#xa0;
defaultThrough their aid and technical support, the international community should encourage the government to be inclusive and ensure justice and equality for all. Donor countries should promote fiscal and administrative decentralization and more autonomy for 
defaultboth 
defaultstate and regional governments. Direct bilateral aid and partnership with state and regional governments would promote more equal development and empower the 
defaultlevels of 
defaultgovernment 
defaultthat work
default most directly with the people.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe prevailing economic model focuses on increasing industrialization, with the promise of “quick wins” through economic growth 
defaultwhich,
default it is hoped, will provide employment opportunities for a huge, unskilled and un/under-employed workforce. 
defaultHowever, 
defaultall 
defaultt
defaultoo often there is a tendency to ignore the potential marginalizing impact 
defaultthat 
defaultsuch an approach to “economic growth” 
defaultcan have 
defaulton the majority of the population
default:
default rural farmers engaged in the agriculture sector. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is critical that the international community supports a model of economic development which is inclusive of the majority, and which ensures their continued access to and control over their resources. Too 
defaultgreat a
default 
defaultfocus on “quick growth” and too rapid a transition from an agricultural to an industrialized 
defaulteconomy
default 
defaultcould
default 
defaultresult in widespread marginalization, inequality and shocks to society which 
defaultmay
default 
defaultbe irreparable. Too rapid a transition might be detrimental to the achievement of just and sustainable development.
default&#xa0;
defaultAt the same time, the investment and trade interests of the international community must consider the development needs of Myanmar. Investment should 
defaultat the very least 
default“do no harm”. For example, it should ensure that it does not exacerbate conflict; contribute to land grabbing or similar confiscation of people’s resources
default. It should go further and promote inclusion 
defaultand avoid 
defaultmarginalization
default of local business
defaultes
default and local entrepreneurship. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
defaultMyanmar’s transition to a modern, developed nation is threatened by persistent and widespread gender inequalities. Patriarchy is deeply rooted in the culture, society, governance systems and institutions
default. This has been
default reinforced over decades by a male dominated
default,
default militarized society. Institutional arrangements have been accepted and leadership generally perceived as a male prerogative. A clear manifestation of this is the severe under-representation of women in leadership and decision making roles in parliament, in government and in the private sector. Typically women’s rights are regarded as not being an issue in Myanmar, or secondary to the pursuit of ending ethnic conflict or pursuing economic development etc. That women’s participation and leadership are not understood to be integral to the achievement of such processes is highly problematic. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSpecific and targeted budgets and 
defaultprogram
defaultme
defaults
default are critical to ensure there is solid investment in promoting women’s participation and leadership at all levels so that gender inequalities can be challenged and women’s rights 
defaultabuses addressed. 
defaultM
defaultain
defaultstreaming gender across sector budgets and programmes is
default not sufficient
default on its own
default to achieve the necessary access to opportunities and justice for women and girls.
