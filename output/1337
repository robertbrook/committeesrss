[normal]Written evidence from Sutton Valence Parish Council (TIC 022)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Sutton Valence is a rural parish but has an A road running through the middle of it. Despite this the bus service is poor. It starts too late for commuters to use, even though the local train station is on its route. The buses are infrequent and the fare is too expensive for most.
