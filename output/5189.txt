[[[Written evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Norfolk [CST0066]]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter, relating to the Public Administration Select Committee's inquiry into crime statistics. I share your view that it is essential that we ensure that crimes are recorded properly.&#xa0;Within your letter you ask two questions, which I have included below, together with my response:&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]My Police and Crime Plan sets out policing objectives, which are one of the ways in which I hold the Chief Constable to account on behalf of those who live; work and visit Norfolk. Each objective includes a performance measure. The performance measures that relate to crime statistics link to crimes, which are referred to as 'Priority Crimes', and are those I have agreed with the Chief Constable are the most serious. This is in the understanding that some crimes, such as hate crimes and sexual offences are under reported and an increase in the recording of these is encouraged. The impact of including performance measures in this way is that resources are focussed on the crimes that present the greatest harm, the Chief Constable holds his staff to account for performance in these areas and the public, in turn, holds me to account.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]In Norfolk, the Crime Registrar has oversight and is the final decision maker for the Constabulary in respect of crime recording. The Registrar and his team work independently from those with investigative roles and reports directly to the Chief Constable. I receive regular written reports from the Chief Constable regarding the Registrar's work in this area and the result of monitoring and audits. The Registrar attends my meetings with the Chief Constable when these reports are presented, so I can discuss any concerns that arise with the Chief Constable and the Registrarpersonally.&#xa0;Despite these safeguards, it is inevitable that from time to time decisions will be made regarding crime recording that others may later review and come to different conclusions with regards to the classification. Audits show that this is on the minority of occasions and when this occurs, interventions are made to rectify emerging issues.&#xa0;Key to ensuring that statistics are recorded accurately is clear and unambiguous national guidance regarding the recording of crime, so that objective decisions can be made regarding classifications, which are clear for the professionals and for the public to understand.&#xa0;Should you have any further queries please do not hesitate to contact me.&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
