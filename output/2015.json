"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCentro â€“ Written evidence&#xa0;\nThank you for the opportunity to submit written evidence to \nJoint Committee on the Draft Deregulation\n Bill.\n&#xa0;\nThe West Midlands is at the heart of the national rail network and the interaction of passenger and freight services undertaking local and national movements creates challenges and opportunities in supporting the growth of both rail service types to generate economic and carbon benefits for the Metropolitan Area within the context of West Midlands Local Transport Plan. \n&#xa0;\nCentro\n, the West Midland Passenger Transport Executive, \ntherefore has a strong interest in rail issues reflecting its interaction with passenger services, ensuring passenger growth is accommodated on the West Midlands rail network as well as addressing the connectivity and accessibility gaps felt across the travel to work area. Centro is currently working with Shire Authorities outside of the Metropolitan Area to deliver a new station at Bromsgrove in Worcestershire and new rail services on the Shakespeare Line in Warwickshire.\n&#xa0;\nFor our written evidence, we felt it necessary to answer the following question:\n&#xa0;\nQuestion 6 - To what extent does the draft Bill benefit consumers as well as businesses? &#xa0;\nCentro supports the removal of restrictions on provision of passenger rail services (1 In \nPart 2 of the Transport Act 1968 \n(integrated transport areas and passenger transport areas), in section 10(1) (general powers of Executive). This Act imposes a 25 mile limitation to coordinating rail matters outside of the West Midlands Metropolitan Area. \n&#xa0;\nThe removal of above restriction would:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCentro, believe that there would be major benefits arising from this Bill, to passengers and the economy in the West Midlands, as it would: \n&#xa0;\nThis Bill offers the opportunity for the region to take control of a key economic asset and deliver real change for the economy and rail p\nassengers. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nGeoff \nInskip\nCentro Chief Executive\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n16 September 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
