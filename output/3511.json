"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Dart Energy (Europe) Ltd (ESG 33)&#xa0;1.0              Introduction&#xa0;1.1\n              \nDart Energy (Europe) Ltd via \nsubsidiaries,\n GP Energy Ltd and Dart Energy (West England) Ltd\n,\n hold a 75% interest in 6 contiguous petroleum exploration and development licen\ns\nes (PEDL) which straddle the Wales-England border \naround Wrexham and a 100% interest in further licen\ns\ne in the South Wales Coalfield near Swansea.  All seven of these licen\ns\nes are considered to have significant unconventional resource potential in the form of coal bed methane, shale gas and potentially shale oil.\n&#xa0;\n2.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe importance of gas to the UK’s overall energy needs and the potential role shale gas could play within it;&#xa0;2.1\n              \n \nAll prediction\ns\n indicate that \ngas will continue to play a significant and increasing role in primary power generation for the \nforseeable\n future, \nhowever \nthe role of natural gas in supporting other UK industries should not be underestimated.  \nA large proportion of the n\natural gas \ndemand in the UK \nis\n due to a \nmyriad of industrial applications \nwhich cannot be replaced by renewables \nincluding\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to industrial uses outlined above approximately 1/3\nrd\n of UK gas demand is driven by domestic heating and cooking.\n&#xa0;\n2.2\n              \nThe recent uncertainty around the future of the \nIneos\n petrochemical facility near \nGrangemouth\n was in part due to the lack of access to competitively priced feedstock.  This is in\n stark \ncontrast to the US example where lower energy prices and \naccess to \ncheap ethane \nfeedstocks\n due to \nthe \nemergence \nof \nshale gas\n has seen a major resurgence in\n \nthe \nUS \npetrochemicals industry\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential for shale gas exploration and commercial level extraction in Wales;&#xa0;3.1\n              \nTo date the focus has been on the shale gas potential of the Carboniferous \nBowland\n and \nHodd\ner\n \nShales\n and Dart has independe\nntly certified gas in place best estimates fo\nr the 6 contiguous licens\nes straddling the Welsh-English border of \n30.4 \nTCF (range \n11.1\n- \n52.4 TCF\n).\n  A number of other geological formations present in Wales may also have significant shale gas and/or oil potential including\n the\n \nCambrian \nTremadoc\n \nShales\n and Silurian shales.\n  \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n              \nUntil the exploration and appraisal testing phases are completed over the coming years it is difficult to estimate what level of commercial development could be achieved.  The commerciality of any particular unconventional resource play is determined by a number of \nsocial\n, environmental, economic and geological criteria and at this early stag\ne every scenario from zero\n commer\nc\ni\nal production through to the development of a major new industry \nare still possible outcomes for the unconventional gas industry in the \nWales\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential environmental and climate change impact of extraction and use of the gas;&#xa0;4.1\n              \nVarious recent studies by the \nRoyal Society, \nRoyal Academy \nof Eng\nin\neering\n and Public Health England \nhave all indicated a well regulated and \nwell \nexecuted shale \ngas \noperation should \nnot \nhave a \nsignificant \nimpact on the environment \nor public health\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n              \nNearly all the examples of environmental damage used by those opposed \nto \nthe \ndevelopment of an indigenous \nunconventional gas industry \nin the UK \ncan be easily classified into the following groups: \n&#xa0;\nor \n&#xa0;\n4.3\n              \nThe\n UK has\n long history of gas processing, pipeline operation and onshore hydrocarbon drilling\n and production\n demonstrat\ning \nthat \nenvironmental risks associated with these operations \ncan be effectively managed rather \nthan \npoor environmental performance \nbeing a systemic and unavoidable consequence. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n              \nClimate change is a global issue and given \nthat the UK contribution to global greenhouse emissions i\ns\n &lt;1\n.7\n% of the global total it is unlikely that, in isolation, any commercial shale production in Wales\n,\n or \nindeed the\n UK\n,\n would have a significant impact on \ng\nlobal \nclimate c\nhange.  \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n              \nHowever events over the last few years in the US have shown that low\ner\n gas prices on a continental scale can lead to a shift away from high CO\n2 \ncoal fired generation to lower emission gas fired generation with a net benefit in total CO\n2\n output.  \n&#xa0;\n4.6\n              \nGiven the presence of prospective shale gas plays being identified on every inhabited continent a simple extrapolation of the US example would suggest that global development of shale gas\n,\n in conjunction with renewables and nuclear energy\n,\n would displace coal fired power generation and lead to significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades.  \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhether the current regulatory regime covering such activity is adequate;&#xa0;5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has a long history of regulating onshore hydrocarbon exploration and production through the DECC onshore licen\ns\ning regime, local or minerals planning regime, \nCoal Authority, \nEnvironment Agency or Natural Resource Wales licen\ns\ning provisions and the Health and Safety Executive. \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n              \nThe\n current\n regulatory\n regime is considered to provide robust protection to the environment, local communities and workforce\n.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n              \nNotwithstanding the previous statement \nthere is a considerable amount of duplication both in the information being submitted and the number of public consultations required throughout the \nplanning\n and permitting regime that introduces significant uncertainty, costs and time delays to the well planning process.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n              \nA clarification of responsibilities of each of the regulators between surface and sub-surface development and a single application for the permitting of well operations to remove the duplication currently inherent in the permitting system would be of significa\nnt benefit to \nop\nerators and would speed up the exploration and \nappraisal\n of the shale resource.\n&#xa0;\n6.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe potential economic impact of shale gas production in Wales&#xa0;6.1\n              \nGiven very early stages of shale gas exploration and appraisal in Wales with only \n8.5\n% of the total area of Wales currently licensed for oil and gas exploration it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of future shale gas development\n.  A\ns previously stated the range of potential outcomes \nvaries \nfrom almost nothing to very significant.\n&#xa0;\n6.2\n              \nThe US example and recent reports by the Institute of Directors suggest that in the success case the unconventional hydrocarbons industry would benefit the UK, including Wales\n,\n due to:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n              \nThe exact scale of th\ne benefits would be directly proportional to the eventual scale of the industry in the UK, however given the UK’s leading role in unconventional development the first mover advantage could result in the export of skills, processes and supply chain to others that follow in the European or North African markets.\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n              \nIgnoring effects on gas price on primary energy production the benefits of an increased supply of low cost ethane\n,\n via domestic shale gas production\n,\n could have game changing effect on the petrochemicals industry.  A 2011 report by the American Chemicals Council modelled the impacts of a 25% increase in ethane availability on the petrochemicals industry in the US and concluded the following:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n              \nWhile no-one is suggesting a direct replication of this in the UK or Wales \nit does go some way to demonstrating the transformational effect that domestic shale gas could have on one particular sector of the economy.  \n&#xa0;\n7.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe role of the Wales Office and the Welsh Government in developing a policy framework for the exploration of shale gas.&#xa0;7.1\n              \nThe onshore hydrocarbon industry welcomes strong\n, consistent and evidence \nbased\n regulation policed by \na strong regulator\n(s)\n with defined \nterms of reference\n.\n  A clear demarcation between surface\n planning\n and sub-surface regulatory regimes and removal of unnecessary burden in terms of cost and \nhuman \nresources \nfor both regulator(s) and operator through overlapping regulation should be a priority of any government.\n&#xa0;\n7.2\n              \nAny new policy framework should aim to encourage early exploration activities\n through the removal unnecessary regulatory burdens, provision of clear and consistent guidance and encouraging investment by ensuring a stable fiscal regime during the development of this industry.  \n \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
