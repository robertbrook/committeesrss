[[[1.1]]] The basis for devolving funds and powers to local areas is to pass greater control over setting the vision and delivering growth and ensuring that businesses are involved in driving the economic prosperity of their areas. This is based on Lord Heseltine's recommendations in his report ' No Stone unturned' which called for the creation of a single cash pot, which could be worth up to £49bn, bringing together disparate funding streams from across Government without ring fences. However the reality is that funding levels are expected to be closer to £2bn per annum. Most of this is understood to be recycled funding for Local Authorities from transport, housing and skills budgets, including some 55% funding from Dft. However this funding is to be unringfenced for LEP’s to bid for on a competitive basis for a Growth Deal to help secure a share towards driving economic growth in their areas. &#xa0;

[[[1.2]]] The rational is fully appreciated in that there needs to be greater involvement of businesses in setting the vision and helping achieve economic prosperity for local areas. However there needs to be a balanced approach including democratically elected Members as key decision makers to tackling the key challenges and ensuring that the right conditions for growth are achieved and sustained into the future. &#xa0;

[[[1.3]]] The main advantages of devolving funding are that it is unringfenced and provides greater certainty over levels of funding anticipated over a longer period from 2015 -2021 (if the allocations announced in the summer of 2014 cover that period rather than simply 2015/16 levels only). This offers greater potential than cyclical funding bid rounds which are generally for specific Departmental deliverables over a very short period and require a detailed business case up front – such as Pinch points/ Growing Places. &#xa0;

[[[1.4]]] This should help areas with developing a more holistic programme and pipeline of projects focused on delivering economic benefits. The advantage being that there is better potential to deal with the myriad of complex issues and challenges that need to be addressed to create and maintain the right conditions for growth. &#xa0;

[[[1.5]]] On disadvantages, much of the funding has been top sliced from Authorities budgets, and not all is unringfenced. Also LEP’s will be the key decision makers regarding the priorities for funding for their areas, and Authorities will now need to be able to convince LEP’s regarding priorities. Therefore in many ways the decision making powers appear to be removed from the democratically elected local Members. There is a greater focus on ‘business’ leading on the priorities for their areas. While business involvement is critical in helping to inspire and innovate and inform the ambitions for local areas, this should be as part of an overall balanced approach led by democratically elected Members with ultimate responsibility for achieving the agreed outcomes for their communities.&#xa0;

[[[1.6]]] There is also a risk that money will be spent on bidding processes and specific support iniatives for a short period without necessarily addressing the underlying challenges and improving the conditions for businesses to grow and thrive into the future.  &#xa0;

[[[1.7]]] The model could be improved if Government made the funding available to ‘LEP area’s’, rather than a specific body with local areas deciding which organsiation was best placed to lead and manage the funds as ‘Accountable Authority’, much as the LTB arrangement works. There are options for different arrangements which could include County/ Upper Tier Boards, LEP, Economic Prosperity Boards, Joint Strategic Committees or alternatives. The key issue is that local areas should ideally decide and deals should be based on outcomes to be delivered and funding devolved on that basis. Government would still set clear criteria and conditions for allocation of funds in LEP areas such as requiring a strong evidence base, or operating across the LEP area or having private sector involvement&#xa0;

[[[1.8]]] It will be important to enhance the role of local Leaders/ democratically elected members who are the key decision makers mandated to deliver for their communities. Most of the duty lies with the local authorities given their statutory functions around transport and planning for growth and prosperity, and they are responsible for delivering on these ambitions.  &#xa0;

[[[1.9]]] Devolving funding over at least a 10 year period through an agreed model to deliver agreed outcomes that best fit local circumstances would enable local areas to take greater control and iniative. This would ensure a more holistic approach to address some of the complexities necessary to achieve step change or structural change needed in some areas, to drive forward economic growth and achieve longer term aims rather than a focus on immediate deliverables or targets. &#xa0;

[[[1.10]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The City Deal model is a good example where in Cambridgeshire we are    seeking to agree a Gain Share mechanism to help deliver c£500m of transport infrastructure investment to support growth and development. Through this mechanism local partners will work together through a combined authority and invest up front in infrastructure to encourage business growth. The area is to retain a share of the uplift in taxes over base to cover costs of additional investment. This type of model will enable the Leaders working with the LEP and key partners to invest up front in infrastructure and greatly improve conditions for businesses. Such ambitious plans and clarity of investment focus is vital for businesses to see when they are deciding where in the world to locate or grow. &#xa0;              &#xa0;

[[[2.1]]] There is a real lack of resources to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes across all levels currently.&#xa0;

[[[2.2]]] LEP’s have been set up with minimal resources and are intended to be lean bodies with a focus on achieving through their partners. However this means that the Authorities deliver many of the aims and provide revenue support for basic operation of the LEP. The lack of capacity and resources means in some case LEP’s are spread thin and don’t have the resource or expertise to support on transport schemes. Indeed this is the role for the Local Transport Authorities to assess, prioritise and deliver local transport schemes. However the difficulty is that Authorities budgets have been reduced significantly from 2008 levels, where both integrated transport and maintenance budgets were reduced by almost 45%. &#xa0;

[[[2.3]]] Reduced budgets, particularly on the revenue side coupled with a lack of available resource funding from Government, (apart from specific programmes like LSTF aimed at behavioral changes which has been useful) there have not been resources to undertake early options appraisal or scheme development work. Therefore in most cases, Local Authorities don’t have a pipeline of projects and focus only on key projects they can commit to in terms of resources to progress critical schemes to support growth. Most major projects and schemes require significant up front investment and often over a lengthy period of time. Examples for this area include Cambridge Science Park Station, which has been in the LTP for years, and while there was understood to be a good business case, there was never sufficient major schemes funding to progress the case to delivery. Through strong local leadership and a willingness to take the risk, Cambridgeshire County Council is progressing the case to approval for delivery. However developing the case and designing to a detailed stage has taken some 3 years and cost millions to take it to planning approval stage for Network Rail to take forward to delivery stage. &#xa0;

[[[2.4]]] Most of the current Government funding tends only to be available when schemes are at an advanced stage and for the most part have all their approvals in place. This means that schemes are unlikely to come forward unless the Local Authorities’ have committed to progressing them. There is little funding available to test options or look for more innovative solutions, therefore Local Authorities have to invest significant in terms of option appraisal /scheme development with little resources, particularly at the early stages. The LGF offers potential in terms of now building up a programme and pipeline for delivery over time to hopefully address priorities. That is provided there is agreement locally with LEP’s on priorities and funding.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[3.1]]] While a focus on the functional economic area is important, it would be helpful to have a more comprehensive vision and approach across a wider area. This would help ensure join up on approach and priorities around improving access to markets, and fostering relationships between related industries and spreading the benefits of growth.&#xa0;

[[[3.2]]] Ideally there needs to be a wider overview to ensure clarity and consistency across LEP’s and LTB areas regarding the challenges and priorities. There is a risk that at the moment, particularly for the key corridors that there could be a lack of join up and investment to support addressing key aims.&#xa0;

[[[3.3]]] Some good work was done in the past on Regional Transport Plan, and this type of overview would be particularly helpful if linked to an investment plan and join up on priorities for investment including key partners like Dft, Highways Agency and Network Rail. This could also then ensure join up on cross boundary priorities for LTB’s and LEP’s. This would be particularly helpful for transport issues which are not related to specific geographies and with a greater focus on corridors and improving links and accessibility to and between key destinations to support more efficient movement of people and goods’ &#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[4.1]]] There is a good working relationship at the local level between the Authorities across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough where the authorities are working closely under the Duty to cooperate particularly on planning and transport matters.  As part of this work the authorities have agreed their objectively assessed housing needs across the whole area and Members have worked together to develop a Draft Long Term Transport Strategy to identify the key measures and interventions needed to support growth and continued economic prosperity looking forward. 

[[[4.2]]] The Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough Shadow Local Transport Body has proven to be an effective and efficient body where the LEP and the Upper tier authorities have worked successfully to develop a robust and deliverable major schemes programme within a challenging timescale. The Body was set up to secure devolved major schemes funding in response to Dft’s request and systems were put in place to comply with requirements. Despite being awarded 33% less funding than anticipated, the LTB agreed 6 priority schemes within a challenging timescale.  &#xa0;

[[[4.3]]] Further to this, the LEP has now tasked the LTB with developing a programme of transport schemes to recommend to the LEP for inclusion in their Strategic Economic Plan to drive economic growth. This process is working well despite the challenging timescales. However there is some concern that while the LTB is developing a robust and deliverable programme aimed at supporting and facilitating growth, it is up to the LEP to decide on priorities and funding, and the duty will still fall to the Authorities to deliver on most of the ambitions although they may not have the resources to do so.  &#xa0;

[[[4.4]]] Looking forward, it is proposed to review the terms of reference and remit for the LTB to align with the LEP and wider role and geography.

[[[4.5]]] Our LEP has been greatly supportive of transport as a key priority for this area and recognizes the key role this plays in everyday lives and as a key enabler of growth. Indeed our LEP is already providing some £50m towards supporting the delivery of the A14 improvement scheme and has agreed the DfT funding previously committed to major schemes which is welcome. However there is a risk that the LEP will decide that they need to prioritise other areas now, without necessarily understanding that authorities won’t have resources without the LGF to progress key schemes that support and unlock growth.&#xa0;

[[[4.6]]] There is a good local working relationship between the LEP, LTB and HA, and Dft. However there is a lack of clarity regarding future expectations in relation to LGF, in terms of the future role and remit of the LTB, working cross boundaries and assessment criteria for LGF. More join up in terms of clarity on expectations for key Departments would be helpful to ensure consistency and certainty regarding the arrangements.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;

[[[5.1]]] The funding environment is challenging particularly given that levels of Integrated Block and Maintenance Block funding have been reduced by some 45% already from 2008 levels. There is uncertainty over what the proposed top slice of funding for the Integrated Block into the Single Local Growth Fund pot will mean for future transport funding from 2015 onwards. In addition, Dft has made it clear that there is unlikely to be any additional funding for local transport beyond the formula grant and LGF funding. 

[[[5.2]]] LEP representatives have worked closely with the LTB to agree the current priority major schemes and funding allocations and this commitment has been agreed. However the reality is that current funding levels for major schemes are not sufficient to help deliver on the priority schemes and although we are hopeful, there is a lack of clarity that the levels of funding necessary will be secured through the Growth Deal.

[[[5.3]]] LTB’s were set up to secure devolved major schemes funding from DfT. Although Dft confirmed there is a significant increase in major schemes funding, some 33% less major schemes funding was committed to the current priority schemes than the indicative amounts set out earlier.  This was most disappointing and for our area, as the Authorities are keen to make progress on the priority schemes to support continued growth, the authorities agreed to deliver 6 priority schemes. However in order to deliver theses, some 80% of the funding is being sourced from the local authorities, mostly through prudential borrowing. In addition there was little or no money available for scheme development or business case development so local partners have had to take on those costs. In our case, the LEP has been most supportive and stepped in to cover the costs of independent scrutiny of schemes which was an additional Dft requirement. 

[[[5.4]]] While a major uplift in major schemes funding is most welcome from Dft, it isn’t clear that this funding will be available to support the delivery of major schemes as all of this funding is now going into the LGF. The difficulty is that the LGF is unringfenced and can be spent on LEP priorities towards delivering economic benefits which can vary enormously in terms of outputs. There is also no guarantee that the LEP will see transport as their top priority and therefore no certainty that the funding will support priority transport projects. 

[[[5.5]]] In addition, LEP’s will be making decisions on priorities for the funding without necessarily understanding the local government funding context. There may be an assumption that Authorities will carry on with ‘business as usual’ and fund schemes. However the reality is that basic budgets have been reduced and unless Authorities can access this LGF funding to help deliver priorities, the programmes could well need to be reduced to match the reality of reduced funding.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[6.1]]] Devolving funding to local areas from 2015 to 2021 is welcome. However as the funding is going though the LEP, this means that Authorities and other partners need to go though another beurocratic process to secure funding towards priorities, and there may not be agreement on priorities. This essentially means that more time will be spent on this new process and making the case with less resources potentially for delivering the outcomes and outputs. &#xa0;

[[[6.2]]] The devolution of funds is welcome and over a longer period, but ideally it should be for local LEP areas to decide the best organsiation/ model for delivery. We see the benefit in developing a programme to address the range of challenges to help ensure the right conditions for growth and delivering economic benefits. However, there are concerns that there is no guarantee that the LEP or indeed Government will agree the priorities for funding for this area. There needs to be greater recognition of the role of democratically elected Members in agreeing priorities. Members have a duty to serve their local areas and deliver key outcomes on behalf of their communities. &#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[7.1]]] Having an agreed long term vision for growth and economic prosperity is an important starting point. This should be linked to an investment plan with clarity on priorities and key outcomes anticipated over time to provide greater certainty to investors regarding ambitions and expectations.&#xa0;

[[[7.2]]] Good collaboration and a joined up approach on resources to support priorities is also helpful in terms of supporting unlocking growth potential. A key area which is pertinent is Community Infrastructure Levy where resources could be pooled towards delivering infrastructure priorities. The funding generated by CIL doesn’t adequately cover the costs of infrastructure needed to support growth. However by pooling some CIL receipts across a wider area, there is greater potential to support the delivery of strategic infrastructure priorities early. &#xa0;

[[[7.3]]] Providing local areas with greater freedoms and flexibilities, particularly in terms of funding will enable areas to take more of the initiative to support the growth and prosperity of their local areas. One example that is providing successful in Cambridgeshire is the creation of a Rolling Infrastructure Fund whereby an initial £8 million of Government funding was used to establish a rolling fund. This funding was originally used to fund the Guided Busway (£5.75 million) and to act as pump-priming funding for Addenbrookes Access Road (£2.25 million) during the 2007-08 financial year. During 2008-09 the money was recovered from the Guided Busway scheme and then reused to provide front-funding for the Addenbrookes Access Road, therefore resulting in all £8 million being used to support spending on this project. The provision of this access road helped unlock up to 4,000 new homes on the Cambridge southern fringe development which otherwise would have been delayed due to cashflow/ recessionary impacts.&#xa0;

[[[7.4]]] In addition to this, an equity investment of £8 million was made to help bring forward the development as part of the Rolling Fund. These investments will now repay with interest, or an equity return, and the funds will then be available for investments to support housing growth across Cambridgeshire in the future. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[8.1]]] Currently the lines of accountability are clear for local decision making on transport expenditure. Most funding for transport is allocated to the Local Transport Authorities through either the Integrated Transport Block or Maintenance Block by formula, with some periodic competitive bids for areas like Pinchpioints, Growing Places, LSTF and BBAF.&#xa0;

[[[8.2]]] In Cambridgeshire funding is then allocated towards the range of requirements identified in the Area Transport Strategies. These have been developed working with County and Local District Members and clarify the policy objectives and identify the key measures and interventions needed to address issues and support growth. This process works successfully and well, and S106 funding is also collected towards mitigating the impacts of growth and supports the aims of the strategies.  &#xa0;

[[[8.3]]] Looking forward, from 2015, while the formula grant element will remain with the Local Transport Authorities, the amount of funding is being top sliced and there is less certainty regarding arrangements for local decision making on transport expenditure for this and the major schemes funding.  While LTB’s have been set up to receive the devolved funding, this will now be administered by the LEP’s through the single pot. However the assessment criteria and decision making processes are unclear. The other issue is that democratically elected Members are not necessarily the decision makers as the LEP’s are primarily business led, and the funding will support the LEP’s priorities. This is a concern as there may not be agreement on funding for priorities which could impact on the potential for areas to address the key challenges in terms of transport and create the right conditions for growth.  &#xa0;

[[[8.4]]] More consideration needs to be given the important role of the LTB in terms of decision making on transport funding. The LTB’s have been set up with clear lines of accountability, and assurance frameworks setting out clear assessment and appraisal criteria to ensure value for money and democratic accountability. In the Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough area discussions are taking place about aligning the LTB to better fit the LEP geography and wider remit regarding transport as there is recognition of the important role of this body in terms of supporting the LEP and recommending to the LEP a robust and deliverable programme that addresses the challenges and delivers economic benefits.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
