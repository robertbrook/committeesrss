[[[&#xa0;]]]Submitted by Laurence Smith, Asset Information Definitive Map Officer via email to Ros Emerys-Roberts, member of Stakeholder Working Group.  I am copying this to the Joint Committee on the Draft Deregulation Bill as the representations are of relevance to the call for evidence published on the UK Parliament website.&#xa0;My contact details are at the end of this message should you wish to discuss any of the points made further.&#xa0;______________________________________________________________________&#xa0;Dear Ros&#xa0;Further to our recent correspondence, please see our full response to the Draft Deregulation Bill below.  I have set this out in the same order as the provisions appear in the draft bill for ease of reference.&#xa0;1.              Page 21, para 16 - Extension of s147 HA '80 to restricted byways and BOATs: We agree with this new provision however feel that an additional criteria needs to be included in this section to allow limitations to be authorised where they are necessary for security, which is a major problem in rural areas in particular.  We also believe that the power should be extended to carriageways in general - many minor unclassified roads have the character of a byway, with a road running into a byway or bridleway with no obvious physical distinction.&#xa0;Further, the anomalous lack of the ability to rescind a s147 authorisation should be addressed.  It is widely known that many authorities have had to come up with alternative solutions because s147 does not allow these functions - this can present LA's with a very awkward situation.&#xa0;2.              Page 23, para 17 - enabling LA's to recover actual costs and costs of the SoS:  We fully agree that LA's and the SoS should be able to recover all of their costs.  However, we also feel that being able to require commuted sums for taking on additional burdens of maintenance would be a more helpful incentive, as is already the case for new road/footpath adoptions under s38 HA '80 Agreements.  In addition, making applicants undertake pre-application consultations with statutory consultees and the parish council should be a requirement, in order to weed out weak cases and to ensure that applicants have addressed likely objections before they become a time-consuming problem for an authority to deal with.&#xa0;3.              Page 72, para (3) 1A (1): Preliminary assessment using Basic Evidential Test (BET) and notice of applications.  We are in favour of this provision, it will not take much officer time to check the evidence and decide whether there is a reasonable basis for the application and will also ensure applicants are given feedback on their application shortly after they have submitted it.  Detailed guidance should be provided concerning the way in which an authority should assess whether the BET is met - a standardised method should be set out for use across all authorities to ensure applicants are treated fairly and consistently throughout the country.  We also feel that a BET can be applied to applications based on user evidence which could save wasting resources on evidently weak applications.  It is essential that the new legislation specifies what happens when an authority rejects an application, i.e. that the decision is final and is only open to challenge through the Courts (JR) process.  It should also specify whether the applicant can be given a set amount of time within which they may re-submit their application with further evidence.&#xa0;4.              Page 77, para 3: New section 53ZA.  We are in favour of this new provision, which will potentially enable us to save resources by not having to undertake a full investigation where an error is obvious.  This would of course be dependent on what the regulations require - guidance will need to be comprehensive to help minimise the potential for a challenge to an authority's decision to deal with an anomaly in this way and ensure fairness to all parties.&#xa0;5.              Page 77, para 5: New section 54B.  We are in favour of this new provision, which will enable some DMMO applications to be determined much more speedily where the landowners are happy to consent to this, and for a more pragmatic approach to be taken by surveying authorities to the often complicated situations that arise.&#xa0;6.              Page 79, para 6: We think it is a good idea for applicants to be required to include an explanation as to why they believe the DM&amp;S should be modified.&#xa0;7.              Page 80, para (3)1A(4):  We agree with the proposal for the OMA to contact the landowner, however it will be necessary for guidance to be included on what lengths the OMA should go to to discover their identity and address and how site notices are to be authorised.&#xa0;8.              Page 80, para (4) 1B (1): It is essential that the legislation or supplementary guidance specifies who will be responsible for covering the cost of an application to the Magistrates' Court and the subsequent Court costs that are incurred.  This also applies to page 81, para 1D (1).&#xa0;9.              Page 81, para 1D (1):  It is essential that Magistrates are given full guidance on how to deal with such appeals against non-determination, as many authorities have a substantial backlog of applications and numerous appeals may be made.  In particular Magistrates should have prior awareness of the RoWIP process and how that often sets out the way in which an authority prioritises applications and any formally adopted Statement of Priorities that an Authority may have.&#xa0;10.              Page 83, para (8) 3A:  We agree with this provision, as it will prevent cases being considered by the SoS on more than one occasion, effectively meaning an Inquiry will be held following the appeal if the SoS thinks the evidence is strong enough to merit this.  The legislation and guidance must however contain adequate provision to ensure that all interested parties are made aware of the appeal/Inquiry so that a situation can be avoided where someone who is affected by the order only finds out about it after the Inquiry has been held, as Orders made following a PI must be confirmed so there is no further right to be heard for anyone who is aggrieved by the order.  The applicant or any owner or occupier of any land to which the application relates are prescribed parties in terms of receiving notice of the appeal, however user groups and local parish councils are not mentioned, therefore we would ask that consideration is given to this, as this will help ensure all potential objectors are given an opportunity to be heard, reducing the possibility of a subsequent legal challenge from an interested party who only found out about the order after the Inquiry.  In general, we believe there is good evidence to suggest that good, thorough consultation is worth the extra upfront work to save resources in the long run and that this principle should be embedded in any new legislation or guidance.&#xa0;11.              Page 83, para (8) 3A (3):  We welcome the ability to decline to submit an appeal to the SoS if nothing in the grounds of appeal relates to an issue of relevance.&#xa0;12.              Page 84, para (10):  This provision appears to remove the restriction on submission of new evidence at a late stage that was introduced in the PINS rules for public inquiries.  We feel it is important that an authority can still make an application for costs against a party who it feels has acted unreasonably and caused unnecessary expenditure to be incurred.&#xa0;13.              Page 84, para 3B (2) &amp; page 91, para (4): We welcome the provision for the SoS to disregard any irrelevant objections and decline to cause an Inquiry to be held and the ability of the SoS to make an Order themselves.&#xa0;14.              Page 87, para (11) 4A: We welcome the introduction of a formal procedure whereby one applicant can transfer their application to another person, as this will remove the potential for disputes concerning the validity of an application where the applicant has changed.&#xa0;15.              Page 87, para 7 (2), Page 90, para 9(2) &amp; page 92, para (2) (a): We strongly support the proposal to remove the need for authorities to advertise both WCA &amp; HA Orders in the press.  This is often very costly and will mean less resources are expended in this area for authorities and for applicants to who these costs are often passed on to.&#xa0;16.              Pages 87-88 &amp; page 90-91:  We also welcome the proposed new ability for authorities or the SoS to separate Orders into different parts so that unopposed parts can be confirmed.&#xa0;17.              Page 88, para (4) 7A &amp; page 90, para 9(3)(2ZA):  We strongly welcome the new power for LA's to confirm opposed orders where the objection(s) are not relevant.  However there will clearly be objectors who do not share the LA's view that their objection is not relevant.  In this situation, what avenues are open to the objector to challenge the LA's decision?  Presumably they could contact the LGO, but only after they had been through the LA's corporate complaints procedure or they could apply to JR the decision, although their ability to do this would be reduced by the cost of applying to the Courts.&#xa0;Also, as the SoS can also decide whether objections are relevant, some less competent LA's may forward objections to the SoS for a decision rather than taking the decision that an objection is not relevant themselves.  How can authorities be compelled to treat this role seriously?&#xa0;18.              Page 88, para (5) (2B) &amp; page 92, para (7)3A(2):  We support the proposal for the High Court to quash the SoS decision rather than the Order - this will save resources removing the need for another Order to be be drafted and advertised, etc.  However we also feel that the High Court should still be able to quash an Order if it is deemed to be incapable of being confirmed.&#xa0;19.              Page 89, para 6:  The proposed ability for an authority to confirm an Order with modifications itself if the affected landowners consent this this will obviate the need for Orders to be sent to the SoS for modification where for example, a minor mistake has been made in the wording.  This will save the SoS and OMA considerable amounts of time and is therefore supported.&#xa0;20.              Page 184, para 316 removal of "Reasonably alleged to subsist":  We agree that this test should be removed for claims based on documentary evidence, however feel strongly that it should be retained for cases based upon user evidence.  We consider that it would be dangerous in the interests of natural justice to remove the 'reasonably alleged to subsist'  test for user-based claims, effectively changing the evidential threshold.  Conflict of evidence cannot be 'balance of probability' (Emery case).&#xa0;Please let me know if you would like me to expand on any of the above points.&#xa0;Regards&#xa0;Laurence
