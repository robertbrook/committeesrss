[[[Robert Plummer]]], BusinessEurope, and 

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]], Head of Research, Centre for European Studies.&#xa0;

[[[Q206 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Welcome, and thank you very much for giving up your time to come and help us in this inquiry. We are making a study of youth unemployment in the member states, following the suggestions from the Commission about the European Youth Guarantee and what to do about it, because obviously the general consensus is that youth unemployment across Europe is one of the major problems facing the European Union. I am going to ask my team to say who they are and what they do, perhaps you will individually introduce yourselves, and then I will tell you the format and we can get on with the questions.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I am Clive Brooke. Formally I was General Secretary of a British civil service union that represented tax inspectors. I have been in the House of Lords as a Labour Peer since 1997.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Peter Wilson. I am an independent Cross-Bench Peer. I have had a career mostly in public service, finally in that public service as a colonial governor, and then in some business and some university occupations.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I am Detta O’Cathain. I have been in the House of Lords for 22 years. I came up through the business route but I sit as a Conservative Peer. I have been mainly working in Select Committees since I came into the House all that time ago.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Roger Freeman. I have had both a career in the House of Commons as a Minister and now in the House of Lords. I earn my living by being chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ UK advisory board.

[[[The Chairman:]]] You have been 40 years in politics.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Not quite that long, no. I am not that old.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I am so sorry.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: Thank you so much. I am Roland Freudenstein. I am the deputy director and the head of research of the Centre for European Studies, which does not sound like anything very particular but it is the political foundation of the European People’s Party, which is not quite as North Korean as it sounds, especially as it leans in the direction of the conservative. Being the head of research I deal with everything, but we have done quite some work on youth unemployment, especially in the context of the upcoming European elections.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: My name is Robert Plummer. I am an adviser in the social affairs department at BusinessEurope. In that department I am responsible for employment, migration and education issues.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can you tell us in a sentence or two what BusinessEurope is?

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: BusinessEurope is one of the three organisations at a European level that represent employers’ organisations. It is the largest of the three. The other two represent SMEs and public employers. All are based in Brussels.

[[[James Higgins]]]: My name is James Higgins. I am the policy officer for employment at the European Youth Forum. The European Youth Forum is the European network of national youth councils and international non-governmental youth organisations, so we represent youth right across the Council of Europe.

[[[The Chairman:]]] The Council of Europe, not just the EU? So you have 40 member states instead of 28?

[[[James Higgins]]]: Yes. I think we go right the way to Azerbaijan.

[[[Q207 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] Thank you. Witnesses will receive a transcript of this session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the parliamentary website. I think that is probably all I need to say.Are you aware of any ways in which the perspectives, ideas and views of young people themselves have been gathered to help different bodies like the European Union, national or local governments to design responses to the issue? How does the European Youth Forum help to bring forward the views of young people in this respect? Before you answer that, I should just say that we have had two witness sessions with young unemployed people, one in Birmingham and one in Liverpool, so we know what the situation on the ground is like, but if you could answer that question, that would be helpful.

[[[James Higgins]]]: Thank you very much for that question. The European Youth Forum has a lot of interaction with the European Commission on the Youth Guarantee and youth unemployment, because this is the level that we tend to operate on. We have interacted quite a lot with the Commission on its proposal, particularly for the Youth Guarantee, and we give our own input and feedback based on the perspective of the youth sector. We were also invited to the Mutual Learning Programme of the European Commission, which was an exchange between member states on their own youth employment policies. We had an opportunity to go on to observe as well as to give some feedback to some of the ministries.Our level of interaction has been quite good. We felt that what we were communicating as the interests of young people was being taken on board. Prior to this meeting I contacted our national youth councils throughout Europe to find out their level of interaction and consultation. That has been more mixed. We found that despite the fact that in a Council recommendation on Youth Guarantee the role of youth organisations and young people was specifically mentioned to be taken into account, in many member states this was done on a very last-minute basis with Youth Guarantee and communication plans being more shown to the National Youth Council than consulted with.Other member states have taken more of a proactive approach and tried to engage with youth organisations. Others have interpreted it as just letting them know in advance what their plan is going to be, which would not be our vision of consultation with young people.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Do you personally see young people and the gritty situations that they find themselves in?

[[[James Higgins]]]: We operate in Brussels but we have gone to our national youth councils and events that they have organised. One that springs to mind was an event of Youth Guarantee organised by the National Youth Council under the Irish presidency. It brought in youth workers from Bray, which is just outside Dublin. They talked very frankly about the reality that they work with. They work with young people from a background of perhaps parents with addiction issues or no parents at all, and explained in real terms literacy problems and other day to day realities that they have. The scheme was under a scheme run by the Irish police force for young people who they identified as being on the verge of offending, and they put in youth workers to work with these people. They showed us some of the issues that they come across, and they were questioning what the Youth Guarantee would do for people with these sorts of entrenched problems.From our perspective the Youth Guarantee is not a panacea to solve all these problems; it is a first step to try to engage with hardcore dysfunctional young people.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: As has been mentioned, there is the youth forum at the European level, and another organisation representing students called OBESSU, the Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions. I think they have been quite widely consulted by the Commission on the actions that have been initiated at the European level. Beyond that, from the perspective that I can bring, I could not give you a more detailed assessment from the national level of the extent to which young people have been consulted.

[[[The Chairman:]]] So you do not have the same sort of experience that Mr Higgins has in Bray, on the ground, in the sense of knowing what the actual deprivation is?

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: No.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That is fine. I just think that sometimes a lot of people plan for other people way over their heads and do not realise where it is at.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I can say that the Centre for European Studies has just started an initiative called Up To Youth, which is an internet-based platform where young people, in the run-up to the European elections, can vent their ideas and make proposals on questions that concern them particularly, and of course youth unemployment is very prominent among those. We have had 20,000 participants so far in the last few weeks since it has been up and many more are coming. We have hundreds and hundreds of concrete contributions. We can go into detail on this later on. That is the one interface where we would like to come into direct contact with young people and they can tell us their ideas.

[[[The Chairman:]]] I think it is very important. They are sentient human beings after all.

[[[Q208 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Do you think it is important to disaggregate young people’s ages and maturity: for example graduates, those with no university background at all, those in their mid teens, and those in their early 20s? We are dealing with different categories of problem and different skills and background. How important is it to be so specific in dealing with what I call subgroups of the unemployed?

[[[James Higgins]]]: I think it is very, very important, because when we talk about youth generally at the European level it is young people to the age of 25, but there are vastly different realities in place. For a young person who is 16 or 17, has left school and has no formal education, there is a very different pathway or very different advice on how to find employment than there is perhaps for a young graduate of 25. It is important to categorise. From the research that we have, there is less and less room in the labour market for young people with no formal education or with a low level of skill.

[[[The Chairman:]]] The NEETs.

[[[James Higgins]]]: The NEETs, precisely. We support these people being redirected back in towards education, but for a young person who is perhaps a graduate, an engineer, and the labour market is not appropriate for their qualification, more education is not necessarily what is required. Different solutions need to be found.An additional point would be that young people, as well as being young, have other circumstances as well. They might come from a background that presents some challenges too. It is important to go into as many details as possible because a blanket solution might not help the situation very much.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: Yes, I think the point that has just been made about advice and support services is a very important one. There is a need for more tailored advice and support for young people, and obviously the different age categories then come into play significantly. If you have gone to university you have the benefits of in-house career services there. If you have left school at 16 you may not have the same access to them, or if you are trying to enter the labour market directly at 16 or 17 you may not know which direction you want to go in. At that age it is very difficult to identify the pathway that you want to take. That point about tailored support and advice, information services, to young people is very important, and for the different age categories.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I would like to come back to the original point about whether there are specific problems for young people in the labour market. I would say yes and no. No, because we are dealing here with a huge problem in the labour market, at least in many member states, which are too inflexible. They have to become more flexible. They have to soften the difference between the two sides of what we call the dual labour market. On one side there are the very, very stable, secure, almost lifetime jobs with high benefits and good social insurance and so on. On the other there is a kind of precarious labour market with no firm employment in the classical sense any more.The paradox here is that tackling those problems would help all concerned, but the victims of this dual labour market in countries like Spain and France—Spain has begun to do something about it but France and other southern member states have not—the real victims of that system are young people because they cannot even enter the secure part of the labour market. If you take the thing to the most strategic level, you need to work on the labour market as such. Having said that, I agree that there are specific problems of access to jobs and especially in addressing the question of skills, where you have to focus on the particular group of young people or even more particular groups within that age group.

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Can I ask a supplementary question, please? Do you share my view that the seeds of the problem are very often born at the age of 13, 14 and 15? Perhaps there is a one-parent family, disruptive behaviour in school and an attitude towards work and the workplace that is somewhat hostile? I speak with some experience as chairman of a charity in 120 British schools dealing with that age group and trying to teach them some kind of maturity and ambition.

[[[James Higgins]]]: For some young people, yes, I would agree with that. I am speaking more from an anecdotal basis than working with this group of young people, but this is the stage where some of these problems can develop. Another issue is that perhaps there is less social mobility than before. I have a feeling that the decisions that young people now have to make in order to be successful in the labour market they have to make at an extremely young age, and there is a lot of pressure on young people. They feel that if they make the wrong choice and maybe have a couple of bad years at school or are having behavioural issues or whatever, that it might be very difficult for them to get back on track again.It is really important to work with young people at this age, but it is also really important to try to improve social mobility so that when a young person perhaps discovers more maturity later on in life, they might manage to get themselves on the right course again rather than being locked out.

[[[Q209 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Could I just come back on Mr Freudenstein’s analysis? Would you describe the Dutch, the Austrian and the German labour markets as flexible or inflexible? Looking at it from where we come from—we have a relatively flexible labour market in the UK—the German labour market, to me anyway, looks quite inflexible compared with what we have in the UK. Yet when I look at their youth unemployment they do extraordinarily well by comparison with what we do. The same applies to the Dutch and the Austrians.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: Let me talk less about the Dutch and the Austrian case and more about the German one. Germany has been enjoying a very good economic situation for a couple of years now. That and the low youth unemployment are due to measures to make the labour market more flexible than it has been in almost 10 years. The so-called Hartz IV reforms enacted by the Schröder Government in 2003, 2004, did a great deal: corporate action, corporate downsizing and restructuring, and wage reticence on the part of the unions. All these factors combined created the situation whereby we are now reaping the benefits of reform.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Can you identify this more precisely for us? One of the issues that we can see in our country relates to apprenticeships. Employers do not participate in the way we see employers participating in Europe: accepting social responsibility for training and putting apprenticeships in place that seem to work extraordinarily well in Germany. We have much freer and loser arrangements. We have the CBI, which is way removed from what happens down the line, and we have chambers of commerce. In fact, we have a very wide variety of chambers of commerce and there is no legislation whatever that controls the way they operate. An argument has been advanced by some people that if they had to accept more responsibilities and were more involved and required by legislation to do it, which is what we see in Germany, we might have better vocational training than we presently have.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I absolutely agree. One has to separate flexible labour markets from corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility, or the entrepreneurs’ social mentality, is of course another factor that is very important to this. Yes, I agree that Germany has a quite efficient system of dual education and training, where education takes place in parallel to professional training: the German apprenticeship system. Indeed, some of my fellow Germans probably go overboard in trying to export that to other countries.I think it should be up to the countries concerned to say that this is an element that we can adopt in our own context and that others might not fit so well. I do agree that the vocational training system in place in Germany, and to a certain extent in Austria, seems to be working very well, but it is up to every other country to take things out of there and apply it to their own situation.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] We are trying to look at the countries that have the lowest level of youth unemployment and the factors that lead to it. Prima facie there may be a case for liberalisation in the labour market, but there are other aspects of the labour market as well that seem to produce good results, which I think your evidence indicates.

[[[Q210 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Just to go on from what Lord Brooke was saying, the general issue is whether the problem lies more with the training of people who go into jobs and their job-readiness, to use that awful bit of jargon, than whether there are jobs available? The implication of what you were saying, Mr Freudenstein, is that in Germany, for example, the training side is well done. The implication is that in other countries that is not so much the case. In general—not just Germany, obviously, but taking the EU as a whole—to what extent do you all see the training and job readiness of young people as a serious issue?

[[[James Higgins]]]: It seems like a bit of a cop-out to say both, but I will explain why I think it is both. A recent report from a US consultancy, I think it was McKinney, showed that in southern European countries there is a huge level of skills mismatch and that many employers cannot get the young people they need in order to fulfil the jobs they have. Even in countries like Italy and Spain with a high level of youth unemployment, this is a battle.A report from the European Commission in 2012 said that about a third of employees in Europe have either too many skills or not enough skills for their job. So there is a skills mismatch. I think that young people are expected to have the skills ready before they even try to go for a job and that previously employers perhaps invested more in training a person over a lifecycle. Because the labour market has changed a bit, there is a lot of pressure on a young person to be ready for the position.But if we put all the emphasis on young people being ready and skilled for the position, that overlooks the huge jump in youth unemployment over the past five years compared with unemployment among older people in the labour market. It seems that another factor is the precariousness of young people in the labour market. When an economic crisis hits, a lot of companies want to make reductions in their costs and sometimes for them the most cost-effective way to do that is the last person who comes in being the first one to leave. Usually that is younger people who have come into the business. It is a mix of both factors.A quite recent report from the ILO, the International Labour Organisation, showed that even though we are exiting the crisis in Europe and there is some slow growth, it is not being reflected in levels of a reduction in unemployment. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between GDP and employment rates at the moment.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Since you answered on both, can I just ask you an additional question to that? We talked about job readiness, rather like readiness for food. What about the mental approach? Is there an issue at all of job willingness, to coin a phrase: a division between those who seriously want a job and go flat out to get it, whatever that means, and those who will sit back and say, “No, we are not going to try.”?

[[[James Higgins]]]: Yes, I recognise that some young people perhaps do not have the level of job willingness, as was mentioned, because they had some problems when they were young or whatever, it has knocked their confidence back a bit and they are very far from the labour market. I think it is there but I think sometimes it is overemphasised. We work with young people who are very internationalised but I do not see it in the young people I have met. There is a lot of enthusiasm to get a job. A lot of young people just feel a bit helpless and perhaps lose their motivation even to try. That has been shown. Once you have had a period of employment of more than three or four months, your level of ambition to find a job rapidly deteriorates, and I think we are getting into that situation now.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: I think that as a starting point there needs to be economic growth in order for there to be job creation, and employers need to have a degree of certainty in demand for their goods and services before they will look to take people on. On the skills side, indeed there are mismatches. I think there are in the region of 2 million unfilled vacancies across the EU at the moment. At the same time, people are as highly educated as they ever have been, and the number of people going into tertiary education is growing all the time, yet we see that in a number of member states obviously there are very high levels of youth unemployment. So there is a question of mismatch.Employers also increasingly look for people who have some sort of practical work experience when they apply for a job, not necessarily that you hit the ground running but that you have some transferable skills that you might have already picked up from some sort of work experience that you can bring into the position that you are applying for. To help address that I think we need to look at education systems, particularly vocational education and training. You mentioned apprenticeships. With traineeships as well there is a chance to have some practical work experience in combination with the classroom-based elements, and that can help to stand young people in good stead when they come to applying for jobs. As part of that I think there is scope to try to better reflect the needs of the labour market within the education system, particularly in vocational education training.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I will pass on that.

[[[Q211 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I ask, on a point of interest, about this mismatch of skills? I remember that during the Irish presidency we attended a conference on employment. The point was really made very strongly that it is the IT skills that they are crying out for, and people do not have them. I would have thought that youth would be the IT experts because they are involved all the time with technology whereas the older people in the workforce find it slightly difficult. Secondly, the older people would be delighted to be relieved of the position of dealing with some of these IT issues. What is being done? Is this too general an approach to youth unemployment, or is there a specific target where people, maybe not in our report but later, say, “What about upping the skills of school leavers or even those from 12 onwards and indicate to them that if they really want to get first-class jobs this is what they ought to be doing”? Does anyone have any views on that?

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: What you just described might be termed digital literacy and that needs to become part and parcel of education, more than it has ever been in the past. Digital literacy, transversal skills such as creativity, critical thinking, self-learning and communication, with a view to the job market, need to become part of education in all stages. So does vocational training, even to bachelor’s and master’s degree level, as well as entrepreneurship education.Coming back to digital skills, again referring to the German system here, we need to do away with this black and white separation between education and professional training in firms and to try to see them in a holistic way.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: I think IT skills, certainly. The latest figure we have at European level is a shortage of between 700,000, up to 900,000 by 2015, or maybe 2020. It is broader than that as well. It is the so-called STEM skills—science technology, engineering and mathematics, of which ICT is part. Employers are increasingly looking for people who are trained in those skills, whether that is at vocational education training level or at higher education level. Those are very much the sorts of areas that employers are looking for.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Mr Higgins, you are agreeing?

[[[James Higgins]]]: I was specifically thinking of the Irish context with the skills in this area, because I think sometimes there is a disconnect between what is emphasised and what is integrated into the national curriculum. In Ireland we have been talking about the development of the IT sector since the late 1990s, but there was not a revolutionary change in the way IT was taught in schools. It can be reflected perhaps that the IT sector is very important for Ireland but from my experience a few years ago the construction industry was where young people went to find employment and now we are going back to the IT sector again. I think a long-term approach to these skills is very important rather than perhaps changing the emphasis on sectors depending on exactly what the timing is.

[[[Q212 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[The Chairman:]]] We have had about six or seven witness sessions since we came over here yesterday and you are the first people who have mentioned IT skills. Is this because the EU has limited competency in the area of education so they are not going to be specific and say that perhaps one of the big things in sorting all this out is to try to emphasise the importance of IT skills or to encourage member states to do something about it? I am just asking you as an aside.

[[[Roland ]]]

[[[Freudenstein]]]: Education is not only a national competency but in some cases even a regional one. The Länder in Germany even legislate on social policies, education, justice and home affairs and so on. Nevertheless, the European Union can encourage; it can provide incentives, like in all these programmes such as the Youth Employment Initiative within the framework of the European Social Fund. But I think the key is really with the member states. A best-practice model where elements are taken from one country and maybe integrated into the context of another country is the key to success.

[[[Robert ]]]

[[[Plummer]]]: Exactly. Education is very much a member-state competence. What the EU can try to do is to steer a little bit the—

[[[The Chairman:]]] Perhaps they ought to put in a sentence or two to these. In this situation it strikes me with real forcefulness that this is an area that is crying out for a novel approach, for people to encourage young people to get in there and expand their horizons, be the new Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or whoever. It is a young person’s game and I do not think they are really aware of just how valuable they could be or should be or would be.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I think it is an old person’s game for the moment.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Why do you think it is an old person’s game?

[[[Q213 ]]]&#xa0; 

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I would like to continue on this theme. I think it is a fascinating point the chairman has raised for us there about the interface between the two and when it comes in. My question is a broad one: what do you see are the roles of the Commission, the roles of national Governments, the roles of the Länder as well, if we take it to a reasonable level, of trade unions, of other partners, and employers, in the issue of solving the problem of unemployment?When we come here we hear a lot about the social dialogue. That works and it seems to produce evidence and, if we go back to the earlier exchange we had, seems to produce results, yet there are people who say you go so far and you should not go any further. We look at education there and vocational training. Who is responsible? Is it the employer who is responsible or should we now be looking to see that the authorities should be educating in the area of preparation for going into work at an earlier age, which raises issues of competency between the Commission and between the states? Who do you think is responsible and where would you say the social dialogue these days stands? Is it weathering or is it worsening, as we have been led to believe, or is it in fact still producing results in notable areas like Germany?

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: The stakeholders are a broad church, so to speak. To be contrary, it is no use for the state to ordain a dialogue of social partners on education or whatever else if the partners do not want to engage, so there has to be some degree of responsibility on the side of the entrepreneurs and the unions and the young people. States and Governments and regional Governments can be a catalyst. They can even be an initiator, but without the co-operation of the other parties concerned it is not going to work. There has to be a complex interplay.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: At the European level in terms of social dialogue we concluded what was called a Framework of Actions on Youth Employment last June. That document set out a series of recommendations for actions at member-state level to help address youth unemployment, looking at issues around education, transition into work, and entrepreneurship. That is something that was negotiated with representatives from employers and trade unions at European level. There are now recommendations, and it is for social partners at the national level to look at how they would go about implementing some of those recommendations. We will be doing a series of annual evaluations for the next three years to see to what extent those recommendations have been taken forward in the different national contexts.In terms of who is responsible, I think it is perhaps increasingly a mix of actors. If you look at school-level vocational education and training, and university level, there is scope there for more involvement of a range of actors, including employers, unions, employers’ organisations, education providers and the Government, to try to develop the education systems at the different levels in the best way that they can to facilitate the transition from education at whichever level you might need it into employment.

[[[James Higgins]]]: I think they all play a role and some actors have stepped up more to the role than others. As regards the European Commission, they have already done quite a lot on youth unemployment. I see their role as establishing the overall framework, perhaps the direction, and they have adopted that in terms of the Youth Guarantee; they have said that is the role they want to go down, and also to improve apprenticeships and traineeships. They have set the context and then the implementation ultimately falls on the member states. On that I was quite surprised that there was news that some of the member states submitted their Youth Guarantee implementation plans very late.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Some have not done it at all.

[[[James Higgins]]]: There was a deadline. I would have thought that with the Youth Employment Initiative and with the money that has been made available there would be a scramble to get them in as soon as possible and to do a varying level of consultation, so we were very surprised by that.On the lower level of implementation I think probably the employment services, business, trainers and youth organisations all have a role to play. We talk about the public employment services adapting their needs for young people. It is a bit of a difficult place to go when you are young.Even social actors such as youth organisations have a role to play as well. They can engage with young people and can get the hardcore ones who are more marginalised to participate. I was pleased to see that trade unions were mentioned as well, because I think that trade unions have a really important role. Young people are less likely to know about employment legislation, about workers’ rights, than other sections of the population. I think the trade unions as well, many of them have not been able to successfully adapt to young people because there has been a decline in many member states of trade union membership, especially among young people. From working with young people there seems to be a disconnect between trade unions and young people completely in many member states, so I think even the social actors need to step up in order to engage with this.The report showed that in some countries a quarter of businesses could not get the people they needed to fulfil their positions. I do not know if that is some people holding their hands up and saying they cannot get them, or ones that are really, really trying to engage and to get young people, but there needs to be this partnership in order to get those young people trained and into the jobs that are waiting for them.

[[[Q214 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] Could I ask you about training and apprenticeships, and about how much of an issue any of you think the question of the standard of training or of apprenticeships is? If it is, is this an area where the European Union should play a role or not? In other words, should it be the EU doing it, the Commission trying to increase standards, or is that something for nation states? I have another question, but I will come to it in a moment.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: I will go first. When we talk about the quality or the content of apprenticeships and traineeships, I think the focus should lie on the learning outcomes. That is crucial because it is what you learn through a traineeship or an apprenticeship that will develop a person’s skills and competences and help them gain employment.In that sense the simple answer is that at European Union level it is not a question for the EU to be setting minimum standards or guidelines around traineeships or apprenticeships. This is something that is best left to member states, taking account, of course, of existing regulations, of the vast array of industrial relations systems that there are across the EU and or existing educational practices. For that reason it is best left to the member states.

[[[James Higgins]]]: I think, again, the institutions have an important role in defining the framework. I agree that they cannot go in perhaps to the reserve competencies. We expressed a little bit of disappointment in the quality framework for traineeships that there was no specific reference to reasons in terms of apprenticeships, but we also recognise as well that it would be seen to be overstepping the boundaries to all of a sudden put in some sort of figure—and how would that correspond with minimum wage levels?I think the issue is that internships have cropped up recently in the past decade and a lot of the legislation of member states has not been able to adapt to that. How does an internship correspond with minimum wage legislation in the UK, where you are supposed to receive money for any hours you work, and if you get to five working hours then you have to be paid? Some member states have adapted to it, some have built in standards and others have not. I think the Commission is trying to react to this and ensure that we are not trying to solve youth unemployment here but also create another entry labour market for young people to go through before they can get into jobs. They have reacted to that to try to address it, but there is still a lot of work to be done.

[[[Q215 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] The other ball that was going to go with that is what do you think of zero-hours contracts, a contract whereby you have no fixed hours? You have a contract and the person who gives you the contract has certain responsibilities, but you have no defined hours, so you may have no work one day and a lot of work the next day.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I have no personal experience—neither do I know anyone who has personal experience—but the way it sounds, it fits in perfectly with the demand for greater flexibility and for getting away from the classical, incredibly stiff, 20th century type of labour markets that we have in many member states. Again, if the European Union can act as a catalyst in bringing best practice to all the member states concerned, I think that would be a good thing. That is something where the European level should act, rather than in setting rules or minimum requirements.

[[[Lord Wilson of Tillyorn:]]] You think the zero-hours contract is a good thing, not a bad thing?

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I believe, in the end, it is a good thing.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: I am sorry to disappoint you, but I do not have anything to add.

[[[James Higgins]]]: We would be very much against zero-hours contracts, firstly because they overwhelmingly affect young people. They are a reason phenomenally for people recently entering the labour market with no guaranteed pension or basic employment rights. It could also entrench intergenerational problems between older people in the labour market perhaps entering at a different time, when there was a more protected and regulated labour market, and young people coming in now.Also, the question was raised earlier about incentives to work. I think if you bring in a system of zero-hours contracts and a very poor level of social community, you erode the incentive to work. I do understand the argument for flexibility in the labour market but I think that in many member states there already is a very high level of flexibility. In Spain they already had a very flexible labour market. Currently over 90% of contracts created in the scheme are temporary contracts. I think there is an issue of flexibility in certain member states in certain contexts but the overall issue is not to do with flexibility. From our point of view it is to do with quality employment for young people.

[[[Q216 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] Before you answer my question, you have a fascinating looking graph in front of you. Is it the result of your Up To Youth study?

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: No, these are taken from Eurostat. There are a couple of interesting figures. To give you a couple of examples, the NEET rate—young people not in employment and not in formal education or training—has not changed. In other words, if you look at the 50%-plus unemployment in some Mediterranean countries, there are people who remain in education in some form, although they seek employment. They do not belong to the group not in employment and not in training, they stick with education.

[[[The Chairman:]]] That could be good.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: It could be, but of course it relativises a little bit these horror stories of 50% or 60%. Among these 50% or 60% you have some who have nothing at all and you have others who at least compensate for not finding employment at the moment by doing something useful. It strikes you and it is shocking that we have such high youth unemployment but it needs to be specified, and that is what these figures are for.

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] I was just wondering, coming back to the survey work you have done, whether there is anything in there that might be of particular use for us. We would be very grateful indeed to see it if we could, particularly with regard to people who raise the issue on the supply-side, and training.The main thing from my next question relates to the three major planks that have emanated at EU level for a youth employment programme or the Youth Guarantee, the Youth Employment Initiative that is now working its way through the system, and the decision to encourage a diversion of some of the European Social Fund money specifically to reduce youth unemployment. What do you think about all these initiatives? Do you think they are welcome and we should have more or them, or do you think they are perhaps encroaching in areas where the Commission should not be getting too involved?In particular, if we have the time, we are anxious to follow the money, the experience any of you may have had with where the money has been going, who it is going to and whether there is any assessment being made of whether there is value for money being secured. That links in part as well to where we started when we were talking about the needs of different groups of the unemployed.

[[[James Higgins]]]: We support the Youth Employment Initiative in a number of ways. First of all, to focus on regions with a very high level of youth unemployment, over 25%, I think that is the right place to start with the investment. We support the focus. The focus is on implementing the Youth Guarantee, so it is about training, it is about provision of jobs when they are there and it is about getting public employment services ready or better equipped to deal with the needs of young people. We like the focus; we think it is very good. The only issue we have with it is that we do not think it is enough: €6 billion sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but the original estimation of the International Labour Organisation in 2012 on Youth Guarantee was €21 billion.We know that money could come from national level or it could come from the European Social Fund. The reason that we think there needs to be a higher level of investment is that Eurofound released a report on NEETs in 2011 that showed that €153 billion was the cost in terms of lost tax contributions from youth unemployment. So we think we need a good investment in order to save money in the medium to long term.On the previous initiatives that went in, action teams were established to help member states spend the European Social Fund that had not yet been executed. I had a look into those reports and it seemed that most of the money went towards small and medium-sized businesses to help them employ young people. What I think is different about the Youth Employment Initiative, and what is perhaps more promising about it, is that it looks better to make some structural reforms if they want to do that, if they feel they need to do that on a local level, and to engage with young people, so the money is perhaps going in a different direction to try something a little bit new.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: Around the Youth Guarantee we can clearly see that in some member states and in some regions in particular young people are in a very difficult situation and they need some support and the EU can certainly help to deliver that on a short-term basis. I think that with the nature of the Youth Guarantee, it should precisely be short term. In the mid to long term you need to look rather at labour market reforms, and reforms of education systems. We have mentioned apprenticeships, perhaps looking to develop or strengthen apprenticeship systems. That is one of the points that, as employers, we have been making for the European Social Fund: member states that want to should be able to have an allocation of ESF precisely for that reason, around developing and strengthening apprenticeships. In that way, by undertaking those reforms of the labour market and education, you get to the point where you would not need the Youth Guarantee.As I said earlier, you need growth to create employment. It is not for employers to guarantee work, so we should rather be looking at some of the structural issues that are there in the different member states and in that way overcoming the need for a Youth Guarantee.One other point I would add is that on a short-term basis the EU can help to seed fund—I think that is the phrase—certain initiatives from a European level, but it is important not to reach a point where EU support is subsidising schemes over a prolonged period of time. It should be targeted on seed funding and initial establishment and development rather than over a long-term period.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: Just briefly, I think it is important to see that the Youth Guarantee is not a job guarantee. There is no way the European Union or anyone else can guarantee jobs. The Youth Guarantee is a programme that guarantees that we will make a concerted effort to improve the chances for young people to get employed, but I would re-emphasise what Robert Plummer just said; it is up to reform. Member states have to reform their labour markets; that is the key to everything. Then we need to tackle education systems and increase the mobility of young people, and improve language skills, for example. All these are different issues additional to the digital literacy that we talked about, but reform is the key. The Youth Guarantee is very much a temporary measure.

[[[Q217 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] One issue that strikes me that has been emerging and that we have seen back in the UK is the silo mentality that one finds in public services that are providing education and providing jobs. Bringing it together is extraordinarily difficult. Listening to you, I get the impression as well that one of the by-products of all this should be an examination of the public service offerings that then lead individuals into employment—the transition from education into work. Is there any specific work being done in that area into these kinds of topics?

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: Do you mean to tackle the silo mentality?

[[[Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:]]] That is a sense of what we are seeing here.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: Let me give you some of the ideas that the Up To Youth participants put forward. They all tackled more or less this question of how to connect the educational world with the business world or with the work environment. Schools should set up entrepreneurial programmes for young people interested in starting their own company. They could have used the word “entrepreneurship”, it is just that they did not use that term. That is another key. This even goes to popular culture in some member states, rather different from Britain, where entrepreneurship is not considered a particular virtue. Universities should establish stable partnerships with companies in practical work and traineeships, such as legal clinics and laboratories, led by experts and not only professors. All universities should have better officers who will help students find a job, depending on their studies. Also, their programmes should be dynamically attached to what the whole job market is asking for. It all goes in the same direction, precisely as you indicated, and this is what young people are telling us.

[[[The Chairman:]]] We are up against the time. Everybody here except me has to go back on a train.There are two things: first of all, your last question, Lord Freeman, then there is one I want to ask you, Mr Plummer.

[[[Q218 ]]]&#xa0;  

[[[Lord Freeman:]]] Perhaps we could have just one recommendation from each of you of good practice in any particular country that should be shared with all members of the European Union.

[[[James Higgins]]]: I would say the Finnish example of the Youth Guarantee. As was mentioned earlier, they have a Public-Private People Partnership, they have created various networks and it seems to work quite well—so well that they are going to reinvest in it even more.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: I will take it a bit broader and say co-operation between different countries, for example between employers’ organisations. If you are looking to develop apprenticeship systems, there is a lot to be learned from Germany and from others.

[[[Roland Freudenstein]]]: I am taking the example not of Germany but of the Netherlands, with the single contact point that centralises all services aimed at helping young people get work, advice and assistance—a one-stop-shop system for young people so they do not have to run around from institution to institution.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Mr Plummer, what do you think is the impact of migration on the EU economic crisis? Is it a help or a hindrance, and what about the brain drain? I ask you this because it looks as though you are conducting research on this and you are probably an expert. Perhaps you would like to write to us on it, unless we have time in the last couple of minutes.

[[[Robert Plummer]]]: Just very briefly, labour mobility we think is an important aspect of employment. It can help address the mismatch of issues that we touched on earlier. Clearly there are issues of brain drain, particularly in the southern member states. It is something that is frequently raised by Spain, Greece and Portugal. Mobility is not a silver bullet, it is true. It can play an important part in addressing mismatches and helping young people get work experience, traineeship options abroad and so on, but it has to be taken together with reforms of labour markets and education systems to help address youth employment.

[[[The Chairman:]]] Can I thank you very much indeed, all three of you, individually and collectively? It has been a great way to end our couple of days of evidence taking in Brussels. It has been a great experience for us and I am sure that the report that we eventually produce in April, of which you will have a copy, will benefit from all of this.You will get the transcripts and please send them back if there are things that we have misunderstood. &#xa0;
