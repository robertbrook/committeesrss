[[[&#xa0;]]]I am writing to support the proposals of the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA) to add provisions to the Bill.  The Friends of the Ridgeway have submitted a letter pointing out the additional protection proposed for National Parks and AONBs should be extended to World Heritage Sites.  The Avebury half of the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site lies within the North Wessex Downs AONB but the Stonehenge landscape does not.  &#xa0;The UK, as a signatory to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO, 1972) is obliged to protect and conserve the Site’s significance or outstanding universal value (OUV) and appropriately present and transmit this to future generations. The extra protection could be most welcome in assisting us in part with this role in the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site.&#xa0; The UNESCO Statement of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV) outlines the reasons for the Site’s inscription on the WHS and acts as a guide to what we need to protect and how this will be achieved. The SOUV underlines the fact that “roads and vehicles also cause damage to the fabric of some monuments while traffic noise and visual intrusion have a negative impact on their settings.”  &#xa0;The most recent Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site Condition Survey (Wessex Archaeology, 2010) points to evidence of damage by off road vehicles.  In the Avebury half of the World Heritage Site, “damage from the use of a monument as a routeway was recorded on the Herepath and The Ridgeway. The condition of these latter routes are both of considerable concern, as both are suffering from their on-going use by vehicles, including recreational off-road vehicles and quad bikes. It is recommended that efforts are made to restrict traffic using these routes and that remedial action be taken to stabilise the worst of the erosion caused.”  The survey indicates similar problems in the Stonehenge half of the World Heritage Site where there are 31 instances of ongoing impacts of vehicle damage. Damage on BOATS account for nearly 20% of all vehicle impacts within the Stonehenge area but represent 50% of the most severe level of vehicles damage. Policy 5c of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site Management Plan (2009) states that vehicular access to Byways within the World Heritage Site should be restricted apart from access for emergency, operational and farm vehicles.   Objective T of the Avebury World Heritage Site (2005) aims to prevent increasing physical damage caused to monuments and public rights of way by the impact of visitor pressure, and restore the areas significantly affected.&#xa0;Should the PDGLA provisions be enacted, it would be most beneficial if they could be extended to encompass the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site.&#xa0;&#xa0;Sarah SimmondsAvebury World Heritage Site Officer&#xa0;September 2013&#xa0;
