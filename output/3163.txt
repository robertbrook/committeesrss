Some other elements of the other pillars may also be relevant. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

This calls for:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Implement well-designed unemployment benefit systems and active labour market policies]]]&#xa0;B1.               Unemployment benefit replacement rates and duration, as well as social assistance benefits provided to individuals who can work, should be set at levels that do not discourage job search excessively and, especially where they are relatively generous, be made conditional on strictly enforced work-availability criteria as part of well-designed “activation” measures; moderate benefit sanctions should be part of such an activation strategy.&#xa0;B2.               Employment services should offer unemployed workers in-depth interviews and job-search assistance; participation in effective active labour market programmes should be compulsory after a certain length of joblessness that may differ across groups (e.g. immigrants facing integration difficulties, disadvantaged youth and older jobseekers); employment services should have adequate resources to perform these tasks and their functions should be well integrated.&#xa0;B3.               Performance of employment services should be assessed on the basis of their long-term impact on employment and benefit caseloads; active labour market programmes should be regularly assessed in a rigorous way to ensure that inefficient programmes are terminated, and that the mix of programmes is adjusted to suit the needs of jobseekers and the labour market.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Make other non-employment benefits more work-oriented]]]&#xa0;B4.               Gate-keeping measures should be strengthened to avoid individuals with substantial work capacity leaving the labour market via sickness and disability systems, while at the same time protecting adequately the needy; the degree of work capacity of people receiving such benefits should be reviewed periodically; rehabilitation with a labour market orientation should be available to those who have some work capacity; job-search support and financial incentives to go back to work should be provided for those with sufficient work capacity.&#xa0;B5.               Public early retirement schemes should be gradually phased out, and public and private pensions as well as other welfare systems reformed so as to remove incentives for early labour market exit.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Facilitate family-friendly arrangements]]]&#xa0;B6.               Family-friendly policies, including childcare support, as well as working-time arrangements which help reconcile work and family life, should be implemented so as to remove barriers to employment for those with family commitments.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Adjust taxes and other transfer programmes to make work pay]]]&#xa0;B7.               Employment should be made financially attractive vis-à-vis benefit receipt, notably through tax-benefit reform and the provision of targeted in-work benefits to make work pay, without creating excessive tax distortions or compromising public finances.&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Ensure that wages and labour costs respond to labour market developments]]]&#xa0;C1.               Ensure that minimum wages are set at levels that do not harm job creation significantly for low-productivity workers.&#xa0;C2.               Payroll taxes on labour should be reduced, especially on low-wage earners, where these are high and the budget situation allows, and health and pension contributions should be kept under control.&#xa0;C3.               In countries where uncoordinated sectoral collective agreements predominate and have adverse effects on employment, individual firms, through collective agreement, should be allowed to opt-out from sectoral agreements or the administrative extension of sectoral agreements should be reformed.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Enhance competition in product markets]]]&#xa0;C4.               Legal impediments to entry of new firms should be removed in all areas where competition is feasible, and administrative burdens on business start-ups should be reduced; start-up costs should be lowered and administrative procedures for the creation of new businesses simplified so as to nurture an entrepreneurial climate; move towards open international trade and investment in goods and services.&#xa0;C5.               Competition-restraining state control of business operations should be reduced.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Facilitate the adoption of flexible working-time arrangements]]]&#xa0;C6.               Obstacles in labour legislation which impede the emergence, through employer-employees agreements, of flexible working-time arrangements should be removed; tax and social security provisions should not discriminate against part-time work or other flexible arrangements which help reconcile work and family life and promote gradual work-to-retirement transitions.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Make sure that employment protection legislation helps labour-market dynamism and provides security to workers]]]&#xa0;C7.               Employment protection legislation should be reformed in countries where it is overly strict, by sanctioning unfair dismissal (for example by prohibiting dismissal on the basis of discrimination with respect to gender, age and ethnicity), but reducing constraints on dismissals for economic reasons; severance costs and administrative procedures should be made more predictable so as to reduce judicial uncertainty; reasonable dismissal notice periods should be provided so as to help laid-off workers find new jobs.&#xa0;C8.               Regulations on fixed-term and temporary contracts may need to be relaxed in some countries; in order not to aggravate labour market duality and thus undermine labour market performance in the long term, a more balanced treatment between temporary and permanent contracts should be pursued, with one option being that dismissal protection rights grow in line with seniority.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Promote transitions to formal employment]]]&#xa0;C9.               Transitions to formal employment should be promoted through: lower taxes on low-paid employment going hand-in-hand with better compliance of other taxes (notably on small businesses); reforms of labour regulations and business registration requirements, to make firms more prone to create formal jobs; and closer ties between social protection entitlements and work to encourage workers to declare their job.

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;D1.               In view of the key role of human capital accumulation for the achievement of economic growth and social objectives, governments should promote high-quality initial education and, in coordination with social partners where this is consistent with national practice, they should set conditions likely to improve labour force skills by:&#xa0;&#xa0;D2.               In order to facilitate school-to-work transition, it is essential to:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Annex C: Response to question 7]]]&#xa0;Should the EU and Member States take in to account the positive and negative socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment? How might any negative consequences be mitigated?&#xa0;The government has commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee to undertake a review of migrant employment in low-skilled work, which will cover a&#xa0;significant proportion of the migration of young people to the UK from within the EU. The MAC will report by the end of April 2014 and their Call for Evidence is open until the 13th of December.&#xa0;The MAC's review&#xa0;will look at the extent to which, and the reasons why, employers choose to recruit migrant workers; why these migrant workers choose the UK over other countries; the extent to which migrant labour fills gaps in the UK domestic labour supply and whether the work they find is a match for the skills they bring; and whether there are structural or cultural issues which inhibit the recruitment of UK-born workers, including issues such as motivations and attitudes to work. This will include a consideration of current government policy around helping UK residents to make the transition from education to the workplace. This work should significantly advance our understanding of the impacts of low-skilled migration into the UK, including how it impacts on young people in the labour market.&#xa0;24 October 2013&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

However, the implication of the response to this question is that individuals have not yet succeeded in making the complete transition in to the labour market.   Despite excluding those in full-time education, the data shows that the majority of this group are inactive rather than ILO unemployed. This figure may be affected by rising participation in education as it means that at any one time there will be more recent leavers from education who have not had a long period in the labour market. http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/news/careers-guidance-schools-not-working-well-enough-0 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-guidance-action-plan https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-a-culture-change-in-careers-provision-an-aspirational-nation https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-inspiration-vision-statement Provisional data for the 2012/13 academic year provide an early view of performance and will change as further data returns are received from further education colleges and providers.&#xa0; Caution must be taken when comparing against data from earlier academic years.
