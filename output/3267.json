"&#xa0;Written evidence from Northumbria Probation Trust.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUnder the Go\nvernment’s proposals, the Community Rehabilitation Companies \n(CRC’s) \nwi\nll supervise many of the\nse\n offenders\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI can explain the thoro\nugh initial training that Probation Offender Managers undergo\n, the mandatory qualifications that are required\n to be an Offender Manager\n and the follow up training on risk assessment, victim awareness and many other areas that are vital for staff managing o\nffenders.  \n&#xa0;\nHow can I say this with such confidence in the future when l do not know what training CRC staff will have beyond their initial induction which appears to be focusing on an introduction to the company?  &#xa0;How can I honestly reassure victims who are anxious, or who have little faith in the Criminal Justice System?&#xa0;This helps the Victim Liaison Officer to manage the case\n.  \nIt also helps the victim to have trust in the Victim Liaison Officer if they are knowledgeable about and understan\nd the situation and reduces the \nembarrassment\n, anger and distress they may feel by having to recount the \ncircumstances of the offence and their \nsituation to an uninformed Victim Liaison Officer.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere has been no assurance that there will there be shared IT systems with the CRC’s.  \nWill Victim Liaison Officers have access to CRC’s offender records?&#xa0;\nWill I be wholly reliant on CRC staff to inform me when a development occurs?  My concerns are that if this is the case, will the first that a victim knows of an offender’s release from prison, be when they pass them on a street, or are assaulted by them again?   &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nVictims worry that confidential information will be disclosed.  I am currently able to reassure them that we abide by Data Protection Policies an\nd \ncan \ntell them exactly where information is stored\n and who has access to it\n.\n&#xa0;\nCan I be confident in the future that this information will be only viewed by the Offender Manager in the CRC, or other appropriate staff who have a legitimate need to view that information and that it will be stored securely?  &#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;November 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
