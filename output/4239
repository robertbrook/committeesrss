defaultSortation is not currently possible in the recycled plastic supply chain.  defaultCentriforce Products knows from its own experience that contamination levels of 10% + are common in the output levels of UK MRF’s at the current time

default We are firmly of the belief based on many years of experience of having worked in the UK recycled plastic marketplace that it will not be possible to remove degradable plastics from the

default. Even a small residual percentage of degradable materials in the feedstock would have far reaching and potentially devastating effects on customers for recycled materials.
