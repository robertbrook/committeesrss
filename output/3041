defaultDo you think that the EU should be providing funding to Member States to tackle youth unemployment? Does EU action respect Member States’ powers in the area of social and employment affairs?
default&#xa0;
defaultYouth unemployment is such a major issue, currently, across Europe, that “yes” the EU should be providing funding, guidance and best practice.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe non-structural funded project “Youth Enterprise and Employment” (YEU) has been an EU funded piece of work across seven European countries/partners.  Funded by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme, YEU has looked at the different kinds of Govt policies in place, in each of the different countries, to tackle youth unemployment and/or youth enterprise opportunities.  
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the UK, the YEU Research has evidenced some strong and positive results in that young people can see what the UK Government is doing to assist youth employment, notably apprenticeships and education &amp; learning opportunities.   Many young people expressed an interest in self employment, but were not always clear as to where to find help, guidance and support.   
default&#xa0;
defaultStakeholders that took part in the research spoke of the need to ensure that young people have ‘employability’ skills and that young people should have a ‘pathway’ to education and/or employment.   
default&#xa0;
defaultEU action appears to allow some flexibility as to how Member States tackle the rising issue of youth unemployment and a “youth guarantee” would seem to be a good tool for maintaining pressure on all Member States to tackle this difficult, but critical issue. 
default&#xa0;

defaultHow do you think that the EU can best ‘add value’ to Member States’ efforts to tackle unemployment?
default&#xa0;
defaultThe EU can ‘add value’ in a number of ways – (i) in its ability to influence and drive actions, locally, which tackle youth unemployment; (ii) the ability to fund programmes which tackle extremely high levels of youth unemployment in some areas; (iii) the ability to share best practice and disseminate this valuable information. There should be more sharing of best practice (what works?) (what does good look like?) which could then guide future funding and programmes; (iv) further research development and investment is needed to support the jobs of the future; young people do not seem to be attracted to many of the jobs currently in the market; (v) greater focus on the provision of effective careers advice to young people from an early age that is related to present and future employment and regional trends; and 
default(vi) ensure that there is clearer sign-posting to existing and future provisions and initiatives.

defaultIs there sufficient disaggregation in EU measures to tackle youth unemployment between, for example, support for young people classified as NEETs, support for newly qualified graduates and general career guidance?
default&#xa0;
defaultIn the UK, stakeholders would generally see that there are different responses needed to tackle different types of youth unemployment.   So, tackling youth unemployment amongst young people who are disengaged from education or employment clearly needs a different response to tackling the rising unemployment levels amongst graduates (higher achievers, with greater mobility across Europe, but may have higher (and unrealistic) expectations).  In the UK market place, there appears to be different responses to different types of youth unemployment with central Govt focused more on providing their own national-policy-led interventions around NEETs vs. local deliverers (such as Universities) tackling graduate employment issues.   There are concerns about the lack of decent career guidance at an early age as suggested in the YEU research.

default              
defaultAre the EU’s accounting, monitoring and evaluation procedures sufficient to be able to determine whether EU funded projects to tackle youth unemployment have been successful or not?  Are there ways in which they could be improved?
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitoring and evaluation could always be improved, but there should be a greater focus on monitoring project participants over the longer term, post-intervention (which has cost and resource implications).  Success lies in a young person becoming employed and that this employment is sustainable.   For example, projects relating to creating and nurturing more start-up businesses often require success being measured in terms of whether the business has survived for more than 12 months and, then, for more than 2 years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt would be interesting to note whether there is longer term evaluation and whether young people have been engaged in the evaluation.
default&#xa0;
defaultMonitoring and evaluation should always go hand-in-hand with sharing best practice and the EU could further its work around the sharing and dissemination of best practice. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultHow do you think the funds allocated through the YEI and ESF could best be spent?
default&#xa0;
defaultVast array of projects currently funded.  Most will have great value (if success is measured).   
default&#xa0;
defaultFund allocation should be more ‘long term’ as programmes which ‘come and go’ (short term interventions) may be useful in ‘pilot’ terms, but may not tackle long-term and generational issues such as growing youth unemployment.  
default&#xa0;
defaultEmployers often call for better ‘career pathways’ for young people and stronger investment in ‘employability’ skills.   
default&#xa0;
defaultMore needs to be done to assist in the development of greater opportunities for young people to develop their work experience whilst in education thus preparing them for the world of work. 
default&#xa0;
default6
default              
defaultDo you think young people are consulted and involved to a satisfactory degree in the decisions around EU funding for youth unemployment projects and how they are administered? 
defaultThere is definitely a need to involve young people more during the formulation of policy and project phase as currently most decisions are made without consulting young people.   However, YEU has certainly sought to engage young people in its research and in its development of transnational learning material around enterprise and entrepreneurship.
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is always room to engage more young people via their own methods of engagement, e.g. social media.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOne suspects that young people are more likely to be engaged in policy making, but rarely in administering projects!
default&#xa0;
defaultSchools could also play a bigger part in ensuring that more young people are involved and engaged in youth unemployment and employment projects through SMSC initiatives. This will help match the ambitions of young people to the job market and build more realistic expectations amongst young people. 
default&#xa0;

default              
defaultShould the EU Member States take into account the negative and positive socio-economic impacts of youth migration due to unemployment when designing measures to tackle youth unemployment?    How might negative impacts be mitigated?  
default&#xa0;
defaultYes.  Negative consequences can only be mitigated via joined-up policy making so that Members States feel that the impacts of migration (+ve and –ve) are fairly shared and issues to tackle migration to, say, one or two particular Member States, can be examined.
default&#xa0;
default8
default              
defaultHow can the EU and Member States embrace new technologies and new methods of working to tackle youth unemployment?  
default&#xa0;
defaultNew technologies can assist in a variety of ways, including, (i) better ways of engaging young people in policy and programme development; (ii) providing better feedback and evaluation from young people; (iii) making e-learning more accessible and more engaging to young people; (iv) making enterprise and employment opportunities more accessible to young people including the learning needed around self-enterprise (something YEU has been looking at); (v) using technologies to ease the negative burdens of migration and drift which links with new and modern methods of working practices; (vi) effective ways of disseminating projects to target groups, stakeholders and audiences; (vii) utilising new technology and communication 
defaultplatforms to reach a wider audience when promoting and delivering services; and (viii) allowing for more effective, immediate and responsive monitoring of project activity and effectiveness from the project funders and managers.
