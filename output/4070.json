"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from Certsure LLP (BRC 58)&#xa0;\nAbout Certsure&#xa0;\nCertsure LLP is the largest third party certification body in the UK for electrical contractors, with 36,000 regis\ntrants with either our NICEIC or\n ELECSA brands. Though we launched in April 2013 as a joint venture between the Electrical Safety Council (ESC) and the Electrical Contractors’ Association (ECA), with the aim of providing funds for these organisations, our roots\n and commitment to raising \nstandards in the industry\n date back \n112 years to 190\n1\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nOur responses to questions raised by the Select Committee&#xa0;\n1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which members of the public are aware of the competent person scheme and that certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations&#xa0;1.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe acknowledge that awareness of Part P amongst consumers requires improvement \nand \nt\nhat is why \nmuch of our surplus fun\nds the ESC\n’s campaigns to raise consumer awareness of the value o\nf using a qualified, competent electrician. \nMoreover\n, \nNICEIC itself has promoted Part P through\n its\n Don’t Take The P \nand\n ASK campaign\ns\n and the use of registered electricians on \nhigh profile \nprogrammes such as DIY SOS and \nSarah Beeney’s House of Horrors\n.\n \nBetween March 2012 and March 2013 NICEIC\n \nreceived 336 items of coverage across national and regional print and broadcast media. \n&#xa0;\n1.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGovernment could commission a survey to provide a detailed picture of consumer awareness; however, a detailed survey would be \ncostly. The ESC carries out an annual consumer survey that gauges consumer awareness of \nP\nart \nP\n and the need to use \nregistered electrician\ns\n, the results are used to direct campaign activity throughout the year\n. \nM\nore important than \nensuring \nrecognition of Pa\nrt P\n by name\n, or awareness of the Competent Person Schemes,\n is \nensuring wide-spread\n public\n \nrecognition that registration is important for work in the home\n and that \ne\nlectrical work can\n be unsafe and illegal if \nnot done properly\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere have recently been concerns \nhave been \nexpressed over the potential for confusion amongst consumers as there is more than one register that references electric\nal firms registered \nunder Part P\n. \nIn o\nrder to overcome these concerns\n a meeting \nhas recently\n been held \nwith \nNAPIT\n and other industry partners\n \nwhere it was \nagreed to seek\n to\n \ndevelop\n \none easily identifiable quality mark underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians. \n(\nSee also \nSection 5).  \n&#xa0;\n1.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nn addition to consumer \ncampaigns, the sy\nstem of self-certification \ncontributes to raising awareness. \nEach year, over one m\nillion electrical installations are notified to Local Authority Building Control by our regi\nstered contractors\n. Every homeowner receives a certificate from \nC\nertsure\n \nplus \ndetails on an Insurance Backed Warranty. \nCustomers of \nNICEIC cont\nr\nactors also benefit from \na guarantee of standards \nand this will be \navailable \nto ELECSA c\nu\nstomers in 2014 \nalong with\n \ninformation on using registered electricians and electrical s\nafety from the ESC on any future work carried out.  Across all schemes that equates to over 8 million homes having received suc\nh a certificate\n and safety information\n since 2005\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere is no doubt that certification carries value because some seek to obtain its benefits without submitting themselves to the rigours of assessment. In \nresponse\n to these attempts to claim certification through use of the brand\n,\n \nC\nertsure operates a \nW\nall \nof \nS\nhame which displays information on contractors \nwho \nhave \nnever applied or been assessed \nor where certification has lapsed or been withdrawn.\n&#xa0;\n2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe extent to which those carrying out electrical works are adequately trained to meet the requirements of the Building Regulations and the extent to which all those working for a company are brought up to the same level of skills&#xa0;2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are two training routes electrical contractors may take into the industry. However training is just the first step on the path to \nsuccessful \nc\nertification\n. To use an analogy, training and qualification is like taking the driving theory test. The actual driving test assessment with an examiner sitting alongside the candidate is what allows someone to drive a car legally\n and is akin\n to\n the certification assessment of competence.\n  \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe traditional route into the industry is a four year apprenticeship with time sp\nlit \nbetween academia\n and experience with a sponsoring organisation. On satisfactory completion of studies and an AM2 test\n – a form of practical assessment -\n the apprentice is recognised as an electricia\nn. \nOriginally a\nimed at school leavers\n, this route\n is not \nalways \nrealistic or \npractical for those wishing to change careers\n. As a result, other accelerated routes were develope\nd\n. \nThis\n has caused some dissatisfaction among those who have spent a number of years in the industry\n, but it does not mean those routes are without \nmerit\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll of the qualifications to be eligible to apply for the Part P scheme are detailed in the Minimum \nTechnical Competen\nce\n (MTC) documents agreed between industry, regulators and Government. \nThis MTC document is also re\ncognised by DECC for the Green Deal S\nchem\ne\n. \nSince Part P was introduced in 2005, there has been a gradual \nuplifting \nof the MTC. From April \n2013\n, the \nrevised electrical MTC \nwill \nrequire authorisation and a Level 3 cert\nificate, which \ncannot be completed in less than 224 guided learning hours.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTraining and qualifications are set by \nawarding bodies such as City &amp;\n Guilds and EAL\n, the specialist a\nwarding organisation for the engineering, building services and related sectors\n. Where Certsure offers training and qualifications they do so under license f\nrom the awarding bodies. Tr\naining \nis \nprovided separately from the certification functions to \nensure\n that\n independence and impartiality\n is maintained\n \nand kept under review by \nthe United Kingdom Accreditation Service (\nUKAS\n)\n. \nAll surpluses are passed back to the ESC and ECA.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOnce a contractor achieves the correct level of MTC they may apply to be as\nsessed\n for Part P \ncertification\n which costs\n £\n370\n. \nAssessment recommendations are: pass; pass subject to providing additional evidence; rejection (don’t reapply); and furt\nher assessment to \nsee additional examples of work. \n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOver the last 24 months the pass rate \nhas been 81.4%. 6.2% were requested to submit further evidence for review and 12.5% requir\ned\n an additional visit. The high pass rate is a result of\n a robust pre-assessment process\n which means only those with a good chance of passing put themselves forward \nor are put forward \nfor assessment.\n&#xa0;\n2.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHaving passed the assessment,\n \na \nQ\nualified \nS\nupervisor (QS)\n has ultimate \nresponsibility \nfor signing o\nff work so in the event that there is an incident caused by bad electrical work the\ny \nwill be held accountable. Certsure \nmakes very clear the consequences for, and responsibilities of, the QS\n.  Following a tragic accident \nin 2007, \ncaused by \na contractor failing to test and inspect properly\n,\n Certsure\n \nwrote \nto every QS\n to remind them of their responsibilities\n. S\neminars\n are held at industry \nevents\n and NICEIC \n&amp;\n ELECSA live events to educate and update QSs on their responsibilities. \nThe QS system helps ensure \nsafe working practices are \ni\nnstitutionalized in a \ncompany \nand \nnot just left to an individual.\n&#xa0;\n2.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUpon its introductio\nn, Part P \ncause\nd mixed feelings within the trade, with those who had been involved in the industry for a long time questioning the need to register. However\n,\n Certsure is confident that only those contractors who\n can demonstrate their knowledge and understa\nnding of the regulations through a robust assessment will \nsecure certification\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.               The extent to which those carrying out electrical works, to which the Building Regulations apply, review or have their work reviewed to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Regulations&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll Part P registrants are \ncurrently \nrequired to be assessed annually through rigorous assessment of their work and knowledge and understanding of the Wiring Regulations. \nThere are over 40,000 contractors registered on Comp\netent Persons Schemes and their notifiable work is tracked and reported to local authorities. \n \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertsure and its previous entities have undertaken assessments under UKAS accreditation standard EN45011 since 2002\n (NICEIC)\n and 2008\n (ELECSA)\n. \nWe believed thi\ns was essential if contractors were to have fai\nth in the system. Not all Compet\nent Person Schemes are currently UKAS accredited but they are required to achieve this by\n June\n 2014\n and we welcome this.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAssessments are \nconducted annually through \na minimum o\nf \nhalf day of questioning and observation in the presence of a Qualified Supervisor (QS), whose responsibility it is to supervise and sign off the work of others.\n Additional assessment time is required where there \nare multiple locations\n or additional QSs\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nssessment\ns start\n with time spent at the contractor’s office or home \nwhere \ninsurance details, complaints system, contracts old and new, electrical certificates, health and safety policy\n,\n standards\n \nand access to appropriate test equipment to carryout test\ning \nare reviewed\n. Following this, the assessor and QS will review \na \nsample of work that \nis\n representative of the contractors work activities\n and are \nchosen\n by the assessor\n. At each location the assessor will ask question\ns\n of the QS about the installation a\ngainst the written specification and the wiring regulations. The QS will show examples of his work and demonstrate how the installation complies with the\n requirements\n. \nThe QS will also be asked to demonstrate testing and safe isolation.\n \nWe are consiste\nntly\n reviewing the standards QSs\n need to reach and these have recently been upgraded.\n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nGovernment has previously explored the robustness of the QS system and found it to be satisfactory. \nMoreover, it means that the Competent Person Scheme covers much more \nthan mere technical competence such as complaints, insurance, health and safety\n, management\n etc\n.\n, unlike GasSafe which solely considers the \ngas \ntechnical competence of the individuals\n. \n&#xa0;\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFinally, assessments are conducted by assessors\n, the majority of whom\n are electrical engineers\n who are themselves required to have achieved a level of competence in excess of that which they are required to assess. \nOur \na\nssessors\n \nare required to update their \nknowledge on a regular basis\n,\n as standards change\n. They do so \nthrou\ngh a mixture of CPD, face to face meetings, regional conferences, technical guidance and\n policy updates\n.\n \nThe competence of the assessors is reviewed annually by UKAS.\n&#xa0;\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have investigated \na \nreport \nin one of the responses \nof\n \na four minute assessment.  \nOur \nassessment\n report shows that \nduring this assessment \nwe\n assessed a rewire at one address and an additional circuit at another.\n \nThe contractor in question was deregistered from NICEIC for non-payment of fees in February 2012, but unfortunately continues to d\nisplay the NICEIC logo on their website. \n&#xa0;\n3.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, we are happy to write to the \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee in specific detail on any evidence that has been submitted where NICEIC and ELECSA have been mentioned.\n&#xa0;\n3.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have a team \nwhich\n \nhandle\ns\n complaints resolution and provide\ns\n support to consumers. If we receive complaints which are upheld then the relevant information will be discussed with the \ncontractor either at the next visit or immediate steps will be taken if the complaint is serious\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUKAS accreditation is only awarded to third party certification bodies that meet and continue to meet the requirements of EN45011. \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEN45011 covers much more than mere technic\nal competence \nand includes issues such \nas complaints, insurance \ngovernance\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertification bodies must demonstrate they are independent of any interests that could affect the certification outcome and must be impartial in all of their certification decisi\nons\n. To achieve this Certsure has a Certification Council made up of industry stakeholders representing users, regulators and the trade. The Council has oversight of certification\n \nactivities and ensures Certsure is independent\n,\n \nimpartial and operat\ning\n in a\n way that meets EN45011. \nThe \nC\nouncil can raise issues directly with the Certsure Board\n and \nUKAS as \nnecessary\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe\n assessment outlined \nin Section 3 is\n thorough and it \nis not possible to pass if the c\nontractor is unable to\n demonstrate how to work safely. Of those undertaking assessment, a number fail\n. They are \nthen offered examples of areas on which they need to improve.\n&#xa0;\n4.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, contractors are required by law to notify \ns\ncheme operators of any electrical works which \nthey themselves deem as notifiable. T\nhis is done v\nia an online tool which captures t\nhe information requested by \nLocal Authority Build\ning Control and sends \nthis information electronically to the correct L\nocal \nA\nuthority\n. \nA\n certificate\n is then sent\n to the hom\neowner confirming who did the work and that the contactor has made a declaration that the works comply with Parts 4 and 7 of the Building Regulations. Homeowners may be asked for this information by a conveyancer if they sell their property.   \n&#xa0;\n4.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nI\nndependent verification\n of \nassessment reports and \ncertification recommendations\n \nis\n \nconducted by\n qualified and competent \nstaff \nto \ndetermine whether the report is sufficiently detailed\n and\n if the assessment recommendation should be upheld or if further evide\nnce or assessment visits are required. \n&#xa0;\n4.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFrom June 2014, UKAS will accredit all scheme operators. \nUKAS are able to spot check our operation without giving any notice. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur scheme authorisations from \nD\nCLG and also compliance with UKAS accreditation (EN45011) require us to publish / make available a register of our contractors. \n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAs stated in 1.3 \nwe\n have agreed to seek to develop one easily identifiable quality mark, underpinned by a register of all full scope Part P registered electricians, that provides a single point of reference for consumers to refer to when seeking an electri\ncian to do electrical work in their home.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is anticipated that the proposal will include all licensed Part P \nscheme operators\n in England and Wales who meet the new scheme requirements in line with DCLG’s timeline, and would lead to the removal from the\n market place of both existing registers (ElectricSafe Register and the El\nectrical Safety Register).\n&#xa0;\nW\ne \nhave written to the \nDepartment\n setting out our intentions and seeking Government support in this regard.\n&#xa0;\n5.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe are keen to work closely with both the Comm\nittee and the Department on the development of a new \nmark\n, to ensure \nit meets the objectives of policy makers, and will keep all parties informed of ongoing developments.\n&#xa0;\n5.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, we maintain that competition and choice is fundamentally good for the \nelectrician and homeowner. Competition and the need to distinguish ourselves from others encouraged us to be amongst the first to seek UKAS accreditation, and dr\ni\nve up standards. \n&#xa0;\n5.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContractors need us to ensure we promote them and choose schemes on the bas\nis of which brand gets them \nwork. Competition ensures \nmore promotion to consumers. \n&#xa0;\n5.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBehavioural change and an increase in standards \nare\n \nbest achieved by using both sanctions and incentives.\n \nA competitive landscape creates the business benefits of \nregistration which complements the legislative framework of Part P\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertsure \nis\n \nconcerned by \nsome of the \nc\nlaims of corporate greed\n which have been put forward by respondents\n. \nCertsure LLP is wholly owned by the \nESC and the ECA\n. \nInitial \nassessment and\n annual registration fees\n – one of the smaller costs faced by a contractor \ncompared to other operating costs \n-\n \nare\n £370 \nfor the Part P scheme under ELECSA and the NICEIC\n, a fee which has been\n held for \nfour\n of the last \nfive\n years\n.\n \nAll profits made from our \nassessment and certification activities are reinvested back into the industry through t\nhe ESC\n or ECA. \nD\nCLG requires \ns\ncheme \no\nperators to ensure \nthe schemes they operate are financially viable and self-sufficient within a reasonable timescale\n.\n \nAny surplus\n may only be used\n for the general benefit of the sector in which the scheme operates\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDCLG \nlicense\ns\n \nscheme operators to run scheme\ns\n and\n conditions\n of that license can be changed to rai\nse standards\n. The original scheme authorisation in 2004/5 required Part P scheme operators to achieve UKAS accreditation within 3 years. The new conditions of authorisation \nare\n intended to make all schemes equal and to allow \nD\nCLG to terminate licences wher\ne the conditions have not been met.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nCLG supervises the schemes through the \nUKAS\n, which \nis a \nscheme requirement from \n6\n \nJune 2014\n but to which we already subscribe\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nD\nCLG provide regular feedback through the C\nompetent \nP\nersons \nF\norum \non areas for \nimprovement and engage\n with scheme operators\n at an individual le\nvel\n on complaints.\n&#xa0;\n6.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCompet\nen\nt P\nerson scheme operators also work with trading standards to enforce relevant consumer law when re\nq\nuired.\n&#xa0;\n6.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertsure operates in a transparent and open manner and \nwe would extend an\n open\n invitation to \nall members of the \nCommittee to see our operation and technical expertise first hand. \nA \nD\nCLG representative an\nd the Local Authority Building C\nontrol have already visited our\n offices to find out more about our business\n \nactivities\n.\n&#xa0;\n7. Conclusions&#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe current accreditation scheme,\n built on the \n1956 model, \nprovides rob\nust standards for the industry. When the Committee reviewed Part P i\nt stated\n:\n “\nA \nstrengthened Part P Building Regulations regime would be better than a fully mandatory scheme at the present time”. Like \nthe Committee\n, we do not believe \nthe review of Part P in 2012 and the reduction of notifications in kitchens and bathrooms \nwill benefit\n electrical safety and may present a real\n safety issue for householders. W\ne do not believe there is any evidence to suggest that the initial conclusion of the \nCommittee\n should be revised.\n&#xa0;\n7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have a culture of continuous improvement and welcome steps taken\n but not yet fully implemented to raise standards further in Part P. \n&#xa0;\n7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nContractor feedback \nis important \nand \nwe take it\n seriously\n. However, \nwe are confident of the integrity of the \nmany examples of electricians who \nhave volunteered their satisfaction with \nt\nhe value of registration\n.\n \nT\nhe scheme\n’s annual growth\n indicates the \nsuc\ncess and respect for our \nbrands in the marketplace.\n \n&#xa0;\n7.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertsure’s roots in\n \ndeveloping electrical safety standards and operating schemes stretch back for 112 years.\n&#xa0;\n7.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll \nsurplus f\nr\no\nm the \nactivities of Certsure\n are reinvested for the benefit of the industry\n and consumers\n.\n&#xa0;\n7.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\ne are happy to write to the \nS\nelect \nC\nommittee in specific detail on any evidence that has been submitted where NICEIC and ELECSA have been mentioned.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
