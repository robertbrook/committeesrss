[[[Written Evidence from the Police and Crime Commissioner for Suffolk [CST0048] ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[CRIME STATISTICS]]]&#xa0;Thank you for your letter of 6 December 2013 and the request for information on crime statistics.&#xa0;In my Police and Crime Plan I have set 4 Police and Crime Objectives which are underpinned by 14 performance measures.  These measures will help indicate how well my objectives are being achieved.  The Chief Constable reports on performance against these measures to me at my bi-monthly Accountability and Performance Panel.  The measures are not targets per se but they are one of the means by which I hold the Chief Constable to account for addressing performance.  I have attached a link to my Police and Crime Plan where you will see explained at pp27-29 the performance measures and the performance assessment framework.  &#xa0;http://www.suffolk-pcc.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Police-and-Crime-Plan-2013-2017.pdf&#xa0;Clearly the veracity of crime recording data is important to me if I am going to gauge the levels of performance in my Force’s area.  It will be no surprise therefore that I was concerned about recent statements made elsewhere about the integrity of crime recording data.  I immediately requested the Chief Constable to reassure both myself and the public of Suffolk upon data quality by reporting to my 5 December Accountability and Performance Panel.  I have attached the link to the Chief Constable’s report for your information.&#xa0;http://www.suffolk-pcc.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Crime-Data-Quality-Auditing Process.pdf&#xa0;I was pleased to note the detail of the processes set out in the report and to hear direct from the Chief Constable as to the strong audit regime in Suffolk backed up by strong leadership.  As a result, I am as satisfied as I reasonably can be as to the integrity of Suffolk’s crime data quality.&#xa0;&#xa0;January 2014&#xa0;
