[normal]Improving cycle safety[bold]I am a life member of the Cyclists’ Touring Club.  I have been cycle commuting in Greater Manchester for about 20 years, averaging 60 – 70 miles per week. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I would like to see more segregated cycle lanes, of a generous size such as found in Trafford Park. Not a bit of the road coloured different – that cars park in, forcing cyclists back into the stream of traffic. 
[normal]Pinch points on the road, where the road su
[normal]ddenly narrows, puts me at greater risk from motorists – cars and cyclists are forced closer together, and car drivers don’t like slowing down.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The key issue for me is for cyclists to have more rights, for example greater legal protection – in exchange 
[normal]for more responsibility required of cyclists. 
[normal]I wonder about a tax disc for cyclists. This would counter the (misleading) claim that motorists have more of a right to the road because of their disc. 
[normal]I wonder about compulsory cycle insurance – like car in
[normal]surance.
[normal]Finally, I wonder about a cycle registration plate – like a car. 
[normal]I hope the above is helpful.
