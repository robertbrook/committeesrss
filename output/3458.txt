[[[&#xa0;]]]Letter from Robert Goodwill MP to Karl McCartney MP dated 6 November 2013 (WRT 38)&#xa0;At the Committee's hearing on 28 October, you raised a concern that following the cancellation of East Coast rail services south of Peterborough that morning, due to extreme weather conditions, the rail operator had not provided a replacement bus service as they had done the previous week when services were suspended because of overhead wire problems. I promised that we would take this up with the rail operator, and can now provide a fuller response.&#xa0;East Coast have advised that they did contact both of their regular contracted bus service suppliers on the morning of 28 October to see if a replacement service could be provided, but that neither were initially willing to send out buses in the very high winds, for understandable safety reasons.&#xa0;As the day progressed, significant numbers of passengers began to congregate at Peterborough in the expectation of rail services resuming.  At around noon, as it became safe for buses to operate, and it was apparent that NR would not be able to open the route for some time yet, East Coast managed to book 11 buses to carry passengers from Peterborough to King's Cross. These buses departed from Peterborough at approximately 14:00. As the bus journey is around 2 hours, by the time the buses arrived into London they did not need to be used again, as the first route proving service had already departed King's Cross, at 15:00.&#xa0;East Coast have further explained that they did not advertise the provision of these buses as these would have been insufficient to cope with very large crowds which might then have materialised. However, the company has said the service provided was sufficient to clear the crowds of passengers that had been waiting at Peterborough for a long time.&#xa0;Clearly, this was a very difficult day for both transport operators and would-be passengers, but I believe East Coast did all it reasonably could help people with their journeys.   It is also relevant, I think, that from the evening of 27&#xa0;October onwards, information  had  been  published for  prospective passengers about the cancellation of rail services, advising them to avoid travelling if possible on 28 October, so that the number of people on the move was substantially lower than normal.&#xa0;I am copying this letter to Louise Ellman MP, as Chair of the Committee.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
