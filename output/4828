defaultSubmission from defaultIntu Properties plcdefault (FD03)defaultIntroductiondefaultWe are pleased to make a submission to the Committee’s inquiry into the many and interrelated issues relevant to any proposals to increase fiscal devolution to English cities and city regions. We note the Chair of the Committee acknowledges (commenting on 
defaultthe launch of the inquiry) that fiscal devolution will 
defaultcreate impacts which are not necessarily easy to predict ahead of any roll out of fiscal change and, we imagine, such knock on effects for good or otherwise will not become apparent until time has pass

defaultIntu’s response to CLG Committee defaultcdefaultall for evidence on the conceptdefaultIn terms of our business we seek to develop our activity and associated economic contribution in many parts of the UK (see map on p.2) and many of the locatio
defaultns where we operate face economic and social problems above the national average. 
defaultWe are concerned at the continuing trend for English regions, not uniformly of course, to underperform London and there is a need for better understanding of why this is happ
defaultening and how the regions can be made to perform better. Cities where the bulk of the population live and city regions
default deserve focussed support to stimulate 
defaulttheir ability to drive 
defaultrecovery and we look to any new devolutio
defaultn of fiscal powers to 
defaulttake account 
defaultof
default the existing efforts of the private sector in such areas.
defaultAn area well worth exploring and of interest to us as a business investing in so many city centres and regions of 
defaultEngland.  Enhancing local responsibility and
default fiscal freedoms must be accompanied by genuine accountability and transparency so that others investing locally and regionally can continue to plan with 
defaultthe best 
defaultknowledge and certainty. If fiscal devolution empowers better local leadership and longer-ter
defaultm finan
defaultcial strategies
default and investment then private sector investors li
defaultke intu will broadly welcome that outcome
default. 
defaultAlong
defaultside ‘leadership’ and closely related we see t
defaulthis 
defaultas a
default key
default issue
default. How would existing structures 
defaultchange
default/come together? 
default And other bodies beyond the current tiers of local government;
default LEPs, Parish Council's and Neighbourhood Forums, how would they be made/encouraged to act in concert as requir
defaulted/dictate
defaultd by new arrangements?
default In terms of this question and some others the success or otherwise of the LEP model may be instructive
default.
default 
defaultAny new models of fiscal devolution
default seeking to act
default as much needed spurs to local action should also encourage closer engagement a
defaultnd partnership with the private sector in consideration of the best and most sustainable economic outcomes.
default  The law of unintended consequences should be assessed especially in respect of any new structures which might be brought to life by fiscal devoluti
defaulton.

defaultdesigned to promote

default&#xa0;
defaultThese are substantial, compl
defaulticated and inter-related issues and s
defaulthould be considered ahead of any large-scale constitutional change. 
default The operation of Business Rates, a subject referenced in the recent Autumn Statement, should, in particular, be subject to review and, in our view, reform before extending fiscal devoluti
defaulton in any way.
defaultB) defaultIntu’s response to CLG Committee call for evidence on the detailsdefaultConsideration of fiscal devolution should
default not preclude early and
default detailed consideration of the nature and operation of any taxes, grants and formulas in current operation. In the case of Business Rates we and many others have called upon the government to review the operation of the tax and consider reform.
