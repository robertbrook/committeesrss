WWC007[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation [bold]Underachievement in Education by White Working Class Children [bold]&#xa0;[bold]I[bold]ntroduction[bold]This is a response 
[normal]to the Educations Select Committee’s Enquiry into 
[normal]Underachievement in Education by White Working Class
[normal] Children
[normal], 
[normal]from Impetus –
[normal] The Private Equity Foundation. Our response is 
[normal]wholly informed by 
[normal]interviews conducted for this response, with eleven of the organisations in 
[normal]our portfolio 
[normal]who are
[normal] working with young people from disadvantaged background
[normal]s
[normal], who have
[normal] poor educational attainment, or who are at risk of doing so. 
[normal]About Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation
[normal]Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation (Impetus – PEF) accelerates the growth of innovative charities and 
[normal]social 
[normal]enterprises helping disadvantaged
[normal] children and young people to get the start in life they deserve. 
[normal]We
[normal] 
[normal]use 
[normal]a unique model of 
[normal]venture philanthropy
[normal], which includes management expertise, pro bono business skills and long-term funding, in order to 
[normal]capacity build and grow, 
[normal]ambitious 
[normal]organisations
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Impetus-PEF
[normal] was formed in June
[normal] 2013 following the merger of I
[normal]mpetus Trust and the Private Equity Foundation. The new organisation has backed a total of 48 organisations, including 26 in its active portfolio. In 2011/12 the Impetus – PEF port
[normal]folio helped 566,000 disadvantaged people.
[normal]We also research and campaign on the topics of educational attainment and work readiness, to influence public deb
[normal]ate, and steer public resou
[normal]rces to where they might have most impact in these areas. 
[normal]About our port
[normal]folio
[normal]Within our 26 strong active portfolio, 11 organisations work with young people at risk of educational failure, or with those who have already ‘failed’ in mainstream education. Between them, they work all over the UK, and with boys and girls from dive
[normal]rse backgrounds, including white working class
[normal] young people
[normal]. 
[normal]11 
[normal]have contributed their expertise and experience to this response. They are listed in the Appendix. 
[normal]Why did we want to ask them?
[normal]We felt that the Select Committee’s Enquiry 
[normal]must 
[normal]be informed by
[normal] the voices and views of those who are working at the frontline with white working class 
[normal]children and young people
[normal], as well as with their peers from ethnic minorities. All the organisations we support have a track record of working successfully to 
[normal]either
[normal] s
[normal]upport educational attainment
[normal] of disadvantaged young people
[normal], or of 
[normal]working to re-engage them in education. They are well-placed to comment on any differences in challenges to educational attainment between white working class young people compared to those
[normal] from ethnic minorities. More importantly, they are best placed to share their successful methods of engagement that convince some of the most excluded and disadvantaged young people to reconnect with education and employment. These methods should be studi
[normal]ed, and reflected upon by every head teacher in the country. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Responses [bold]Specific Challenges 
[normal]All 
[normal]11
[normal] organisations work with white working class children and young people, and most also work with significant numbers of black and minority ethnic benef
[normal]iciaries too. The portfolio was split, with half responding that they did not feel white working class young people faced specific challenges that might hold back their educational achievement, and half responding that they did. 
[normal]However, all were knowledge
[normal]able about the challenges to academic achievement facing young people across economically disadvantaged groups. 
[normal]Of those who perceived specific challenges, 
[normal]many commented that the home lives of their white beneficiaries seemed more chaotic, and that their
[normal] parents were less likely to push them to attend, and achieve at
[normal], school, than their BME peers:
[normal]“There is a split between ‘school culture’ and ‘family culture’ – 
[normal]some 
[normal]boys don’t know how to cope with the switch between the two. What the school teaches is not 
[normal]always 
[normal]reinforced at home. We actually have to provide the kids with an ‘attachmen
[normal]t’ to the school, if
[normal] parents don’t provide this.’ - 
[normal]– 
[normal]Senior Manager, charity prov[bold]iding counselling services in schools[bold]“Our white working class kids find it hard to cope. School is too much of a contrast from their life outside school and this has an effect on their ability to find employment. They haven’t learnt the basic skills of co
[normal]mpliance and cooperation. The ‘skills’ they have are seen by them and their community as acceptable and necessary for life on the estates in which they live.” - 
[normal]Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West[bold]“We see Ghanaian and Bang
[normal]ladeshi parents who have worked hard, and they push their children to do well. Whereas our children from whi
[normal]te working class chaotic backgr
[normal]ounds get the opposite from home.” - 
[normal]Manager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in ed[bold]ucation[bold]The notion that white working class parents might not be strongly inclined to support their children’s education came up several times:
[normal]“Our data shows that our white beneficiaries have had significantly less positive family input into their educat
[normal]ion than have our BME beneficiaries, and that they are much more positive about work-based learning. 56% of our white intake had some positive attitudes about school learning compared to 86% amongst our BME boys. Our white intake also had significantly low
[normal]er literacy scores than
[normal] their BME peers.”
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]CEO of a charity working with young offenders[bold]“We find parents 
[normal]in our white working class 
[normal]areas are less likely to self-ref
[normal]er the
[normal]ir children to our services than
[normal] in middle-class areas. They 
[normal]may be 
[normal]afraid of seeki
[normal]ng, or receiving help, partly because of the stigma of this, but also 
[normal]possibly 
[normal]because they feel i
[normal]ntimidated by a system they don’
[normal]t understand, or feel part of. They 
[normal]may 
[normal]become passive in the face of it.’
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]Senior Manager, charity providing counselling ser[bold]vices in schools[bold]“We are finding, as we’ve opened a centre in a predominantly white working class area, that we’re having to do a lo
[normal]t more work with the parents tha
[normal]n we did at our centres in more mixed areas. Our young people who come from immigrant famili
[normal]es, their parents are not anti-education, but need extra support, and don’t know how to navigate the system. Whereas some 
[normal]of 
[normal]our white working class families have negative views of education, and no aspiration in that direction” 
[normal]– 
[normal]Manager at a charity offe[bold]ring homework [bold]clubs and academic support[bold]This respondent added that she felt 
[normal]“
[normal]having a parent who failed at school is a bigger barrier to educational achievement than having En
[normal]glish as an additional language”
[normal]. 
[normal]Another repeated theme was a lack of 
[normal]identity, and a sense of belonging
[normal], which many respondents felt affected white wo
[normal]rking class boys in particular:
[normal] “Thirty years ago, white working class communities round here were strong, now the opposite is true. The demise of the Unions and Churches in 
[normal]these communities has created a support gap. Too many boys rarely see their father go out to work. The lack of labour, and of community, has led to a lack of a sense of place or purpose. There is a lack of certainly for kids about where they will work as t
[normal]he labour market has changed dramatically” - 
[normal]Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West[bold]“Our white working class boys seem to have a less strong religious or cultural heritage to give them an expectation of staying on the straigh
[normal]t and narrow. If their parents’ relationship breaks down, there’s no safety net to catch them. They drift, and the schools don’t seem likely to step in. Looking across the young people we see, it does seem that any religious influence is grounding. Our whi
[normal]te working class boys just seem more lost than other groups” – 
[normal]Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEET[bold]s[bold]This respondent also reported that, working in a very ethnically mixed area of London, she felt that more of her white beneficiaries were probl
[normal]em drug users (mainly cannabis) than th
[normal]eir BME peers. Recreational use
[normal] was widespread across the NEET young people her organisation works with, but she felt the white young people were more likely to spiral into habitual, debilitating use. 
[normal]Those responden
[normal]ts who did not feel they could identify challenges specific to the white working class asserted that poverty was the chief challenge to educational attainment, and the factor most likely to 
[normal]detrimentally impact 
[normal]both attainment and opportunity. One charity 
[normal]CEO made the point that poor educational attainment amongst working class boys has been the norm for decades, but this has only recently been exposed by the
[normal] better
[normal] performance of 
[normal]girls, and certain ethnic minority groups. He pointed out that the gender gap
[normal] in educational attainment reverses in the workplace, and dismisses talk of ‘a crisis of masculinity’ as a modern apologetic for poor educational outcomes which have been present for many years. 
[normal]Some respondents also pointed out the higher school exclusio
[normal]n rate amongst young black boys, 
[normal]and commented that teachers were more likely to exclude black children for behaviour that would not result in exclusions for white children. 
[normal]Some of our respondents pointed out that the challenges they identified were more
[normal] keenly seen amongst white working class beneficiaries, but were not limited to them:
[normal]“Young people from Asian backgrounds typically have much less chaotic home lives and their families encourage them to succeed in education. This is beginning to change th
[normal]ough, and we’re seeing 
[normal]3
[normal]rd
[normal] generation English-
[normal]Asian kids start to behave much more like their White working class counterparts” 
[normal]- 
[normal]Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West[bold]“We do see a lot of ‘fatherlessness’ am
[normal]ongst our white i
[normal]ntake, but then
[normal] we do amongst our Black British young people too. I feel the big divide is between ‘black an
[normal]d white’ and ‘Asian’, due to 
[normal]the strong family background many of or Asian kids have.”

[normal]E
[normal]ducational 
[normal]N
[normal]eeds
[normal] and M
[normal]ental 
[normal]H
[normal]ealth
[normal]The majority of respondents agreed that mental health problems were common amongst 
[normal]all 
[normal]their beneficiaries, with depression and anxiety the most so. Special educational needs 
[normal](SEN) 
[normal]were also a recurrent theme 
[normal]– the charity working with young offenders recorded twice (34%) the incidence of statemented SEN amongst its white intake as amongst its BME intake. A practitioner at another organisation said that he felt there was a higher incidence of SEN amongst his wh
[normal]ite male clients, and that they experienced poorer diagnosis and poorer treatment than other groups. 
[normal]One senior manager working with NEETS commented that our school system prioritises attainment over engagement, which severely disadvantages and dis
[normal]-
[normal]incent
[normal]ivises children and young people with SEN. 
[normal]How to Engage Young People [bold]There were many 
[normal]similarities
[normal] amongst the successful methods o
[normal]ur charities use
[normal] to engage disadvantaged children and young people, either in mainstream education, or in ‘second chance’ a
[normal]ctivities designed to move them into education, training, or employment. 
[normal]Persistence was common to nearly all, but it is worth going into more detail here, as we feel the lessons are essential for those working with young people in schools, health services
[normal], and employment services. 
[normal]“[The key is] quiet tenacity. We approach parents with a focus on their children’s ‘emotional wellbe
[normal]ing’ and not ‘mental health’. We
[normal] expect a ‘does not attend’ rate of about four, with children and/or parents finally attending o
[normal]n the fifth appointment. This is different from CAMHS which has a ‘no follow up’ policy if a young person doesn’t attend.  Our staff are well-supported to maintain their persistence and resilience.
[normal] Staff need to be expert, nuanced, supportive, and not ‘cli
[normal]nical’.
[normal]”
[normal] – 
[normal]Senior Manager, charity providing counselling services in schools[bold]“We use an arts-based programme, because you can’t ‘fail’ the arts”. Our intake have a history of educational failure and any success is a huge motivator. Our curriculum builds li
[normal]teracy and numeracy by stealth, as well as confidence. Clients are called ‘students’, and when they graduate the course, this is celebrated with a ceremony attended by parents and local dignitaries. We’re also happy to spend money on cabs to get latecomers
[normal] in in the morning – the cabbie
[normal]s
[normal] we use are happy to hammer on the door to get them out of bed, because getting them into a rout
[normal]i
[normal]ne is crucial. It’s a good use of money because nothing is a bigger waste of money than an empty seat on a course.”
[normal] – 
[normal]CEO of a [bold]charity working with young offenders[bold]‘’We go to where young people are – and we make them an initial offer that’s engaging: ‘just come and play football’. We fit in with the people who are already making a difference in a community – we don’t compete with 
[normal]them. We assess the young people to make sure an intervention is right for them – we don’t want to set them up to fail, because 
[normal]that’s happened to them before.”
[normal] – 
[normal]COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning [bold]“
[normal]The key is 
[normal]to engage young people in a coaching relationship. Many organisations say they do coaching but all our staff are actually fully trained coaches. The adult to adult relationship between a coach and a young person is crucial – teachers simply aren’t able to
[normal] 
[normal]have this kind of relationship
[normal] with pupils. Our staff need to be char
[normal]ismatic, and good listeners – bu
[normal]t not afraid to challenge apathy or hopelessness. We meet young people in Job Centres and try to get a phone number. Then we call them repeatedly and expec
[normal]t lots of rejection – typically, it will take three or four chances to get them to e
[normal]nrol.”
[normal] – 
[normal]Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs[bold]“
[normal]The first few years at our Centres might just be about having fun, learning a few skills, and making new friends
[normal] from outside the immediate neighbourhood. After a few years, maybe at 14, staff are trusted and can ask questions about how things are going at school. The White working class kids we see are not used to being asked these questions, or if they are, they’r
[normal]e not responding positively. Our staff open their eyes to different responses and options. It may sound like slow progress, but we’ve got 20% of kids coming from workless hom
[normal]es with very chaotic home lives”
[normal] 
[normal]– Senior Manager at a charity providing youth cen[bold]tres in the North West[bold]“
[normal]The quality of our staff is key to successful engagement – selection is stringent and training ta
[normal]kes three months. Staff build up a very personal relationship with young people and demonstrate a strong commitment to them. We say ‘if
[normal] you join us at 7 we still want to be seeing you every week when you’re 14’. Where else can a child get this individual commitment
[normal]?
[normal]”
[normal] – 
[normal]Manager at a charity offering homework [bold]clubs and academic support[bold]“
[normal]We often hear that teachers treat the young people we 
[normal]see very negatively, and use a ‘shaming’ approach. They don’t treat them as equals. We have positive conversations with them about school and their aspirations for the future. One girl said that having a mentor – someone who cared – was really important to
[normal] her. And without positive role models, kids may find negative ones – such as drug d
[normal]ealers.”
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]Manager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in education[bold]“One thing we offer is community. We give these young people a unique mom
[normal]ent of being in a group which goes through intense experiences where they are taken out of their comfort zone. They get new experiences, encouragement, inspiration, and they do it with their peers.’
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs[bold]It is
[normal] easy to spot the 
[normal]recurring 
[normal]themes in these quotes. Again and again we see the importance of 
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Persistence
[normal] and resilience on the part of staff working with young people at risk of educational failure, or who need reengagement with education. This is contras
[normal]ted with the tendency of statutory services to withdraw support if it is turned down once. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]A one to one relationship 
[normal](often described as ‘mentoring’ or ‘coaching’) 
[normal]between a young person and an adult who is prepared to commit to them. Again, respondents commented that schools, and other statutory services, are not set up to provide this kind of relationship, but that its essential for young people who are not getting
[normal] this type of support at home. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Investing time in young people. No intervention can 
[normal]work overnight, or stop young people
[normal] from having to go back to a chaotic home.
[normal] Staff must be able to work with children and young people over an extended time, and not be forced to ‘move them on’ too soon. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]F
[normal]inding ‘hooks’ that 
[normal]draw young people in, and then 
[normal]let 
[normal]them
[normal] succeed when they are used to failing. 
[normal]These lessons deserve to 
[normal]be reflected on by schools, as well as by services such as CAMHS.
[normal] CAMHS was described by one respondent, with extensive experience as ‘an intimidating service’ for young people. 
[normal]What Needs To Change [bold]Many of our portfolio felt that the education system wa
[normal]s simply not set up to support achievement
[normal] for all young people, and that disadvantaged young people, in particular, bore the brunt of this. A common theme was that the link between educational attainment and future career success was not seen to exist by 
[normal](in particular) white working class pupils. 
[normal]“White working class boys don’t 
[normal]always 
[normal]see a link between exams and the kind of employment they’re looking for
[normal] – and 
[normal]not all schools equip
[normal] white working class boys with the skills the
[normal]y need to get, and keep, a j
[normal]ob.”
[normal] – 
[normal]Senior Manager, charity providing counselling services in schools[bold]“The education system doesn’t cater for the career aspirations of many kids”
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]CEO, mentoring charity [bold]“The white working class kids do not see education as the way out of their curre
[normal]nt situation.”
[normal] - 
[normal]Senior Manager at a charity providing youth centres in the North West[bold]“Alumni networks are really underused – every school should have an alumni network, so that children and young people can see, and access, people from backgrounds like t
[normal]heirs who have succeeded.”
[normal] [bold]- [bold]Manager at a charity offering homework [bold]clubs and academic support[bold]“Role models from the local community – people who’ve succeeded in employment - should be working alongside teachers, and expanding young people’s exposure to 
[normal]wider opportunities.”
[normal] - 
[normal]CEO, mentoring charity [bold]Charities also felt that conventional methods of teaching were unlikely to work for the children and young people they worked with:
[normal]“The trouble is, the school curriculum assumes engagement and a desire to le
[normal]arn – what happen
[normal]s
[normal] to children who aren’t engaged for whatever reason? Coaching would be a more effective method of teaching that guarantees engagement – it’s suitable for all abilities, and can make any subject relevant.” 
[normal]– 
[normal]Head of Coaching of a charity w[bold]orking with NEETs.[bold]“
[normal]There are many different barriers, and so not just one model of learning will suit everyone. 
[normal]How can teachers get to know what inspires and motivates individual pupils, and then teach with that in mind? That’s what we do.”
[normal]  – 
[normal]Manager at[bold] a charity offering homework [bold]clubs and academic support[bold]“Effort needs to be recognised. When young people do good they feel good, they feel better about themselves, and they are more likely to achieve. If they are not strong at maths, but they have learnt 
[normal]to feel positive about how much effort they have put in, they will likely continue to put in effort, learn more, and achieve more.”
[normal] - 
[normal]Manager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in education[bold]Many commented that schools often 
[normal]weren’t alert to, or able to respond to, the problems in a child’s life outside of school, which could stop them achieving in school:
[normal]‘What young people do outside of school is as important as what they do in school. Seven 
[normal]nights’
[normal] 
[normal]a 
[normal]week, weekends and holi
[normal]days, ki
[normal]ds are not in school – what’s on
[normal] offer to them
[normal] then is critical to their
[normal] achievements in school. They need to be challenged, they need to find ways of being successful, to mix with people from outside their immediate 
[normal]neighbourhood, form relationshi
[normal]p
[normal]s with good adult role models. We need to invest in opp
[normal]ortunities for young people to 
[normal]get stability, order, and fun into their leisure time.”
[normal] -

[normal]Chi
[normal]ldren can hide in large schools”
[normal] 
[normal]- 
[normal]Ma[bold]nager, charity providing interventions to keep at-risk teenagers engaged in education[bold]“We see massive truancy in our intake – one boy came to us at 16 who had been to secondary school on just two occasions.’ 
[normal]– 
[normal]CEO of a charity working with young offenders[bold]“
[normal]Policymakers and teachers
[normal] need a better understan
[normal]ding 
[normal]of the different barriers different groups face. When we train our volunteers we ask them to imagine themselves as a white working class boy, a Black British boy, and a Muslim teenage girl. It helps th
[normal]em understand the different stereotypes those groups face, and how they get in the way of learning.” 
[normal]– 
[normal]Manager at a charity offering homework [bold]clubs and academic support[bold]“The school system is not attuned to the realities of white working class lives, 
[normal]particularly the most disadvantaged. Qualifications are not the whole story – we must pay attention to what is happening at the fringes of young people’s lives.”
[normal] [bold]- COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning [bold]“Teachers as
[normal]sumptions and expectations about what a child is capable of are often based on the
[normal]ir
[normal] background, and are still far too influential on a child’s achievements at school.”
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]CEO of a charity working with young offenders[bold]Many respondents expressed a strong des
[normal]ire for a system which genuinely had academ
[normal]ic aspirations for all children, as well as high-quality vocational pathways and options. 
[normal]But most were wary that a resurgence in talk of ‘improved vocational options’ would actually result in low-quality, second-
[normal]choice options that served as somewhere to ‘dump’ white working class students who were not expected to achieve. 
[normal]Several commented on the lack of careers guidance on offer in schools now, as well as the loss of the Connexions service. 
[normal]One comment reflecte
[normal]d that schools don’t necessarily recognise, or value, the work experience that white working class boys might get outside of school:
[normal]“
[normal]It’s really common that white working class boys help their dads out with work in the summer – and sometimes in term time
[normal] 
[normal]too
[normal]. This type of work experience can be a really good thing – but do schools recognise it, and count it alongside ‘going to work in an office’?”
[normal] [bold]- COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning [bold]The Importance of Data [bold]A crucial part of what we work with our portfolio organisations to achieve is called ‘impact management’. That is to say, the practice of measuring key indicators 
[normal]in real-time 
[normal]during your work, and using the results to influence your practice, and resourci
[normal]ng, on a daily, weekly, and annual basis. There is substantial evidence to show that not only does this drive improved performance at an organisation level but it also 
[normal]improves outcomes for individual beneficiaries. 
[normal]We asked our organisations to tell us h
[normal]ow they used impact management, and real-time monitoring, in their practice, and to ensure they were doing a good job for children and young people. The methods varied, but there were similarities. 
[normal]“Attendance of a young person is logged every week, and t
[normal]hey are phoned if they don’t attend.”
[normal] 
[normal]– 
[normal]Manager at a charity offering homework [bold]clubs and academic support[bold]“Continuous monitoring – adult to adult reflection and review – is part of the coaching process/culture. We know how every young person is doing at ev
[normal]ery stage of their time with us” - 
[normal]– 
[normal]Head of Coaching for a charity working with NEETs[bold]“
[normal]Staff receive their clinic
[normal]al supervision on the same 
[normal]day they see their clients [children and young people]. 
[normal]This means they’re 
[normal]reporting
[normal] on a child’s progress the same
[normal] day they see them, and making plans for next steps”
[normal] [bold]- [bold]Senior Manager, charity providing counselling services in schools[bold]“Real-time monitoring of staff performance is routine – if any of the teams are submitting sub- standard results, they have to submit an improvement plan which is independently audited, and a site visit is carried out” 
[normal]– 
[normal]CEO of a charity working with young[bold] offenders[bold]“Our use of data is formative and summative
[normal]. Students have routine 1:1s with a Progression Coordinator, and their performance on the course is monitored. They, and we, need to know if there are any areas where they might be likely to fail, so it
[normal] can be addressed.” - 
[normal]COO of a charity using street football as a hook to reengage NEETs in learning [bold]There is evidence that impact-led use of data is key in improving educational attainment in schools, including those with disadvantaged intakes. Our organ
[normal]isations – some of the best-performing in the UK – are using data to ensure they know whether the children and young people 
[normal]they work with 
[normal]are improving and benefitting. They use this feedback to put in place remedial plans if they are not. 
[normal]It is crucial 
[normal]for all schools to identify and track the right data. From the day a child enters school, staff should be able to see whether they are making academic progress, and be empowered to act quickly if they are not. Good GCSE results for the majority in a school
[normal] are not acceptable, if a rump of pupils are allowed to underachieve, disrupt lessons, or simply not attend. 
[normal]As one of our respondents said, children can ‘hide’ in large schools. They cannot if a school is committed to tracking the progress of every child
[normal], and focussing attention, and resource, on those who need it. Tackling a child’s problems – whether academic, or in his wider life -  at 12 is more effective on every level than waiting until they are 16, and months away from failing to secure a single go
[normal]od GSCE. 
[normal]Conclusions[bold]We would be delighted to talk w
[normal]ith the Education Select Committee about this res
[normal]ponse, the eleven interviews 
[normal]conducted and the ongoing work of Impetus – The Private Equity Foundation.  We welcome the committee’s desire to better understand the challenges faced by white working class boy
[normal]s in the UK
[normal] education system
[normal].  We hope that hearing from an engaged philanthropic funder and the voices of many expert practitioners working in and outside of school
[normal],
[normal] is a useful contribution to the committees understanding of how 
[normal]collaboratively 
[normal]we 
[normal]can 
[normal]wo
[normal]rk towards an education system where every pupil, regardless of background is supported to succeed and transition successfully into the adult world of work and 
[normal]become an active and engaged member of society.
