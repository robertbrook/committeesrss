The Charity has\n a series of \nbroad salary bands \nappropriate to\n each grade\n which do\n not \ndistinguish \nbetween \nfunction and\n specific role types, but allow \nthe \ngroup\ning of\n roles of similar skill, professionalism and responsibility\n.\n  When \nthe Charity\n \nconsider\ns\n each role\n,\n \nit\n \nset\ns\n a benchmark salary range \nbetween the median salary of the charity sector and the median of the appropriate\n private or other\n sector for that particular role.\n \n \nApart from me\nmbership of one of our pension schemes\n,\n all of which are contributory, remuneration\n does not\n include any additional ben\nefits such as bonuses\n,\n \nas\n typically \nfound\n in the pr\nivate sector\n. \n&#xa0;\n1\n6\n. \nThe Charity\n \naim\ns\n to be competitive in the market\n \nso as\n to attract and retain the best people,\n \nwhilst always being mindful of the efficient use of donors’ support. \nTo achieve this \nit\n use\ns\n external agencies and salary \nsurvey \ndatabases to ensure that \nit\n \nbenchmark\ns\n accurately\n;\n th\nis approach is\n reviewed on a regular basis. \nPositions on\n the Executive Boa\nrd are individually benchmarked. While \nthe Charity\n \nrecognise\ns\n that \nit\n should not and do\nes\n not compete directly with the private sector in terms of remuneration, \nits\n \nsuccess in recruiting from th\ne private \nsector is strongly correlated to the breadth, intere\nst and diversity attached to \nits\n \nroles. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n \nRecruitment for senior roles\n&#xa0;\nconsists\n&#xa0;\nof assessments\n&#xa0;\nby\n senior managers and \nT\nrustees\n,\n incorporating a\n&#xa0;\ntechnical assessment, as required, to assess specialist capabilities.\n \nWhere appropriate\n,\n \nexternal\n&#xa0;\nagencies\n&#xa0;\nare engaged \nin\n&#xa0;\nthe search and selection of candidates.\n \nThese agencies\n&#xa0;\nsupport \nthe Charity\n \nin creating robust selection processes that are\n&#xa0;\ncomparable to those used in the\n&#xa0;\nbroader\n \nmarket.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Charity\n \nseek\ns\n to \nselect\n the right candidate for each role, to ens\nure that they will add value.\n&#xa0;\n18\n.\n \nThe Cha\nr\nity’s\n \ncurrent policy is not to disclose the remuneration details of individual \nemployees;\n however \nit\n \nconfirm\ns\n that \nthe\n highest paid employee is the Chief Executive. \nS\nenior executives do not receive performance related bonuses. \n&#xa0;Appendix&#xa0;Improving treatments and developing new ones19. Survival\n rates from cancer have doubled over the last 40 years. The science support\ned\n and fund\ned by Cancer Research UK\n is at the hea\nrt of these improvements. In 2012/13, \nthe Charity\n \nspent £351 million on research in institutes, hospitals and universities across the UK. \nIt is\n the only charity that funds research into all types of cancer, across the development pathway from basic biology to large clinical trials. \nThe Charity has\n helped develop life-saving and life-extending cancer treatments, including tamoxifen\n and Herceptin\n f\nor breast cancer and abiraterone for prostate cancer.\n20.\n \nA substantial proportion of Cancer Research UK's scientific funding is provided to \nits\n \nfive core research institutes in Glasgow, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester and London. Cancer Research UK is one o\nf the founding partners of the Francis Crick Institute - a world-class centre for interdisciplinary medical sciences, research and innovation, scheduled to open in 2015.  \n21.\n The Charity\n \nalso fund\ns\n work through fifteen Cancer Research UK Centres.  These C\nentres provide a national framework to deliver world-leading research, improved patient care and greater local engagement. They drive local partnerships and high-calibre collaborations between universities, NHS Trusts\n, industry\n and other cancer charities u\nnder a united strategy to accelerate the translation of research into the clinic for patient benefit. \n22.\n \nProviding an environment in which world-class research can thrive is crucial to \na\nchieving \nthe Charity’s\n \nresearch goals. \nI\nnvestment in infrastructure \nsuch as \nin the\n \nCentres helps to shape the research environment in the UK so that researchers can make the most of funding from \nCancer Research UK\n \nand others\n.\n \nIt also enables \nthe Charity \nto \nnurture the research leaders of the future. \nThe Charity\n \nsupport\ns\n research through \nits\n \ninvolvement in partnerships and networks, both nationally and internationally, as well as funding the work of individual researchers across the UK.\n&#xa0;Arming everyone with vital information23.\n \nIn 2012/13 \nthe Charity \nalso spent £17 mill\nion on providing information to people affected by cancer, raising awareness of cancer risks and symptoms, and influencing health, science and charity policies.  \nIt\n \nprovide\ns\n information and communicate\ns\n with patients and the public about cancer prevention \nand early diagnosis to widen the impact \nof \nits\n \nresearch.  \nIt\n \nalso\n work\ns\n to influence decision-\nmakers to create environments that will lead to faster progress in the fight against cancer. \n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
