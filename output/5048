default&#xa0;
defaultThe London Assembly Police and Crime Committee welcome
defaults
default the opportunity to respond to the Home Affairs Committee inquiry on police and crime commissioners. 
defaultThe following 
defaultis a cross-party perspective on 
defaultsome issues we have experienced in London which might be relevant in terms of your national scrutiny work. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSince the establishment of the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) in January 2012
default, the Assembly and 
defaultmy Committee
default 
defaulthave experienced a 
defaultnumber of issues resulting
default,
default in particular
default,
default from different interpretations of the legislation. 
defaultWe are making good progress in resolving these issues, e
defaultnabling the 
defaultCommittee 
defaultto hold MOPAC to account and investigate issues of importance to policing and crime reduction in London. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTransparency and data availability are crucial for police and crime panels to be effective. My 
defaultCommittee 
defaulthas been
default determined to ensure that the new governance arrangements 
defaultestablished through the introduction of police and crime commissioners 
defaultdo not diminish 
defaultthe transparency and accountability of policing in London.
default 
defaultAlthough the new datastore website provides a lot of new data, obtaining information from MOPAC, as elected members, 
defaulthas been a challenge but 
defaultI believe 
defaultthe C
defaultommittee
default ha
defaults
default made good progress 
defaultin establishing
default and embedding
default the scrutiny role the Assembly h
defaultas to play. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNonetheless, full and regular access to information has been an ongoing issue for the Committee. The Deputy Mayor 
defaultfor Policing and Crime 
defaultinitially insisted that requests for information should be made to MOPAC rather than to the Met
default, since the PCC’s role is to scrutinise MOPAC not the Met,
default 
default&#xa0;
default and said he would assess whether or not the information should be provided. Similarly, he sought to limit appearances by senior Met officers, including the Commissioner, at the Committee. 
defaultWe
default argued that, if 
defaultthe Committee 
defaultneeds information from the Met to fulfil its functions, the Met should provide it directly
default, noting that as Assembly Members we would be entitled to this information if we requested in that capacity anyway
default. It 
defaultmust be 
defaultup to 
defaultpolice and crime panel 
defaultmembers to assess what information they require to hold 
defaulttheir elected commissioners 
defaultto account
default 
defaultand it cannot be right for 
defaultcommissioners
default to try to make that judgement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultT
defaulthe Deputy Mayor 
defaultalso 
defaultsought to limit the 
defaultrole of the 
defaultAssembly’s Police and Crime 
defaultCommittee and the information available to it. The Committee argued that effectively holding MOPAC to account requires the Committee to look in detail at the full range of areas of policing and crime reduction, whether or not a particular area i
defaults a current priority for MOPAC. 
defaultPolice and crime panels need to understand the broad policing landscape in their area and must have the ability to investigate issues that are not priorities for their elected commissioners. 
defaultBecause the legislation does not set out in detail what information and access police and crime panels should have, this can depend on the individuals in elected commissioner posts. In our case, it took the intervention of the Mayor to resolve some of the issues we faced following a new Deputy Mayor’s appointment. This must lead to a concern that
default, without clearer guidance,
default 
defaultn
defaultew individual
defaults
default 
defaultin the elected commissioner posts might bring a new set of challenges 
defaultfor police and crime panels 
default– e.g. different expectations around transparency
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are, however, areas where a lack of information has made our scrutiny work more difficult. Decisions previously taken in public by the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), supported by public reports and minutes, are now often made in private between the Deputy Mayor and the Met. Our recent investigation of the decision to expand Taser deployment in London demonstrated why such discussions must take place in public. Despite assurances that MOPAC would provide more public information than the MPA, less information is now available than under the old regime. The periodic updates received by the MPA on a range of programmes and strategies being pursued by the Met are no longer available and monthly financial information, previously reported through the MPA Finance and Resources Committee, was entirely withdrawn for a time and now published in a more limited way. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSince it was established
default,
default the 
defaultAssembly’s Police and Crime 
defaultCommittee 
defaulthas
default 
defaultinvestigated issues that are important for Londoners and held the Deputy Mayor to account on a cross-party basis. 
defaultAs 
defaultexample
defaults,
default t
defaulthe Committee has made 
defaultre
defaultcommendations 
defaultto improve MOPAC’s proposals for new Safer Neighbourhood Boards;
default 
defaultto reverse the Met’s
default poor pe
defaultrformance in supporting victims of crime
default;
default and 
defaulthas
default set out a series of steps that should be taken by the Met and MOPAC before any 
defaultfurther 
defaultchanges are made to the availability or range of 
defaultso called 
defaultless
default-
defaultlethal weapons carried by police officers in London.
default 
defaultAdditionally, f
defaultollowing a detailed examination of the Mayor’s draft Police and Crime Plan
default,
default the Committee called for a number of improvements, including: more sophisticated performance targets; a clearer explanation of how MOPAC w
defaultould
default work with the Met to improve publ
defaultic confidence in the police;
default 
defaultclarity around 
defaulthow the new neighbourhood policing model will continue to support community engagement
default, accountability and confidence; and 
defaultmore information about 
defaulthow MOPAC w
defaultould
default work with partner organisations to achieve the Mayor’s criminal justice and community safety objectives.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee will continue to help shape the Mayor’s strategy for policing in the capital and question senior officers from the Met and MOPAC on a range of issues, as we have to date on anti-terrorism powers; implementation of the Met’s new local policing model; stop and search; and undercover policing. There are outstanding issues which still require answers and performance improvements, such as the effectiveness of MOPAC in promoting police integrity, the handling of police complaints and the disciplinary process for senior officers. Questions also remain as to how MOPAC is monitoring the Met’s approach to discipline more broadly – a role previously carried out by the MPA and now led by the Met. However, obtaining the information we need to assess the effectiveness of the Deputy Mayor and MOPAC in overseeing an effective police force for London is likely to remain our biggest challenge. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs with any 
defaultorganisational 
defaulttransition
default we found that the changeover between the MPA and MOPAC bought its own challenges. There was a loss of organisational memory and some processes were not maintained. Securing the transition, including various staff restructures, has been a large part of MOPAC’s operation in its early years. Ultimately, this has left a period in which the police were less accountable.
