[normal]The 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] Forest Trust (KFT) is pleased to have the opportunity to submit a response to the open consultation on land reform in Scotland
[normal].  KFT 
[normal]wish
[normal] to express 
[normal]support for
[normal] the Community Woodland Association
[normal] response 
[normal]submitted to this
[normal] consultation 
[normal]and 
[normal]the
[normal] point
[normal]s expressed therein.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]KFT, 
[normal]a community led
[normal] organisation,
[normal] 
[normal]was established in 1999 
[normal]to manage and develop woodland on
[normal] the community owned 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] Estate.  As custodians of 17,200 acres of land the community 
[normal]of 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] via KFT has 
[normal]developed the woodlan
[normal]d
[normal] resource
[normal] to deliver a wide range of
[normal] benefits – environmental, economic and social
[normal] (refer to Appendix for detail)
[normal] - 
[normal]to the local community and wider public.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We hope that the outcome 
[normal]of the
[normal] review enables more
[normal] communities to 
[normal]successfully acquire the
[normal] lan
[normal]d that they live on
[normal] and other assets
[normal].  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]With regard to our own situation, 14 years down the line of community ownership, it is our hope that there is clarific
[normal]ation regarding state aid rules which 
[normal]have the potential to
[normal] impact on the growth 
[normal]and sustainability 
[normal]of
[normal] established
[normal] community organisations.  
[normal]Further more r
[normal]ecognition is required that investment of public funds in community land organisation
[normal]s
[normal] is distinct form inve
[normal]stment in privately owned land, achieves better
[normal] value for money
[normal] and brings
[normal] multiple benefits.
[normal]KFT
[normal] is the major conduit of environmental services in the 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] Peninsula and is a significant contributor to the biodiversity works in north Lochabe
[normal]r. It delivers environmental improvements through co-operative working with neighbouring estates and with smaller private landowners and outcomes include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]KFT 
[normal]has brought an average of £90,000 per annum of external funding into the economy of 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] since 2002. Over the life of the Trust the direct financial benefit to 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] through 
[normal]KFT
[normal] is of the order of £1.4million. This is direct income and does not take
[normal] account of voluntary effort; indirect benefits (bed nights of contractors, etc.) plus the increased asset value of woodland and land through woodland management activities. 
[normal]Over the lifetime of KFT
[normal] has employed an average of 4 FTE per annum and has provid
[normal]ed work opportunities for at least 5 local and external contractors.  Economic outputs include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]KFT is part of the fabric of the 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] community and has assisted and supported the 
[normal]Knoydart
[normal] Foundation in a wide range of community activities. Social outcomes 
[normal]include:-
