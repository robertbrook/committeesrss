[normal]Written evidence from Mark Ryan (CRJ 01)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1. 
[normal]My name is Mark Ryan and I am a Senior Lecturer in Constitutional and Administrative Law at Coventry University. My submission, however, is made in my personal capacity and indicates my personal observations 
[normal]in respect of the r
[normal]ole of the courts in the 
[normal]context of a codified constitution
[normal]. It in no way reflects the view
[normal]s 
[normal]o
[normal]f
[normal] my employer (Coventry University). 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. Question 1
[normal]: 
[normal]T
[normal]he constitutional role of the judiciary in the United Kingdom is to determine the law 
[normal]laid
[normal] down in statu
[normal]t
[normal]es 
[normal]and 
[normal]that 
[normal]developed 
[normal]in th
[normal]e common law. In short, the courts settle legal disputes by interpreting and applying the law to a particular case before it. 
[normal]In terms of our uncodified constitution
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]judiciary 
[normal]have historically assumed a responsibility for protecting the individual fr
[normal]om the state. 
[normal]In particular, this 
[normal]has been achieved by 
[normal]the courts 
[normal]interpreting legislation in the light of certain constitutional presumptions (
[normal]e.g.
[normal] access to the court) and developing  the common law within the context of constitutional principles (
[normal]e.g.
[normal] b
[normal]y providing remedies).  A central 
[normal]role of the judiciary
[normal] has been 
[normal]to uphold the rule of law and thereby protect the individual
[normal] by ensuring that 
[normal]state/executive bodies act strictly within 
[normal]th
[normal]e 
[normal] legal
[normal] powers conferred. 
[normal] 
[normal]In fact, judicial review 
[normal]- as
[normal] implemente
[normal]d by the judiciary 
[normal]- can
[normal] be viewed as the rule of law in operation. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. 
[normal]If the United 
[normal]K
[normal]ingdom were to ad
[normal]o
[normal]pt a codified constitution (albeit 
[normal]this is highly 
[normal]unlikely given that constitutions are typically fashioned in the context of a 
[normal]crisis/
[normal]watershed)
[normal],
[normal] it would 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]alter the courts’ relationship with both the executive and the legislature
[normal].
[normal] In terms of the executive
[normal], it seems 
[normal]l
[normal]ikely that 
[normal]the 
[normal]current 
[normal]procedural nature of judicial review
[normal], 
[normal]which focuses on the decision
[normal]-
[normal] making process
[normal], 
[normal]would 
[normal]shift 
[normal]t
[normal]o
[normal]wards
[normal] one involving a 
[normal]closer examination of the decision itself. In 
[normal]other words, it seems clear that the jud
[normal]ges - 
[normal]armed with the 
[normal]specific 
[normal]authority 
[normal]in
[normal]vested by a codified constitution
[normal] 
[normal]- would
[normal] 
[normal]inevitably adopt a more 
[normal]robust 
[normal]approach 
[normal]in 
[normal]their 
[normal]dealings 
[normal]with 
[normal]the executive
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. 
[normal]The
[normal] m
[normal]ost important 
[normal]change
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]however, 
[normal]would 
[normal]undoubtedly 
[normal]occur 
[normal]in 
[normal]respect 
[normal]of the courts
[normal]’
[normal] relationship with the legislature
[normal],
[normal] as a codified constitution 
[normal]would 
[normal]render the common law principle of parliamentary sovereignty redundant
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] 
[normal]After 
[normal]all, the
[normal] laws contained within the new 
[normal]constitutional 
[normal]document would be 
[normal]considered to be 
[normal]of a fundamental and 
[normal]higher
[normal] legal order
[normal]. T
[normal]he role of the courts in 
[normal]the 
[normal]context 
[normal]of a codified constitution
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]therefore
[normal], 
[normal]would be to uphold the 
[normal]new 
[normal]codified 
[normal]documentary 
[normal]c
[normal]onstitution
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]other words, 
[normal]sovereignty would have shifted from Parliament
[normal] (albeit 
[normal]that
[normal] according to 
[normal]Dicey
[normal] 
[normal]political 
[normal]sovereignty 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]r
[normal]ests
[normal] 
[normal]with the people)
[normal] to the new codified constitution.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. 
[normal]A central way in which a new codified constitution would benefit the individual is that 
[normal]the 
[normal]constitution
[normal]al 
[normal]document would
[normal] undoubtedly contain a Bill or Charter of Rights
[normal]. This would 
[normal]constitutionally ring fence
[normal] 
[normal]the 
[normal]fundamental rights 
[normal]of the individual
[normal],
[normal] whic
[normal]h t
[normal]he courts 
[normal]would 
[normal]be required to 
[normal]protect f
[normal]rom infringement from 
[normal]both
[normal] the executive and the legislature. It must be pointed out, however, 
[normal]that the more constitutional power enjoyed by the judiciary the more interest there w
[normal]ould 
[normal]be in, and scrutiny of, 
[normal]seni
[normal]or 
[normal]judicial appointments.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. 
[normal]Question 2
[normal]:
[normal] The principle of 
[normal]consulta
[normal]t
[normal]ion 
[normal]is very important (
[normal]it is 
[normal]after
[normal] 
[normal]all 
[normal]a general
[normal] principle in public 
[normal]law)
[normal]. 
[normal]The results of such 
[normal]a 
[normal]consultation 
[normal]exercise 
[normal]would 
[normal]rather 
[normal]usefully
[normal] indicate how t
[normal]he 
[normal]judges would
[normal] 
[normal]perceive
[normal] 
[normal]their role in 
[normal]the context of 
[normal]a codified constitutional 
[normal]landscape
[normal]. Such consultation should also extend 
[normal]beyond serving members of the judiciary
[normal] and 
[normal]embrace 
[normal]those 
[normal]retired senior judges 
[normal]currently 
[normal]sitting in the House of Lords
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. 
[normal]Question 3
[normal]: 
[normal]It is submitted 
[normal]that under a codified constitution the 
[normal]constitutional 
[normal]role of the judiciary should be enhanced by 
[normal]conferring 
[normal]the power to strike down (or part of
[normal]) 
[normal]an Act 
[normal]of Parliament 
[normal]which is deemed “legally” unconstitutional.  
[normal]A
[normal]ccordingly
[normal],
[normal] if an Act 
[normal]were to be 
[normal]declared 
[normal]unconstitutional (
[normal]i.e.
[normal] 
[normal]as 
[normal]being 
[normal]inconsistent with the
[normal] provisions of the
[normal] codified constitution) it should be declared invalid
[normal],
[normal] or at the very least
[normal],
[normal] suspended
[normal]. The latter 
[normal]scenario 
[normal]would 
[normal]then 
[normal]allow 
[normal]Parliament
[normal] to 
[normal]subsequently 
[normal]alter 
[normal]the legislation 
[normal](
[normal]analogous 
[normal]to the 
[normal]position following the 
[normal]decision 
[normal]of the 
[normal]H
[normal]ouse
[normal] 
[normal]of Lords in the 
[normal]ex parte 
[normal]Facto
[normal]rtame
[normal] l
[normal]itigation
[normal]: 
[normal]R v Secretary of State for 
[normal]T
[normal]ransport, ex parte Factortame
[normal] Ltd (No 2)
[normal] [1991] 1 AC 603
[normal])
[normal]. 
[normal]It is recognised that 
[normal]empowering 
[normal]the courts to strike down Acts of Parliament would represent a 
[normal]fundamental 
[normal]shift in our constitutional arrangements
[normal] and would be considered highly controversial in some quarters
[normal]. In contrast, t
[normal]he striking down of delegated legislation deemed unconstitution
[normal]al 
[normal]w
[normal]ould 
[normal]clearly be less 
[normal]cont
[normal]entious
[normal]. 
[normal]After all, t
[normal]he 
[normal]courts can already invalidate secondary legislation in judicial review proceedings if it is, for example, 
[normal]ultra vires
[normal] 
[normal]its parent Act
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. Question 3(
[normal]a
[normal])
[normal]: The
[normal] impact of a codified constitution on parliame
[normal]ntary sovereignty is that 
[normal]th
[normal]is 
[normal]principle 
[normal]would 
[normal]simply 
[normal]cease to 
[normal]exist 
[normal]as it
[normal] is, after all, 
[normal]a common law construct. 
[normal]In short, as noted earlier, the 
[normal]notion 
[normal]of sovereignty would shift from Parliament to the new codified constitutional document
[normal]. This 
[normal]constitutional transfer 
[normal]would 
[normal]undoubtedly hav
[normal]e
[normal] to be 
[normal]authorised by the people in a 
[normal]national referendum.
[normal] 
[normal]In 
[normal]respect of primary legislation, 
[normal]as elsewhere, 
[normal]judicial review
[normal] 
[normal]would be
[normal] known as “
[normal]constitutional review
[normal]”. 
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n relation to the executive
[normal],
[normal] it seems inev
[normal]itable that acting 
[normal]under the authority of 
[normal]power conferred by 
[normal]a codified constitution, judicial review of 
[normal]G
[normal]overnment 
[normal]action 
[normal]would become 
[normal]much 
[normal]more robust 
[normal]and move 
[normal]from a
[normal] technically procedural remedy to a 
[normal]much 
[normal]more substantive one
[normal].
[normal]      
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. Question 3(b)
[normal]: 
[normal]T
[normal]he history of the Court of 
[normal]Justice of 
[normal]the European Union (ECJ) 
[normal]illustrates 
[normal]a court 
[normal]gaining in confidence and 
[normal]developing its role. Indeed, the two major principles of European 
[normal]law developed by the 
[normal]C
[normal]ourt, viz., 
[normal]the 
[normal]primacy of European law 
[normal]and the doctrine o
[normal]f direct effect
[normal] 
[normal]were 
[normal]not 
[normal]expressly set out in the original Treaty of Rome
[normal] and demonstrate
[normal] 
[normal]the dynamism 
[normal]of 
[normal]the 
[normal]European Court 
[normal]in developing its constitutional role
[normal].
[normal] In
[normal] fact
[normal], the impact on the United Kingdom was 
[normal]seen 
[normal]in the 
[normal]ex parte 
[normal]Factortame
[normal] litigation in 
[normal]which the European Court effectively empowered the United Kingdom courts to disregard 
[normal]domestic 
[normal]constitutional arrangements in order to protect 
[normal]putative 
[normal]European 
[normal]law 
[normal]rights. The experience of the Europe
[normal]a
[normal]n Court 
[normal]perhaps suggests that the 
[normal]United Kingdom 
[normal]courts may 
[normal]also 
[normal]gradua
[normal]l
[normal]ly develop their constit
[normal]utional role 
[normal]over time once a new codified constitution has 
[normal]b
[normal]edded in.    
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. 
[normal]Question 4
[normal]: T
[normal]here is a c
[normal]ertain 
[normal]legal logic to enabling the courts 
[normal]to 
[normal]assess the validity of a Bill prior to it being made an Act 
[normal](with a clear precedent be
[normal]ing 
[normal]found in the Scotland Act 1998). 
[normal]Although t
[normal]his procedure 
[normal]would 
[normal]help to ensure that 
[normal]a 
[normal]Bill 
[normal]was 
[normal]within the parameters of the codified constitution, it could
[normal] 
[normal]be argued 
[normal]that it 
[normal]would 
[normal]represent a breach of the separation of powers 
[normal]a
[normal]s an
[normal] interference with the legislative 
[normal]process and 
[normal]function. 
[normal] 
[normal]In a
[normal]ny event, i
[normal]f such a procedure were
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]be ad
[normal]opted, it would have to be determined
[normal] who 
[normal]had the responsibility 
[normal](
[normal]or power
[normal])
[normal] to 
[normal]refer 
[normal]a 
[normal]Bill
[normal], 
[normal]and at what stage
[normal] in the legislative process
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. 
[normal]Question 5
[normal]: 
[normal]Ideally the 
[normal]new C
[normal]onstitutional Court should be a separate entity 
[normal]from 
[normal]the existing Supreme Court. This would entail two consequences
[normal]:
[normal] firstly
[normal],
[normal] it would require 
[normal]the recruitment of 
[normal]more senior judges
[normal]. S
[normal]econdly
[normal],
[normal] the name of the Supreme Court (assu
[normal]ming that it 
[normal]is 
[normal]to 
[normal]exist under 
[normal]a 
[normal]new cod
[normal]i
[normal]fied constitution) would have to be renamed
[normal]. It is submitted that the court be renamed
[normal]:
[normal] The F
[normal]inal Court of Appeal 
[normal]and 
[normal]as such, 
[normal]it would process “
[normal]non-constitutional
[normal]” 
[normal]law issues
[normal],
[normal] w
[normal]hilst 
[normal]the
[normal] new 
[normal]C
[normal]onstitutional 
[normal]Court wo
[normal]uld
[normal] 
[normal]consider 
[normal]purely 
[normal]“constitutional” issues
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]It is of course recognised that there is no clear and sharp dividing line between constitutional and non-constitutional issues
[normal], however, in general terms a division can be made
[normal] and 
[normal]in any case, 
[normal]this 
[normal]should not 
[normal]be considered an i
[normal]nsuperable problem
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. 
[normal]Question 6
[normal]: 
[normal]The American Supreme Court provides a graphic example of the power of the judiciary in a codified constitution to 
[normal]develop and 
[normal]enhance its 
[normal]constitutional
[normal] role
[normal], as 
[normal]demonstrated 
[normal]in 
[normal]the famous 
[normal]Marbury 
[normal]v
[normal] Ma
[normal]dison
[normal] case
[normal] ((1803) 5 US I Cranch 137)
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal] Under a codified cons
[normal]titution t
[normal]he courts will 
[normal]necessarily 
[normal]be the 
[normal]protectors of the constitution and the final arbiter as to the 
[normal]meaning of 
[normal]its provisions
[normal]. As 
[normal]such
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]this 
[normal]w
[normal]ould lead to great
[normal]er
[normal] 
[normal]interest 
[normal]in, 
[normal]and 
[normal]scrutin
[normal]y
[normal] 
[normal]of, senior 
[normal]judicial appointments
[normal]. This may 
[normal]necessitate 
[normal]that 
[normal]parliamentary affirmations of 
[normal]senior judicial 
[normal]appoi
[normal]n
[normal]tments
[normal] have to
[normal] take place. In terms 
[normal]of
[normal] appointment
[normal]s,
[normal] a specifically 
[normal]ad hoc
[normal] Commission 
[normal](
[normal]analogous
[normal] to the Suprem
[normal]e
[normal] Court 
[normal]S
[normal]elect
[normal]ion
[normal] Commission
[normal])
[normal] cou
[normal]ld be created to put forward a
[normal] suitable candidate 
[normal]in the event of a 
[normal]vacancy.
