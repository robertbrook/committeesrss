Does the Government have an effective strategy for forensic science in the UK and is it sufficient to support forensic science R&amp;D and criminal justice?&#xa0;

We believe that the Government’s strategy to allow a private forensic marketplace to develop and to encourage competition between regulated Forensic Service Providers (FSPs) has delivered cost effective, high quality and timely forensic services in support of the Criminal Justice System.

However, the outsourced forensic market is shrinking due to a number of factors: reduced expenditure on forensic science (as in all areas of public spending); lower reported crime rates; and the strategy of investing in the development of in-house forensic capabilities within individual police forces.  The planned implementation of Streamlined Forensic Reporting may also impact on police spend on forensic science.  Increased competition can of course stimulate development activity and encourage innovation to reduce cost, but the shrinking market will also have the effect of reducing the attractiveness of the market for private investment.

The Government’s current forensic procurement strategy has also added significant complexity and therefore cost to the delivery of forensic science, with the potential for an increased administrative burden diverting resources away from service delivery.  This impacts particularly in complex casework where the coding structure is also less well suited for capturing the broader forensic review and assessment activities.

The relatively modest size of the forensic market influences its attractiveness for R&amp;D investment and current predictions are that with the current strategy the market will continue to shrink.  In addition there is a relatively long lead time in forensic science from innovation to presentation in the courtroom and this affects the potential return on investment.  Previous government expenditure on forensic R&amp;D, channeled through the Forensic Science Service’s research activity, is no longer available and while efforts are being made by the Government to encourage greater interdisciplinary networking and involvement of the university sector, we are not aware of any specific Government funding identified for forensic R&amp;D.
&#xa0;Did the FSS transition and closure run smoothly and within budget?&#xa0;
