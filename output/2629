[normal]Written [bold]evidence from Bahrain Watch[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]SUMMARY OF SUBMISSION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1. The Bahrain government is committing serious violations as part of a crackdown against its opposition, human rights defenders and free expression. It is failing in its pledges to enact reforms and has failed to hold perpetrators of violations responsible for their acts. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2. British manufactured arms and repressive technology have been used to suppress Bahraini citizens.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3. The British government has regarded Bahrain as a key export destination since 2010. It has consistently supported arms exports to Bahrain, despite continued human rights abuses.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4. The British government has given legitimacy to Bahraini officials and agencies accused of serious human rights abuses by inviting them to arms fairs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5. The British government has increased its defence relations with Bahrain and is presently leading negotiations to sell arms worth a reported £1 billion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]INTRODUCTION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6. Bahrain Watch is an independent research and advocacy group that seeks to promote effective, transparent and accountable governance in Bahrain. It is led by independent researchers inside and outside Bahrain and focuses on evidence-based advocacy in the areas of political reform, economic development, and security.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]FACTUAL INFORMATION
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]CURRENT SUMMARY AND BRITISH EXPORTS
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7. Bahrain has been in a state of crisis since February 2011 when a popular uprising was brutally suppressed, with activists killed, maimed, tortured, and imprisoned. No senior official has been held accountable for these ongoing violations. There is little evidence of any substantial reform in Bahrain.
[normal] In September 2013, 47 countries signed a joint statement describing Bahrain’s human rights situation as “an issue of serious concern”. While the European Parliament also passed a resolution raising similar concerns,
[normal] to date the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has failed to name Bahrain as a “country of concern”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8. British made arms have been used to suppress Bahraini citizens since 2011. Saudi troops used Tactica armoured vehicles manufactured by BAE Systems when they entered Bahrain in March 2011. Bahrain police armed with shotguns use birdshot against protesters, which has resulted in several deaths and serious injuries. Birdshot cartridges manufactured by UK firms Gamebore, 
[normal]Eley Hawk and Hull Cartridge have been identified in photographs taken by activists reportedly following the suppression of protests. Bahrain security forces have used tear gas manufactured by US firm Federal Laboratories, owned by Armor Holdings.
[normal] Until July 2012, Armor Holdings was owned by BAE Systems. Surveillance technology sold by a British based company has been used by Bahrain to target activists.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9. Whilst some UK export licences were revoked in February 2011, the British government has largely maintained close relations with the Bahraini authorities and consistently encouraged arms sales. The Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defence Force has claimed that he successfully pressured the British government into lifting the freeze on arms exports. Interviewed in February 2012, he recounted a conversation with “a senior British officer”: “
[normal]I told him that we would impose a ban on dealing with British planes, ships and military personnel in Bahrain if the ban on Bahrain was not lifted within two weeks. We do not need to import anything from them, but it is a matter of principle. The British ban was lifted after one month.
[normal]”
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10. Some of the worst human rights abuses were committed during the three-month state of emergency announced by the King on 15th March 2011. Several export licenses to Bahrain were approved during this period. In April 2011, export licenses for “body armor”, “civil body armor” and “training hand grenades” were approved. In May, licenses were approved for “small arms ammunition”, as well as components and technology for “military support vehicles” and “all-wheel drive vehicles with ballistic protection”. The Ministry of Interior, Bahrain Defence Force, Bahrain National Guard and National Security Agency were responsible for implementing the state of emergency. British exports to - and relations with - these government bodies are therefore of particular concern. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]11. There has been a steady trade with Bahrain since 2010. In 2010, the UK approved export licenses worth at least £8,776,392.
[normal] In February 2011, licenses for goods worth at least £5,249,516 were revoked. Approved arms exports in 2010 include small arms and ammunition, “CS hand grenades”, “tear gas/riot control ammunition” and “stun grenades”. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]12. In 2011, export licences worth at least £13,310,376 were approved, a significant increase from the previous year. Several of these, worth at least £893,397, were revoked in February 2011. In 2012, export licenses worth at least £7,968,437 were approved. This included the export of 400 machine guns and components worth £4,100,000 for “naval end use”, and “secure communications equipment” to the Bahrain military to improve their “command and control”.
[normal] The figures reveal a significant increase in exports from previous years. In 2008, export licences worth £5,167,508 were approved and in 2009 that figure was only £2,873,044. These figures may be dwarfed if the UK Government succeeds in selling Bahrain 12 Eurofighter Typhoon jets worth a reported £1billion.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]PROMOTING DEFENCE EXPORTS
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]13. Promoting British business interests in Bahrain has been a consistent thrust of the current government. Writing for the UKTI sponsored “Doing Business in Bahrain” website, the British Ambassador notes: 
[normal]“In meetings with the British Prime Minister, HM The King has declared 
[normal]that he looks to Britain to be Bahrain's 'partner of choice' (...). David Cameron said this was 'music to his ears'.
[normal]”
[normal] The events of 2011 did not impact British business. In 2012, exports of goods to Bahrain increased by 21.4%.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]14. The FCO is increasingly engaged in promoting defence exports. One of the actions in the FCO’s 2012 Business Plan is: “Use defence engagement to help maintain the UK share of the global defence export market and to increase the UK’s share of the global security export market, including supporting export campaigns for Typhoon.”
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]15. Prior to 2011, Bahrain was named as a “key market” for UKTI Defence and Security Organisation (UKTI DSO). In a UKTI DSO case study, Praetorian International’s co-founder reports that UKTI “helped us immensely when we were trying to make worthwhile contacts. The [UKTI] desk officer for Bahrain arranged valuable meetings for us with people such as the UK Defence Attaché in Manama”.
[normal] Bahrain is one of 72 countries which has a UK Defence Attaché.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]16. UKTI DSO officials had meetings with the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF) and Ministry of Interior in the months before February 2011. On 5th-10th October 2010, representatives demonstrated a “Ballistic Toolkit” to the BDF. On 19th January 2011, two UKTI DSO officials met with the MOI to discuss “possible sharing of info between UK and Bahrain on Security and Policing best practice”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]17. On 11th May 2010, the first day of the new Coalition Government, the FCO published “A Charter for Business”, pledging that “FCO Ministers and officials will lobby tirelessly on behalf of UK business interests overseas”.
[normal] As noted by the Foreign Affairs Committee, this new FCO Charter “made no mention of the FCO's role in helping businesses address the potential human rights implications of their overseas operations”.
[normal] On the same day, UKTI launched a five-year strategy titled “Britain Open for Business” aimed at expanding inward investment and overseas exports through “building strategic relationships at the highest levels”.
[normal] Arms formed a central part of this renewed export drive. Speaking at a UKTI DSO event in November 2010, Defence Minister Gerald Howarth described “the biggest defence exports drive in decades”.
[normal] UKTI has four staff members based in Bahrain.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]18. Several Ministers in the new government had begun forging relations with Bahraini officials whilst in opposition. On 13th-16th March 2009, Alan Duncan MP (currently Minister of State for International Development) and Keith Simpson MP (currently Private Parliamentary Secretary to the Foreign Secretary) visited Bahrain, with “accommodation and flights paid for by the Government of Bahrain”. The Bahrain government paid for Liam Fox MP (Defence Secretary from May 2010 to October 2011) to visit Bahrain on 21th-23th July 2009 to “meet with the King”. William Hague MP (current Foreign Secretary) visited Bahrain on 9th-11th January 2009 to meet the oreign Minister. His trip was funded by the Bahrain government.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]19. After coming to office, Defence Secretary Liam Fox and Foreign Secretary William Hague visited Bahrain on May 24th 2010. They had meetings with the King and Foreign Affairs Minister respectively.
[normal] In June 2010, Foreign Secretary William Hague launched the “Gulf Initiative” which sought “to improve commercial, economic, cultural and educational ties” with 
[normal]Bahrain and other GCC countries.
[normal] The following month, King Hamad met with Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street. They discussed “furthering economic bilateral ties”.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]20. Defence Secretary Liam Fox and Defence Minister Lord Astor visited Bahrain in December 2010. They had meetings with the King and Crown Prince, who are also respectively the Supreme Commander and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Bahrain Defence Force.
[normal] Fox had also met with the Crown Prince in London the previous week
[normal]. Fox’s associate Adam Werritty was also in Bahrain during the period of this trip to attend the Manama Dialogue.
[normal] It has been reported that Werrity’s company Pargav Limited funded his overseas trips. One of Pargav’s donors was G3 (
[normal]Good Governance Group). G3 is a private intelligence firm whose clients include British arms firm BAE Systems. It held meetings with Fox during his time in opposition and government.
[normal] In July 2011, G3 received a £1.5million contract with the Bahrain government to develop a “media campaign to support Bahrain's position in the international community".
[normal] Liam Fox resigned as Defence Secretary in October 2011, following a scandal involving his ties to Werrity and the Atlantic Bridge charity which he founded. Lord Astor was a trustee of Atlantic Bridge.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]DEEPENING UK-BAHRAIN ENGAGEMENT 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]21. Shortly after the state of emergency had ended in Bahrain, the British government began to expand its drive for arms exports. On 8th September 2011, the UKTI DSO Senior Management Team hosted a lunch in London to give members of the AeroSpace, Defence, Security (A|D|S) trade association an opportunity to meet “meet newly appointed UK Defence Attachés”, including the official who was due to start work in Bahrain.
[normal] On the same day, two officials from UKTI DSO, including the Country Manager for Bahrain, spoke at an event organised by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry titled: Middle East: A Vast Market For UK Defence and Security Companies. Bahrain was named as a “top destination” for the UK defence industry.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]22. The following week, London hosted the DSEi international arms fair. A delegation from Bahrain National Guard attended “as guests of the UK Government”.
[normal] 
[normal]The Bahrain National Guard supported other agencies in the March 16th 2011 assault on Pearl Roundabout and security operations at Salminaya Medical Complex and the Financial Harbour.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]23. According to emails obtained by Private Eye, the UK Government had originally decided not to invite Bahrain, however it changed its mind after determining that 
[normal]the human rights situation had “improved considerably”.
[normal] A delegate from the Bahrain National Guard was escorted around the arms fair by Gerald Howard MP, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Security Strategy at the Ministry of Defence, as well as two officials from UKTI DSO.
[normal] According to Private Eye: “
[normal]The government also arranged dinner dates and "stand visits" with arms firms, and the two Bahraini National Guard reps attended a BAE Systems reception on 13 September. There were also meetings with defence ministers Gerald Howarth and Lord Astor, a "lunch hosted by Air Vice Marshal Nigel Maddox" in the "VIP Dining Area" and a 45-minute presentation on unmanned drones
[normal]”.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]24. The Bahrain International Airshow was held on 19th-21st January 2012. The event is organised by UK firm Farnborough International, a subsidiary company of A|D|S. Two days before the start of the airshow, A|D|S held a lobbying event in Parliament to announce their new “Flying Forward” campaign and a “newly established All Party Parliamentary Group Aerospace”.
[normal] A spokesperson for Farnborough said of British involvement in the airshow: “government-to-government relations are still good and invitations have been extended to the UK defence and aerospace community as well as the UK government
[normal].
[normal]”
[normal] UKTI DSO had intended “to organise a joint chalet” with A|D|S at the airshow, however this didn’t happen.
[normal] A Government Minister subsequently claimed that whilst UKTI DSO “deployed a small team to support the airshow”, they did not purchase a chalet as “the expense could not be justified”.
[normal] Defence Minister Lord Astor attended the Airshow and held meetings with Bahrain’s Prime Minister, Crown Prince, Foreign Minister and BDF Commander-in-Chief. General Simon Mayall, the MoD’s Defence Advisor for the Middle East, also attended the meeting with the BDF Commander-in-Chief.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]25. On 30th January 2012, the UK government approved an export for 2 assault rifles worth £6,620 to “a member of the Bahrain Royal family”.
[normal] Although the monetary value is small, the export carries great symbolic weight. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]26. In July 2012, a delegation from the Bahrain military attended the Farnborough Airshow, following an invitation from UKTI DSO.
[normal] Prime Minister David Cameron opened the airshow which was attended by 16 government ministers.
[normal] Then Defence Minister Ge
[normal]rald Howarth MP “had 15 meetings with overseas delegations”.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]27. King Hamad visited London on 23rd August and met with the Prime Minister. They “
[normal]discussed opportunities for British businesses in” Bahrain.
[normal] Two week later, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond visited Bahrain and held several meetings, including with the King, Crown Prince and Defence Minister. General Simon Mayall attended some meetings "in his role as defence senior adviser middle east". General Mayall also met with the Interior Minister.
[normal] General Mayall returned to Bahrain on 7th October and met with the BDF Commander-in-Chief.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]28. On 11th October, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and the Bahrain Foreign Secretary signed a new UK-Bahrain Defence Cooperation Accord in the presence of the Crown Prince.
[normal] The Ministry of Defence did not publicise this accord and have not released a copy of the text. Defence Minister Dr Andrew Murrison told the Foreign Affairs Select Committee in 2013 that he “will not discuss the content of that particular document”. At the same hearing, Foreign Minister Alistair Burt described the accord as “evidence of [the] strong relationship” between the UK and Bahrain.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]29. Three days after the accord was signed, the Crown Prince attended a banquet held in his honour at Sandhurst Military Academy.
[normal] General Mayall met with the Crown Prince during the event.
[normal] Sandhurst has close links to the Bahrain Royal Family. In January 2012, it received a £3million donation from King Hamad, following “negotiations [...] about the donation throughout 2011”.
[normal] Following the donation, Sandhurst renamed “Mons Hall” to “King Hamad Hall”. King Hamad’s son Sheikh Nasser represented his father at the opening of the hall on 13th 
[normal]May 2013.
[normal] King Hamad and Sheikh Nasser are both graduates from Sandhurst. The Crown Prince’s son Sheikh Mohammed graduated from Sandhurst in April 2011.
[normal] In 2012, he began an “exchange programme with the British Army”.
[normal] 39 Bahraini officers have been trained at Sandhurst since 2002, 5 of whom were training in 2011. The UK Government subsidises their training by £29,600.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]30. Defence Minister Lord Astor visited Bahrain in early December 2012 “to attend high level talks with leaders”.
[normal] Later that month, Lord Astor accompanied several British officials to a reception at the Bahrain Embassy in London. Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon was also present.
[normal] Hoon works for AgustaWestland, which is owned by Italian firm Finmeccanica, one of the manufacturers of the Eurofighter Typhoon. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]31. Lord Astor returned to Bahrain on 10th January 2013 to brief a Defence Minister on British made Typhoon warplanes which had arrived in Bahrain that day.
[normal] In August 2013, it was revealed that the UK government is leading negotiations to sell Bahrain a reported 12 Eurofighter Typhoons worth around £1billion. Lord Astor’s trip was followed by a series of high-level meetings. General Mayall visited Bahrain on 14th February and met with the Crown Prince, Foreign Minister, BDF Commander-in-Chief and Sheikh Nasser, Royal Guards Commander.
[normal] On 9th March, the outgoing Chief of Staff of the British Army met with the BDF Commander-in-Chief.
[normal] On 19th March, UKTI DSO’s Senior Military Advisor met with the BDF Commander-in-Chief and a Defence Minister.
[normal] On April 29th the Head of UKTI DSO was in Bahrain to meet the Minister for Defence Affairs.
[normal] On May 12th, a UK Defence Minister, the British Chief-of-Staff and Prince Andrew attended a reception held by King Hamad in London.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]32. During this period, Bahraini delegations were invited to two British trade expos. In March, a Bahraini delegation attended the Home Office run “Security and Policing” expo. BAE Systems were introduced to the delegation and the firm “outlined its cyber defence capabilities”.
[normal] In April, Sheikh Nasser was amongst the delegates at the Counter Terror Expo.
[normal] Sheikh Nasser is accused of having “personally engaged” in torture in 2011 and heading “a punitive campaign to repress Bahraini athletes who had demonstrated their support [for] the peaceful pro-democracy movement”.
[normal] His attendance at the arms fair and high-level meetings with British defence officials are therefore a cause of concern.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]33. King Hamad met with the Prime Minister in Downing Street on 6th August. Bahrain state media revealed that the King expressed “Bahrain’s keenness to purchase the British Typhoon warplanes”. King Hamad returned to London in September, the week before the DSEi arms fair. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond met him at his private residence. They reportedly discussed the Typhoon deal. King Hamad also made Defence Minister Lord Astor and former UKTI Special Representative Prince Andrew.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]34. A delegation from Bahrain attended DSEi as guests of UKTI DSO.
[normal] DSEi hosted several arms companies whose tear gas has been used in Bahrain since 2011, including Non-Lethal Technologies, Condor Technologies and 
[normal]Rheinmetall. Benelli, whose shotguns are used by the Bahrain police, and Less Lethal Africa, who have reportedly supplied Bahrain with rubber bullets, also exhibited at DSEi.
[normal] During DSEI, UK firm BMT revealed that it has entered a partnership with Turkish shipyard Ares to supply boats to Bahrain’s Coast Guard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]35. UKTI are currently actively promoting their presence at the 2014 Bahrain International Airshow in January, where they will have their own chalet. UKTI is also offering to help British firms “win business in this market”.
[normal] The 2014 airshow is being organised by UK firm Farnborough International and includes a “Security and Surveillance Pavillion”.
