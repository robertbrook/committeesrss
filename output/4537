[normal]Q61 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] 
[normal]Hello, good evening and thank you very much for coming. I am sorry if we have kept you—you were at the back, so you were not hanging around in the corridor. In case you were not here at the beginning of the session, let me explain the form that this takes. We will take about 45 minutes or even less, if we want to get you off by 6 o’clock. Members have already declared their relevant interests. The session is on record. It will be webcast and subsequently accessible on the parliamentary website. You will get a transcript of everything that is being recorded and you will have a chance to correct the transcript. When it comes back corrected, it goes on the public record and is on the parliamentary website. Please could we start with you explaining who you are and what you do?
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: I am Heather Cousins. I am Deputy Secretary in the Department for Employment and Learning. I have responsibility for resources in the department and I have policy responsibility for higher education, NEETs and the European Social Fund. I have been in my post only for a month, so I have brought along my expert, Brian Smart—my left-hand man on this occasion—who will be able to answer any detailed questions for which I do not have the information.
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much. After a month is when you write a book on the subject. Mr Smart?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: Yes, I am Brian Smart. I currently head up the policy and strategy branch, which has particular responsibility for the NEETs question within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. Prior to that post, which I have had for about a year now, I was head of the European Social Fund Managing Authority and I currently have responsibility for the ESF Certifying Authority within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal].
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much. Do either of you want to make an opening statement or will you just take the questions?
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: I will just briefly say thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence on the actions that we have taken in the devolved Administration. I think that in some ways size enables us to trial things and see what works. It is also useful to have in the one department the higher education institutions policy, further education, skills and the employment programme. The fact that that is all in one department means that we can have the co-ordination and collaboration that I think is essential for success. That is all that I wanted to say as an opening remark.
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much indeed. Brian, do you want to add to that?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: No, I am fine.
[normal]Q62 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Shall we start off with the questions then? I think it is generally agreed that youth unemployment across 
[normal]Europe
[normal] is a particularly serious aspect of the economic crisis that we are facing at the moment. Could you summarise for us your view on exactly the nature of the problems as they affect you in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]? Who and what groups are affected and in what particular ways?
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: It would probably be helpful if I started off with some background statistics on the extent of the problem of youth unemployment within the context of the European Community and then Brian will take the issue of the measures that we are taking and so on. Here are some summary figures regarding 16 to 24 year-olds. As far as the unemployed in that age group are concerned—that is, those who are claiming unemployment-related benefits—there are 15,970, which is 7.2% of the age group. Of those, 2,305 are long-term unemployed—those who have been claiming those benefits for over a year—which is 1% of the age group. The number of NEETs 
[normal]who 
[normal]have been identified using the Labour Force Survey, however, is estimated to be around 46,000. 
[normal]T
[normal]he information coming out of the 2011 census of population would indicate 33,516 individuals who are either unemployed or economically inactive. The difference is accounted for by those 
[normal]who are in part-time education.
[normal]It is evident from these statistics that youth unemployment has been persistently high, ranging from 8% in 2002 to 20.3% in the second quarter of 2013. It impacts, obviously adversely, on the lives of those affected. When we look at the various causes and so on, we see that there has been a lot of good work on ensuring that people leaving school have five or more GCSEs and there has been a lot of good work on improving adult literacy skills, particularly at the lower levels. However, we are still struggling with the economy. Certainly our economic recovery is slower than that in the rest of the 
[normal]UK
[normal]. The sectors where traditionally we have had youth employment are still struggling—construction and so on. That really is the context. Our level of youth unemployment between 18 and 24 year-olds currently stands at 24.7%, which is below 25%, but it is up on the previous quarter and up by 5.5% over the year, despite our significant efforts to arrest its growth.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] Is this the 16 to 24 year-olds?
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: That was the 18 to 24 year-olds.
[normal]Baroness O'Cathain:[bold] I thought I heard you say that benefits were given to those between the ages of 16 to 24.
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: No, sorry, the benefits are for the 18 to 24 year-olds. 
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: Sixteen to 17 year-olds had benefits taken away in 1986, I think, so they have not had them since.
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: There is a confusion with the NEETs category being between 16 and 24 and the unemployed category being between 18 and 24.
[normal]Q63 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Thank you. Brian Smart, do you want to add to that?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: What I want to go on to say further is that the size of Northern Ireland means that, as Heather said, we have the unique situation where we have one government department
[normal] that 
[normal]can cut across quite a number of the issues that many of these young people encounter. Last year, we set about looking at the whole issue of youth unemployment by establishing a cross-departmental, cross-government committee, which established what was called pathways to success. We have six key elements to that. First, within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], we have the youth guarantee, which is available to all young people aged 16 and 17. When they come forward, we will provide them with a place in training, further education or employment where possible. Currently about 7,000 places are provided for that—this is up to 30 April 2013.
[normal]Pathways to success have, as I said, six key elements. We realised that 46,000 young people were choosing not to engage in our mainstream programmes. Therefore, it was incumbent on us to research why that was and then to come up with a new method of trying to engage these young people. We established a collaboration and innovation fund of £9.2 million to give 24 organisations across the voluntary community, business, local councils and health trusts an opportunity to have funding for a two-year period to look at new, innovative and collaborative ways of engaging with these young people, the expectation being that, based on that and based on the evaluations, we would take those parts that were working and build on them and not use those parts that were not working. That is an important programme. It is providing 6,400 places over the next two years. 
[normal]Alongside this, you have the troubled families initiative. We call ours the 
[normal]community family support programme
[normal]. In 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], we have set aside £4 million. It has also been established as a delivering social change programme by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, which is contributing half the funding to it. We are going to engage 720 families in association with social services through our health trusts as well as through the Probation Board and the Department of Justice. We are bringing families together who have NEETs young people, who have intergenerational unemployment and whose life chances are marginal. Many of these young people have younger siblings who would be destined to become NEETs. It is a major intervention from us working with families to try to get families as a unit to work together in order to be able to listen, to understand, to be more tolerant and to deal with issues around money management, health and nutrition. That is a major programme.
[normal]Alongside that we have introduced an educational maintenance allowance for 16 and 17 year-olds. You may well be aware that 16 and 17 year-olds cannot in the current system claim unemployment benefit unless they are care leavers or they have other particular circumstances that allow them to claim funding. We have introduced a non-means-tested EMA, so that if a young person comes to us in one of our programmes for 10 hours or less, they get £10. Crucially, that attendance also allows them to have their child benefit reinstated, so that young person, if they are the first young person in a family, will get £10 for attending our course plus their parents will get £20.40 because their child benefit is reinstated. If they come to us for more than 10 hours, we give them £25, and if they come and work full-time they move on to £40 a week—if they are 16 or 17 years old, they maintain their child benefit. That is unique to 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] and it is something that has been very, very beneficial in reconnecting young people. We also have a local intermediate employment service working in communities and run by community organisations to reconnect these young people. Overall, we are spending £25 million over the next two years on what we think is a fairly comprehensive approach to looking at innovative ways to tack
[normal]le the problem of unemployment.
[normal]Within that, we also have the Northern Ireland European Social Fund, which funds organisations to provide 4,500 places for young people who fall into the NEETs category. We set a target back in 2007, when we were designing our operational programme, and we have identified 4,500 places—roughly 3,000 of those have been filled, but the programme has another couple of years to run. We feel that we have taken a fairly comprehensive position in relation to youth unemployment and in engaging employers. As part of our European Social Fund, there are three priorities. Priority 1 is largely for the voluntary and community sector. Priority 2 is for government-led programmes. We have put 47,000 young people through apprenticeships over the five years of the programme, at a total cost of £57 million, 40% of which is paid for by the European Community, with 60% paid for by the Northern Ireland Assembly. We feel that we are off to a good start. It is a difficult issue. These young people very often have left school early. They have numeracy problems, literacy problems or behavioural problems. Many of them do not feel comfortable in the formal sector and prefer the informal sector
[normal],
[normal] and that is the basis on which we have been taking forward our approach to this problem.
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much. If you have a whole lot of statistics, you may find it easier to give us a piece of paper afterwards.
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: We will, yes.
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Otherwise we will get drowned in statistics. We will come to other questions, but some of the things may have been covered.
[normal]Q64 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Baroness Valentine:[bold] Yes, I think that you have pretty much answered the beginning of my question, but perhaps you could answer in particular the end of it. Could you summarise for us the steps that you are taking to tackle youth unemployment and say why you have chosen these? More particularly, can you contrast them with measures in the rest of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] and the rest of 
[normal]Europe
[normal]? What is best
[normal],
[normal] and if necessary worst
[normal],
[normal] practice transfer? Also, can you comment on your degree of ability to determine your own priorities and programmes in this field? You appeared to be commenting on the fact that you could put things together in a way that a less devolved Administration would find more difficult, so can you comment on that as well?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]:  
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], as you can probably appreciate, has had considerable funding from 
[normal]Europe
[normal] for many, many years, not only structural funds but peace funding. A lot of that funding has created an infrastructure within communities that is sustained to this day, and it allows people within what you might call a large estate with multiple problems. There is a community presence there, and there is perhaps a community house or a repository of people working with young people within a European context. That is important to us. Equally, we within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] are very much involved in transnationality across 
[normal]Europe
[normal]. Quite recently, we won a contract to do a piece of work on Parliament and social inclusion. We worked with 
[normal]Greece
[normal], 
[normal]Portugal
[normal], 
[normal]Lithuania
[normal], 
[normal]France
[normal], 
[normal]Spain
[normal] and a number of other countries to look at the particular problems that they were experiencing and contrasting them with our own situation. That is very helpful as it enables us to locate the activities that we are engaged in against others across the European Community. 
[normal]I accept your point that we in the devolved Administrations are probably able to respond more quickly to emerging crises. However, we have the added difficulty of our land border with the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and the particular economic turmoil that it has experienced as a result of the banking crisis. You will see that there has been a major slump in the economy down south in the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] and mass migration on a scale that is almost twice what it is within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. I believe that we can respond easier and quicker without having to cope with a lot of the bureaucracy that some of the other larger devolved Administrations might have.
[normal]Earl of Liverpool:[bold] Can you tell us how your position compares with that of the 
[normal]Irish
[normal] 
[normal]Republic
[normal], particularly on the issue of outward migration and what you are doing perhaps with the Irish Government on joint initiatives? 
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: This is another area where we can give you a lot of statistics, but I will not. We will send you the statistics that we have. I can summarise them by saying that there are more young people in the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]. Its outward migration is greater than ours, and some of that outward migration might come to the north. We have particular issues with the participation of young people from the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal] at our colleges of further education. We have estimated that at the moment we are paying to the tune of £8 million for educating people from the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]. The issue of whether we can collaborate has been discussed at the recent North South Ministerial Council in the context of youth unemployment. They obviously have access to the European money to deal with the regions where youth unemployment is over 25%. We are just under that figure, and we do not have access to that money. We are looking particularly at whether there are border areas where we can collaborate and have joint initiatives.
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: There is a particular issue in that the employment rates within Donegal, for example, are running at around 49%. Therefore there is a capacity issue for local provision at FE level, because they come across the border to us.
[normal]Q65 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Kakkar:[bold] I just want to come back to the assessment that you have made of the value of various EU initiatives—the youth guarantee, for instance, or the Social Fund—to 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] currently and potentially in the future, and to your assessment of their value more broadly across the 
[normal]Union
[normal]—if you have made that assessment
[normal]?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: In terms of finance, it is probably worth about £400 million to us over the next ESF period. That probably represents about 7% of the departmental budget. It is a niche amount of money, but it allows us to be fairly flexible, because while EU funding is a reserve matter we can nonetheless write the operational programme to suit our particular needs within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. We have also been able to demonstrate a degree of flexibility in ERDF funding, which has provided us with additional money on the European Social F
[normal]und side, particularly to deal with NEETs in this last period. We had a transfer of €20 million to deal with the youth unemployment problem. 
[normal]More widely
[normal] within 
[normal]Europe
[normal], clearly we would like to see more money coming to deal with youth unemployment if we co
[normal]uld. Heather has already indicated that we are on the cusp of the threshold to receive youth employment initiative funding. We currently have unemployment at 24.7%, 25% being the point at which the funding is triggered.
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] Can you repeat that?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: I am saying that we currently have 24.7% unemployed among the 18 to 24 year-old group. Under the new initiative which the European Community is bringing forward to address youth unemployment, the sub-regions of 
[normal]M
[normal]ember 
[normal]S
[normal]tates that have 25% or more unemployment can apply to get funding from that fund. We unfortunately are not in a situation where we can apply for it
[normal],
[normal] on the grounds that we are 0.3% off. However, at a sub-regional level, perhaps in some of the counties in the north-west, we are probably at more than 25%, but it is not available at a sub-regional level. That is one of the discussions that we are having with the European Community and our colleagues in the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal]: whether or not the north-west region of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], which straddles the border, can be regarded as eligible for that funding. 
[normal]Baroness O'Cathain:[bold] There is a precedent there, though, is there not? You will remember, Lord Brooke, the three regional development funds. 
[normal]Cornwall
[normal], for example, was able to get funding, and parts of the north-east as well I think, so there are precedents that could be called in. I think that is a very good idea.
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: As I say, it was raised at the North South Ministerial Council just last week, and it is something which the 
[normal]Taoiseach
[normal] was keen to take forward as well.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] You are straddl
[normal]ing two 
[normal]M
[normal]ember
[normal] 
[normal]S
[normal]tates.
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: Yes, of course, but we are part of the wider European Community and we have to bring forward meaningful arguments that allow us perhaps to cut through some of the bureaucracy, or at least to change minds and maybe even hearts.
[normal]Baroness O'Cathain:[bold] That is absolutely right. You should try to change the bureaucracy, because we are trying the same old ways, such as not getting the SMEs involved. We have to think outside the box. This is too serious a problem.
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Good luck with it. Lord Haskel.
[normal]Q66 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] This problem has been around for an awful long time, and a lot of good work has been done on it, as you have just told us. There has also been 
[normal]a 
[normal]considerable amount of evaluation as to the best practice and how to help young employed most effectively. Indeed, 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal] has been an effective participant in many transnational programmes, so if so much is known, why is the problem of youth unemployment so intractable? What could we practically do to improve our collective performance? How can we do better?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: You are absolutely right. There is no question about that. In 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], we have already stated that we have been recipients for many a long period of both peace funding and EU funding. However, with the unprecedented nature of the economic collapse and the banking crisis, the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], our neighbour, gave a guarantee in relation to all banking deposits, which meant that it had to go to the troika to borrow lots of money. We are seeing it from both sides
[normal]: t
[normal]here is not only a general downward trend in economics but particular circumstances in the 
[normal]Republic
[normal] of 
[normal]Ireland
[normal], which again are unprecedented.
[normal]We are not experiencing the same levels of youth unemployment that you are seeing in 
[normal]Spain
[normal], 
[normal]Greece
[normal], 
[normal]Portugal
[normal] and many other regions, because of our investment over the years and because of wise investment of European funding, I would suggest. We have managed to keep the lid on it. In the 
[normal]Labour Force Survey
[normal], we are sitting at roughly 20%—between 16% to 24%. We have not done badly in relation to that. Equally, as I said earlier, about 7% of our departmental budget is equivalent to the ESF funding that we get over seven years. Alongside that, we are spending almost two-thirds, or £450 million per year, on young people in further education colleges, at universities, in apprenticeships or in training, but we need to work harder and smarter in order to ensure that we do not have it. We need to work closely with employers on what their needs are and to ensure that we can keep young people in employment so that they can complete their apprenticeships. 
[normal]One of the things that we did three years ago when quite a lot of young people were being made redundant because of the downturn and were apprentices who were maybe two years into their three-year apprenticeship was to introduce a programme-led apprenticeship using European funding in order to ensure that the previous two years invested by the young person were maintained. We then allowed them to finish their apprenticeships through the FE sector, so that they had a qualification in advance of the upturn. 
[normal]We are always striving to do new things. If you are an advanced capitalist country you are always going to experience unemployment at various levels. It is an economic measure that people introduce in order to cope with a downturn. Equally, when there is a boom you have skills shortages. It has been around a while, as you say, but with careful consideration as well as being innovative we can make sure that we do not have the same levels of unemployment that there are in Portugal and Greece. Twenty per cent is regrettable, but it could have been a lot more without the interventions that we have had.
[normal]Lord Haskel:[bold] So we can work more closely with employers and we can provide continuity to apprentices if their schemes are disrupted. What more can we do?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: That is a major philosophical question. In terms of where we are at the present time, who could have foreseen the economic decline and the banking crisis? Maybe one or two commentators did. We have now seen closer regulation and closer controls to ensure that risk behaviour that threatens the economy can be marginalised or at least regulated better.
[normal]Lord Kakkar:[bold] One final point. If I understood correctly, you described the fact that you had maintained youth unemployment at around the 20% level compared to other European 
[normal]M
[normal]ember 
[normal]S
[normal]tates, and that that was partly attributable to the fact that you had mechanisms in place over a period of time before this big crisis hit us to ensure that
[normal] 
[normal]as it came to the fore you could do as much as possible to prevent this problem from expanding and larger numbers of youth becoming unemployed. Do you think that European schemes did enough previously to emphasise that need to prepare for crisis rather than deal with it?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: I suppose that is a difficult question in that each member state’s economic development will be at a different stage. In 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], we have traditionally had high levels of unemployment, but we significantly reduced those in the 10 years previously. However, that is against the background of a construction sector collapsing by almost 40% and retail sales and retail jobs down by 10%. That is directly about people either having the confidence to spend and to go out and generate economic activity. 
[normal]As far as the European Union’s funding is concerned, because it represents only 7% we have to look at it in a niche way. That is what we have done
[normal]:
[normal] we have largely used ESF funding through priority 1 to maintain the voluntary and community sector, the third sector, because they are the people who we feel are best placed to deal with the particular problems that the young people who are unemployed and NEET young peopl
[normal]e are experiencing, because those young people
[normal] do not by and large come into the formal sector unless they are mandated through jobs and benefits. If you are a 16 or 17 year-old, you do not get any funding in any case. We will provide with them an EMA, but sadly that cannot be paid for out of European funding, because you cannot pay training allowances out of the European fund. 
[normal]Q67 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] You mentioned migration earlier. As we all know, there has been massive migration from the Republic. I wonder 
[normal]whether
[normal], maybe separately, you could tell us the extent to which migration has changed in the past four or five years in Northern Ireland, and the extent to which that might have impacted on the numbers who are unemployed. We can deal with that separately if you would write to us, please. 
[normal]What is your view of the role that employers
[normal] 
[normal]play, be they private or public, and the extent to which they are involved in tackling the issue? 
[normal]W
[normal]hat you have been describing to us
[normal] is very impressive
[normal]. However, the Government have undertaken much of that. Could you talk about what the private sector’s role has been, the plans for the future and the extent to which changes in the public sector are impacting on 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]?
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Before you answer that, could you reply in writing to Lord Brooke’s fir
[normal]st question? If you do not mind, could you 
[normal]keep your answers brief now
[normal]? W
[normal]e do not want to keep you long beyond your scheduled time. 
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: Again, I would point to the issue of the small size of communities. We have very good relationships with employers. We are continually asking employers about skills which they require us to be providing for them. Having that in the one department is very important. We have various programmes, such as Steps to Work, youth employment schemes and the ESF programme. There is a lot of private sector support. Equally, the public sector has been providing placement opportunities. We are looking at offering placements in the Civil Service, and many of the local councils provide work placements and paid employment schemes through our 
[normal]p
[normal]athways strategy. We have just completed a major review of apprenticeships with a view to looking at apprenticeships going from level 3 to level 8 in the future, and expanding that provision. 
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: Alongside that, it is worth mentioning that the careers service is also part of our department. It is not like local government and it has not been privatised. It remains with the Department for Employment and Learning. Interestingly, it provides ongoing mentoring, help and support for young people within secondary schools. More importantly, it also contracts our NEETs people, because we have unique learning numbers within 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]. I
[normal]t is the same within the 
[normal]United Kingdom
[normal] as well. They are case-loading roughly 1,500 young people who are currently NEETs, who they are mentoring and seeing. The other thing is that the careers service is now doing more work with employers by way of spending two weeks in areas of growth within the economy, so that they can talk much more meaningfully about the types of jobs 
[normal]that 
[normal]are coming forward and the changes within the Northern Ireland economy. We have a very good working relationship with employers. We do not always get along with the employers’ organisations, but we certainly have a useful dialogue with them. It is not polemical
[normal]; 
[normal]it is more dialogue. 
[normal] 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] You mentioned 
[normal]p
[normal]athways just now. Earlier, there was point about the large number of people who were not on the 
[normal]p
[normal]athways programme. Can you explain what happened to those people? What are they doing?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: As I said, 
[normal]pathways to success 
[normal]has six elements to it. One of the programmes 
[normal]that 
[normal]we tried focusing on was the collaboration and innovation fund, which has 6,400 places in the next two years. We started that programme in February of this year and we already have 1,400 people going through it. We believe that we are on target, which is roughly 3,000 per year. Those young people, had they not come on to the collaboration and innovation fund, may well have just been at home. Interestingly, I always think about young people and every one of them has a mobile phone; there are not many who do not. Maybe they cannot always pay for the phone by top-ups. One of our organisations provides them with a SIM card for the month. If they turn up, that is fine; if they do not turn u
[normal]p, the SIM card is cut off. T
[normal]here are lots of incentives there and innovative ways of looking at how you incentivise these young people. Having a mobile phone, and one that works, is very important. 
[normal]Q68 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal] 
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] I want you to elaborate on young people. How do you think the position can be improved by involving them rather more?
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: We have involved young people in the development of 
[normal]p
[normal]athways to 
[normal]s
[normal]uccess. 
[normal]A
[normal] young person’s version of the consultation document went out when the strategy was being designed. There was a NEET strategy forum, and specifically a youth development officer within that and youth forum to inform our development of policy. This week we are having a major EU conference
[normal] that is 
[normal]specifically focused on NEETs. The young people have been involved in designing that conference. They had what was called a fringe event last week, the outworkings of which will be workshops on the Thursday afternoon of the conference this week. We have also done various SurveyMonkey questionnaires, which have elicited views from young people about what they need, what works for them and how they can be more involved in the decisions that will affect their future. We have regional focus groups for those who have not been able to be involved in the fringe event, for example. We have various voluntary organisations, such as one called Youth Action Northern Ireland, which have organised these events for us to ensure that we can hear the voice of young people. Specifically for this conference, a group of young people have been offered WorldHost training. They will be meeting and greeting the 300 delegates who will be attending this conference. We have participation from all over 
[normal]Europe
[normal] at this conference. We have the deputy-director general—  
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: DG Employment.
[normal]Heather Cousins[bold]: —coming along to speak. 
[normal]Lord Clinton-Davis:[bold] That is all very well, but what has been the reaction of the younger people? You are saying that certain things have been offered to them, but how are they reacting?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: A few years ago they came and demonstrated outside our building and said, “What are you doing for us?”. That was the start of a dialogue with these young people. We were not complacent by any stretch of the imagination. We also have this NEET strategy forum
[normal],
[normal] which is a voluntary organisation that has come together. It has 65 members from across all walks of life in 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal], from voluntary and community sectors, employers’ groups, parenting groups, educationalists and various other people. They came along and lobbied the Minister. We have given them some money and organised them. They act as a sounding board for a whole range of different organisations that work with young people. More importantly, five of the people who are on the NEET strategy forum were elected to represent them on the ministerial advisory group on NEETs, so they have a voice right at the heart of government. They are there to challenge us as civil servants, and others, at these meetings about the strategy’s progress. 
[normal]W
[normal]e have a young person’s voice on that advisory group as well. We believe that we engage quite a lot with young people, and with those who represent their views. We could always do more, I am sure, but what we have done to date is a fair representation of useful engagement, and it has borne fruit.  
[normal]Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe:[bold] Is anybody doing similar things elsewhere in the 
[normal]UK
[normal] that you know about?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: I think we have borrowed some ideas from other parts of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] in the way
[normal] in which
[normal], for example, libraries engage with young people. Some of the research work that has been done in the Midlands and around 
[normal]Birmingham
[normal] and 
[normal]Sheffield
[normal] is quite interesting. We always keep up to date with what is happening. I come back to saying that the unique circumstances 
[normal]that 
[normal]we have in Northern Ireland, the fact that we have one department with control over quite a number of functions which would fall under several different departments in the English model, provides us with a critical mass and the ability to be able to react where necessary with resources, and to go out through competitive tendering in order to secure contracts for people to deliver products for us. We have a very strong governance and accountability that goes along with that. We should be public money ambassadors. 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] You mentioned a young persons’ version of a consultation document. Could you send us a copy, please?
[normal]Baroness O'Cathain:[bold] That was one of the things that I was going to comment on. Lord Brooke mentioned the other parts of the 
[normal]UK
[normal] having that face
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] 
[normal]face with NEETs et cetera. What about other 
[normal]M
[normal]ember 
[normal]S
[normal]tates? Do you know if this goes on in, say, 
[normal]Poland
[normal], 
[normal]Spain
[normal], 
[normal]Greece
[normal] or 
[normal]Lithuania
[normal]?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: I am certainly aware, for example, that in Germany their apprentices go and spend some time in other 
[normal]M
[normal]ember 
[normal]S
[normal]tates as part of the funding which they get, not only in order to experience another member state but to develop their language skills. I am certainly aware of that. Beyond that, I have no other particular examples.  
[normal]Q69 [bold]&#xa0; 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] I will ask you one ve
[normal]r
[normal]y quick thing and then we must let you go. How do you rate, in terms of accessing EU funds, in comparison with other the other devolved Administrations?
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: The funding is made available to 
[normal]Westminster
[normal] and then we argue, so we do, based o
[normal]n a number of different factors. O
[normal]bviously there are a lot of statistics. The last time we got slightly more
[normal] than what should have been available to us. Under this new programme we got an extra €50 million, so I think we are doing okay. 
[normal]The [bold]Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] All right. That is a good final point. May I say, first of all, thank you very much for coming. Secondly,
[normal] if you have thoughts when you go back which you would like to pass on to the Committee to help us, could you please write? That would be extremely helpful. 
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: Yes, sure. 
[normal]The[bold] Acting [bold]Chairman:[bold] Thank you very much for coming. It has been very useful to have you here. 
[normal]Brian Smart[bold]: Thank you.
