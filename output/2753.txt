[[[A programme of land reform should be seen as a means of]]]extending property rights including ownership, leasing and renting thereby tackling inequality;increasing the participation of communities in decision making over land use policy and land use therebystrengthening democracy;using fiscal and taxation measures to promote specific outcomes thereby providing public benefits and delivering the Scottish Government's Land Use Strategy.&#xa0;

[[[Land value tax and land use tax]]]could provide powerful tools to guide land ownership and land use change, and provide a valuable and alternative source of revenue.&#xa0;

[[[Reforming the law of succession]]]to allow all children the right to inherit heritable and moveable property has the potential to create smallerparcels of land and increase the rate of land coming onto the market, especially very large rural landholdings, thereby accelerating land reform.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Crofting]]]is a secure tenure system for extending sustainable land use, creating diverse livelihoods and small scalelow intensity food and timber production. Measures should be introduced to:extend crofting tenure to all parts of Scotland;create incentives for land owners to create new crofts;create planning guidelines for the creation of new croft housing where new crofts are establishedcreate a target of 10,000 new crofts by 2030;The Scottish Government (SG) should lead the way by creating crofts, including woodland crofts, on SGowned land.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Hutting]]]can allow the urban and rural population to benefit from Land Reform through access to land forrecreational occupation. Measures should be introduced to:provide strong political support for the concept of hutting;create incentives to landowners to release land through sale or lease;create changes to the planning law to provide a definition of a hut and reform of the planning law;create changes to the building standards to develop a simple process for obtaining consent to construct huts;create a target of 1,000 new huts by 2020.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Allotments]]]can allow the urban population access to land for growing food and recreation. The SG shouldprovide strong political support for the expansion of allotments;create a target of 50,000 new urban allotments by 2030.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[The Land Reform Act]]]is not working. Measures should be introduced to:simplify and streamline the processes of the Land Reform Act (LRA);extended the scope of the LRA;amend the LRAÂ  to allow access to the LRA and the Land Fund by properly constituted bodies set up with the purpose of establishing new crofts, small holdings and huts;similar amendments should be made to the the National Forest Land Scheme .

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Resources]]]The Scottish Government should ensure that there are adequate resources including financial resources to drive forward a comprehensive land reform programme. A new body should be created to ensure effective delivery of the land reform programme.&#xa0;October 2013
