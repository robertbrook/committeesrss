"&#xa0;\nSubmission from the British Property Federation (FDC32)&#xa0;\nThis evidence by the British Property Federation has been \nprepared as a contribution to the Communit\nies\n and Local Government Select Committee inquiry into \nwhether and how fiscal and financial powers could be devolved to cities\n and city regions\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe British Property Federation (BPF) is the voice of property in the UK, representing companies owning, managing and investing in property. This includes a broad range of businesses – commercial property owners, the financial institutions and pension fund\ns, corporate landlords, local private landlords – as well as all those professions that support the industry. \n&#xa0;IntroductionThe BPF strongly supports the principle of\n devolving\n greater powers and responsibilities to cities\n / city regions\n.\n We believe that \nthe\n \npoor comparative performance of many English cities is due at least in part to \nthe over centralised nature of Government in the UK.\n \nInitiatives\n such as City Deals represent a \nstep\n in the right direction but much more needs to be done to give \nour major \ncities\n the\n degree of\n initiative and the\n level of\n resources \nthat will\n enable them to fulfil their potential as  drivers of growth. The predominant feeling\n within the property sector\n is that many in central Government are \nstill \nreluctant to let go and give \nc\nities\n their head. This is in stark contrast to the greater autonomy, particularly fiscal autonomy, enjoyed by many competitor cities elsewhere in Europe.  \nWe believe that those running cities, working in partnership with business and other interest groups,\n are best place to understand local needs\n – for instance on matters such as \ninfrastructure\n and\n skills \n- a\nnd have the drive and \ncommitment\n to carry through appropriate programmes   to address them \nThe underperformance of English citiesA  series\n  of research reports over the last decade  ha\ns\n highlighted the underperformance of English cities in comparison with their international  peers including those in Europe.  In his 2004 report, ‘Competitive European Cities: Where do the Core Cities Stand?’,\n  Professor Michael   Parkinson  said that ‘It is clear that, despite their relative renaissance in recent years, the Core Cities still lag behind their European counterparts in terms of competitiveness.’  Although he was at pains to stress that there are \nimportant variations within the UK Core Cities and \nthat many \nhad improved their performance his overall message was stark: UK cities do not punch their economic weight in a European context. They lag significantly behind many of their European continental \ncounterparts\n in areas such as  innovation, workforce qualifications, connectivity, employment rates, social composition and attractiveness to the private sector\n. This is made worse by the fact that European cities do not punch their weight globally.\nAnothe\nr report in 2006, The Competitive Economic Performance of English Cities, by Oxford Brookes University and others also highlighted the uncompetitiveness of English cites.\nThe latest UK Competitiveness Index for 2013 also point\ns\n to\n a\n growing divergence betw\neen the best and least well perfoming areas in the UK\n,\n the best area\ns\n being almost exclusively in London and the South \nE\nast.\nWhilst \nmany of the core cities have made real \nprogress \nsince 2004\n the long economic recession \nthat the country has suffered for muc\nh of the last decade\n mean\ns that many of the \n  fundamental problems  of competitiveness\n highlighted by \nP\nrofessor Parkinson ad others\n remain\n to be tackled\n.\nWould greater devolution of fiscal powers help?Tackling uncompetitiveness is\n, \nof course\n, a highly \ncom\nplex issue\n and there is no simple answer\n. However,  one \ncontributory factor\n that \nhas been\n consistently\n been \n raised \nby those who have looked at this issue\n \nis the over centralisation of decision making and fisca\nl\n control in the UK \n \nin contrast \nto the greater autonomy enjoyed by many \n more successful c\nit\nies in Europe and elsewhere\n. \nT\nhis it is often suggested\n \ndetracts from the ability of \ncities / city regions\n to   \nframe policies and set priorities \nbest \n suited to the needs of their areas. \nT\nhe trend in continental Europe has been to decentralise and regionalise\n \ndecision-making, placing powers at the lowest level.\n As a result, c\nontinental cities have responsibility\n \nfor a wider range of functions which affect their economic competitiveness than\n do their\n \nUK counterparts.\n \nProfessor Parkinson summed up the position as follows\n:\nContinental cities typically have more diverse forms of local revenue and more buoyant tax bases, which make them less fiscally dependent upon the national state and more pro\nactive in their development strategies. Many European cities have powerful elected mayors who give clear leadership to economic development. Many successful cities have been deeply involved in European systems and networks, which has encouraged them to be\ninternationalist, expansionist and entrepreneurial. The mix varies but it is difficult to\ndisagree with the view that their combination of powers and resources make continental\ncities more proactive, more entrepreneurial and probably more competitive. The \nmost\nsuccessful cities in Europe remain German. They have substantial powers and resources and operate in the most decentralised national system. UK cities arguably have fewer powers, resources and responsibilities than their competitors and have been less\n engaged in the European project. And they have been less successful economically. The more centralised governmental, institutional, and financial system must be one dimension of the\nunderperformance\n of UK cities. The policy implication is not a short term one. But it is\nclear. Letting go achieves more.\n&#xa0;\nThe Oxford Brookes report \nalso \nconcluded\n that more autonomy would be helpful:\nUrban economic governance is weak and relatively ineffective in England\n. In\n \norder for the cities themselves to respond more effectively to the framework\n \nconditions set by national government they need be given more power and\n \nfreedom to introduce new institutional structures tailored to the speciﬁc\n \neconomic needs of their loca\nl economies. This could include the freedom to\n \nreform local government institutions in order to make them more dynamic and\n \nincrease their capacity for long-term strategic decision making.\n&#xa0;\nThe\n most recent \nreport \nto address this issue, albeit in a London co\nntext, was\n ‘Raising the Capital’\n,\n issued in \nM\nay 2013\n by\n \nthe London Finance Commission.\n \nAlthough \nthe Commission\n felt that academic evidence about t\nh\ne impact of devolving fiscal pow\ner\ns on economic growth was inconclusive\n it highlighted\n (using work \ncommissioned fro\nm\n the University of Toronto\n)\n  the very low levels of fiscal autonomy enjoyed b\ny\n UK cities\n compared with those in other countries\n. The report\n concluded that London would benefit from having more revenue streams under its control\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe view of the BPFThe predominant view within the property industry is that strong local leadership and initiative \nare\n essential to taking forward\n a long-term vision for a city / city region. However\n the\n ambition and enthusiasm of civic leaders and other\n local lea\nders\n is being stymied by \na continuing\n reluctance\n within\n central Government to relinquish control. \nT\nhere is a\n \nstrong desire\n within the sector \nto move away from what has\n apt\nl\ny\n \nbeen \ndubbed the ‘infantilisation’ of local government.  \n \nOver the last year the B\nPF has held a number of high level roundtables in major cities around the country including Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham which have brought \ntogether \nleading local \nfigures in\n the property industry \nand\n leaders of local government.  The aim was to explore barriers to economic growth and development and ways of overcoming them.\nThere was a remarkable degree of cross-sector support for\n the principle of\n devolving greater powers to \ncities / city regions.\n \n \nA\nmong the k\ney messages were\n:\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAs already mentioned,\n the case for\n greater \ndevolution w\nas\n \nrecently \nexplored \nby\n the London Finance Commission\n in  its report\n, ‘Raising th\ne Capital’ .\n \nAlthough the report was London specific many of the arguments put forward are just as relevant to other cities.  Indeed it could be argued that\n the\n \nneed for greater autonomy is even greater in other cities as \nLondon is such a major global forc\ne that it has the capacity to thrive even in the absence of greater autonomy.  \n&#xa0;\nPicking up some of the themes discussed in that report \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n9 January 2014\n&#xa0;\n"
