"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Clive Best (IPC0053)I am\n an independent scientist. I have a PhD in High Energy Physics and previously worked at CERN, Rutherford Lab, JET Fusion Experiment and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commissio\nn.  All opinions expressed here \nare entirely my \nown.\nThe fifth assessment report is a comprehensive and impressive review of the current status of climate science. \nAlthough the message\n \nremains\n one of warning, the results are actually \nrather \nencouraging. \nThe relevant new conclusions of AR5 are:\nIn general AR5 is good news for the world and good news for the UK.  The world has more time to adapt to a low carbon future\n than \npreviously assumed\n.  Professor Dieter Helm ma\nkes a strong argument in  “The Carbon Crunch” \nfor gas\n as a \nlow carbon \ntransi\ntion path\n. \nOther\n \nimplications for UK energy policy are:\nReferences\n1. \nA cost Benefit Analysis of Wind Power, Eleanor Denny, PhD.
