"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Katrine Rogers (WSC012)&#xa0;\nMore part time opportunities for women returning to work in new jobs after a career break are required \n&#xa0;\n1. This is a personal account of my reasons, as a woman, for currently having left a STEM career in academia. I do not believe them to be unique, \nquite the contrary. I give some background information for context, and then point out some problems in paragraph 4: problems that most women in my situation face. Issues I feel the government should be addressing are given in paragraph 7.  Women need far \nmore opportunities to work part time, peculiarly when applying for new jobs to return to the workplace.\n&#xa0;\n2. I did a PhD in physics and continued on to do a postdoctoral research position in mathematical engineering. I love maths, science and research, and \nwas sure that nothing would make me leave. I had never felt discriminated against in any way, or that I had any different opportunities to my male peers.\n&#xa0;\n3. Then I decided to have children. I was advised to wait until I had a permanent position, preferabl\ny until I had reached senior lecturer. I was not prepared to wait until I was significantly older and risks of complications had increased significantly.  As I was on a short-term contract, (which is the case for most STEM researchers in academia under the\n age of 35) I was unable to return to my previous position after my maternity leave, and was also unable to benefit from contractual maternity pay. I was also advised to apply for a new position to extend my contract without telling anyone that I was pregn\nant until after being offered a position. I could not do this. I know the law does not allow discrimination against pregnant women, but this is easy to get round in practice, especially in academia where projects and backgrounds are so different.\n&#xa0;\n3. The p\nrospect of applying for a new position while looking after a baby and looking for part-time work was too daunting, and seemed too unlikely to succeed to even attempt. There are very few part-time positions available for new applicants. It may be possible t\no reduce a full-time post to part time, but to find a position which will take you part time from the start seems very rare.\n&#xa0;\n4. I therefore had a short gap before my next baby, hoping that I could get back to work more quickly that way. My second is now 1\n5 months, and I'm trying to find jobs to apply for, but the task is very daunting due to several factors:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. I expect I will manage to return to a STEM career, but I expect it will be at a much lower level than I planned before having children. Perhaps doing some\nthing like tutoring, and keeping a little research going in my spare time.\n&#xa0;\n6. For comparison, my husband did his physics PhD at the same time as me, but finished slightly later and started his first postdoctoral research position 8 months later than me. H\nis prospects for a successful career in academia are looking very promising, whereas mine now seem almost non-existent, due to having children and not wanting to return to work straight away, full time.\n&#xa0;\n7. The biggest problem seems to me to be a lack of p\nart time positions for new applicants and help to return to work, and the extreme difficulty of following a career path successfully part time. Ideally I should be able to return to work at 50% and be able to reach the same goals in twice as long. This, ho\nwever, seems very far from reality. Could the government provide some incentives for hiring parents part-time after career breaks? The system is completely set up for full-time jobs. Researchers apply to research councils for funding in full-time positions\n, and if they hire someone part time they risk losing some of their hard earned funding if they cannot find someone else part-time for the rest of the funding. Could research councils encourage funding applications with part-time jobs, or automatically ext\nend the length of the funding proportionally if a person is hired part time?  Without something like that, women wishing to return part time are not competitive on the job market. Anti-discrimination laws seem of little use in practice. \n&#xa0;\nAugust 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
