[[[Written evidence submitted by Valerie Hunter]]]&#xa0;Education Select Committee   -   Academy Inquiry&#xa0;1.  Are academies as successful as they make out – or is it spin and propaganda ?[This is about Harris, mostly in Croydon, but no doubt applies to other academy chains.]&#xa0;Primary Schools2.  Dictatorship, hypocrisy, bullying, manipulation by Michael Gove, DfE, Harris and even Ofsted.Michael Gove insisting that Harris is the only sponsor acceptable to him, although the majority of parents at Roke, Coleraine Park and Downshill [and others elsewhere] did not want them as sponsor.  Handing over schools with no subsequent control !        Dictatorship.&#xa0;3.  DfE do not look at their own verified statistics, when quoting their rhetoric.'Academy sponsors are assessed vigorously to ensure they have 'the necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements.'So how do they explain that with Riddlesdown's help (Roke's preferred sponsor), Roke's grades went up from 64% to 80% - and that with Harris's help Peckham Park went DOWN from 90%  to 61 %.     Hypocrisy !&#xa0; 4.  Although they denied it, DfE bullied and threatened these three schools.  [See Google -Press Release from Coleraine Park Primary Governors, for example]&#xa0;5.  Harris just come into the schools and alter what they like, irrespective of the wishes of parents.Harris are accused of deliberately manipulating pupils' attainment data, and using American resources  [skip rope etc],  and letters home have included incorrect grammar and spelling.Exercises also incorrect !  This is Harris's 'exceptional primary team'?&#xa0;6.  Ofsted is even more worrying.One inspection (20 min) said the children were bored, another that they were enjoyed the school.One said they improved under Riddlesdown, but not enough !  See above re Peckham Park!One said that children with special needs were falling behind at the school, and the lack of support provided.     So the 'exceptional primary team' now helping Roke are providing LESS support !The academy management are accused of trying to force out SEN pupils by withdrawing all one-to-one help in order to improve the school's league table ratings, literacy homework apparently cut and pasted from AMERICAN SOURCES - ['The children jumped rope at recess'], incorrect grammar and spelling in letters home, manipulating data on children's attainment tests, and much more, including children in tears.(http://insidecroydon.com/2013/10/29/harris-primary-reduces-sen-support-and-adjusts-

[[[7.  League table success apparently being more important to Harris than children who n]]]

[[[eed the most help.  This is why Sponsor chains should not take over primary schools.]]]                         --------------------------------------------&#xa0;8.  The fifth Primary school taken over by Harris, (and the third to object !)  was Roke in Croydon.  .FACT OR FICTION ?&#xa0;9.  By now, DfE must have known how Harris was doing with its FIRST primary school take-over.

[[[But ]]]

[[[DfE]]]

[[[ IGNORED  their own verified statistics]]] !&#xa0;10.  The first Harris take-over was Peckham Park, presumably requested because the SATS were 64%.In January 2013, DfE published the first SATS % grades.    [Harris Peckham Park was the only primary that had been open long enough for comparison statistics]Peckham Park school – last results before closure  - 90%Harris Peckham Park – results – 61% !!!And expected progress went DOWN  from 95% for both English and Maths for community school to 90% for English and 79% for Maths for Harris !&#xa0;11.  This 'evidence' of worse SATs  under Harris therefore did

[[[ NOT]]] show 'necessary improvements' to results at all!It shows that

[[[ Harris DID NOT have the 'necessary capacity and experience to bring about improvements]]]'.  Quite the reverse !  If this was the result after a year with their FIRST primary, how could they cope with the other three they already had – let alone take on 5 more later that year.&#xa0;12.  When challenged by Roke about this appalling drop in in SATS % at Peckham Park, the response at a meeting was 'Could have been worse'  !!!!!A further comment as written answer to a number of questions stated   '2011 year group were a relatively able group – 2012 were less able'.&#xa0;13.  This must apply to MOST schools whose grades went down for one year (Riddlesdown for example a drop of 10%  for GCSE/Equivalents, NOT 29% as Harris Peckham Park), but they are called 'failing' !     But Harris Merton went

[[[ down 13%]]] !!     Harris failing ?&#xa0;14.  A 29% drop in SATS at a school would have had an immediate take-over on the cards – but not for a Harris Academy.     Instead,

[[[ kno]]]

[[[DfE]]]

[[[ still forced ]]]

[[[Roke]]]

[[[ to become a Harris Academy against the wishes of most parents]]].        [ A cynic could suggest that Harris wanted this school for  a feeder for its Purley one, instead of Riddlesdown.]&#xa0;15.  The Ofsted Reports for Harris Peckham Park  January 2013 (a year and a quarter after being taken over) gave '

[[[REQUIRES IMPROVEMENT]]]' [3] for '

[[[Achievement of pupils]]]', '

[[[Quality of Teaching]]]' and '

[[[Leadership and Management]]]'.And exactly the same 'requires improvement' grades for Harris Chafford Hundred  (the second primary taken over by Harris) in November 2012.'Your Thurrock  2nd January 2013 'Ofsted has told Harris Primary that it requires improvement, or risks being put in Special Measures' !!    Follow-up Report 19th March still critical.

[[[SO WHAT HAPPENED TO HARRIS'S 'EXCEPTIONAL PRIMARY TEAM']]] ?&#xa0;16.  'Consultation' revealed that 94% of parents did not want to be taken over,  but if they had to become an academy, 81% did not want Harris as sponsor.&#xa0;17.  With Roke, for the third time in a row, Harris had been forced on parents against their will – consultation ignored.&#xa0;18.  'The outstanding team of teachers and leaders were not in place when the SATS [Peckham Park] were prepared and taken, and have the expertise needed to give Roke the support it needs.'Where were they then that Peckham Park reduced by so much under Harris, and Chafford Hundred risked going into special measures ?How could Harris be allowed to take over  more schools when they hadn't got this team in place for the first one to improve in over a year ? [They told Roke that there would be evidence of acceleration of children's progress in the first two terms ! Not  

[[[DETERIORATION]]] after four terms for Peckham Park and one at Chafford Hundred !!]   How many 'extra' teams are NOT in place for the other 4 schools to be taken over in 2013/14 ?&#xa0;19.  When Roke asked about 'LONG TERM experience' – the reply was 'We have recruited a team of outstanding teachers led by Sir Robin Basher who have proven good and outstanding teaching and outstanding schools'.But Sir Robin had recently joined.  Was that long-term experience  on Primary schools !They also responded  to the questionaire from Roke with 'Support from outstanding primary teachers to support improvement for 2 to 3 days a week on average.  Regular support from Robin Basher about a day a fortnight.'And 'currently planning 5 primaries including Roke' – '3 more outstanding Primary Advisory Teachers are being recruited.'And  'Can support expansion at 8 to 10 additional schools a year.'     And DfE are letting them !&#xa0;20.  Lord Nash, the Under-Secretary for the DfE, in a letter to the local MP. Sir Richard Ottaway who favoured Riddlesdown for the take-over, stated that Harris is a 'strong and proven sponsor'.And with  'an exceptional primary team'          [He obviously is incapable of reading DfE's verified statistics too.)&#xa0;21.  He also writes 'The formal consultation is usually started when the proposed sponsor has been identified by the Department, the governing body has met with, and

[[[ agreed to be sponsored by this sponsor]]]

[[[SPIN]]]  -  Said to have 10 applicants for every place – but 2011/12  figures published in the local papers (I can't find later) show that there were 2110 applications, but only  543 first choices – i.e. the other 1567 (three quarters of the applicants) put down between 1 and 5 other schools in preference !    This is deliberately misleading parents.Counting all 6 choices as popularity, even the most unpopular school in Croydon is over-subscribed&#xa0;24.   2012 VA score shows Crystal Palace with the lowest score [998.3] of all Harris Academies and most Croydon schools.Does this mean that Crystal Palace concentrated on getting the most pupils with C for English/Maths, and ignored giving effort, encouragement etc to those  who should have got a B or A instead.Exclusions. - 2009/10  5th highest out of Croydon's 22 state schools                      2010/11 joint 7th     -  2011/12 10th.&#xa0;25.  Harris South Norwood£32m of taxpayers' money rebuilt this school with new equipment and facilities giving them a great advantage over other schools.

[[[SPIN]]]

[[[  -]]]  1220 applications, but only 287 first choices – the other 933 wanted SOMEWHERE ELSE&#xa0;26.  The official yearly intake was 210 pupils,, only it appears that they did not take in other children, in spite of shortage of places  for another 4 years    [ in respective years 105, 91, 95, 108.][Did they get funding for the children they would have in the future that helped give additional attention to those already at the school, and boost results ?]

[[[SPIN]]]  - The 2011 verified results showed for the first time a breakdown of the 5 A-C GCSE results including Maths and English into two columns – GCSE ONLY and GCSE/Equivalent.South Norwood's figure

[[[ dropped from 75% to 46%]]]  (29% !!! - the biggest decrease of Croydon's 27.   22 state schools, and 9% higher than the one in second position !As the 'Equivalent' figure is the only one published in the local paper, and by Harris, this gives parents a totally misleading impression that 75% were 'good' GCSEs.&#xa0; 28.  Exclusions :  2009/10 – the most in Croydon : 2010/11 – the 2nd highest  :  2011/12 – the third highest!                                        &#xa0;29.   Harris Purley£18m of taxpayers' money spent on new facilities and equipment.

[[[SPIN]]] - Continually referred to by Harris as underachieving and failing, nothing could be further from the truth. Five years or so previously the school had been at rock-bottom, bad reputation,so would not be academic.   But five years later their CVA improvement score from what they were expected to get was in the top 3% in the country and the 2nd highest in Croydon !   [Ignored ]Science up to 75% from 54%, and all other columns in DfE's verified performance tables up ABOVE Croydon average, including 5 A-Cs, Level 1 English/Maths, and Modern languages.The joint English/Maths up 8% from 18% to 25 % was the ONLY GRADE BELOW !- AND THE ONLY GRADE TAKEN ANY NOTICE OF!National Challenge Inspectors said that the pupils would pass the then required 30% in the summer [they did- 33%] and would continue to rise as the school had more academic  pupils – which they did – but Harris unfairly claimed credit that THEY had turned the school around !The school's final Science figure was 94% in 2009 – up from 27% in 2007, and other subjects continued to rise.The unpopular jibe was also untrue. September 2008 190 pupils turned up for 180 places !But the Council said the school was going to close and be moved to the far north of the borough which accounted for the low first choice for 2009.

[[[SPIN]]] -  In 2011 the GCSE ONLY grade drop from 61% to 42%, Equivalent. (3rd highest in Croydon).  Again parents misled by higher figure.In 2012 Purley only entered an average 6.3 GCSEs  - only Harris Peckham was lower.&#xa0;30.  Baccalaureate – In 2012  South Norwood 4%.  Purley 3%.Most other Harris academies elsewhere 5% or under !&#xa0;&#xa0;33.  It seems to me that too many academies are more interested in prestige than welfare of children.The non-academic are just as important.  A child who gets support and improves their score from that expected is more likely to adopt a good attitude to work, and be a success, even if not academically.   This continual 'failing' label is disastrous.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0;
