default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultFurther written evidence submitted by the defaultLocal Government Association (LGA)defaultAbout the LGAdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.
default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultEvidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA’s understanding is that there is not a ‘rule’ as such in legislation or statutory guidance which states that children cannot or should not be placed more than 20 miles from home, although the Department for Education (DfE) would be best placed to confirm this.  
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, councils are required to record information on the distance from home at which looked after children are placed and to report this to the DfE.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe distance is measured by reference to the definition included in ‘
defaultDepartment for Education (DfE) Statistics SSDA903, Return Guidance Notes Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England, 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013’
default, which states that:
default&#xa0;
default“2.2.1 Home Postcode defaultThe postcode of the address where the child was living when they first became looked after, if the child becomes looked after while in hospital after being born, use the mother’s home address.” 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis information is published annually by the DfE as ‘Children looked after by local authorities in England, including adoption’ and includes the number of children placed at more than 20 miles and at less than 20 miles
default. 
defaultThis publication 
defaultalso breaks th
defaulte data

defaultaccording to 
defaultwhether placements are inside or outside the authority’s boundary.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThis information is also required by Ofsted 
defaultfor individual children 
defaultin respect of case sampling and case tracking as part of the single inspection framework for children in need of help and protection, children looked after an
defaultd care leavers.  
defaultTherefore, although it may not be in legislation, the fact that 
defaultthis information
default is part of mandatory reporting requirements to central government and is a consideration in inspections will act as a driver of behaviour and may account for the confusion that appears to exist about whether or not there is a ‘rule’.
default&#xa0;
defaultIn any case councils, as corporate parents, will want to ensure the best placement for each looked after child.  Indeed, they are required 
defaultby the Children Act 1989 
defaultto place a child in the most appropriate placement and, so far as is reasonably practicable, the placement should allow the child to live near their home. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is important to recognise that in some cases it will be in the child’s best interests for them to be placed at a distance from their home.  It may be for their own safety, for example in cases of exploitation or gang involvement.  Children’s needs may also require specialist care w

defaultIt is also important to recognise the differing geography of local authorities when discussing out of area placements; a child placed in a neighbouring authority could, for example, be closer to home than a child placed within the boundaries of a large shire county.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe clustering of residential children’s homes in certain geographical areas contributes to the number of out
default of authority placements made. 
defaultDeveloping councils’ market shaping role is one of the reasons the LGA commissioned the OPM action research
default, referred to in written evidence submitted to the Committee in September, 
defaultinto more effective strategic commissioning of residential children’s homes.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Government has consulted on introducing a requirement that Directors of Children’s Services must ‘sign off’ decisions to place children out of area and at distance.  While we understand and appreciate the intention of this proposal, it is important that it does not create unnecessary bureaucracy.  Also, as noted in our 
defaultprevious 
defaultwritten evidence to the 
defaultC
defaultommittee, regulation can be helpful, but can only achieve so much
default.  It 
defaultis also important to consider the broader issues presented by the market for residential children’s homes and
default,
default in particular
default,
default the imbalance of provision across the country which contributes to children being placed out of area. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIntroducing a more stringent ‘rule’ that councils could not place children more than an arbitrary distance away would be unworkable and could potentially act against the best interests of children for the reasons set out above.
