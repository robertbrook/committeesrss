[[[Executive Summary]]]This is the response of. Our responses focus on the need to design buildings to reduce heating, demand recover and recycle waste heat, and enable the installation and retrofitting of infrastructure to distribute renewable and recovered heat. This response is based on evidence developed as part of our activities, including reports for the Scottish and Westminster Governments, our recent book Carbon Management in the Built Environment, and through our professional networks.&#xa0;&#xa0;1.1. The government would be wise to recognise and respond to the different challenges posed by generating and distributing renewable heat compared to renewable electricity. In addition, heat needs to be treated as a waste product as well as something to be generated. As for electricity, there is huge potential in small and community scale generation, however there is also the need to introduce legislation to ensure waste heat is captured and recycled to local communities. This requires the Government to expand its approach to enable investment in the installation of new infrastructure to connect heat sources to households and local businesses, and could significantly reduce energy demand for heating. &#xa0;&#xa0;2.1. There is little evidence to suggest that the UK's heat demand is being significantly reduced by government policy beyond existing regulatory measures, principally the Building Regulations. DECC's own analyses rightly point to the role of the recession as a principle factor in the decline observed since 2008, whilst final energy consumption has rarely dipped below 140,000 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent since 1970, and there is good agreement when these figures are adjusted for the impact of temperature on energy demand.     &#xa0;&#xa0;3.1. This is a highly contested issue that, in our view, has not yet been adequately resolved. The Initiative for Carbon (ICARB), in which GCU is a partner, has previously issued an official statement here: http://icarb.org/2012/11/28/is-biomass-really-dirtier-than-coal/ &#xa0;&#xa0;4.1. There are significant concerns over the sustainability of large scale biomass, and over the sufficiency of the FSC label in ensuring all biomass is sustainably sourced. Given the quantities of wood expected to be used for biomass the 70% lower limit for FSC certification needs to become 100%, and stricter policing of overseas suppliers is needed. (Dr Baker has provided confidential written evidence on this to the Scottish Government which could be made available to this inquiry). Longer-term, biomass can only be considered sustainable if demand for fuel can be met from within the UK. These limits to the level of demand that can be met from sustainable sources mean that policies on the use of biomass should prioritise small to medium-scale CHP and district heating projects. &#xa0;&#xa0;5.1. Well-designed CHP-based district heating schemes should have no notable environmental impacts providing the buildings and sites selected for the CHP units are sufficiently ventilated and exposed to disperse emissions, particularly particulates from biomass CHP. However there are legitimate concerns over the impact of unabated emissions from large scale biomass, and over the use of individual domestic biomass CHP units in dense urban areas, where the 'canyoning effect' can concentrate emissions and impact on air quality.           &#xa0;&#xa0;6.1. The most significant risks for continuing the reliance on gas for space heating are security of supply and future price rises. Alastair Buchanan, the out-going head of Ofgem, illustrates the vulnerability of UK gas supplies in his talk on Ofgem's Project Discovery (see: http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Media/keyspeeches/Pages/security-of-supply.aspx ). This and other evidence shows that the UK is already vulnerable to interruptions and price rises, and therefore it is reasonable to recommend a transition away from using gas directly for space heating, however this needs to be supported by increased renewable electricity generation to match, and outpace, this fuel shift. (See also Baker et al., 2012).     &#xa0;&#xa0;7.1. The critical problems are a lack of investment in retrofitting infrastructure, and a lack of regulation to ensure that new housing is connected to CHP infrastructure, and to require the owners of new sources of waste heat to install infrastructure to distribute that heat to local homes and businesses. &#xa0;7.2. The first problem requires the Government to give consistent and long-term signals to the energy industry, supported by local decision-making, to enable the industry to expand heating infrastructure and make it flexible enough to deliver a range of heating fluids (biogas, steam, etc).  &#xa0;7.3. The second problem could be resolved by the introduction of a Heat Planning Law to ensure waste heat is recovered and recycled to local homes and businesses. This could be introduced through the existing planning  system, and could have the additional benefit of reducing emissions from transport through encouraging co-location of housing and employment.&#xa0;7.4. These issues and recommendations are detailed in our Housing Futures report (Baker, Emmanuel &amp; Phillipson, 2012).&#xa0;7.5. However there are also some significant untapped opportunities for developing alternative sources of community heating, for example using flooded mineworkings (see: http://www.gcu.ac.uk/newsevents/news/article.php?id=53804 )   &#xa0;&#xa0;8.1. Figures compiled as part of our work Emmanuel &amp; Baker, 2012) give approximate costs for individual domestic installations as: £2,000-£4,000 for solar thermal; £8,000-£17,000 for ground source heat pumps; £5,000 to £10,000 for air source heat pumps; and approximately £3,000 for individual CHP units. &#xa0;8.2. Based on our experience of working with local authorities and housing associations, it is the variability and uncertainty in payback periods, rather than the length of the payback period, that discourages investment. However these uncertainties can be significantly reduced by careful technology choice supported by occupant education. Here again, retrofitting infrastructure should be seen as key to enabling these technologies, for example by enabling CHP and GSHP community heating to be supplemented by building-integrated solar thermal and ASHPs. The long term aim should be capture and distribute or store all 'waste' heat from the built environment.     &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;9.1. Many experts expect overheating to become a significant problem for the UK as climate change progresses, however overheating can be predicted and buildings can be designed to minimise it (e.g. see CIBSE, 2013). &#xa0;9.2. An Expert Workshop convened by ClimateXChange Scotland (Beckmann, 2013) concluded that the most significant barrier to adapting the building stock to a warmer climate is the lack of an enabling environment. The report contains a list of 20 recommendations made by the experts, who included the renowned architect Bill Gething and representatives from Scotland's leading built environment research groups.&#xa0;&#xa0;10.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Installing heat pumps at a community scale (e.g. a community ground source heat pump) entails overcoming a range of barriers, including meeting planning law requirements, raising finance, and engaging with local government, delivery partners, and end-users. However the knock-on benefits of supporting community scale heat pumps are naturally more wide-ranging.&#xa0;10.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Take up of individual heat pump systems should largely reflect household awareness and preference. A suggestion here is that, whilst households may be less aware of heat pumps, the substantial academic evidence on the comparative benefits of solar thermal (e.g. Roaf et al., 2012) is being supported by consumer preference.    &#xa0;10.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Heat pumps also come in a variety of forms and vary significantly in scale, from small building-mounted ASHPs to large and innovative uses of the technology, for example exploiting flooded mineworkings in Glasgow (see: http://www.gcu.ac.uk/newsevents/news/article.php?id=53804 ). The RHI needs to be extended and made more flexible to better capture all these potential applications.   &#xa0;&#xa0;11.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Enrolment in the RHI requires a Green Deal assessment, which requires an up-front fee and associates the RHI with a much-criticised, and (to date) relatively unsuccessful initiative. It seems reasonable to expect that this will hamper its take up to some extent.  &#xa0;&#xa0;12.1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The Building Regulations in place across the UK currently disincentivise designers to use high thermal mass solutions to reduce and regulate heating energy demand, and to use natural ventilation systems (as opposed to the mechanical ventilation used in the PassivHaus system). Whilst both approaches are valid greater flexibility needs to be introduced to enable natural heating, cooling and ventilation solutions can compete with mechanical solutions, and without relaxing emissions reduction goals (e.g. see CIBSE, 2013; Roaf, 2012; &amp; Humphreys et al. 2011).    &#xa0;&#xa0;
