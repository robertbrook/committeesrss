"Written evidence submitted by the Refugee Children’s Consortium (RCC) (LAI 0054)&#xa0;\nIntroduction&#xa0;1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Refugee Children’s Consortium (RCC) is a group of \nNGOs working collaboratively to \nensure that the rights and needs of refugee children are\n promoted, respected and met in \naccordance with the relevant domestic, regional and\n international human rights and\n \nwelfare standards.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRefugee and \nmigrant\n children are children first and foremost and mu\nst be \nafforded the same rights and protection as any other child\nren in the UK. Article 2 of the \nUN Convention on the Rights of the Child \n(UNCRC) \nclearly st\nates that the rights within the \nConvention should be respected for all children within the state party’s juri\nsdiction, \n‘\nwithout discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child’s or his or her parent’s or legal\n \nguardian’s race, colour, sex, language, \nreligion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic\n \nor social origin, property, disability, birth or other status’.\n&#xa0;\n3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Convention also states that the best interests\n of the child must be a primary \nconsideration (Article 3)\n and that States Parties must affor\nd children the right to express \ntheir views in all matters affecting them – including in judicial an\nd administrative \nproceedings (Article 12).\n&#xa0;\n4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRefugee, asylum-seeking and migrant children may often be\n particularly vulne\nrable and in \nneed of specific protection and assistance. This is es\npecially the case when they are \nseparated and without their families. In recognition of this, the UN Committee on the\n \nRights of the Child’s \nGeneral Comment No. 6 on Treatment of Unaccompani\ned and\n \nSeparated Children Outside their Country of Origin \n(2005)\n states that where children are \ninvolved in administrative or judicial proceedings the\ny should be provided with legal \nrepresentation.\n&#xa0;\n5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe need for legal representation for children has also\n \nbeen emphasised by the Council \nof Europe. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Eur\nope guidelines on child\n-\nfriendly \njustice s\ntate that\n:\n3.7 Children should have the right to their own legal counsel and representation, intheir own name, in \nproceedings where there is, or could be, a conflict of interest\n \nbetween the child and the parents or other involved parties.\n3.8 Children should have access to free legal aid, under the same or more lenient\n \nconditions as adults.\n&#xa0;\n6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn the wake of already \nenormous cuts to civil legal aid brought about by the Legal Aid,\n \nSentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO),\n \nwhich in the experience of \nRCC members are having a significant detrimental impact on \nthis group\n of children\n and their ability to exe\nrcise their rights, the RCC is extremely concerned about the potential impact th\ne current proposals would have \non refugee and migrant children, young people and their families. In particular, the Consortium is concerned about the proposed introduction of a\n ‘residence test’ for civil legal aid and changes to\n legal aid for judicial review, which \nthreaten access to justice for thousands of children, young people and families. The RCC is concerned about the effects that the proposed residence test would have in\npreventing refugee and migrant children and families accessing legal aid in those areas of law where legal aid still exists currently after LASPO, such as public law, community care, special educational needs, homelessness and public, and certain private, \nlaw family proceedings.\n&#xa0;\n7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRCC members work with thousands of refugee and migrant children each year, both children who are sep\narated and children in families, and see the frequency with which these children’s rights are violated in practice. \nMembers of the \nconsortiu\nm have considerable expertise in\n supporting this group and offering a range of support, advice, advocacy and other services to them. RCC members try to resolve the issues faced by these children and families, preferring to find means of resolving \nproblems that do not involve litigation wherever possible. However, from our years of experience of working with this group we know that legal representation is crucial if these children are to be able to realise their rights and solve the problems they fa\nce. In many \nsituations legal representation is the only possible means of resolving the problem. Members of RCC who are not lawyers cannot lawfully provide advice on a child or family’s immigration issues (section 84, Immigration and Asylum Act 1999), nor \ndo RCC members who are not lawyers have the necessary expertise to do so. Similarly in other areas of law such as community care or public law, \nthe\n work that RCC members do relies on being able to refer to legal aid solicitors and we are extremely concerne\nd by the threat to legal aid provision, which in turn threatens our work, our ability to assist our clients, and could place a huge burden on scarce voluntary sector resources.\n&#xa0;\nLack of a child impact assessment&#xa0;8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe government appears to have undertaken \nno child impact assessment whatsoever in relation to these proposals\n, which risk effectively cutting children off from access to justice.\n \nThe government claims that the impact on children has been considered\n.\n \nHowever, this is not evident in the vari\nous do\ncuments,\n n\none of\n which mentions the \nbest interests of children.\n&#xa0;\n9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe government has an obligation, under the \nUNCRC\n to ‘undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the\n \nimplementation of\n \nthe rights\n’ contained in the \nConvention,\n \nand\n to ensure that, in all actions \nconcerning children, their best interests shall be a primary \nconsideration. This fundamental \nprinciple applies whether the actions are taken by ‘public or private\n social welfare \ninstitutions, courts of law, a\ndministrative autho\nrities or legislative bodies’.\n This extends to \nthe formation of government policy and legislation, and, a\nccording to the UN Committee on \nthe Rights of the Child, child impact assessments are key to \nfulfilling this obligation. The \nCommit\ntee stated, in its\n General Comment on ‘genera\nl\n \nmeasures of\n \nimplementation’\n \nthat:\nEnsuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning children (art. 3(1)), and that all the provisions of the Convention are \nrespected in legislation and policy development and delivery at all levels of government demands a continuous process of child impact assessment (predicting the impact of any proposed law, policy or budgetary allocation which affects children and the enjoy\nment of theirrights) and child impact evaluation (evaluating the actual\n \nim\npact of implementation). This process needs to \nbe built into government at all \nlevels and as early as possible\n in the development of policy.\n&#xa0;\n10.\n&#xa0; \nWe believe the impact assessment \nundertaken by the government in relation to these proposals is wholly inadequate. In relation to the residence test, the impact assessment\n states that non-British nationals will be at a particular disadvantaged compared with British nationals. It is the R\nCC’s view that this is discriminatory under domestic and international human rights legislation. Article 2 \nof the UNCRC makes clear that \nthat there should be no discrimination between children on the basis of their nationality, ethnicity, social status or \nother status, \nor the status of their parents, a provision\n reiterated in government guidance \nwhich states that ‘\ne\nvery child matters even if they are someone subject to immigration control\n’\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe residence test&#xa0;11.\n&#xa0; \nWhile the RCC \nwelcomes the concessions made in the government’s paper \nLegal Aid Transformation: Next step\ns published on 5th September 2013, which \nrespond\n to some of the concerns we raised in our response to the \nTransforming legal aid\n \nconsultation in June 2013,\n \nwe firmly believe that \nthese proposals are \nstill \ninconsistent with the government\n’s \ncommitments to protecting all children’s welfare, best interests and rights as set out under domestic and international legislation – regardless of their or their parents’ \nstatus or nationality. \n&#xa0;\n12.\n&#xa0; \nThe government appears to have been persuaded that some groups are vulnerable, but has only carved out very discrete areas in which they will still be eligible for civil legal aid, leaving in question their commitment to really pro\ntecting these groups and their access to justice.\n&#xa0;\n13.\n&#xa0; \nThe Refugee Children’s Consortium strongly opposes proposals for limiting legal aid through a requirement that an applicant for legal aid is ‘lawfully resident’ in the\n \nUK at the time of applying for civil \nlegal aid and a requirement that the applicant has resided lawfully in the UK for 12 months. We also disagree with the rational\ne\n behind the proposal, which is that it will ensure that only those with a ‘strong connection to the \nUK’ are able to benefit from\n the civil legal aid scheme. Many of the children with whom we work have a very strong connection to the UK. For some it is the only place they have ever lived, or the only one\n \nthat they can remember. \nFor example, there are an estimated 120,000 undocumente\nd migrant children in the UK, over half of which (65,000) were born in the UK to undocumented migrant parents\n and\n will fall foul of the residence test, as a\n child born in the UK does not automatically\n acquire British citizenship if\n their parent/s are not British. \nIn addition, many undocumented children are brought into the UK by a parent \nor guardian, or through a private fostering arrangement. Some come to the UK lawfully when they\n are very young with a parent or other relative and \ngrow up here, unwittingly staying beyond the period when their visas or leave were valid. \nIn some cases family relationships break down, leaving children abandoned and left to be taken into the care system.\n&#xa0;\n14.\n&#xa0; \nWhere unlawful decisions are made there will be \nchildren who have meritorious claims and who have a right in law to challenge the decision but who will effectively be without any remedy because they will be unable to access legal advice or representation to challenge these decisions because they cannot \npay for it and because legal aid will be denied to them. This will have a significant effect on refugee and migrant children and families, many of whom rely on legal support to ensure that they are able to access the support from local authorities to which\n they are entitled and to ensure that they are able to challenge unlawful decisions made about their cases – decisions which determine their futures.\n Examples of the groups affected include:\n&#xa0;\nDestitute children and families \n&#xa0;\n15.\n&#xa0; \nDestitute children who are con\nsidered to be\n in the UK unlawfully (because, \nfor example, their family’s asylum claim has been refus\ned, or they are the chil\ndren of \noverstayers) are already from 1 April 2013 no longe\nr able to get legal aid for any \nimmigration (non-asylum) application they\n might be able \nto make, including one based on \nthe right to respect for private and family life (under Artic\nle 8 of the European Convention \non Human Rights) and their best interests. The new propos\nals will take away their access \nto civil legal aid entirely\n. So for example, if a local authori\nty acts unlawfully and does not \ncomply with its duties to the children under section 17 of th\ne Children Act 1989, the family \nwill not be able to access legal aid for a community \ncare solicitor. Judicial review \nproceedings in these cases are a key safeguard in ensuring\n a local authority does not act \nin breach of the law by unlawfully refusing support and for\ncing a family into destitution, \nbut they will have no access to legal aid to bring proceedi\nngs and are, in \nour experience, \ncompletely unable to bring such proceedings unaided. \n&#xa0;\n16.\n&#xa0; \nAnother extremely vulnerable group that would be hit by\n the proposed residence test is \nseparated migrant children in local authority care. A significant number of c\nhildren with \nno regul\nar immigration status may end up in the care of a\n local authority, for example a \nchild who has long overstayed a visa through no fault o\nf their own and where a private \nfostering arrangement has broken down or they have been the subject of careproceedings a\nfter suffering abuse or neglect. Some of thes\ne children will not be claiming \nasylum so will not fall into the asylum-seeker excepti\non. If the local authority acts \nunlawfully and does not comply with its duties to the child (for exampl\ne, placing the child \ni\nn unsuitable accommodation or undertaking an unla\nwful age assessment), the child \nwould have no legal aid for a community care solicitor to\n challenge this treatment which \nbreaches their rights. Also, the recent cuts to legal aid f\nor immigration claims mean \nthat \nunaccompanied children as well as care leavers rely on the local authority’\ns duties \ntowards them including a duty to pay for immigration legal services privately whe\nre this is \nin their best interests. \n&#xa0;\n17.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhere has already been a \nsignificant cost shift \n(and overall cost increase to the government) as a result of looked after children being cut off from immigration legal aid under LASPO\n 2012.\n \nIn the view of \nthe Consortium, the government should urgently consider th\ne potential financial burden it \nrisks put\nting onto local authorities if a residen\nce test were implemented. Local \nauthorities, owing duties to looked after children, woul\nd have to pay for private legal \nservices. Furthermore, if a local authority refuses to pay for \nlegal aid in a particular case, \nl\negal aid will not be available to enforce this obligation.\n The No Recourse to Public Funds Network has estimateda cost burden of £26 million on \nlocal authorities resulting from these proposals, due to the\nincreased homelessness and their duties to vulnerabl\ne children.\n&#xa0;\nChildren affected by detention \n&#xa0;\n18.\n&#xa0; \nThe Ministry of Justice’s response to the Transforming Legal Aid Consultation states: \n‘We have also concluded that there are further limited circumstances where applicants for civil legal aid on certain \nmatters of law (as set out in Schedule 1 to LASPO) would not be required to meet the residence test. The test will not apply to the following categories of case (which broadly relate to an individual’s liberty.....’\n \n&#xa0;\n19.\n&#xa0; \nDespite this concession, the Governme\nnt still proposes that the residence test will apply to \nchallenges to the legality of detention which\n are brought\n in civil claims\n by immigration detainees after their release. \nRCC members have dealt with many cases where children and parents have been deta\nined unlawfully. Civil claims are a crucial means to offering these individuals redress, and ensuring that the Home Office cannot detain children and parents unlawfully with impunity. \n&#xa0;\n20.\n&#xa0; \nIn 2010, a time limit of one week was introduced on the detention of \nfamilies with children. Prior to this, RCC members referred very many families to solicitors who made civil claims challenging the legality of their detention. In one case a family was awarded £150,000.\n  Such cases were vital in holding the Home Office to account and precipitated very significant improvements in the treatment of this vulnerable group.   \n&#xa0;\n21.\n&#xa0; \nThe RCC is aware of two cases where the High Court has found that single mothers have been unlawfull\ny detained and separated from their children.\n Despite the unlawful practices highlighted by the High Court in those cases, many of the flaws which were revealed continued to be features of the cases set out in Bail for Immigration Detainee’s 2013 report ‘\nFractured Childhoods: the separation of families by immigration detention\n’. The RCC is aware of several recent cases where legal proceedings in civil claims to challenge the legality of parent’s detention were commenced but the Home Office paid thousands o\nf pounds in compensation prior to the case reaching trial. In one case which settled in early 2013 the parent and child were given £68,500 in compensation.\n \n&#xa0;\nCase study: Beth and Daniel &#xa0;Beth’s grandfather, who was caring for her and her disabled brother\n Daniel during their mother’s detention, became seriously ill and was admitted to hospital three times. Beth had to stop attending school to care for her brother and grandfather and missed her GCSE exams. \n&#xa0;\nBeth found it extremely difficult to look after h\ner seven year old brother, was has limited motor control and severe behavioral problems. Children’s Services deemed Daniel to be at risk of emotional and physical harm, and found that: ‘Daniel has found it very difficult being separated from his mother…  [\nA] concerned neighbour rang to report that Daniel was playing alone in the road at 8pm... he walks into people’s houses.’  \n&#xa0;\nTwo months into his mother’s detention Daniel was hit by a car.  \nDespite receiving reports about the welfare of these children, the\n Home Office detained their mother for 160 days before she was released on bail by the Tribunal. The Home Office subsequently awarded the family \ntens of \nthousands of pounds in compensation for the mother’s detention. \nUnder the proposed residence test, this mother would not have been able to access Legal Aid for her civil claim challenging the legality of her detention. &#xa0;&#xa0;\nCare leavers \n&#xa0;\n22.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposals would also have a \nsignificant impact on \ncare leavers, including\n young \npeople\n who came to the UK as unaccompanied ch\nild\nren\n, who claimed asylum but \nwere\n \nrefused and became appeal rights exhausted. After turning 18 they woul\nd not be able to \nget legal aid in order to challenge the local authority if t\nhey unlawfully withdrew support \nan\nd made them destitute, an issue faced by many of\n the young people with whom RCC \nmembers work.\n&#xa0;\nChildren whose ages are disputed \n&#xa0;\n23.\n&#xa0; \nA further group of cases of concern to RCC mem\nbers are children whose age is \ndisputed. Many children in the immigration syste\nm ha\nve their ages disputed and some \nare treated as adults, which can lead to their being held in\n immigration detention or being \ndenied support.\n \nThe correct assessment of an applicant who is under 18 years of age is necessary to ensure that the government \nupholds its domestic and international obligations to those who are children. Where an applicant disagrees with the assessment made by a local authority, a judicial review of the decision, and the court's determination of age binds both parties. \n&#xa0;\n24.\n&#xa0; \nThese \nchildren would only be able to get\n legal aid for a community care \nsolicitor to challenge an unlawful age assessment if th\ney have an ongoing asylum claim \nat the time the application for legal aid is made. For so\nme, claiming asylum will not be \nthe appropriat\ne course for their immigration case. For o\nthers, the age dispute may only \narise once they no longer fall within the asylum-seeker\n exception, either because they \nhave been recognised as a refugee, or granted anoth\ner form of leave to remain, and \nthen have to\n wait \nto accrue the necessary\n 12 months\n residence\n (this issue\n is explore below at paragraph 29\n)\n, or because they have\n been refused and have become a \nfailed asylum-seeker (the process of assessing age wi\nthin a local authority can take \nmany months). RCC memb\ners work with many chi\nldren whose ages are unlawfully \nassessed\n, including children who are detained in adult institutions as a result,\n and is extremely concerned that the prop\nosals risk taking away the only \neffective remedy from those who do not meet the r\nequire\nments of the residence test (we \nare also concerned about the effects of the proposals on judicial review more generally –\n \nplease see below).\n&#xa0;\nSuspected victims of trafficking\n25.\n&#xa0; \nWhilst the government has conceded that victims of trafficking should not be subjected to the residence test, \nthis is limited to those for whom\n \nthere has been a conclusive decision that the individual is a victim of trafficking or has been identified under\n the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) as having ‘reasonable grounds’ that they are victims of trafficking.\n This means that prior to an NRM referral and while awaiting the ‘reasonable grounds’ decision, a child victim of trafficking is not able to get leg\nally-aided advice or support from a solicitor unless the case also involves an asylum claim. \n&#xa0;\n26.\n&#xa0; \nRCC members and others have elsewhere expressed serious concerns about the National Referral Mechanism\n and \no\nver 65% of victims of trafficking are not referred t\no the NRM\n,\n in part due to \na lack of awareness among frontline professionals of the existence of the NRM\n. When a referral is made\n, RCC members’\n recent research \nhas shown \nthat many children receive a negative decision\n because the exploitation element is difficult to prove despite there being evidence for illegal entry via an agent or trafficker\n.\n \nThe assistance of a legal representative with\n compiling evidence and making representations to support their account of traf\nfi\ncking when referred to the NRM l\nowers the risk of a negative NRM decision. \n&#xa0;\n27.\n&#xa0; \nFurthermore, this concession would only mean that a victim of trafficking was able to obtain legal aid for an immigration applications, employment law case and civil damages cla\nim.\n The exemption therefore leaves very significant gaps in the civil legal aid that trafficking victims can access. They will not have access to civil legal aid in public law, leaving them unable to bring a judicial review. This is striking because the o\nnly way to challenge a negative reasonable or conclusive grounds decision is by judicial review. \n&#xa0;\n28.\n&#xa0; \nThey will also not be able to access legal aid in community care, for example if a child or young person is unlawfully denied services by a local authority o\nr unlawfully age disputed. This means that trafficked children will be in a powerless position where they are unable to challenge an incorrect age assessment and will therefore not be recognised as a child. This means they could remain homeless or be accom\nmodated inappropriately, supported insufficiently, and be placed at risk of harm, detention and \nforced removal\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nCase study: JoyJoy was trafficked into England from Nigeria when she was five-years-old, and kept \nin domestic servitude\n for 10 years. She did\n not \nknow her birth family, never went to school, was\n not \nregistered with a GP and was given limited access to the outside world.\nAt the age of 16, Joy escaped and presented \nto\n children’s services\n for support\n. However, the local authority disputed her age,\n as she did not have any documents to prove her date of birth, and assessed her to be over 18. The local authority took no steps to refer Joy’s case to the National Referral Mechanism, despite the clear indicators of trafficking. \nJoy's case was taken on b\ny a solicitor who challenged both the age assessment and local authority’s failure to make a referral to the NRM. Her case was heard in the High Court which held that she had been 16 at the time of the age assessment. So, aged 18, she was given a firm fina\nncial footing with local authority funding, to help her find housing and study childcare at college.\n \nUnder the proposed residence test, Joy would not have been able to access Legal Aid for the judicial review of her age assessment and to challenge the local authority’s refusal to support her. Despite being a victim of trafficking she would not have been covered by the government’s concession outlined above. &#xa0;\nAsylum seekers and \nthose with \nrefugee status\n29.\n&#xa0; \nThe RCC\n welcome\ns\n changes made to the government’s original proposals which mean the period of lawful residence will start from the date an asylum claim is submitted rather than the date it is accepted. However, we believe this approach to be counter-intuitive since childr\nen and young people with an overwhelming strong case for recognition as a refugee who are \ngranted refugee status\n almost immediately would \nstill \nbe ineligible for legal aid for almost a year \nsubsequent to\n being recognised as a refugee\n.\n The average processin\ng time for an initial asylum decision for a child in 2012-2013 was 127 days (or approximately 4 months)\n.\n Furthermore, it is no\nt clear whether this concession\n would apply to unaccompanied children who are refused asylum but granted discretionary or limited\n leave to remain (56% of unaccompanied children who claimed asylum in 2012 were granted discretionary leave).  \nJudicial review&#xa0;30.\n&#xa0; \nJudicial review represents the practical application of the rule of law and someone who has suffered an unlawful act or omissio\nn by a public authority can bring a challenge by judicial review where there is no other remedy. As outlined above, JR is, for example, the only way to challenge an unlawful age assessment or an adverse decision on whether someone is a victim of traffickin\ng. \nJudicial review is also a vital safeguard against the Home Office unlawfully removing children and parents from the UK\n, and maltreating children who are in immigration detention\n. \nThe Government’s proposal that legal aid providers not be paid for work on\n judicial review cases unless permission is ultimately granted by the High Court would transfer all the financial risk of an application for judicial review to the legal aid provider, so that all the work they do on a JR is at risk. This will make provider\ns far less willing to bring JRs and RCC members who are not lawyers are concerned that we will simply find no lawyers willing to take on the cases that we wish to refer to them because they cannot bear the financial risk. This will leave children with no w\nay to challenges unlawful treatment and undermine our efforts as voluntary sector organisations to support them.\n31.\n&#xa0; \nJudicial review is a vital safeguard against public authorities acting unlawfully or where it is necessary to clarify the law. The impact assessment clearly identifies that there is a risk that providers may refuse to take on judicial review cases because \nthe financial risk of the permission application may rest with them. We do not agree that these are cases that \nwould not be considered by the court in any case. In fact we often find that cases settle before the permission stage in the child or family’s fa\nvour because the threat of legal action is sufficient for the authority or Home Office to change their unlawful practice. Without this vital safeguard, children and families will be unable to challenge unlawful decisions and actions by government. \n&#xa0;\n32.\n&#xa0; \nSuch \nwas the level of concern about this proposal that a further consulta\ntion was launched in September alongside the proposal that \nwhere a case has been issued \n(but not otherwise),\n and settles without permission having been granted, the Legal Aid Agency may n\nevertheless pay the lawyers provided there is a good reason why the defendant has not been ordered to pay. This is however unlikely to address the central problem as public bodies faced with judicial reviews do not back down in the period between the issue\n of proceedings and the grant of permission. They tend to wait to see what the judge will do. Rather, public bodies tend to back down just before a case is issued and often whilst the substantial work preparing the case for issue is underway. All this work\n is vital and can be extremely time-consuming. Making it unfunded will seriously undermine the ability of individuals to hold the state to account.\n&#xa0;Alternatives to legal aid&#xa0;33.\n&#xa0; \nThe Ministry of Justice’s Impact Assessment assumes that \n‘individuals who no lon\nger receive legal aid will now adopt a range of approaches to resolve issues. They may choose to represent themselves in court, seek to resolve issues by themselves, pay for services which support self-resolution, pay for private representation or decide n\not to tackle the issue at all.’\n \nThe RCC believes that the children, young people and families it\n \nworks with are unable to adopt alternative approaches that will resolve the issues they\n \nface. In the RCC’s view, the clients we work with will simply be \nunable to bring their cases\n \nwithout legal aid, especially children. Nor should they be expected to do so. It is\n \ncompletely unreasonable to expect children to navigate complex legal issues without\n \nprofessional advice and representation and leaving children \nwithout legal representation\n \nis incompatible with the government’s obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights\n \nof the Child. For children in care, the changes will simply result in significant costs to local\n \nauthorities (forced to pay for private leg\nal services for looked after children, and\n \npotentially also care leavers and families supported under the Children Act 1989) and\n \nsignificant costs to the court system, as judges are forced to deal with thousands of ill-prepared\n \nlitigants in person.\n&#xa0;\n34.\n&#xa0; \nIt is \nalso clear that most children and families who have previously been able to apply for legal aid, many of whom will be dealing with legal issues around support and accommodation, will be unable to pay for private representation, and may be left at risk of a\nbuse and exploitation, including sexual abuse and exploitation, as they seek alternative means of funding legal services.\n&#xa0;\n35.\n&#xa0; \nIt cannot be assumed that alternative sources of advice exist or will continue to exist, as the legal services landscape is changing \nso dramatically due to government decisions. Many law centres and other not-for-profit organisations have already suffered significant cuts under LASPO, and it is not realistic to expect voluntary sector advice agencies or pro bono solicitors to offer alte\nrnative source of advice on many issues. The government’s changes threaten the very existence of legal providers, and undermine any sense of clarity about the future operating environment, so it is not at all clear who would be left to do any pro bono work\n. In any case, pro bono work is by its nature limited in terms of the amount of advice that can be offered and advice providers will not have capacity to meet clients’ needs, either in terms of the potential volume of people seeking help, or the specialist\n knowledge required for more complex cases.\n&#xa0;\n36.\n&#xa0; \nAs stated at paragraph \n7\n above, many RCC membe\nrs provide advocacy services to \nyoung refugees and migrants, and while they can liaise with local authorities and others to try to ensure that appropriate support an\nd protection is provided, without recourse to \nlegal action it is often impossible to force the relevant individual or agency to take action. A clear example of this is the high numbers of judicial reviews of unlawful local authority age assessments, where \nit is not until a letter before action has been sent that the local authority will agree to treat the child as the age they claim to be. A significant number of these cases have to go to full hearing, and in many situations interim support will only be pro\nvided as a result of a court order.\n&#xa0;\n37.\n&#xa0; \nThe government has outlined that the proposed residence test would not result in contravention of our domestic and international legal obligations because ‘we would ensure that legal aid will continue to be available \nwhere necessary to comply with our obligations under EU or international law set out in Schedule 1 to LASPO.’\n This is based on the supposed availability of exceptional funding as a safeguard for those excluded from legal aid by the residence test. However\n, it is the RCC’s belief that the exceptional funding system is not an adequate safeguard. To our knowledge, only nine grants of exceptional funding have been made since 1 April 2013 and it is inappropriate for children’s access to justice to be provided b\ny way of an ‘exception’\n&#xa0;\n38.\n&#xa0; \nWhile the cost savings of restricting legal aid via a residence test are wholly unknown to the government, as stated in Impact Assessment MoJ194, the impact on children and those voluntary and statutory sector organisations support\ning them (including local authorities) will be hugely significant.\n&#xa0;\nConclusion&#xa0;39.\n&#xa0; \nThe proposed changes would result in a vast inequality of arms between the state and the individual subject to its power, an inequality that is all the more marked for children\n and young people, whose particular capabilities and vulnerabilities create distinct obstacles to their ability to seek redress and access justice. This is true of all children, due to their inherent vulnerability, lack of experience and enhanced advice ne\neds,\n but it is particularly true of separated children and young people who are without their families and face complex administrative and legal proceedings alone, often in a language which is not their mother tongue and in a system which is utterly bewil\ndering to them. As is widely recognised, there are significant obstacles to these children being able to recognise legal problems, seek appropriate, quality legal advice and representation, and understand and navigate complex administrative and legal proce\nsses.\n \n&#xa0;\n40.\n&#xa0; \nChildren need legal representation if their rights are to be realised. The view of the RCC is that the proposed residence test is unlawful, breaching children’s rights as outlined above. Children who are not ‘lawfully resident’ or who have not resided lawf\nully in the UK for 12 months should not face discrimination and to deny them access to legal remedy is in breach of their rights. Any reforms to the civil legal aid system must take full account of their potential impact on all children, on children’s acce\nss to justice and an effective remedy, and on a child’s opportunity to be heard in administrative and judicial proceedings affecting them (Article 12, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child). \n&#xa0;The RCC recommends that:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nMembers of the Refugee Children's Consortium are: \n&#xa0;\nAction for Children, Asphaleia Action, Asylum Aid, Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees (AVID), Bail for Immigration Detainees, The British Association of Social Workers (BASW), Brighter Futures, British Association for Adoption and Fostering (\nBAAF), Catch22 National Care Advisory Service, Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB), Coram Children's Legal Centre, Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), Children's Rights Alliance for England, The Children's Society, DOST, ECPAT UK, Family Rights Grou\np, The Fostering Network, Family Service Units (FSU), Freedom from Torture, Gatwick Detainees, The Immigration Law Practitioners' Association (ILPA), Islington Law Centre, JCORE, Law Centres Network, Medical Justice, NCB, NSPCC, The Prince’s Trust, RAMFEL,\n Refugee Action, Refugee Council, Refugee Support Network, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Scottish Refugee Council, Student Action for Refugees (STAR), Voice, The Who Cares?
