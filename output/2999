defaultThank you for the opportunity to

default and submit evidence to this Inquiry. As a background we should add that we have written to the Secretary of State, Ministers and staff of the DfT on 29

default August and did forward a copy of our letter to th
defaulte
default

defaultommittee on 13

defaultHaving consulted with Stuart McIlvenny he has advised us it would be easier if we incorporated the main points of our 29

defaultWe have received a reply from Jessica Hunt of the DfT on 8
defaultth
default October which did not really answer our fundamental points (copy of response from DfT 
defaultprovided
default as Appendix 1
default)
default. The letter
default did not address the need for joined up policy, demonstrated the still very low level of maintenance funding for the 98% of the road network and the lack of recognition that road building wouldn’t solve congestion problems
default.
default It recognised that local authori
defaultties do generally understand better the local transport issues; however pronouncements by government on parking
default and traffic enforcement
default and control by the DfT 
defaultand DCLG 
defaultof minutiae seem to contradict this.

default The Local Government Technical Advisers Group 
default(
defaultTAG
default)
default represents a large number of local authorities in the country, these include those with highway and transport responsibilities; such as Transport for London, most London boroughs, Metropolitan authoritie
defaults, Unitary authorities
default, consultants providing highway and transport services for major local authorities and
default many of the districts an
defaultd towns in two tier authorities. 
defaultWhile these ‘second tier’ authorities do not have direct responsibility for transport, 
defaultthey do have a major role in looking after significant towns and the sensible overall planning of them including providing a reasonable environment and trying to ensure
default,
default through the Highways and Transport Authorities
default,
default that the transport system is fit for p
defaulturpose. 
defaultOverall we represent over 100 different authorities.
default Thus for any technical or professional group, we believe we are the most effective representative organisation likely to have a technical as well as public view on any policy issues
default (we are profe
defaultssional advisers to the LGA)
default.

defaultTAG does support and welcome the government’
defaults views that we need to provide good 
defaulttransport and communications
default for people and the economy and we need to 
defaultrepair and renew
default considerable parts of our infrastructure.  However we have grave reservations on some of the assertions included and indeed on the strategy, spending plans and possible future administrative structures.

defaultWe are particularly concerned that lack of clarity relating to the future of local highway authority roads will continue to increase the division between the 
default2% of the network under the management of the Highways Agency and the remaining 98% managed by Loc
defaultal Authorities 
defaultrather than delivering the necessary integration. 
defaultIt should be noted particularly that for all 
defaultpractical purposes all journeys by whatever mode begin and end on the 98% of the road network that is managed by LAs.
default It is the journeys made by t
defaulthe customer road users that are important to the economy no
defaultt just the roads classified as T
defaultrunk roads
default.

defaultWhile it may be a common perception that providing additional capacity would reduce congestion and help the economy there is little evidence to this 
defaulteffect. Furthermore for big cities it can often be the case that adding to the road network can make all travel worse.
default 
defaultWhile this may be difficult to understand there is a wealth of published information which supports this fact. 
default(We have provided

defaultWhere communications can be achieved electronically and physical transport can be avoided

default  
defaultand is likely to
default be a 
defaultsignificant and growing contributory factor in
default 
defaultthe arrest of actual traffic growth
default,
default as seen 
defaultin the last decade
default.
default.
default3.2

defaultAny person or freight 
defaultmovement 
defaultis dependent on 
defaultthe 
defaultuse of the nearly 9
default8
default% of the total road network that is Local Authority 
defaultcontrolled
default - by car, delivery vehicle,
default bus, 
defaultfoot or
default cycle
default,
default 
defaultat the beginning and end of each and every journey
default.  Al
defaultthough it has been stated that 
default 
defaultabout a third 
defaultof vehicle miles are on the Trunk Roads it i
defaults really the number of overall trips that are most important.  Furthermore it is certainly desirable that all Transport and Highway authorities encourage the minimisation of the travel distance needed to meet the needs of individuals or the economy as a wh
defaultole
default - 
defaultpacking Kent potatoes in Somerset, or driving 5 miles to an out of town supermarket for a
default convenience shop
default,
default 
defaultdoes not really help the economy
default – policies for transport should not encourage these all too real situations
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default              
defaultIt is notable that Local Au
defaultthorities have indeed managed to arrest traffic growth in many major urban areas and some smaller historic towns by effective transport and planning policies.  This has been very hard work 
defaultand sometimes expensive 
defaultwith the con
defaults
defaulttraints 
defaultof the 
default1985 
defaultTransport 
defaultAct outside London
default and
default often with
default less than full support by Central Government on 
defaultissues such as 
defaultmanagement of parking and enforcement of moving vehicle offences
default.
default Furthermore i
defaultncreased capacity particularly of 
defaultMotorway

defaultes
default extra car commuting traffic 
defaultwhich again
default contribute
defaults
default to Local Authorities difficulties in managing their networks effectively
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultIt is however welcomed that DfT circular 02/2013 
default(
defaultThe Strategic Road Network and the delivery of Sustainable Transport
default)
default does suggest that trip generation should be minimised at source and sustainable modes of transport should be maximised and journey lengths minimised.  (
defaultpara 12). 
default 
defaultI
defaultt would be highly desirable if such an objective was carried through in government planning
default guidance for all developments and for the management and development of the Trunk Road network itself.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultIn both the ‘Investing in Britain
default’
defaults Future’ and 
default‘
defaultAction for Roads’ document the impression is given that a road
default 
defaultbuilding strategy will reduce congestion in the future but it appears 
defaulteven 
defaultfrom the Traffic Forecasts by the DfT that this is far from the truth
default and indeed the traffic congestion is predicted to get worse even with such major expenditure on the Trunk Road 
defaultNetwork. This calls into question the need for alternative strategies and spending plans 
defaultto deliver a different outcome nationally. 
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default              
defaultThe conclusions of the Eddington review into Transport 
defaultwere that 
defaultthe major problems 
defaultwere 
defaultin 
defaultu
defaultrban areas rather than 
defaultinterurban and the
defaultre was an urgent
default need for policies to reduce 
defaulttraffic
default volumes.
default The statement in the Forward by the Chancellor and Chief Secretary
default -
default “
defaultIt’s been the result of a collective national mindset that has privileged the
default 
defaultshort term over the long ter
defaultm, and has postponed difficult decisions
default” could not be 
defaultmore 
defaulttrue
default especially
default if such a roads expansion policy rather than managing our total traffic is followed
default.
default (We should add that from the tenor of the statements made by Government that they
default mistakenly
default th
defaultink that a road enlargement policy is what is needed
default rather than managing our total traffic).
default 
defaultIt is 
defaultalso 
defaultparticularly notable that t
defaulthe map of the most serious congestion even on HA roads 
default(page 15 of Action for Roads) 
defaultclearly shows the worst congestion clos
defaulte to the largest urban areas.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default              
defaultFunding and consequentially the management of local highway authority roads and transport services continue to remain uncertain, raising the concern of an increasing division between the strategic road network and the 
defaultcommunities they purport to serve. Levels of capital funding are indicated to increase
default for local highway authority roads
default, despite questions relating to the overall affordability, but 
defaultcertainty of funding with the corresponding benefit of establishing a pip
defaulteline are receding, at least for the foreseeable future. 
default&#xa0;
default3.8
default              
defaultCapital funding is increasingly being provided as 
defaulteither 
defaultrelatively small one-off grants following competition or indirectly through organisation
defaults
default without responsibility for the network. 
defaultHoweve
defaultr, the greatest concern relates to revenue funding which continues to reduce; revenue reductions are directly impacting on the ability of authorities to manage transport in their areas with the consequential and inevitable outcome that congestion will incr
defaultease and 
defaultultimately 
defaultsafety decline. The revenue reductions are impacting on all aspects of transport infrastructure; bus services are being reduced, support for sustainable travel is being removed and road safety initiatives cut back. 
default&#xa0;
default3.9
default              
defaultThe fixation on
default pot holes is in some respects welcome in that it is focussing attention in the deterioration of the fabric of the network but 
defaultcan 
defaultdetract from the argument relating to other essential aspects such as traffic signal maintenance, drainage 
defaultand road markings,
default all of 
defaultwhich 
defaultcombine to deliver an effective, efficient and safe network. Bland statements regarding the
defaultse
default issues being the responsibility of local authorities to determine priorities within their budgets are at best unhelpful and ignore the root causes o
defaultf the problem.
default&#xa0;
default3.10
default              
defaultA somewhat separate but w
defaultorryingly 
defaultaspect of recent cuts in government funding has been the severity of the loss of skills from the sector. This reduction is greater and m
defaultore sever
defaulte
default than those of the 198
default0’s. The potential pipeline for major strategic road network could offer a glimmer of hope in terms of skills development and retention for the future, but only impacts on one area of the sector leaving other key areas with potentially greater uncertainty 
defaultincluding transport planning, 
defaultroad safety, sustainable transport and highway maintenance. A clearer 
defaultand more balanced 
defaultview for the longer term investment in the
default whole
default local transport network is required. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default4.1
default              
defaultWe welcome unreservedly the 
defaultlong overdue extra expenditure for maintenance. We would however again stress that to improve the quality of road journeys for freight
default,
default cars
default,
default pedestrians and cyclists
default,
default the condition of u
defaultrban roads and indeed rural non trunk roads need a vast improvement
default. 
defaultWe
default would be concerned if funding is skewed to the 
default2
default% of the road network rather than the 9
default8
default%
default. 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultWe note on page 5 of Investing in Britain
default’
defaults Future
default,
default it is stated that “T
defaulthe Government has consistently prioritised capital investment over day-to-day spendi
defaultng
default” 
defaultand consequentially the primary benefit of the additional funding will be to 
defaultoffset
default reductions in revenue budgets. 
defaultHowever, this will not address the longer-term deterioration in the overall transport network, maintenance of key assets including 
defaulttraffic signals, drainage and road markings is being required to be reduced.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultWe are concerned 
defaultregarding
default any further reduction of public and democratic control of many of our busiest interurban and urban fringe roads by making t
defaulthe Highways Agency a more arms length organisation.  The Trunk roads must be considered as part of th
defaulte overall road 
defaultnetwork and indeed part of the wider Transport Network.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
defaultAccountability of the HA in the new model raises concerns, it is a long held view that the HA and indeed DfT should be more directly accountable to the communities they effect by their decisions. However, there is a danger under new models whereby the HA c
defaultould have greater freedoms and flexibility
default that 
defaultit becomes more remote from the wider public, not 
defaultjust road users.
default 
defaultG
defaultreater clarity
default might 
defaultonly be provided in terms of financial accountability.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultThe ability of the HA to invest outside the strategic road
default network is 
defaultwelcome
defaultd
default allowing a degree of integration but is a poor substitute for the provision of adequate funding to the local authorities to address problems in their areas. Th
defaulte framework for the HA 
defaultmust therefore include
default the ability 
defaultand encouragement 
defaultto invest in public 
defaultt
defaultransport
default, pedestrian and cycle  i
defaultmprovements, 
defaultlocal access provision close to HA roads, 
defaultSmarter Travel/ Travel Planning
default initiatives
default, Park and Ride etc
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default              
defaultA performance specification is all very well in princip
defaultle
default but one thing we have learned is that in times of significant change
default,
default outcomes become more difficult to predict, particularly in the longer-term. If say journey time reliability
default 
defaultis
default used as a 
defaultkey 
defaultperformance measure for the Trunk Roads
default,
default 
defaultit can be improved 
defaultby 
defaultdiverting traffic onto 
defaultthe local highway network, providing a perverse outcome.
default  
defaultSuch an outcome 
defaultmay 
defaultbe acceptable to the users of the 
default2% of the 
defaultnetwork but would be highly unpopular with local communities who would potentially be left with no direct re
defaultcourse to the HA and local authorities powerless to intervene.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default              
defaultRegarding the identified management models each would seem to have potential drawbacks. The formal contractual model appears fraught with difficulties associated with performance increasin
defaultg in complexity with duration of the contract.  The regulated utility model appears least appropriate given their performance and lack of alignment with broader national economic requirements
default;
default 
defaultfor example reduced energy prices with more modest profit margi
defaultns would be in the public 
defaultinterest. The trust model addresses an issue of concern relating to the balance of service provision and profit but leaves the question 
defaultof 
defaultperformance unanswered and previous statements appear to have ruled out the transfer of the
default assets.
default&#xa0;
default5.6
default              
defaultFreeing the H
defaultA from the constraints of short
default–term funding and restrictive employment processes is welcomed but the
defaultse
default issues are also faced by Local 
defaultA
defaultuthorities 
defaultmanaging
default the rest of the network.  Furthermore a
defaultt
default this stage there appears to be 
defaultno clarity regarding how funding for 
defaultthe 
defaultnew model will be resourced.  
defaultI
defaultt is t
defaulto be hoped that new HA company w
defaultould
default not run up large deficits, off book for government, as Network Rail has, as this really represents hidden public debt.
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default              
defaultT
defaulthe benefits of l
defaultonger-term financial planning and certainty for the HA are welcomed and should secure greater commitment to workforce training in apprenticeships and also importantly higher technical skills.  However, a critical shortage of skilled staff is inevitable giv
defaulten the rapid shrinkage we 
defaulthave suffered and without such commitments
default 
defaultwill not be remedied, although given the uncertainties in the wider public sector funding, skill shortages are likely to remain in the long-term.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;defaultHow will the policies set out in the Government’s “Action for Roads” command paper improve the strategic road network for all road users, whilst also improving the environment?default6.1
default              
defaultThe proposals identified in Action for Roads 
defaultc
defaultould
default deliver greater and longer-term certainty in terms of the performance and delivery of improvements 
defaulton 2% of 
defaultthe road network
default 
default(
defaultif 
defaultdelivery of (capacity) improvements are really 
defaultrequired
default)
default.
default However the presumption that congestion can be tackled by increased capacity and demand for growth satisfied is
default not backed by evidence
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default              
defaultThere is evidence that a number of local authorities 
defaulthave been 
defaultsuccessfully managing congestion with growth in the
defaultir local economies and without the need for increases in overall road capacity. The key principle adopted being that of the integration of policy and investment programs across modes with a specific objective of sustainable growth. Greater emphasis is requ
defaultired regarding the coordination of investment and in particularly in terms of the working with local authorities to ensure that the economic growth is sustainable.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default              
defaultT
defaulthe lack of clarity regarding the direction of funding for local transport raises sign
defaultificant concern whether sustainable growth can be achieved. Funding is being reduced both in terms of capital expenditure
default (
defaultlocal authority 
defaultcapital 
defaulttransport spend has reduced by almost 25% in the last two years
default)
default and also in terms of revenue spend including
default reductions in funding for maintenance and operation of public transport
default (
defaultconcessionary bus fare funding for some authorities alone is facing a potential reduction of 35%
default)
default. Government needs to “join up” its thinking regarding transport and cannot blindly a
defaultssume that increased investment in the Strategic Road Network alone will result in better transport outcomes.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultThe barrier posed by the trunk road network to cyclists and walkers, particularly on the edges of urban areas is understated and the vague assumption that the movements can be accommodated on local networks an overstated simplification. In many instances k
defaultey links between communities have been severed and significant investment is required if these barriers to efficient and sustainable movement are to be removed. A clearer commitment to supporting such improvements to provide key links which may well be on 
defaultlocal networks, is required. 
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default              
defaultInvestment in new technology and support for alternative fuels is welcome, however without better integration of policy and investment across modes and networks there is a danger that 
defaulteven 
defaultthe environmental cost
default,
default of 
defaulttryin
defaultg to 
defaultachiev
defaulte
default growth
default by trunk road enlargement
default will be significant.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow does the Government’s policy for roads link with planning for other transport modes?default6.6
default              
defaultIn part this is covered in the response
default and section 3
default above and there is great concern that the outcomes may not be desirable particularly in terms of both commuter and longer distance journeys. 
default&#xa0;
default6.7
default              
defaultOne potential outcome, is that additional capacity provided in the strategic road network will result in the
default transfer of trips from public transport
default and longer journeys for goods and people
default. If this is to be avoided coordination in terms of policy development and delivery need to be integrated.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow reliable is the Government’s forecast for growth in demand for defaultthe strategic road network? How should the Government deal with uncertainty in its forecast?default&#xa0;default6.8
default              
defaultForecasts provide potential indications of outcomes; the fundamental assumption that high growth in the economy must result in higher levels of traffic needs 
defaultto be challenged and highest traffic levels should be considered a failure of transport policy rather than successful economic policy.
default It is notable that even in London the DfT is predicting traffic increases however 
defaultLondon has grown substantially in popul
defaultation terms and economic performance over the last 20 years without 
defaultroad 
defaulttraffic increases.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow can we improve the reliability and efficiency of travel on the strategic road network? What impact will new technology have?default6.9
default              
defaultReducing the total amount of (
defaultparticularly car) traffic on the network by  p
defaultromoting public transport and other more sustainable modes of transport
default, support local planning authorities to ensure that all new development is located and designed for sustainable transport, provide 
defaultbetter a
defaultnd timely information to enable users to make choices regarding modes and times of journeys.
default Support companies and individuals in sustainable travel options.  Invest in electronic communications to avoid the need for some travel.
default&#xa0;
default6.10
default              
defaultWhile the
defaultre
default 
defaultmay be s
defaultcope in the future to increase the capacity of the 
defaultstrategic road
default network by electronic measures 
defaultthese will not be available in the 
defaultforeseeable
default future for most of the 98% of the network
default so unlikely to be effective for improvement of reliability of journeys 
defaulte
defaultven if such measures did not increase traffic levels.
default&#xa0;
default6.11
default              
defaultVariable speed limits more electronic enforcement and better identification and more reliable information to drivers and t
defaultraffic control managers could help reduce incidents and accidents causing congestion.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhat mechanisms are there for Government to increase investment in strategic roads and attract new investors? Are there good examples from other countries that could be defaultapplied in the UK? default6.12
default              
defaultWe have previously given verbal evidence in answer to a question by the Committee that we considered that generally there was an adequate strategic road network in the country nevertheless its management, integration with national 
defaultand local transport strategies and maintenance could be improved.
default&#xa0;
default6.13
default              
defaultTo attract investment there must be a revenue stream available. TAG are on record as supporting congestion charging/ road user charging as is done in many countries throughout the worl
defaultd
default to fund maintenance of the strategic road network.  We do not believe that such charging should be for isolated links but managed as part of an overall transport strategy.  We also recognise the political difficulties in the introduction of charging regi
defaultmes, nevertheless they are generally supported by industry to reduce congestion and help the economy.
default&#xa0;
defaultHow should the Highways Agency be reformed to make it “the world’s leading highway operator”? What roles should Government and the private sector play todefault ensure better management of the strategic road network?default6.14
default              
defaultThe first step in improving the Highways Agency is to ensure
default that it does not exist in isolation and needs to be based on a sound integrated transport policy and treat as a whole network involvi
defaultng LAs
default.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultWe hope that this evidence will be useful to the Committee. We would be pleased to elaborate, provide any supporting evidence by additional documentation and verbally in front of the Committee.

defaultDear Martin Sachs,
default&#xa0;
defaultAction for Roads default&#xa0;defaultThank you for your response to the ‘Action for Roads’ command paper, we take on board your concerns about the lack of clarity relating to the future of local highway 
defaultauthority roads. 
defaultThis paper focuses on the strategic road network as funding for local roads is now devolved to l
defaultocal authorities, who know their own network better than any national body or outside observer, and they remain the people best placed to manage their assets.
defaultT
defaulthe Government is committed to ensuring that 
defaultUK
default transport infrastructure supports economic growth, and this of course depends on effective interfaces between networks. It is therefore important to ensure that the network which the government controls operat
defaultes as effectively as possible and why we will be implementing reforms to drive efficiency and transform its current operation. 
defaultOur forecasts indicate that traffic levels on strategic roads will be 24% higher in 2040 than they are today, in our central cas
defaulte traffic will rise by 46% above today’s levels. This why the investment announced at the Spending Round is absolutely essential to ensure our national network, which has been all too susceptible to underinvestment, is fit for the 21
defaultst
default century, will suppor
defaultt economic growth, and allow the UK to keep pace with our international competitors. 
defaultReforming the Highways Agency into a publicly owned company, with an investment strategy, and road user watchdog, represents a clear break from the short-term thinking and stop-start culture that has affected the management of the network to date. The Gove
defaultrnment’s proposed reforms will put in place the structures, commitments and relationships to support a more ambitious infrastructure programme, and allow the strategic road network to operate more like the best-performing infrastructure providers in other 
defaultsectors. 
defaultThis will have knock on benefits for suppliers. Credible independence will allow confidence in road investment plans, enabling suppliers to procure materials at lower costs through longer contracts and invest more in recruitment and staff training
default.
defaultWe are conscious of the importance of embedding strong safeguards within the new organisation to ensure that the strategic highways company continues to deliver its obligations. We will shortly be publishing a consultation providing further detail of our
default plans to reform the Highways Agency
defaultWe are also clear to put in place measures and a framework to ensure that the network operates effectively as part of a wider transport system. In May 2012 we set out a new way to plan the management and enhancement of 
defaultour road network to take account of local needs and interests, via route based strategies (RBS). This process has been designed to bring together different interested groups – local authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships, motorists’ organisations, envi
defaultronmental groups and others – to discuss the future of a section of the strategic road network. 
defaultIn the next two years RBS’ will cover all of the network and will heavily influence the development of the Road Investment Strategy, building an investment fra
defaultmework that recognises that in some cases the best way to address capacity issues on the SRN will be to do something off it – for example
default the funding the Manchester Airport Eastern Link Road (MAELR) to allow local traffic to stay off a nearby stretch of th
defaulte M60.
default  This will also enable the strategic highways company to target investment in the network that will benefit of the surrounding areas, as was the case in connecting the A453 to park and ride facilities at the Nottingham Express Transit to reduce traf
defaultfic in town centres. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs you note in your letter, the government is committed to investing in maintenance for both local and national roads. In the Spending Round in June 
defaultearlier this year, the government committed £12 billion for road maintenance to 2021
default, £6 billion of which is dedicated to local roads. This represents the biggest sustained commitment to maintaining our network in decades, and will decisively make up for the underinvestment of the past twenty years.
defaultThe department is also due to publish a
default National Policy Statement at the end of the year which will set out the policy and planning framework within which applications for planning consent for road, rail and rail freight interchange developments over a certain size are considered.  The purpose 
defaultof the NPS is to provide clarity and certainty on Government policy for promoters (HA, Network Rail, developers), the planning inspectorate (PINS) and decision makers (Ministers). It will make an important contribution to removing planning barriers to grow
defaultth by providing clarity to applicants and decision-makers on the government’s priorities for development of the networks and the criteria against which developments will be assessed.
defaultWe agree with the point you make in your letter, regarding the need to co
defaultnsider a variety of measures to address capacity issues. User information is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in effectively managing the network. We discuss this in detail in Action for Roads, and as you highlight we will continue to look at new way
defaults to address capacity issues on our road network through better information.
defaultSimilarly, the government is committed to relieving freight traffic on our roads. The Department for Transport currently provides freight grants to industry to encourage modal shi
defaultft from road to rail or water, where the cost of using rail or water are higher than road
default;
default and where there are environmental benefits to be gained. Two freight grant schemes help to remove over 800,000 lorry journeys from 
defaultBritain
default’s roads annually. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWith r
defaultegards to remote working, such practices are not for government to dictate but for individual businesses to consider depending on their own requirements, network capabilities and spending decisions. However, Government does have a role in promoting choice 
defaultand raising awareness amongst businesses and individuals of the different options and many benefits of the alternatives. The Department has therefore commissioned work to explore how widespread alternatives to travel could potentially benefit the 
defaultUK
default, looki
defaultng at resulting travel patterns, and the impacts on travel demand to determine how the impacts of home working feed into the transport system.

defaultSummary, linksdefault and published reports on road building induced traffic and congestiondefaultThere is
default very strong 
defaultevidence 
default(but not as widely known as it should be) 
defaultthat road building can increase traffic levels enormously; although the mechanisms – mode change, redistribution,
default peak narrowing, genuine new trips etc 
default&#xa0;
defaultresulting in the extra traffic is less clear.
defaultCongestion at the end of the new roads and elsewhere from the extra traffic

defaultis much harder to quantify properly.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe December 1994 
defaultSACTRA
default report
default 
default ‘Trunk Roads and the Generation of Traffic’ 
defaultis probably the most robust evidence and analysis of all this.
default&#xa0;
default 
defaultThe SACTRA work itself pulled on a number of different evidence sources - not only the before-and-after traffic counts but also inferences from la
defaultrge numbers of studies of values of time, demand elasticities, differential growth rates, and surveys. It was because all these told a broadly consistent story that SACTRA felt able to be more decisive in its conclusions than the DTp was expecting at the t
defaultime. 
defaultSince then there has been one completely different type of evidence base as well: this is the complementary literature on traffic reduction following road space reductions (pedestrianisation, bus lanes, disasters, maintenance closures, etc). This is
default important in its own right, but also significant in giving confidence that the induced traffic effect is not an artefact due to economic growth or similar. The largest empirical compilation is a book Cairns S, Hass-Klau C and Goodwin P (1998) Traffic Effe
defaultct of Highway Capacity Reductions, Landor Publishing, London, with some updating papers subsequently of which one was awarded a gold medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers.
defaultSACTRA does show that the net effect of road enlargements could actually creat
defaulte more congestion.
default&#xa0;
default Mogridge and Thompson really propounded this 
defaultin their various books and papers 
defaultand it certainly can apply most in big cities on radial routes. 
default&#xa0;
defaultExplained simply there is a vic
defaulti
defaultous circle --- more road space – more car use - 
default&#xa0;
defaultless public
default transport use – fares go up, frequency goes down – more people transfer to cars etc and the new equilibrium point is a lower level of service in both cars and Public Transport.
default&#xa0;
defaultApart from SACTRA there is:
defaultIt is interesting to note
default that 
defaultSACTRA came out during a 
defaultConservative 
defaultGovernment and Transport 
defaultM
defaultinister Stephen Norris said at the time that the government would not have built so many roads if they had known about it.
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile this gives robust evidence of roads generating traffic t
defaulthere is also substantial evidence that extra roadspace and higher speeds do not necessarily provide economic benefits. 
defaultReference can also be made to the 1998 SACTRA report on roads and economic regeneration which included doubts that the economic benefits could be as high as the calculated time savings. We also know that the 
default‘economic benefits’ 
defaultcalculated 
defaultlargely on basis 
defaultof predicted 
defaulttime savings are
default highly artificial
default.
defaultIt appears that 
defaultthe statements of certain business people and the roads lobby
default is being used to make the case for Trunk road improvements rather than any evidence.  I
defaultt is an easy message to say that widening 
defaulta road would appear to be a solution to congestion! The real message on transport policy is much more complicated.
defaultPhil Goodwin’s article in LTTdefaultInduced traffic again. And again. And again.defaultPhil GoodwindefaultWhen the costs of travel are reduced, people do more 
defaultof it. When the costs of car travel are reduced, people use cars more. Why are these obvious propositions so forgettable that they need to be proved anew every decade?
defaultIt was way back in 1925 that the opening of a new section on the Great West Road demonst
defaultrated 'the remarkable manner in which new roads generate new traffic', as Bressey wrote in 1937.  Soon forgotten. Glanville and Smeed at the Road Research Laboratory rediscovered it in 1958, and Foster, at Oxford, in 1963, and it was remembered long enough
default to appear in Ministry of Transport advice in 1968, which said:
default"Generated traffic on large schemes has often amounted to between 5% and 25% over and above the normal forecast traffic level…larger in exceptional cases"
defaultWithin three years the advice disappeared (nobody ever said why), and generated traffic was routinely not calculated for road schemes. The DoT took a legal case to the House of Lords to prevent such forecasts being challenged by objectors. But the evidence
default kept re-appearing: a GLC study demonstrated it empirically in 1985, as did Martin Mogridge and his colleagues in 1987, and it was sharply reinforced in 1988 after the M25 exceeded its long term forecast traffic growth within months of opening. 
defaultIn 1994 SA
defaultCTRA, the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, published its best known report, on what it renamed 'induced' traffic. The average traffic flow on 151 improved roads was 10.4% higher than forecasts which omitted induced traffic, and  16.4% 
defaulthigher than forecast on 85 alternative routes that improvements had been intended to relieve. In a dozen more detailed case studies the measured increase in traffic ranged from 9% to 44% in the short run, and 20% to 178% in the longer run.  This fitted in 
defaultwith other evidence on elasticities, and aggregate data. The conclusion was 
default"an average road improvement, for which traffic growth due to all other factors is forecast correctly, will see an additional [ie induced] 10% of base traffic in the short term an
defaultd 20% in the long term"
defaultThe Department of Transport accepted this. The report was updated it in a special issue of 'Transportation' in 1996 (including my own review, as lead author of the 'evidence' chapters 
defaultof the SACTRA report).  Bob Noland and others fo
defaultr the USA, and many authors in Europe, have since demonstrated similar international results.
defaultFast forward to July this year. CPRE published a report by Lilli Matson, Lynn Sloman, Ian Taylor, and John Elliott. The authors were known to me - I worked with L
defaultilli on the Ten Year Plan for Transport, with a report we called 'Running to Stand Still'; with Lynn on 'Smarter Choices', and also the West Midlands TIF programme; and with John (who did the original 1985 GLC study, with Jill Beardwood and Steve Purnell) 
defaulton the Thames Gateway Bridge.  They are a serious group of engaged professionals, and I opened their report with interest.
defaultIt's called 'Beyond Transport Infrastructure', and what they have done is look in detail at three big schemes on the A27, A34 and M65
default, and a further ten schemes on the A5, A6, A41, A43, A46, A66, A500 and A1033. These were schemes undertaken 
defaultafterdefault SACTRA's 1994 report had been finished and accepted. They reported:
default"Careful scrutiny of the traffic flow data suggests that traffic growth a
defaultfter the scheme opened has been significantly higher than growth on other nearby road corridors or national traffic growth"
default"…in all three case studies the current traffic flows are near or already in excess of what was predicted for 2010. In towns with by
defaultpasses, such as Newbury and Polegate, the new roads did significantly reduce the town centre traffic levels. However, these reductions are not as great as originally forecast and there has subsequently been regrowth in traffic levels on the bypassed roads.
default The net effect in combination with the new road is generally a considerable overall increase in traffic".
defaultTheir final conclusion is remarkably restrained. After noting the Highways Agency's own explanations for the extra traffic growth, (which were intrig
defaultuingly similar to those rejected by SACTRA 12 years earlier), they write 
default"Nevertheless, in view of the fact that many of the schemes reviewed have demonstrated significant increases in traffic volumes (in the range of 10-35%, within a period of one to two
default years after opening), there would seem a strong case to consider the issue of induced traffic in more detail in future evaluations".
defaultSo 1925, 1937, 1958, 1963, 1968, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1994, 1996, now 2006: for eighty years, every eight years on average th
defaultere has been the same experience, the same conclusions - even, for goodness sake, more or less the same figures. The evidence has been consistent,  recurrent, unchallenged by serious countervailing evidence, but repeatedly forgotten. CPRE have done us a se
defaultrvice, I think, but really it should just not have been possible for them to find, 12 years after SACTRA, the same mistakes.
defaultThere may well be situations when it is justified to encourage more traffic, but this should be done cautiously, with eyes wide ope
defaultn about the implications, not by denial. Induced traffic tends to increase environmental damage, and usually tends to reduce the calculated benefit-cost ratio of a road improvement, because the period of relief from congestion will be shorter than planned;
default also because the benefit to the marginal extra travellers is less; and because assuming the extra traffic is not induced artificially makes the 'without' case worse than it really would be. It is a bit more complicated to predict.
defaultMaybe that's the problem
default. The methods you can use if there is no induced traffic are cheaper, and have the incidental side effect of uplifting the calculated benefit. If the promoter of a scheme is the same agency as is responsible for its appraisal, that's two quite big incentiv
defaultes to get it wrong, and no countervailing pressure to get it right. Except, perhaps, the embarrassment of the next research study? But that will be nearly a decade later, and somebody else's problem.
