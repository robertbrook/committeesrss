defaultThe massive release of data by the Department for Education (over 200 pieces of data on each of over 5,000 secondary schools) makes possible a thorough analysis of how well different types of school have performed.

default and maintained schools,

defaultSponsored Academies: 49%
defaultNon-academies: 58

defaultThe difference is greater for 
defaultthe % achieving 5 A-Cs including English and Maths but without counting non-GCSE qualifications like Btecs
default (which will be mainly excluded from 2014):
default 
defaultSponsored Academies: 35%
defaultNon-ac

default%
default(Note: The data here is for Sponsored academies. Converter academies are school that were already principally rated Good or Outstanding and will therefore, by definition, have higher results. This also means that the non-academy sample is wei
defaultghted towards those schools not previously Good or Outstanding, but still achieves far better results than for sponsored academies.)
defaultSponsored Academies v Non-academies by Deprivation in SchooldefaultThe gap is huge but this 
defaultcould be said to be
default an unfair compari
defaultson. We
default know that the raw % pass rate 
defaultis closely related to the ability of the students at entry. We know that schools in disadvantaged areas tend to achieve lower % for 5 A-Cs and we know that the early academies were more likely to be in disadvantaged ar
defaulteas. So does this explain the discrepancy?
defaultThe answer 
defaultis no. To analyse this, 
defaultthe data 
defaultis split 
defaultinto 
defaultsix
default comparison groups according to the % of students 
defaultin the school that 
defaulton free school meals. The first group, the most advantaged, is of schools where 
defaultless than 10% are on FSM and so on up to the most d
defaultisadvantaged where more than 5
default0% are on FSM. Academies 
defaultdo better in the 2 least disadvantaged bands but worse in the others.
defaultTaking the figures without GCSE equivalents, sponsored academies perform worse
default for all except the least privileged (and there are only 5 academies in this band).
default&#xa0;
defaultThe message is clear. When academies are compared to 
defaultmaintained 
defaultcomprehensives with the same level of disadvantage, their results are worse.
default It may be that the further 
defaultsteps that are needed are to learn from the best schools – whether academies or maintained.
defaultDo students in academies take more academic qualifications?defaultThe DfE is keen to see students taking less GCSE “equivalents” like BTECs and more academic 
defaultqualifications – like languages and humanities. Are disadvantaged students benefitting from such opportunities in academies?
defaultThe answer is no. Students in academies are more likely to do equivalent qualifications, and less likely to take a humanity or a 
defaultla
defaultnguage
default GCSE.
defaultUse of Equivalentsdefault“Equivalent qualifications” are qualifications like BTECs that can currently count as equivalent to GCSEs and are generally regarded as used to game the system. It was the Daily Telegraph that first spotted
default, for the 2011 res
defaultults,
default that
default&#xa0;
default“Academy schools ‘inflate results with easy qualifications’”
default, finding that 11.8% of academy results were 
defaultdown to equivalents, compared to 6% for non-academies. The gap actually widened in 2012:

defaultNote: “5 ACEM” refers to % achieving 5 GCSEs including English 
defaultand Maths.
defaultBut this is perhaps an unfair comparison. Sponsored academies are more likely to have started with lower results and schools with lower results are more likely to use equivalents. Do academies make more use of easier equivalents when compared to
default similar schools? 
defaultTo compare similar schools the DfE data 
defaulthas been split
default into ranges according to their 2011 GCSE results, 0-20%, 20-40% and so on. There are only 3 schools in the 0-20% range so the key range for looking at schools in need of improvement 
defaultis the 20-40% range:

defaultNon-academies, 20-40% band
default42.1%
default30.2%
default11.9%
default&#xa0;
defaultFor similar schools, academies are still much more likely to achieve their league table 
defaultGCSE results through equivalents. The 2013 set of exams represent the last year when equivalents can be used in this way. From
default&#xa0;
default2014 very few non-GCSEs
default&#xa0;
defaultwill be counted as equivalent, and then only as equivalent to one GCSE. Will we see a dramatic fall in GCSE results in many schools, especially academies, in 2014?
defaultStudents in academies are less likely to take history or defaultgeography GCSE:defaultMichael Gove has expressed his concern at 
defaultthe lack of history teaching in British schools. Yet the schools in which students are least likely to study history or geography are the sponsored academies – even when compared to similar schools,

defaultProposaldefaultWe should be very careful in assessing the actual data on academy performance (and not just anecdotal ev
defaultidence on very 
defaultsuccessful academ
defaulti
defaulte
defaults like Mossbourne 
defaultand
default Burlington Danes)
default, and ensure we compare them to similar schools. 
defaultThe data appears to indicate, as Michael Wilshaw recently said in the interviews around the 2013 Ofsted report, that it is not structures that 
defaultdeter
defaultmine school success but other factors (such as leadership, teacher development, high expectations).
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default•default&#xa0;defaultThe process for approving, compelling and establishing academies and free schools, including working with sponsors;defaultFor free schools, defaultt
defaulthose who have been through the process have complained that it is 
defaultard
defaultu
defaultous
default and bureaucratic. 
defaultHowever that
default has not stopped the problems: 
defaultthe closure of 
defaultNew
default 
defaultDiscovery school, the fraud problems at Kings Academy, the issue of Al Madinah – described as having 
defaulthad the worst Ofsted report ever recorded.
defaultN
defaulto amount of prior assessment can guarantee the success of a new 
defaulteffectively 
defaultindependent s
defaultchool. As an analogy, 
defaulttake 
defaultjob interviews: However thorough, the wrong person is sometimes appointed. What is vital is that
default there is a proper process after appointment to support and challenge that person and ultimately deal with any problems that arise.
defaultSome organisation, and the local education authority is ideally placed, needs to be actively involved in the early days of a
default new school to help ensure its success. 
defaultAnd i
defaultn some areas the local parents may prefer a maintained school. Why is this not an option? Why is parental choice only allowed as long
default 
defaultas they want to choose an academy or free school?
defaultProposaldefault&#xa0;default•default&#xa0;defaultThe functions and responsibilities in relation to academies and free schools of local authorities and other organisations operating between the Secretadefaultry of State and individual schools; what these functions and responsibilities should be; and what gaps there are in support for schools at this level;defaultA well run and effective local education authority will have good knowledge of its local schools – based 
defaulton contact with parents and young people and, in the case of maintained schools, the active role of a school improvement partner.
defaultExamples of such authorities are Tower Hamlets and Hackney, both of whom have transformed their schools from being at or near 
defaultthe bottom of the league tables 
default(10 years ago) 
defaultto, despite high levels of deprivation, being in the top half. Tower Hamlets has done so almost entirely without academies. Hackney built four new academies and most of the secular secondary schools are now ac
defaultademies. (A mark of 
defaultit
defaults success is that the only schools that are 
defaultnotdefault now oversubscribed are the faith schools in the borough.)
defaultHowever Hackney has played an active role even in its academies. It administers all admissions (though different schools have di
defaultfferent banding rules and some have faith requirements), ensuring that pupils only have to take one banding test. All schools work together, whether Academies or maintained, and the LEA seeks to provide support and challenge to all 
defaultit
defaults schools.
defaultThat is key
default. Local authorities have found that, when they express concern to the DfE about an academy, the DfE is only actively involved if the school is below the national floor targets. A good local authority will be aware, for instance, if a school is above floor 
defaulttargets but coasting. 
defaultA local authority is not doing its job if it first finds out that a school is under-performing after an Ofsted inspection. 
defaultThere will always be many good and outstanding schools, whether they are academies or maint
defaultained schools. The 
defaultissue is which body 
defaultis there to step in i
defaultf a school starts to weaken, which body
default is best able to spot it and who can best intervene to help.
defaultThe need for a “middle tier” is widely recognised and the DfE has responded by creating a new layer, with Commissio
defaultners. It is unclear how effective this will be, how well one individual in a region will be able to know their local schools.
defaultProposaldefault&#xa0;default default•default&#xa0;defaultWhat role academy chains play or should play in the new school landscape; how defaultaccountable they are; and what issues they raise with regard to governance arrangements;default&#xa0;defaultIt is not clear who, if anybody, academy chains are accountable to. Some are performing well. But, inevitably, some are not performing so well. Who will hold them to 
defaultaccount?
defaultExample: Financial ReportingdefaultOn the issue of whether schools, are accountable 
defaultwe can 
defaulttake 
defaultthe example of 
defaultfinances. 
defaultDavid Cameron told the 
defaultHouse of Commons
default Liaison Committee in March 2012
default 
default“People can increasingly see the funding per pupil that goesdefault into the school and if we are successful in introducing a more national funding formula for schools that will be even clearer. The parent/teacher /local community knows how much follows the pupil into the school and can then see the results. We need to sedefaulte how much money going into the schools and the results coming out. This will produce results for very transparent amounts of money that are going in.”defaultThis transparency would be welcome but

default does not exist.

defaultDfE Financial Information on ChainsdefaultExample: Burlington Danes Academydefault“No 2012-2013 Consistent Financial Reporting 
defaultdata (see the
default&#xa0;
defaultguidance
default)”
default&#xa0;
defaultFor academies it is possible to download the audited accounts. Though difficult for the non-financial person to read, it does at least give some
default detailed financial inform
defaultation for individual academies – though it is not comparable to the above information for a maintained school.
defaultFor Burlington Danes, the audited accounts are for the ARK chain as a whole and give o
defaultnly one overall expenditure figur
defaulte
default for the school.
defaultThis year the Public Accounts Committee concluded:
default default“the Department must insist that every Academy Trust provides it with data showing school level expenditure, including per-pupil costs, and with a level of detail comparable to that defaultavailable for maintained schools. The Department must then publish this data so that proper judgements and comparisons can be made by Parliament and the public.”defaultTory MP Richard Bacon described the lack of financial information as “mind-blowing.”
defaultThe data 
defaultoutlined by 
defaultthe Public Accounts Committee is still not available, as the above comparison shows.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe financial question is only one aspect of chains, but illustrates th
defaulte lack of accountability. A local authority is 
defaultsubject to inspection by Of
defaultsted and the DfE has stepped in, in several authorities, 
defaultto ensure improved provision. 
defaultC
defaulthains cannot be inspected by Ofsted and it is unclear what level of underperformance will lead to action by the DfE, and of what type. 
defaultProposal: default&#xa0;default•default&#xa0;defaultWhat alternatives to sponsored academy status should be offered to failing primary schools.defaultIf the local authority is supportive, 
defaultcould 
default“failing” primary schools access support from the local authority and be able to improve within the community of maintained schools.
defaultExample: Snaresbrook school in East London was threatened with forced academisa
defaulttion after an Ofsted visit in June 2013. 
defaultIn
default the meantime the local authority, Conservative-controlled Redbridge Council, had intervened, brought in a new head, provided an estimated £50k of support and, by all accounts
default,
default 
defaultturned the 
defaultschool round.
defaultThe vocal 
defaultopposition of parents to academisation was supported by Redbridge Council, including all its Conservative members. The DfE responded by stating that the parents could get their wish and the school would remain in the maintained sector.
defaultThe school had been 
defaultoffered the chance to join an academy chain of two schools. It is hard to see how a newly established, and small, academy chain could be of greater benefit than a well-resourced local authority, with several dozen schools and the resources to second an exp
defaulterienced headteacher into the school. 
defaultIs this an isolated example? Analysis of the school-by-school data released by the DFE in December 2013 reveals:
defaulthttp://bit.ly/1bE3L09defaulthttp://bit.ly/1hXllEIdefaultThere is no evidence base for conversion of primary schools to academies. It is an experiment and there is, so far, no data in the public domain to detail
default whether it is a success or not.
default 
defaultIn contrast there is substantial evidence of the improvement that maintained primary schools are capable of. An underperforming primary can draw on the substantial resources and experience of the local authority.
