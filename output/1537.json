"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence\n from Campaign for Better Transport (TIC 045)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nExecutive Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBefore responding to the questions posed by the Committ\nee we would make two points.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nL\nocal amenities have been replaced by more centralised units or by more remote\n development, meaning people are having to travel further.\n This is obviously lin\nked to a rise in car ownership, b\nut a quarter of households in Great\n Britain, for a variet\ny of reasons, do not have a car. \n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIsolation is important to define as it is not just people in sparsely populated and rural areas that experience isolation. \nEven\n in urban and suburban areas \npeople may be isolated due to \npoor public t\nransport and lack of many public amenities.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe strongly welcome this inquiry. \nIt is evident that Government spending cuts are making the issue of isolation worse as passenger transport has been significantly cut over the last three years. \nThe Campaign for\n Better Transport has\n recently\n been working \nto highlight the issues passengers face in isolated communities\n,\n and rural communities in particular\n. O\nver the last few months\n we have campaigned\n for sustained\n support of \nrural transport up to an\nd beyond the Spen\nding Round\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe have recently published \nfour\n pieces of research of relevance to the Inquiry\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll of these studies point towards how important getting public transport right is for low income groups\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAll modes of passenger transport are important but it is fair to say the most important\n and most frequently used\n mode of passenger transport in rural areas is the \nbus;\n therefore we shall be focusing strongly on buses and their importance throughout this submission of written evidence. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe needs of different groups of passengers are only occasionally taken into account when determining the provision of \npublic transport to isolated communities. \nThese groups include: \n&#xa0;-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nElderly Passengers-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYounger Passengers-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnemployed Passengers-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLow Income Passengers-\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisabled Passengers&#xa0;2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBefore briefly highlighting the needs of \nthese \ndifferent groups of passengers we would \nlike to highlight t\nhree points \nwhich \nshould be taken into account when determining provision of public transport to isolated communities.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe following \nbriefly identifies the needs of user groups that heavily rely on public transport.\n&#xa0;2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPassenger Transport and Isolation for the Elderly - \nPublic t\nransport isolation for the elderly is a very serious issue. \nPublic t\nransport is a lifeline for many\n \nolder people, w\nith many \nelderly people unable to drive public transport is the only option and for many people over the age of 65 this option is \nnot available. Public \nt\nransport for the elderly enables them to connect with them with friends, family and their community whilst allowing them access to health and social care and other key services. \n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOlder people and younger people make more trips by \npassenger\n transport (bus, coach and rail) than \nany other age group\n. \nT\nhis coincides with a decline in the number of people holding\n a car driving licence with \nage;\n only 35 per cent of pensioner households in rural areas have no access to a car.\n \n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \naccessi\nbility\n of public transport differs significantly between \nurban and rural \ncommunities. In urban areas the percentage of people who live within 13 minutes of a regular (hourly) bus is around 95%, in rural areas it\n falls to \n50%\n.\n&#xa0;2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPassenger Transport Isolation for the Young - Young people travel\n a shorter total distance and make fewer journeys than they used to but must now make longer journeys to reach their most frequent destinations. They make most of their journeys by car but, in common with older people, they use cars less and travel by bus \nmore than people in the middle age groups\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYoung people make significantly fewer car journeys than they did – down from almost 600 trips per person each year in the mid-1990s to 377 trips in 2011 – and fewer young people now own cars or have driving \nlicences (only 38% of 17-20 year olds now have a driving license compared to 48% in the early 1990s)\n.\n The provision of public transport to compensate for this trend has however not been taken into account by local or central governments. \n&#xa0;2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport Isolation for people who are unemployed - The location of job centres causes difficulties for those in rural areas, particularly when Jobcentre Plus offices insist on weekly or daily signing-on and when offices have closed permanently.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThose living in rural ar\neas without access to a car face particular difficulties in finding work due to poor transport provision and a lack of affordable social housing located nearer to employment opportunities. Those on low incomes may also be reluctant to move nearer to jobs d\nue to their informal networks of support or family commitments in the area where they currently live\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo out of five jobseekers say lack of transport is a barrier to getting a job. The cost of transport can be a problem getting to interviews and transpo\nrt problems can be a deterrent to making job applications\n&#xa0;2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport Isolation for people on low incomes – People on low incomes face similar issues and obstacles to those who \nare out of work.\n&#xa0;\n2.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLow income families are more dependent than others on bus \ntravel; buses account for a larger proportion of their income and the cheaper fare deals which involve paying larger lump sums are often unavailable to them. Bus fare increases restrict the ability of households to meet the transport costs of their childre\nn for important out of school activities and transport costs can be a barrier to employment for low income families\n&#xa0;\n2.14\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPeople in the lowest income quintile make three times more journeys by bus than people in the highest income quintile\n&#xa0;2.15\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTransport Isolation for people with disabilities - Disabled people are more likely to mention transport as a local concern than non-disabled people, 60 per cent of disabled people have no car in the household and hey use buses around 20 per cent more frequently than non-disa\nbled people.\n&#xa0;\n2.16\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInaccessible transport cuts disabled people off from community and family life.\n Fifty per cent say they did not see friends and family\n as often as they’d like because of inaccessible transport and 20% find it difficult or impossible to get \nthe healthcare they need because of inaccessible transport.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main challenge to prov\niding better and more consistent bus and rail services to isolated communities is funding. Since \n2010 central Government funding for buses has been cut by 20% and funding for supported bus services has been cut by 20%\n.\n&#xa0;3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSupply and demand is an issue in iso\nlated communitie\ns with\n a higher cost per passenger journey for the operators. The wider benefits to local economies must be considered when making decisions on local transport.\n&#xa0;3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIntegrated Transport – Due to the nature of a privatise\nd\n rail network and deregulated bus services a huge challenge is getting transport operators to work together to promote integrated transport, which in isolated communities can be vital. \n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNetwork St Albans\n \nwas launched in 2009 to bring together all the orga\nnisations which have a role to play in providing/improving transport in the city of St Albans, with the aim to reduce traffic congestion. It was St Albans Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) that formed the basis for developing a public transport related par\ntnership to come up with alternatives to single occupancy car use in St Albans.\n \n  \nThe negative impacts imposed on the city and wider area from local traffic congestion and pollution (specifically on Pea Hen Junction), needed a strategic approach, which in\ncludes improving public transport service provision and infrastructure.\n&#xa0;\n3.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGreater integrated transport systems should also be strongly encouraged for isolated areas enabling bus and train operators to work with local authorities to promote cooperation and enabling a greater door to door journey experience from public transport. \n&#xa0;3.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA study by the Campaign for Better Transport on door to door journeys identified four key points needed for success\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity transport \ncan be \na lifeline in both rural and urban areas. It takes disabled people t\no work, children to school, sick people to healthcare and older people to the shops. It runs local bus routes and provides transport for a wide range of clubs, voluntary bodies and care homes. People shape the services they want and comm\nunity transport mak\nes it happen.\n&#xa0;4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Transport schemes serving the most remote corners of the country, or schemes working in partnership with other local services like youth clubs or care homes, can really make a huge difference to people who use them. Community Transport is part of\n the Transport mix in isolated communities but not the sole \nsolution to passenger transport\n.\n&#xa0;4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCentral Government and Local Authorities are unrealistic if they expect volunteer run community transport projects to fill gaps left by deep bus cuts. Research fr\nom the Community Transport Association has shown that community transport can only fill between 10 to 15 per cent\n of former supported transport provision\n.\n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe integration of services and pooling for budgets, at both local and national levels, can ensure t\nhat public money is made to work harder. Some local authorities have already made savings by integrating the way they contract public bus services, school buses and social services transport. Partnerships between councils, operators and big institutions li\nke hospitals and universities have had good results. Taxi buses, NHS transport, travel schemes for post 16 students and social enterprises all have a part to play. In some cases core routes linking towns are met by demand response village services at reque\nst stops. \n&#xa0;\n4.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA ‘Total Transport’ solution for areas affected by cuts to services which would bring together all transport provision in an area\n such as private operators, council run services, \nh\nospital \nt\nransport\n and social services.\n&#xa0;\n4.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity Rail Partnersh\nips play\n an important \nrole in\n providing transport for isolated communities.\n \nThe case for new or reopened connections is increasingly strong, with demand for rail now at its highest level since before the Second World War, despite the network being \nconsiderably smaller than then. Despite the growing case for these connections, there is no clear process in the rail industry for this to happen and many local authorities lack the capacity or skills to progress schemes themselves. Some new lines and stat\nions have been built, however, and demand on these new lines and stations has usually been higher than forecast.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is \ndifficult to say what extent passengers in isolated communities should rely upon taxis as previously described there are many different service users in these areas that all have di\nfferent needs and requirements.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIf taxis are used to replace public trans\nport then they should be demand responsive. Can a replacement taxi be adequately used for people in work or education at peak times. How far would this service also booked in advance.\n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThere are various Taxi Voucher Schemes in place across a few \nplaces\n in \nEngland, most notably in London but also in Surrey, Cheshire, Brighton and Hove for example. Outside London these vouchers amount to around £70 per year on the basis that users give up their National Bus Pass in exchange.\n&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA recent Case Study\n by Campaign for Better Transport\n of an area in the North East\n looked at an housing estate where bus cuts had taken place and where the local council had replaced the supported bus service with a r\nesidual \nfree \nbus \nservice to the local supermarket. This st\nudy found that that some residents were forced into taking taxi’s but only those who could afford to. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal residents were left isolated causing very serious impacts for many such as leaving the house much less to go shopping, visit friends and family. F\ninancial impacts due to having to travel by taxis, and most seriously, health and social impacts\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \n“\nA lot of older people than me live around here and especially early morning I relied on this bus service. I can't walk very well, I have a stick so walking\n far is not an option unless the weather is dry.\n” (Female, aged 46 to 65, not working and not looking for work, no access to a car, has a disability or ill health)\n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDemand responsive transport can be important for residents in isolated communities\n.\n In Simo\nn Norton’s evidence to this committee he highlights the guidelines for good \ndemand responsive service, which include:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFunding transport services in isolated communities is getting progressively harder and harder with spending cuts across the boar\nd since 2010. \nThere must be a greater focus on transport integration and Local Authorities working together with all transport operators. \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDifferent modes of \nt\nransport should be working together not against each other – it should not be a case of bus versus rail. \n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhilst many argue for spending cuts to transport across the country\n,\n there must be a \ngeneral\n recognition that investing in passenger transport is goo\nd for the country with wider benefits experienced economicall\ny, socially and environmentally to having a good transport system. People in isolated communities must not be left behind when budgets are cut and savings are made. \n&#xa0;\n7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA way forward would be to \ncreate a ring fenced fund from Central Government for local buses which would p\nool investment in buses from the Government departments that most benefit \nfrom them – DWP, DfE, DH. This would be d\nistributed as now through the Bus Service Operators Grant or t\nhrough a new approach that supports buses in rural as well as in urban areas based on accessibility.\n&#xa0;\nAugust\n 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n Transport and Poverty: A Literature Review, Campaign for Better Transport, July 2012, \nhttp://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/transport-and-poverty-literature\n-review.pdf\n \n Transport barriers to getting a job – Evidence from Citizens Advice clients, Campaign for Better Transport, July 2012, \nhttp://www.bettertransport\n.org.uk/files/Transport-barriers-to-getting-a-job.pdf\n \n Social Inclusion Value of Buses – Marchwood, Social Inclusion Value of Buses – Burbank, Campaign for Better Transport, July 2012, \nhttp://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/social-inclusion-value-of-buses-marchwood-report.pdf\n and \nhttp://www.bettertransport.org.uk/files/social-inclusion-value-of-buses-burbank-report.pdf\n \n \nhttp://www.be\nttertransport.org.uk/files/Crisis-of-bus-provision-in-England.pdf\n \n National Travel Survey Department for Transport, 2009\n Information about travel behaviour based on National Travel Survey, Department for Transport\n, 2009\n (DfT)\n \nNo Entry!
