[normal]OAR0018[bold]Written evidence submitted by the LGA[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and 
[normal]improve local government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issue
[normal]s that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.

[normal]Further Education[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Councils have 
[normal]duty to secure suitable education and training provisi
[normal]on for all young people aged 16-
[normal]19, and to encourage enable and assist young people’s participation, and a responsibility to promote local growth.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ofsted has, in two consecutive years, highlighted the 
[normal]poor responsiveness of further education provision to local economic conditions,
[normal] and the limited attention paid to 
[normal]equipping young people with the skills and experience to take jobs
[normal]. This has serious repercussions for employers, young people and, at an an
[normal]nual public investment of £7.78 billion, the taxpayer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Councils regularly identify the skills system as one of the greatest barriers to local growth. It is a structural issue created by the national lagged 
[normal]learner 
[normal]number funding system that financially re
[normal]wards providers for passing high numbers of qualifications, rather than for helping young people towards a job or helping employers 
[normal]meet their 
[normal]skills needs. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This has led to skills mismatches, where far too many young people put their effort into courses 
[normal]unlikely to lead to a local job. Our research has shown that, in 2011/12 post-16 providers trained 94,000 hair and beauty technicians for 18,000 jobs. Meanwhile the construction sector, which has since identified significant skills shortages, providers tra
[normal]ined around123,000 people for around 275,000 advertised jobs.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A
[normal] nationally controlled funding system 
[normal]will struggle to remedy this
[normal] 
[normal]because
[normal] 
[normal]the
[normal] national economy
[normal] is
[normal] a composite of
[normal] many different local economies. There are 2.23 million local business units 
[normal]across England, 99 per cent of which employ fewer than 100 people and the majority operate in local economies. It is our concern that, without reform, the evolving public service landscape will struggle to 
[normal]work 
[normal]coherently with employers in ways that help y
[normal]oung people. Our analysis suggests there are three reasons for this:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Around the country local authorities are seeking to work wi
[normal]th providers to ensure young people are trained for jobs in the local economy, identified through quality local labour market information or through linking to local investment plans and developments. Examples are available in our Hidden Talents report, in
[normal]cluding some City Deals, Community Budgets and many council led initiatives. Local models have real impact, and been better able to join-up with employment provision and other services, attract additional private sector investment, and trial payment by res
[normal]ults models.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Good practice exists in spite of the system rather than because of it
[normal]; i
[normal]n many places the national funding and performance incentives discourage collaboration and innovati
[normal]ve
[normal] practice that responds to local need.
[normal] In our recent survey, almost
[normal] 90 per cent of councils felt that they do not have sufficient influence to ensure 
[normal]the 
[normal]funding enables young people 
[normal]to 
[normal]gain 
[normal]the 
[normal]skills 
[normal]needed 
[normal]to 
[normal]secure
[normal] jobs in the local area. More than 60 per cent felt that the Education Funding Agency was driven 
[normal]more 
[normal]by 
[normal]the concerns of providers, than by employers or young people.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We want local partnerships - including providers, employers and enabled by councils - 
[normal]to
[normal] become accountable for creating and leading a coherent and responsive mix of skills provision focused o
[normal]n supporting young people’s transition 
[normal]to
[normal] the local labour market. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Significant progress in this area cannot be achieved without reform to 
[normal]the 
[normal]further education funding system. We are therefore keen to discuss with the 
[normal]Education C
[normal]ommittee:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The principles of 
[normal]a locally led
[normal] approach have been 
[normal]championed
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] a range of significant contributions
[normal] from 
[normal]the Heseltine Review, the Social Mobility Commission led by Alan Mi
[normal]lburn, and also the Work Foundation, London School of Economies, the Institute of Public Policy Research
[normal] among others.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Local authority tracking of young people[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Local authorities have a responsibility to track young people as part of their statutory duties to encourage and support participation, and improve outcomes for young people.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Ofsted’s Annual Report references the percentage of young people unknown to lo
[normal]cal authorities, which is on average 4 per cent of 16 and 17 year olds. It 
[normal]states that
[normal] ‘in some 
[normal]l
[normal]ocal authorities the percentage is as high as 23 per cent’. This is misleading. Only 7 councils have more than 10 per cent of young people unknown, only 2 coun
[normal]cils 
[normal]have 
[normal]above 15 per cent and only 1 council 
[normal]has 
[normal]above 20 per cent. Furthermore, in the last year, the percentage of young people unknown 
[normal]to local authorities 
[normal]has fallen in 
[normal]each of 
[normal]these 7 councils
[normal] by as much as 13 per cent.  This 
[normal]improvement 
[normal]is 
[normal]not refe
[normal]renced by the report. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Nevertheless
[normal],
[normal] we are keen to support councils wanting to improve further, and the
[normal] LGA
[normal] recently launched a Tracking Guide and Planning Toolbox, which builds on the innovative practice in some ‘expert’ local authorities for 
[normal]those 
[normal]want
[normal]ing to improve how they track young people
[normal]. In undertaking this 
[normal]work,
[normal] it 
[normal]beca
[normal]me clear that local authority success is dependent on the contribution 
[normal]of
[normal] an increasingly fragmented market of providers in their area, accountable to national programmes.
