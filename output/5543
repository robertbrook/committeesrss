defaultOAR0018defaultWritten evidence submitted by the LGAdefault&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;defaultThe Local Government Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and 
defaultimprove local government.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issue
defaults that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.
default  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe LGA covers every part of England and Wales, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.

defaultFurther Educationdefault&#xa0;
defaultCouncils have 
defaultduty to secure suitable education and training provisi
defaulton for all young people aged 16-
default19, and to encourage enable and assist young people’s participation, and a responsibility to promote local growth.
default&#xa0;
defaultOfsted has, in two consecutive years, highlighted the 
defaultpoor responsiveness of further education provision to local economic conditions,
default and the limited attention paid to 
defaultequipping young people with the skills and experience to take jobs
default. This has serious repercussions for employers, young people and, at an an
defaultnual public investment of £7.78 billion, the taxpayer.
default&#xa0;
defaultCouncils regularly identify the skills system as one of the greatest barriers to local growth. It is a structural issue created by the national lagged 
defaultlearner 
defaultnumber funding system that financially re
defaultwards providers for passing high numbers of qualifications, rather than for helping young people towards a job or helping employers 
defaultmeet their 
defaultskills needs. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis has led to skills mismatches, where far too many young people put their effort into courses 
defaultunlikely to lead to a local job. Our research has shown that, in 2011/12 post-16 providers trained 94,000 hair and beauty technicians for 18,000 jobs. Meanwhile the construction sector, which has since identified significant skills shortages, providers tra
defaultined around123,000 people for around 275,000 advertised jobs.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultA
default nationally controlled funding system 
defaultwill struggle to remedy this
default 
defaultbecause
default 
defaultthe
default national economy
default is
default a composite of
default many different local economies. There are 2.23 million local business units 
defaultacross England, 99 per cent of which employ fewer than 100 people and the majority operate in local economies. It is our concern that, without reform, the evolving public service landscape will struggle to 
defaultwork 
defaultcoherently with employers in ways that help y
defaultoung people. Our analysis suggests there are three reasons for this:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAround the country local authorities are seeking to work wi
defaultth providers to ensure young people are trained for jobs in the local economy, identified through quality local labour market information or through linking to local investment plans and developments. Examples are available in our Hidden Talents report, in
defaultcluding some City Deals, Community Budgets and many council led initiatives. Local models have real impact, and been better able to join-up with employment provision and other services, attract additional private sector investment, and trial payment by res
defaultults models.
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultGood practice exists in spite of the system rather than because of it
default; i
defaultn many places the national funding and performance incentives discourage collaboration and innovati
defaultve
default practice that responds to local need.
default In our recent survey, almost
default 90 per cent of councils felt that they do not have sufficient influence to ensure 
defaultthe 
defaultfunding enables young people 
defaultto 
defaultgain 
defaultthe 
defaultskills 
defaultneeded 
defaultto 
defaultsecure
default jobs in the local area. More than 60 per cent felt that the Education Funding Agency was driven 
defaultmore 
defaultby 
defaultthe concerns of providers, than by employers or young people.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe want local partnerships - including providers, employers and enabled by councils - 
defaultto
default become accountable for creating and leading a coherent and responsive mix of skills provision focused o
defaultn supporting young people’s transition 
defaultto
default the local labour market. 
default&#xa0;
defaultSignificant progress in this area cannot be achieved without reform to 
defaultthe 
defaultfurther education funding system. We are therefore keen to discuss with the 
defaultEducation C
defaultommittee:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe principles of 
defaulta locally led
default approach have been 
defaultchampioned
default 
defaultin
default a range of significant contributions
default from 
defaultthe Heseltine Review, the Social Mobility Commission led by Alan Mi
defaultlburn, and also the Work Foundation, London School of Economies, the Institute of Public Policy Research
default among others.
default&#xa0;defaultLocal authority tracking of young peopledefault&#xa0;defaultLocal authorities have a responsibility to track young people as part of their statutory duties to encourage and support participation, and improve outcomes for young people.  
default&#xa0;
defaultOfsted’s Annual Report references the percentage of young people unknown to lo
defaultcal authorities, which is on average 4 per cent of 16 and 17 year olds. It 
defaultstates that
default ‘in some 
defaultl
defaultocal authorities the percentage is as high as 23 per cent’. This is misleading. Only 7 councils have more than 10 per cent of young people unknown, only 2 coun
defaultcils 
defaulthave 
defaultabove 15 per cent and only 1 council 
defaulthas 
defaultabove 20 per cent. Furthermore, in the last year, the percentage of young people unknown 
defaultto local authorities 
defaulthas fallen in 
defaulteach of 
defaultthese 7 councils
default by as much as 13 per cent.  This 
defaultimprovement 
defaultis 
defaultnot refe
defaultrenced by the report. 
default&#xa0;
defaultNevertheless
default,
default we are keen to support councils wanting to improve further, and the
default LGA
default recently launched a Tracking Guide and Planning Toolbox, which builds on the innovative practice in some ‘expert’ local authorities for 
defaultthose 
defaultwant
defaulting to improve how they track young people
default. In undertaking this 
defaultwork,
default it 
defaultbeca
defaultme clear that local authority success is dependent on the contribution 
defaultof
default an increasingly fragmented market of providers in their area, accountable to national programmes.
