[normal]As a citizen of the UK, who uses cycling as his primary form of transport, I am writing in a personal capacity. I wish to make two points:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Point 1
[normal]=======
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The following document was commissioned by the Department for Transport:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Title:     
[normal]Driversâ
[normal]€™ perceptions of cyclists Authors:   L 
[normal]Basford
[normal]; S Reid; T Lester; J Thomson; A 
[normal]Tolmie

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It addresses issues central to your committee's concerns. Your committee should not conclude until every member has read that document. It is only 38 pages long, so thi
[normal]s should be quite manageable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]For convenience, I note that the document has been mirrored at: http://www.southamptontriclub.co.uk/storage/TRL549.pdf
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Point 2
[normal]=======
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]It is better for the committee to take a little longer, and to draw sound conclusions, 
[normal]than for the committee to conclude sooner and draw invalid conclusions.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Additionally, it is dangerous to draw conclusions on a topic from a position of ignorance in relation to that topic.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]There are many forms of ignorance. The Transport Select Committee
[normal] on cycling safety, in taking (ostensibly) knowledge-based submissions from a range of stakeholders, is trying to reduce the ignorance of its members, to improve the quality of the eventual findings of the committee. That is laudable.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]However, as the foll
[normal]owing two articles makes clear, several members of the Transport Select Committee on cycling safety lack - and apparently are likely to remain lacking - in not only knowledge but also in recent and extensive *experience* relating to cycling on the public h
[normal]ighway in the UK.

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Unless that is remedied, the committee's conclusions 
[normal]will be made from a position of significant ignorance, no matter how extensively the committee consults. Fortunately, this is easily and inexpensively remedied - assuming that the committee members are sincere in their desire to understand the dangers cycl
[normal]ists face.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I therefore propose the committee adopts the following rule:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Before any contribution from a member of the Transport Select Committee on cycling safety can be included in the committee's written findings, that member must prove that he or she h
[normal]as:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]travelled, by pedal cycle, on each of at least 100 days of the preceding 365 days, a distance of at least one mile on the public highway in the UK; and
[normal]-
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]travelled
[normal], by pedal cycle, at least 20 miles in total on A-roads within the preceding 365 days.
