default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for your invitation to submit 
defaultevidence to the Committee's inquiry into crime statistics
default. 
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile in some cases the police service or Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) may be best placed to respond to the Committee’s specific questions, I have set out below some general 
defaultobservations about particular themes raised in your letter.  I also enclose a detailed note prepared by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), as the body responsible for the publication of the statistics, at Annex A.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe UK Statistics Authority has 
defaultconducted a range of work on crime statistics. In 2010
default,
default the Authorit
defaulty published a monitoring review
default 
defaultOvercoming Barriers to Trust in Crime Statistics
default, 
defaultand the National Statistician subsequently undertook an independent review of crime statistics in 2011. Th
defaultis work culminated in the decision to transfer responsibility for the compilation and publication of crime statistics from the Home Office to the ONS in April 2012. The National Statistician’s review also identified the need for a transparent, independent 
defaultadvisory committee to consider any change in definitions, classifications or methodologies that may affect the statistics. The Crime Statistics Advisory Committee was established in late 2011 
defaultand has taken an active role,
default advising the Home Office over matt
defaulters related to the collection of police recorded crime, the ONS over changes to the presentation of crime statistics, and HMIC over the inspection of police recording practices. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is the Authority’s view that these have been important steps in improving
default the integrity and independence of the statistics; prerequisites for building public trust in them.  We do, however, note that there is scope for further improvement.  
default&#xa0;
defaultWhile much of the evidence is anecdotal, the Authority considers that possible inconsi
defaultstencies in crime recording by the police and the potential distorting effect of performance targets are a matter for concern.  Trust in the integrity of these statistics requires users to have confidence that consistent decisions about crime recording are
default being made across forces, and over time.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe current lack of periodic independent audit of crime recording by the police is similarly a matter for concern.  We, therefore, welcome the intention of the HMIC to ca
defaultrry out a national inspection of
default the integr
defaultity of crime recording starting in late 2013. We believe such inspections should become a permanent feature of the system.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFinally, the Committee asks whether recorded crime statistics should be classified as National Statistics.  The Authority original
defaultly assessed these statistics when they were the responsibility of the Home Office, and they were designated as National Statistics in 2012.  They are now undergoing reassessment.  The Authority holds the view that – given the national importance of police 
defaultrecorded 
defaultcrime 
defaultstatistics – these statistics should be National Statistics.  Compliance with the Code of Practice will ensure that the statistics meet the needs of users, and are produced, managed and disseminated to high standards.    
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;defaultANNEX: NOTE PREPAREdefaultDdefault BY THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICSdefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Home Office has been collecting information from the police on the number of police recorded crimes since the 
defaultlate 19th century. This series has been based on aggregate counts of the number of specific offences contained within the notifiable offence list (NOL). This list includes all indictable crimes (i.e. those tried at Crown Court) and all those that could be 
defaulttried either a
defaultt a crown court or a magistrate
defaults
default’
default court. The police also record other crimes, or crime-related incidents, which are outside the scope of the main recorded crime collection. 
default&#xa0;
defaultTo supplement the police recorded crime series, the Home Office ini
defaulttiated a separate survey – known then as the British Crime Survey (BCS) – which measured the extent of crime by asking people whether they had experienced crime.  The survey aimed to assess how much crime went unreported to the police and to capture richer
default data 
default(
defaultthan available from the aggregate police recorded crime series
default)
default on the characteristics and experiences of victims
default of crime
default.  The first BCS ran in 1982 and was repeated periodically through the 1980s and 1990s before the Home Office decided to establ
defaultish the survey on a continuous basis in 2001. While Home Office analysts were responsible for the data analysis and publication of research and statistics coming out of the BCS, the data collection was contracted out to an independent survey research organ
defaultisation.  
default&#xa0;
defaultFollowing a monitoring report published by the UK Statistics Authority in 2010, the Home Secretary asked the National Statistician to undertake an independent review of crime statistics. The terms of reference for this review included considering which ind
defaultependent body should assume future responsibility for crime statistics and to consider the data collection arrangements that should underpin any new arrangements.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Statistician recommended that responsibility for the publication of the stati
defaultstics should be transferred to the independent Office for National Statistics (ONS), to demonstrate that the statistics were free from political interference. The National Statistician recommended that responsibility for the whole life cycle of the BCS, an
defaultd funding, should als
defaulto be seen to be independent of M
defaultinisters and 
defaultthat 
defaultthis should also transfer to ONS.  However, it was recognised that, given the existing relationships between the Home Office and the police service, there were benefits to the Home Offi
defaultce 
defaultin 
defaultretaining responsibility for the collection and validation of police recorded crime
default data
default.  This would also avoid an increase in bureaucracy in the police supply of data to both ONS (for crime statistics purposes) and t
defaulto t
defaulthe Home Office (for other pur
defaultposes).  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe National Statistician’s recommendations were accepted by the Government and the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 2012. The ONS now receives police recorded crime data from the Home Office Statistics Unit on a quarterly basis
default,
default and anal
defaultyses
default these data
default alongside Crime Survey data which is collected independently by the ONS. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThere are currently no international standards for crime recording by the police. Recording practice in England and Wales is governed by the Home Office Counting Rul
defaultes (HOCR) and the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS). These rules set out whether, how
default,
default and when to record a crime. They are designed to provide a consistent approach across forces, and over time, in the recording and classifying of offences.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe HO
defaultCR requires that incidents reported to the police should be initially registered, irrespective of whether the report comes from victims, witnesses or third parties, and whether 
defaultor not it relates to a crime. The NCRS was introduced in 2002 to provide a more
default victim-focused approach to crime recording and followed a report 
defaultby
default Her Majesty’s Insp
defaultectorate of Constabulary (HMIC)
default which highlighted inconsistent recording practices across forces influenced by local police culture.  The NCRS requires that an incident 
defaultwill be recorded as a crime if, on the balance of probability, the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law and there is no credible evidence to the contrary. Once recorded, a crime should remain recorded unless there is additional verifi
defaultable information to show that a crime did not occur.
default&#xa0;
defaultAlongside the adoption of the NCRS, forces were encouraged to undertake internal audits of crime records to ensure compliance with the new standards. This led to
default the creation of the role of a force crim
defaulte r
defaultegistrar whose role it is to quality assure data and be the final arbiter with respect to disputes about the local interpretation of the HOCR.  Force crime registrars are coordinated by a national crime registrar based at the Home Office
default,
default and the guidan
defaultce with which they are provided includes a data quality audit manual.
default&#xa0;
defaultOn receipt of the data, the Home Office Statistics Unit checks the data for obvious errors or omissions and 
defaultmakes enquiries
default with forces 
defaultin respect of any 
defaultoutliers or unusual trends. Forces may then revise and re-submit the data. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRegular independent audits of police data quality, carried out by the Audit Commission, took place between 2003/04 and 2006/07. There seems to be broad agreement that such inspect
defaultions contributed to improvements in police crime recording. We understand that these audits ceased because the standard of crime recording significantly improved over the period. Since the cessation of such national audits, the HMIC has undertaken ad hoc i
defaultnspections on specific aspects of crime recording by forces
default,
default but there have not been regular independent audits of crime recording in recent years.
default&#xa0;defaultAre crimes being recorded by the police when they should be? Are crimes being categorised correctly? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt i
defaults the view of ONS that these questions can be best answered through independent audits of crime recording. 
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, an ONS analysis, published in January 2013
default, suggest
defaulted there has been
default a reduction in the consistency of crime recording in recent years.  
defaultThe analysis examined trends at a national level in crimes being recorded by the police, against those estimated by the 
defaultCrime Survey for England and Wales
default, exploring whether or not there was evidence of the two series diverging.  
default&#xa0;
defaultThe analysis suggested t
defaulthat
default,
default prior to the introduction of the NCRS
default,
default a relatively large volume of reports made by victims to the police may not have appeared in the police recorded crime series, with as much as a 50 per cent shortfall each year. A step change was seen following 
defaultth
defaulte 
defaultintroduction
default of the NCRS
default in 2002, with the volume of comparable police recorded crime close to 90 per cent of the total estimated from the survey. This relationship remained fairly consistent up until 2007/08. A consistent downward trend in the ratio bet
defaultween the two series 
defaultwas seen up to 2011/12 with the latest figures (for 2012/13) showing no change. The police recorded crime series has thus been reducing at a faster rate between 2006/07 and 2011/12 than suggested by the survey which might suggest a grad
defaultual erosion of compliance with the NCRS (see Figure 1). 
default&#xa0;
defaultFigure 1: Ratio between CSEW reported incidents and crimes recorded by the police (in comparable sub-set)defaultONS note
defaults
default that the analysis does not definitively prove 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is mis-recording of 
defaultcrime.  Nor is it able to examine the extent to which crimes
default,
default once recorded
default,
default are being categorised correctly. ONS therefore welcomes the forthcoming HMIC inspection, which will address these issues.  
default&#xa0;defaultWhat are the factors which can influence police mis-recording of crime? 
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is ONS’s view that there are a range of possible factors which may influence mis-recording of crime, including:
default&#xa0;defaultAre the right checks in place t
defaulto ensure that the systems for recording crime function effectively and accurately?  Has enough been done to ensure the integrity of crime data? What more should be done?
default&#xa0;defaultIt is the view of 
defaultONS that force crime r
defaultegistrars play an important role in ensuring 
defaultthe 
defaultintegrity of data, appointed to act as a “final arbiter for the audit process, the interpretation of the counting rules
default,
default and assigning outcomes”.
default  In a review of crime and incident reports, published in 2012, HMIC identified “an objective force crime 
defaultregistrar with strong influence over local crime recording decisions to ensure performance pressures are not unduly exerted” as one of a number of factors which contributed to forces consistently making good crime and incident recording decisions.
default At the 
defaultsame time
default,
default HMIC identified that in some forces the role of 
defaultforce crime registrar 
defaultmay not be sufficiently independent of those charged with delivering improvements in performance. 
defaultTherefore, 
defaultthe role of 
defaultthe force crime registrar 
defaultis an important one and ther
defaulte is a case for their role to be strengthened. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe process by which data supplied by police forces to the Home Office is checked and validated has been described above. The ONS undertakes further quality checks of data supplied to them by the Home Office
default for use in the National Statistics. These include checks to examine the internal consistency of the data and with previously supplied data. ONS also has representation on key Home Office working and strategic groups dealing with the police recorded crime 
defaultdata. This ensures the statisticians keep in touch with emerging issues and that the statistical implications of any changes to the series are properly considered.
default&#xa0;
defaultHowever, without regular independent audit, it is difficult to assess whether or not crime 
defaultrecording systems are functioning effectively and accurately. The ONS would like to see the forthcoming inspection carried out by HMIC repeated annually so that users of police recorded crime statistics can be informed about their accuracy.
default&#xa0;
defaultTo what extent
default can policy-makers have confidence in the statistics which result from the recording of crime by police forces?
default&#xa0;defaultThe answer to this question very much depends on what policy-makers (and other users) need the statistics for
default,
default and the extent to which recorded
default crime figures represent a good measure of the issue under consideration.  ONS analysis mentioned 
defaultabove 
defaultshowed that the downward trend in levels of recorded crime over the last decade was validated by the independent Crime Survey
default,
default and 
defaulttherefore that
default users 
defaultcan have confidence in the broad trends.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe consistency of recording is likely to vary by type of crime. For example
default,
default it is thought that the vast majority of homicides come to the attention 
defaultof
default the police and are recorded accurately. On the other hand, it is known that steps have been taken in recent years to encourage more victims of sexual offences to report crimes to the police and to improve the police handling of such matters. These are lik
defaultely to have led to more 
defaultof 
defaultsuch offences being recorded. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe statistical commentary provided by ONS aims to provide users with an indication of the quality of the statistics and us
defaulte is made of additional sources (
defaultfor example
default,
default admissions to hospital 
defaultin re
defaultlation to violent assaults)
default to verify the broad trends 
defaultshown in the
default Crime Survey and police recorded crime
default data
