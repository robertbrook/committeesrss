defaultImplementation of the cut-off provisions will be a major project. 
defaultDefra's
default estimates (in the Impact Assessment) are that there will be 20,000 additional applications, costing local authorities on average £2,900 to determine. That adds up to £58 million, with extra costs to be added for both central and local government in order-making and dealing with appeals against refused applications and with objections to orders. The total cost to the public purse could easily be £100 million. 
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuch a major project justifies proper management. But not only are there no plans in place: the provisions in the Bill for the Secretary of State's jurisdiction over applications for directions to be transferred to the courts (Schedule 6 paragraph 6(4)), and for applications to be recorded in the register only after the preliminary assessment (Schedule 6 paragraph 4) means that keeping track of what is happening will be much more difficult than would otherwise be the case.
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn the Explanatory Notes (
defaultpara
default 64) it is acknowledged that "The investigations of applications based on evidence about the position before 1949 can be very difficult for authorities". That difficulty, which will apply also to applicants, may well lead to applicants erring on the side of caution and submitting applications for routes that would not, in practice, be extinguished at the cut-off date.
defaultd)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe increased complexity of dealing with applications made after the cut-off date - judging whether a right of way existed in 1949 and, if so, whether it was extinguished at the cut-off date or whether an exemption from extinguishment applied - will give rise to increased, continuing, costs for both local and central government. 
defaulte)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 extinguished rights for mechanically-propelled vehicles in certain circumstances, essentially a trial run of similar provisions. It has led to extra work considering whether exemptions apply and several court cases on its interpretation. The greater extent and complexity of the cut-off provisions in the 2000 Act suggests that the extra work involved will be significant.
defaultf)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe main purpose of the provisions was supposed to be greater certainty. But this must be questionable, as the lack of resources means progress will be slow. 
defaultDefra
default is estimating that there will be 20,000 additional applications, which means an average of 2,000 per year. There is no evidence that authorities will be able to cope with anything like that number. If so, many thousands will remain undetermined at the cut-off date, and it will be many years before they are all resolved, with 
defaultal
default the associated uncertainty. 
defaultg)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMoreover the proposals in the Bill on preliminary assessment of applications and associated delays in recording in the register mean that many of those will be hidden from public view by not being in the public register, nor will they have been notified to landowners, with consequent implications for property sales. Furthermore the provisions do not extinguish rights over ways that might be considered to have the greatest impact on landowners - ways not presently recorded at all, but which qualify to be recorded as either byways open to all traffic or restricted byways.
defaulth)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever the Act is worded that if a footpath or bridleway that existed as a public right of way in 1949 is not recorded on the definitive map at the cut-off date it will be extinguished (unless an exemption applies). This means that in any question about the status of a way after the cut-off date the starting point is that the rights were extinguished unless it can be shown that the right of way did not exist in 1949 or that an exemption applies. The difficulty of ascertaining the status in 1949 is accepted by 
defaultDefra
default (see above): the exemptions are in section 54 of the 2000 Act (which I, as a practitioner with many years' experience, find very difficult to understand) and possibly in regulations. 
defaultDefra
default has not published any draft regulations, so it is impossible to judge what effect any regulations might have.
defaulti)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe extinguishment of footpaths and bridleways is likely to have a particular effect in urban areas, where many such ways (mostly footpaths) are often not currently recorded on definitive maps. The Act provides no exemption for ways that are in regular daily use, 
defaultnor
default for those that are maintained by the local authority at public expense, so the only certain safeguard will be recording of the way on the definitive map. I consider that there are many thousands of such ways in regular daily use by people going to school, shops, work, etc that will be put at risk by implementation of the cut-off provisions. They range from centuries-old routes in towns and cities to ways on housing estates built in the 1930s.
defaultj)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLocal authorities that are highway authorities have a duty to keep an up-to-date list of those ways that are publicly maintainable, including footpaths and bridleways. They use that information not only to plan their maintenance work, but also, for example, to answer questions related to property transfer. At the cut-off date, there will be considerable uncertainty about the status of footpaths and bridleways included in that list: do authorities amend the list, or, if they continue to maintain ways where the rights have been extinguished, will they be spending money unlawfully?
defaultk)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe implementation of the cut-off provisions does not have universal support. The Equestrian Access Forum, whose members are the British Horse Society, the Byways and Bridleways Trust, the British Driving Society, the National Federation of Bridleway Associations and the South Pennine Packhorse Trails Trust, published a report in

default"T
defaulthe Government has decided not to take forward this amendment. This means that the statutory requirement to publish certain applications in newspapers remains. It is clear from the responses that some members of the public and community groups rely on the statutory notices in newspapers to learn about planning applications in their area. The Government is not convinced that good alternative arrangements can be readily rolled out.
