[normal] The National Passenger Survey is
[normal] undertaken by Passenger Focus and comprises periodic surveys designed to collect information on satisfaction with rail services but also includes details such as journey purpose.

[normal] Note that the proportions in the graph are generally higher than those actually used in the appraisal due to the use of 
[normal]annualisation
[normal] factors to multip
[normal]ly different journey purposes to annual totals and take account of weekend and bank holiday travel.
