[normal]Existing 
[normal]evidence 
[normal]suggests that, although important
[normal], it is not 
[normal]only 
[normal]staff qualifications and staffing 
[normal]ratios that are the most important factors in determining children’s outcomes. In
[normal]stead, it is the quality of care and relationships that are central to safeguarding.
[normal] 
[normal]This practice is consistent with government reforms of social work more widely, stemm
[normal]ing from the Munro Review

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Conclusion and k[bold]ey r[bold]ecommendations[bold]&#xa0;[bold]i[bold]) Expectations on the quality of care from providers need[bold]s[bold] to be high and t[bold]here should be greater local authority accountability for the outc[bold]omes of children in their care. [bold]Informing the market about need and encouraging new entrants won’t necessarily lead to better quality care, especially if expectations of care, specifications
[normal] and contract management remain the same. 
[normal]ii) The quality of care provided by staff is about much more than qualifications. [bold]Imp
[normal]ortant
[normal] factors such as leadership and ethos, the size of the care home and the importance of staff consensus and shared working philosophy must not be overlooked and support should be provided to develop these throughout the sector.
[normal]iii[bold]) A strong parenting role [bold]among care workers is essential[bold]. [bold]This includes
[normal] activities such as discussing problems and achieving a level of relationship that is more positive than potentially deleterious ones outside of the home.
[normal]iv[bold]) [bold]Commissioning and partnership working are hugely im[bold]portant. [bold]Increased
[normal] efforts must be placed on strategies to encourage placement stability, such as efforts to retain social care staff and provide the continuity of a consistent adult figure.
[normal] 
[normal]P
[normal]lacement decisions should be based on risk assessments, which sh
[normal]ould include the children and young people already living in a placement and the impact that the ‘new’ child may have on them
[normal], given levels peer violence
[normal]. 
[normal]v) [bold]Improvement of support mechanism[bold]s[bold]. [bold]Data and evaluation should be more central to our strategy to 
[normal]evalua
[normal]te what works for care homes. There needs to be more opportunities for sharing good practice between children’s homes given the current lack of a mechanism to do this.
