[[[line (GSK) (AMR0029)]]]Summary&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; funding for Academic Centers of Antibiotic Innovation to address innovation gaps and support an open collaboration/precompetitive approach to the early AB discovery eg through Public-Private Partnerships (details in Question 6); &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a simplified regulatory environment that avoids complexity and duplication by harmonising global regulatory and legislative requirements, and unifying clinical trial guidelines and evidence standards,  to enable rapid registration of novel antibiotics; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a new economic model to incentivise investment in antibiotic R&amp;D, that does not rely on volume of sales to reward innovation – as part of this, a “Microbial Threats Reduction Fund” could be set up to support both procurement and stockpiling of new antibiotics. A key part of this new model will be to optimally balance appropriate use with global accessibility to new life saving antibiotics.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a focussed effort to design, develop and implement globally, use of effective diagnostics to guide prescribing of antibiotics and streamline AB clinical trials. We propose this could be achieved by creating a global challenge fund (details in Question 6)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a dedicated R&amp;D team focussed on antibiotics for serious and life-threatening infections. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; a leading role in partnering with public bodies to supplement our investment and improve industry efficiency and focus on key public health needs. For example we played a key role in creating the Innovative Medicine Initiative for antibiotics ‘New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs’ (ND4BB). Within this program we have created many ‘firsts’ for AB R&amp;D eg the first clinical trial consortium for antibiotics, the first semi-open innovation discovery programs, an academic consortia focused on fundamental science to increase our understanding of how to design antibiotics for Gram negatives and a consortium to investigate the economics of antibiotics and new commercial models. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; proportionate promotional activities that support the appropriate use of antibiotics, aiming to reduce resistance by ensuring that the right drug is prescribed at the right dose, for the right duration (antibiotic stewardship).  &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; ongoing efforts to engage with scientific and medical communities and share the experience we gain in our R&amp;D work, to contribute to the progress of medical science. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; in an effort to further support antibiotic stewardship initiatives, a commitment to provide data on the volume of our new antibiotics sold to healthcare institutions and support for research into the possible link between antibiotics in the environment and resistance. &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; recognising that high levels of antibiotic use in farming has the potential to cause resistance, we commit not to license our new antibiotics for agricultural use.&#xa0;1.1

[[[              ]]]This is not GSK’s core area of expertise, but we track the key trends as they   impact our R&amp;D activities, and note the following high-level points: 2.1              Significant progress has been made in understanding and tracking AMR over recent years. Surveillance systems continue to improve, genetic analysis of resistance is revealing mechanisms and the recent microbiome map is likely to contribute further to understanding of host-pathogen interactions across the range of bacterial flora.2.2              However, more needs to be done. Surveillance needs to be as global and joined up as possible. We lack a holistic view for many parts of the world and in some parts we lack even basic data. There are few studies on mortality and costs associated wtih resistance, which makes it harder to justify focussed investment in this area. Similarly, there is a lack of estimates of the value created by current antibiotics.2.3              There are significant gaps in knowledge about transmission of resistance between species and especially between agricultural animals/fish and humans. Again this makes it hard to justify policy measures to change the way antibiotics are used in farming.2.4

[[[              ]]]Surveillance that focuses on bacterial resistance, the epidemiology of bacterial infections, drug utilization and clinical outcome is needed to monitor the impact of rational prescribing programmes for both current and new antibiotic agents.  2.5              While surveillance programmes have improved dramatically in scope and quality in recent years, further progress is needed to generate resistance data and improve the relevance of that data to antibiotic usage and clinical outcome.  It is critical to identify regions with high prevalence of key MDR pathogens to support the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents and implementation of infection controls measures.  This information will be particularly crucial for new ‘limited use’ agents that will be approved with smaller clinical trial data sets. 3.1              Despite the rising concern regarding the impact of antimicrobial resistance, very few new antibiotics have been launched in recent years and future prospects are worrying due to a relatively small number of products in late-stage development. This is the result of several factors, but research and investment is generally considered to be too low.3.2              Unique scientific challenges to antibiotic R&amp;D have led to high failure rates in R&amp;D; the regulatory environment is complex and regionally divergent; and economic returns on R&amp;D investment in antibiotics are relatively low. New antibiotics should be only used to treat patients that older products can’t: the resulting low volumes and relatively low prices are not attractive for investment. Many large pharmaceutical companies have exited the area as a result, and others continue to evaluate whether to stay in. 3.3              The goal needs to be a significant increase in total R&amp;D investment in antibiotics. The comparison with HIV R&amp;D investment could be a model. Big and small companies have important roles to play, as do academic and public health researchers. The negative spiral of disinvestment, lack of academic interest and lack of products needs to be reversed.3.4              The growing threat of resistance and the complexities of this area increasingly demand a collaborative response, moving beyond the scientific community to include policy makers, healthcare funders and other stakeholders. This is not easy and requires strong political leadership. For example, given the time-lag in developing drugs, new products should be developed to treat not only today’s high need infections, but tomorrow’s infections (with emerging resistant bugs) as well. Companies need to be encouraged to invest for the future needs of societies. GSK is committed to progressing antibiotic R&amp;D through the public private partnership model and close collaboration with National and Regional public health bodies is key for success.3.5              A global strategy and co-ordinated change programme, spanning the antibiotic ecosystem, is needed. This should address the four key areas listed in page 1 of our submission.  3.6              Strong and visionary political leadership is needed to catalyse the leading nations of the world and other stakeholders to implement such a global solution. The UK has an opportunity to deliver and demonstrate leadership through implementing best practice in its domestic policies and building a global partnership. Ideas for action led by the UK follow below. We would welcome the opportunity of discussions with Government to explore these ideas.3.7              With respect to diagnostics, we recognise significant advances have been made to rapidly identify bacteria once isolated in culture from clinical specimens.  However, to make a transformational change in the appropriate use of antibiotics, new diagnostic tests are needed that will accurately identify the pathogens and/or presence of resistance mechanisms directly from clinical specimens (e.g. sputum, skin, etc.) within 20 minutes. Such diagnostics are a win-win; not only will they enable rapid identification of patients for appropriate therapy or facilitate de-escalation to a narrow spectrum agent; they may potentially decrease cost and improve efficiency of some antibiotic clinical trials thereby improving the tractability of antibiotic research and development.  4.1

[[[              ]]]Rational PrescribingThe UK Government should continue to support and strengthen current antibiotic stewardship programmes in the UK and sustain public campaigns to emphasize the growing problem of MDR pathogens.  The public (patients) can be important allies in promoting rational prescribing of precious antibiotic resources.&#xa0;4.2

[[[              ]]]Transparency for the use of new antibiotics

[[[  ]]]Enhanced transparency around the use of all antibiotics is needed, but especially those approved with limited data. To this end, GSK has committed to providing data on the volume of our new antibiotics sold to healthcare institutions, in a manner to be determined.&#xa0; We realise this information could only be useful in conjunction with other data relevant to rational prescribing, but we hope this commitment will initiate a dialogue on the need for increased transparency and evidenced-based approaches on the use of new antibiotics.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]4.3

[[[              ]]]Antibiotics approved with limited data

[[[&#xa0;]]]GSK supports ‘limited data’ development programmes to bring new antibiotics as quickly as possible to patients for whom there are few, if any, alternatives.  GSK proposes the need to modify existing rational prescribing programmes to support the use of drugs approved in this way, to include:&#xa0;4.4              Sponsors such as GSK should continue to work with all stakeholders to support appropriate use programmes for its antibiotics, and actively engage in training relevant stakeholders on the appropriate use of its new antibiotics. This training should include a review of the intended utilization of the new agent, the clinical data, limitations of the clinical data with regard to safety and efficacy; the general concept of ‘limited data’ label, and how benefit/risk is only supported by adhering to the clearly labelled constraints outlined. For products approved with limited data sets or restricted labels, companies could be held accountable to educate/certify programmes and identify appropriate physician prescribers, although physicians may not believe that companies should play such a role.  

[[[&#xa0;]]]&#xa0;5.1              As we have already outlined above, GSK believes that progress in addressing antimicrobial resistance can only be achieved through a coordinated global strategy as the good work of a government in one part of the world could be compromised if another is disengaged. Many of the challenges outlined are global; bacteria and resistance has been shown to spread rapidly with no boundaries; drug development is done globally, as is the link between global volume of use of a product and resistance to it, etc. These challenges would be addressed most effectively by Global solutions, for example: 5.2              The UK has started to play a vital leadership role on these global issues and we strongly support the development of a WHO Resolution, prominent advocacy at global meetings such as the WISH Summit, Chatham House and others. In addition we would call on UK Government to do more to lead progress in the following important areas:&#xa0;6.1              The 5 year Strategy is a useful step to define clear areas of policy development to recognise and address the challenges of increased AMR. GSK is encouraged to see that the value we can bring to the problem is well understood. This is explicitly reflected in terms of adding to the scientific research base, developing new products (traditional antibiotics, vaccines, novel therapeutic approaches and diagnostics).6.2              However, many of the recommendations are too high-level to be actionable at this point. We understand that processes are being designed to develop this thinking further and we look forward to being involved.6.3              We highlight 3 high priority areas where a real focus would enable UK to demonstrate global leadership and create a step-change in the way new antibiotics are discovered, developed and used.6.4              UK Government could endorse the need for, and principles of, a new economic model and actively advocate with other like-minded Governments for consensus. Sweden, Netherlands, US, France, Denmark and Norway would be likely targets. 6.5              This coalition should then develop and seed fund a platform that other Governments and funders can subscribe to, and commit to conducting a feasibility pilot on a suitable product. Part of this process would involve active participation from relevant UK Government stakeholders in the key initiatives trying to progress the principles and design for such a model. There are many challenges to overcome, but clear endorsement and a focussed effort followed by some kind of pilot would give us all the best chance of success.&#xa0;6.6              By consolidating funds from multiple public partners (eg MRC, DTRA, BARDA, NIH, EC, IMI, Wellcome, DARPA etc)  and governments to create a global prize for a transformational diagnostic that will diagnose the causative pathogen of pneumonia within 20 minutes of a physician consult. Not only would such a diagnostic be transformational for appropriate use, but it would also enable highly targeted clinical trials that will decrease trial size and costs and make antibiotic R&amp;D more attractive for investment. This is a win:win for society. However, such a diagnostic will need to be very rapid, cheap and accurate, and several technical challenges need to be overcome. Sufficient market financial incentives are lacking and we believe progress would be achieved via a substantial prize in excess of $50-100M.   6.7              The vast majority of R&amp;D effort up to this point has been focussed on the ‘small molecule - kill the bug’ paradigm – which we,  and others,  know from extensive experience has substantial challenges (we have openly published our experience from 70 high throughput screens, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 

[[[6]]], 29-40,  2007). We believe that more focus should be put on exploring and robustly validating non-traditional and innovative approaches such host targets, new modalities, phage, biofilm approaches etc. The best place for this to happen is in academia so we propose funding should be available to create ‘Academic Centres of Antibiotic Innovation’ in UK universities with expertise in the area. The collective resources/scientists of the university could work with pharma to validate and progress some of these novel non traditional approaches. We also think the entire area of antibiotic discovery from ‘Target’ to ‘Lead identification’ could be precompetitive/ open innovation and these academic centres could be the catalyst for this fundamental change.November 2013&#xa0; providing there are no legal constraints preventing us from doing so
