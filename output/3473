default defaultand
default defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault, Head of Crown Dependencies, Overseas Territories and Visits Team, Ministry of Justice
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default 
defaultLord McN
defaultally and
default 
defaultCathryn
default Hannah, welcome to our session this morning. I 
defaultam going to
default do something unusual by saying that
default,
default in our discussions with all the Crown Dependencies
default,
default we have had many favourable reports of the way in which the Ministry of Justice has implemented our previous report and in particular the way in which both
default you,
default Lord McNally
default,
default as Minister
default,
default and you, Ms Hannah, as the civil servant in charge
default,
default have been helpful and co
default&#x2011;
defaultoperative to the Dependencies. 
defaultIt
default does not mean that there are not issues and grievances, but in many fields remarks are not prefaced with friendly tributes to Ministers and civil servants of the kind that we have heard on quite a few occasions. 
default 
defaultWhat
default resources are
default the Department devoting to this, bearing in mind that our previous report indicated that you were going to have problems with the resources and
default,
default therefore
default,
default you should trim the activity to fit the resource?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: 
defaultCathryn
default runs a very small department. Since 2010 the Ministry of Justice has had to cut back, i
defaultnitially, in the first spending r
defaulteview by 23%
default, and in a subsequent review
default by 10%. That has meant that we h
defaultave had to employ a leaner team,
default able
default, 
defaultwe hope
default,
default 
defaultto 
defaultdeliver more for less, but I do not think that there have been pressures on delivery that have affected our performance. I
default do not know whether 
defaultCathryn
default would like to say anything.
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: That is 
defaultright. We have tried to 
defaultstreamline our focus on the areas where we, as the Ministry of Justice, demonstrably add value and are the core of the constitutional relationship. That has meant that, as you have noted, the relationships with the Crown Dependencies have improved and at the same time 
defaultso has 
defaultthe quality of the service we 
defaultprovide
default. We have a small team
default,
default but it is a team that works well and is adequately resourced for what we are doing. We also have access to lawyers, some of whom are here today, who work on Crown Dependency issues and are able to provide a quick and efficient service.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: We took up one of the key recommendations of your 2010 report,
default which was to not make the MO
defaultJ the solver of every problem and the dealer 
defaultwith
default every issue. We have 
defaultbecome
default very adep
defaultt at identifying the individual and
default the Department where the solution to a problem is
default,
default directing the Crown Dependency there
default,
default and making sure that the response 
defaultis
default a positive one. Within a few weeks of taking office as the Minister in 2010, the Prime Minister gave me clearance to write to every ministerial lead to say that it was expec
defaultted that they should have cognis
defaultance of the problems or issues relating to the Crown Dependencies and 
defaultshould 
defaultbe expecting to give them access. In the main that has worked.
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultWe will explore that in more detail, but perhaps I could ask what you feel you have done 
defaultwhich
default guarantees that this kind of relationship can continue with future changes of office holder, both ministerial and civil service?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: I always emphasise 
defaultthat 
defaultall Ministers are birds of passage and, of course, sometimes lead officials in Departments have other priorities, but I do think that we have set in place contacts and relationships and a template for working
default,
default which anybody following me or following 
defaultCathryn
default will be able to take forward. I have been assiduous in my visits to all the Dependencies. I have made sure that
default,
default when Ministers from the Dependencies have been in 
defaultLondon
default, my door is always open as far as they are concerned. As I said before, we have also put in place with the Cabinet Office a guidance note for Departments on how they should treat the Dependencies. If points have arisen where they seem to be overlooked
default,
default I have intervened either by phoning or writing to Ministers concerned, saying, 
default“
defaultCan I remind you that the Prime Minister has asked that you give this priority
default?”
default Usually, that little nudge has been enough to get the wheels turning.
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultCorbyndefault: defaultGoing back to the point tha
defaultt Sir Alan raised a moment ago, 
defaulthow are you prioritising constitutional issues over day
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultday issues and how are you going to make sure that continues in the future
default,
default because clearly that is 
defaultyour
default direction of 
defaulttravel 
defaultat the moment?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: 
defaultWith regard to t
defaulthe constitutional issues, such as they are, one of the problems 
defaultwas that
default I discovered 
defaultthat a goodly number of M
defaultembers of both Houses thought that the Crown Dependencies were colonies a
defaultnd—
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultCorbyndefault: defaultIt shows the need for constitutional education, does it not?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: It certainly does. 
defaultThey thought that I was somehow Governor-
defaultGeneral and I could issue orders
default,
default and the orders had to be obeyed 
defaultand so on
default. One of the points that I constantly made
default when meeting parliamentary colleagues wa
defaults that both the 
defaultKilbrandon
default Report over 50 years ago and this Committee three years ago were very careful in pointing out that our constitutional r
defaultesponsibilities were supportive; t
defaulthey were not dictatorial. That I have tried to do. In the main, the constitutional relationship is in good shape and it is a matter of seeing where issues arise in the case of some of the bigger Dependencies, their desire for an international profile, representation at major conferences 
defaultand so on
default. We are looking at that and working with them on that. 
defaultThe other is m
defaultuch more, as you say, the bread-and-
defaultbutter
default,
default day
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultday problems of dealing with 
defaultWhitehall
default. Those we try to deal with on a case-by-
defaultcase basis
default—
defaultas I say, not getting embroiled a
defaults the MOJ
default but using our knowledge of the 
defaultWhitehall
default machine to help the Dependencies to get to the right desk and the right decision maker.
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultCorbyndefault: defaultIs that working?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: I think so. 
defaultSir Alan made the point
default that
default,
default certainly
default,
default the relations we have had over the last three and a half years have been very constructive
default,
default but, 
defaultas with
default all these things, it is like a good marriage; it has to be worked at. It is not a finished product
default; i
defaultt is work in progress. Therefore, if ever I leave a note for my successor
default,
default it will be to k
defaulteep working at the relationship and
default make sure the lines of communication are open. It is not a fixed
default settlement. It is, as I say, 
defaultwork in progress.
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultCorbyndefault:default 
defaultCathryn
default, do you feel the same on this?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: 
defaultAbsolutely. 
defaultOn the constitutional day
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default&#x2011;
defaultday business such as the legislation, because now we have established processes in place that we 
defaulthave 
defaultworked very hard to agree with the Crown Dependencies, it is something that is quite stable. For example, there is no backlog of Crown Dependency legislation any more. Legislation is dealt with in an average of 20 working days and usually for the next Privy Council sitting
default, and t
defaulthat is something that the team and lawyers and Ministers are very keen to continue, so we have that kind of process that works. Because there is no backlog
default,
default it is a lot easier to deal with legi
defaultslation as and when it comes in. 
defaultBy focusing on what really counts and streamlining the relationship
default,
default we have been able to make progress that is sustainable and will continue.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: That is the key
default,
default though, Sir Alan. When we came 
defaultin, 
defaultI found that within the Ministry of Justice we had lawyers second
default&#x2011;
defaultguessing Crown Dependency lawyers. One of the things that has struck me is the very high quality of lawyers and civil servants within the Crown Dependencies. In reality, second
default&#x2011;
defaultguessing them was paternalistic and unnecessary.
defaultChair: defaultIt
default was an 
defaultexplicit recommendation of ours
default that you should not do that. We will return to the legislative timetable in just a moment.
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultCould I ask a question about the generic relationship between the 
defaultUK
default and the CDs
default?
default As I understand it
default, your task is twofold:
default on the one hand
default,
default 
defaultit is 
defaultto mediate directly between the 
defaultUK
default and the Crown Dependencies
default,
default and
default,
default 
defaulton
default the other
default,
default 
defaultit is to facilitate
default direct c
defaultontact with other Departments. D
defaulto you think you have the balance of those dual imperatives right?
default&#xa0;defaultLord McNallydefault: Yes, I think so. When I first thought through what the job entailed
default,
default I did think that part of my job was going to be to make sure that they got the right kind of access to the benefit of both. I appreciate that
default, if a
default Department is working on a mass
defaultive piece of legislation such as a 180-
defaultclause Bill dealing with all of the UK or even England and Wales, the priority it gives to how that legislation may affect the Crown Dependencies will not 
defaultbe at the top of their list or
default 
defaultat 
defaultthe top of ministerial lists, but in the Crown Dependencies it is 
defaultat 
defaultthe top of their list
default.
default 
defaultT
defaultherefore
default,
default it is
default about
default how we get them both together without the Department saying, 
default“
defaultWho are these people? Why are they bothering us?
default”
default, making them understand that part of their key core responsibilit
defaulties
default is to make sure that that legislation works with the Crown Dependencies and 
defaulthas
default a point of entry early enough in the development of policy to have awareness. 
defaultHas that always worked? No, it has not
default,
default but, as I say, this is why it is work in progress. We have had the odd slip
default—t
defaulthere was a great deal of concern about value added tax being applied to certain products from the Crown Dependencies with little or no notice
default. It
default is that kind of surprise and shock that I have been trying to iron out of the system. I also see, as well, my responsibility as a candid friend. I have consistently said to the Crown Dependencies that they have to meet their critics
default—and 
defaultthey have their critics
default—
defaultby running a tight ship, acting with 
defaulttransparency and in accordance with all the rules and regulations of whatever field of endeavour that they are working in. Again, my impression is that that ambition is shared by the Crown Dependencies. I have said consist
defaultently to them that
default there is no advantage in them pushing the envelope and getting involved in areas of activity 
defaultthat
default 
defaultcause them 
defaultreputational damage.
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultWhen we visited the Dependencies
default,
default they felt a little bit hurt at some of the comments that came out of No.
default&#xa0;
default10 and the Treasury about taxation issues. Do you think they were justified in feeling aggrieved?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: A little bit. Again, that was an example where we have made rapid p
defaultrogress. I have worked with No. 
default10
default,
default and I know it is highly unlikely that in planning some statement by the Prime Minister someone around the table is going to say, 
default“
defaultIs this going to affect the Crown Dependencies, Prime Minister?
default”
default Somehow we have to build that in. What has been good is that
default,
default since we had a couple of incidences where the Prime Minister was showing you his determination to address financ
defaultial service regulation globally
default 
defaultand
default the Crown Dependencies thought that they were being unnecessarily fingered, No. 10 and the Treasury have become much more aware and the Chief Ministers of the Crown Dependencies were invited over for discussions. There has been a lot more communication with them about the determination of the Government to address weaknesses in global governance of the financial sector. 
defaultI have also said to them
default—
defaultpushing at an open door
default—
defaultthat they are now living in a world where the world community is looking at tightening financial regulations and it is in their best interest
defaults
default to be part of that process of transparency and accounta
defaultbility. That is the right thing: w
defaulte are aware of their concerns
default,
default but they see themselves playing a constructive and positive part in a direction of travel 
defaultto 
defaultwhich all the major countries are now committed in terms of transparency and accountability and financial services.
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultIn the light of 
defaultt
defaulthe fact that there were those discussions, if these remarks were careless or inaccurate
default,
default do you think that that has damaged the relationship between the UK and the Crown Dependencies
default,
default or has that been overcome by these discussions?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: I hope not. The Crown Dependencies have certainly expressed thanks for the way that the Prime Minister has handled recent multinational G8 and G20 meetings. The nature of the relationship is 
defaultthat 
defaultsometimes they will say things or do things that upset us
default,
default and, dealing with 
defaultWhitehall
default, some Department will drop the ball or do something that is high
default&#x2011;
defaulthanded. What I hope we have established is a basis of trust between us so that if something does happen we can quickly move to repair it without any lasting damage. 
defaultCathryn
default has worked extremely hard at that
default,
default making sure that there have been seminars and workshops with the 
defaultCrown Dependency civil servants
default 
defaultand 
defaultcivil servants coming into 
defaultWhitehall
default to get a better understanding of how 
defaultWhitehall
default works. That is a process that I would like to see continue and develop
default,
default because the more they have civil servants who understand how the 
defaultWhitehall
default machine works the better. Of course, 
defaultif 
defaultWhitehall
default civil servants have somebody 
defaultcome over 
defaultfrom Jersey
default,
default Guernsey or the 
defaultIsle of Man
default, it sticks in their mind that there is that administration with those issues that they have to keep in sight when they are developing policy.
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultFinally, has anything arisen since the 2010 repor
defaultt that would cause you to think w
defaulte need a review of the constitutional relationship, or are we as we were?
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: No, I do not think so. The constitutional relationship is 800 years old. I was just checking that it was King John
default,
default who usually gets a bad press, who gave the seal to the 
defaultChannel Islands
default relationship. No, it works
default,
default and I believe it is as strong 
defaultas 
defaultor stronger than it ever was. As long as the We
defaultstminster Government appreciate and understand
default t
defaulthe nature of that relationship—
defaultthat they are not colonies and cannot be browbeaten and bullied but have to be t
defaultaken into account and discussed with—
defaultand as long as they realise that they have responsibilities both to the United Kingdom and the global community in the observance of treaties
default,
default agreements and such, it is a solid relationship and one that I do not see needs any tinkering with in any fundamental way.
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultSteve Brine: defaultWe 
defaulthave 
defaulttouched on some of this but maybe we can just explore it a bit more
default with 
defaultCathryn
default. 
defaultI
defaultnitiatives have been undertaken recen
defaulttly to look at the consultation on
default 
defaultUK
default legislative initiatives and how they affect the Dependencies. Lord McNally, you mentioned people being seconded and we know that somebody was seconded from 
defaultJersey
default to the MO
defaultJ over the turn of the last year, but what recent initiatives can you expand on for us that have sought to improve the mu
defaulttual understanding between the D
defaultependencies and the UK Departments?  I notice there is this legislative checklist, which you would 
defaultthink is a bit of an obvious no-
defaultbrainer
default,
default bu
defaultt clearly it has
default been falling down somewhere. 
defaultCould you expand on that?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: Sure. The Cabinet Office have their legislative checklist
default—t
defaulthe most recent one was published in July of this year
default. I
defaultt is a useful starting point because it shows Departments what their 
defaultobligations
default are to Crown Dependencies in relation to consulting on 
defaultUK
default legislation. That seems to work quite well. There is an obligation, therefore, to show that they have consulted the Crown Dependencies before a bit of legislation can go through Parliament. 
defaultW
defaulte have tried to help that along by creating 
default“
defaulthow
default&#x2011;
defaultto
default”
default notes for other Departments that explain what their role is
default,
default how they can perform it and what support they can get both in terms of UK legislation that may affect the Crown Dependencies and also the extension of international instruments. We have had feedback both from the Crown Dependencies and 
defaultfrom Government Departments that t
defaulthey find that really useful
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte are trying
default to
default make it as easy as possible for another Government Department to understand what they need to do and how they need to do it. If it is complicated
default,
default it gets put to the bottom of the pile. If it is easy and it is explained
default,
default it is a lot easier for them to know who to contact. Again, it is about
default building these direct official-to-
defaultofficial conversations between the Crown Dependencies and the Departments.
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultSteve Brine: defaultJersey
default said it was better than it used to be, which is as good a ringing endorsement as you get with an official term. Anecdotally, from your point of view working 
defaultin
default it, 
defaulth
defaultow often is that step still missed out? Why is it not a lot better than it used to be?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It seems to be a lot better. We do have occasions where, for legacy issues, they are something we have been working on for a long time. Then
default,
default as Lord McNally said, 
defaultthere 
defaultwe are trying to ensure that remedies happen as quickly as possible so
default,
default if a mistake has been made
default,
default you deal with it and make sure that it does not have any lasting damage. A good example of where it has worked well,
default for example, is the Home Office B
defaultill at the moment on immigration, which obviously 
defaultis being
default done to a tight time
default 
defaultscale. 
defaultT
defaulthe Home Office officials 
defaultme
defaultt very early with the Crown Dependencies, explain
defaulted
default what they are doing, explain
defaulted
default how it is going to work and explain
defaulted
default what time
default 
defaultscale they had to engage with the Crown Dependencies, which was tight, but at least the Crown Dependencies knew about it, knew it was coming, 
defaultand 
defaultknew who to engage with. Again, the feedback we had from the Crown Dependencies is they really appreciated
default that kind of direct engagement. S
defaulto we are getting a lot more Departments proactively coming to us 
defaultasking
default how 
defaultthey
default engage with the Crown Dependencies on these things.
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultSteve Brine: defaultMaybe this is a
default question for you, Lord McNally. W
defaulthat scope is there for Ministers when they go into a Department new? Far be it for me to suggest that a Minister is merely reshuffled into his or her new Department without a full knowledge of that Department and what goes on in that Department, but what scope is there for Ministers to be better
default informed on
default that, because
default,
default ultimately
default,
default it is up
default to Ministers to ask civil servants
default ques
defaulttions as well as the other way 
defaultround, is it not?
default&#xa0;defaultLord McNallydefault: It is indeed
default,
default but you have described exactly the British system
default.
default  
defaultSteve Brine: defaultI know
default.
defaultLord McNallydefault: First of all
default,
default you are briefed, as I was in 2010, about the relationship. I wa
defaults probably as ignorant as most M
defaultembers of Parliament in either House about the precise relationship and the difference between the Crown Dependencies and the 
defaultOverseas
default 
defaultTerritories
default. For the first few weeks I had colleagues in both Houses congratulating me on being able to visit all those tropical islands that we have dotted around the world. I had to explain to them
default,
default no, no, those are overseas territories. The Crown Dependencies are the 
defaultChannel Islands
default and the Isle of Man.
defaultSteve Brine: defaultNew members to this Committee usually ask the Chairman that same question
default.
defaultLord McNallydefault: 
defaultWhen are we going? 
defaultMy greatest insult to the Isle of Man was when I said to them that they were all right in their relationship with me because I always considered them a little 
defaultbit of Lancashire in the 
defaultIrish s
defaultea
default. I then got a history lesson on their Viking past and how they had nothing to do with 
defaultLancashire
default.
defaultChair: defaultI am surprised you have managed to live that down
default.
defaultLord McNallydefault: Hopefully, any Minister who does follow me wil
defaultl take the same decision as me: 
defaultthat this is not a peripheral part of their responsibilities
default. It is 
defaulta key part
default,
default and I saw it from day one, to try and understand the issues and 
defaultto 
defaulttake bo
defaultth sides of the job as I saw it.
default 
defaultOne was
default to make sure
default,
default where they were running into problems in dealing with Government, in 
defaultWhitehall
default or 
defaultBrussels
default, that I would try and be a facilitator in making sure that they had access to the right people, to the right Depa
defaultrtment, at the appropriate time. The second was
default to be the candid friend, to make it 
defaultso 
defaultthat this
default 
defaultwas not a one
default&#x2011;
defaultway street; if they were going to have good relations with the Westminster Government and with this Parliament
default,
default then they had to show 
defaultthat they were
default aware and alert to their responsibilities in this world community. I have been willing to do that at times to make sure 
defaultthat, 
defaultmostly willingly, they responded to a realisation that in a globalised world you have to be able to play constructively and to guard your representation if you are going to succeed.
defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultGareth Johnson: defaultC
defaultould 
defaultI
default ask you a couple of questions surrounding the issue o
defaultf Royal Assent for legislation?
default I took part in the trip to the 
defaultIsle of Man
default and they were very pleased with the progress that had been made in expediting legislation. 
defaultW
defaulthat 
defaultis 
defaultthe current timetable that you 
defaulthave for achieving Royal Assent
default and 
defaultdoes it differ
default between the various different Crown Dependencies?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: Our part in the process does not differ in terms of the time
default 
defaultscales. As I mentioned earlier, the average is very much that legislation is dealt with within a month and usually for the next Privy Council. What does delay it and where there is a slight difference is the fact that for a lot of Jersey and Guernsey legislation it has to go through the Privy Council time
default scales, which
default are roughly nine a year
default,
default and over the summer and the winter period there can be quite a gap between the Privy Councils, which is one of the reasons we have suggested to Jersey and Guernsey 
defaultthat 
defaultthey might want to look at the Isle of Man model, which is that by prerogative order the Lieutenant
default&#x2011;
defaultGovernor
default of the Isle of Man can sign off certain legislation that does not affect the constitutional
default relationship for Royal Assent. S
defaulto the 
defaultsame process in the MOJ 
defaultis followed
default,
default but the end part of it is quicker because there is not the delay brought about by Privy Councils. We understand this is something that Jersey and 
defaultGuernsey
default are considering
default,
default but it is ultimately down to them whether they want to take this forward or not.
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultMoving to that timetable, do you think that there is room for improvement still, even with the Isle of Man system
default,
default which seems to be the most expeditious system of the Crown Dependencies? Do you think there is any room for improvement still further?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: In terms of 
defaultour role
default, we have streamlined 
defaultit 
defaultas far as it can go. Our lawyers do need to review the legislation. The Royal Assent memorandums are incredibly useful for them in terms of showing how the legislation is compatible with ECHR requirements and also 
defaulthow it 
defaultfits in with constitutional relationships, which enables an effective review from our lawyers, but that process still needs to happen. As I said, to be honest
default,
default it is fairly quick now anyway. 
defaultM
defaultost legislation is submitted up to Ministers and so forth
default 
defaultin a matter of weeks, so it is probably as quick as it can be.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: 
defaultI
defaultn 2010 there was a backlog
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaultthat was a real
defaultly
default serious reason for criticism. We have clea
defaultred the backlog; we have the 20-
defaultday target
default; and t
defaulthey are looking at a move to the 
defaultIsle of Man
default procedure, which 
defaultI think 
defaultmakes sense. I would think it worth this Committee looking again in three years
default’
default time
default—
defaultI would not like to start pulling up the plant to see if the roots are growing too soon. We are on a good trajectory as far as dealing with these matters 
defaultis concerned 
defaultand I do not see any obvious further initiatives
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte also have to remember that
default,
default if we 
defaulthad got
default this wrong in terms of 
defaultUK
default terms, in 
defaultWestminster
default terms, you would have the relevant Minister down here immediately to ask why this was not spotted or why we allowed this to go through. It is a mutually dependent relationship and what happens in the Crown Dependencies does splash over into our reputation, so we have a responsibility to make sure that 
defaulttheir legislation passes muster
default but with as light a touch as we possibly can.
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultIt seems it has been quite a success story
default 
defaultthus far. I know when we 
defaultwere speaking with the legislatu
defaultr
defaulte
default in the 
defaultIsle of Man
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthey were very frustrated. In the p
defaultast there had been delays of 12 to 
default18 months or so
default, and
default I unde
defaultrstand that,
default when this Committee previously visited the Isle of Man
default,
default this problem was flagged up to that Committee and recommendations were made to your Department that this be sorted out. It seems as though, 
defaultby 
defaultand large, that has happened. I
defaultt does
default,
default I suppose
default,
default give an example of 
defaultwhere, 
defaultif there are good communications taking place
default,
default you can actually make sure that there is benefit for all.  
default&#xa0;
defaultLord McNallydefault: I am not going to be accused of flattering this Committee, which I know is far too mature to be flattered, but
default,
default for students of Government and governance
default,
default the interrelationship between the Department and this Committee is a good case study
default.
default 
defaultY
defaultour 2010 report set a number of tasks
default,
default which, to answer your question, made it easier for me to know where my priorities should be. If you look at your 2010 report and see where we have addressed our emphasis and work
default,
default it is a good way of working, as far as the Department is concerned, to take a Select Committee report and to go through it in terms of implementation.
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultOne of the things we did pick up, though, is that sometimes delay occurs in the legislative timetable and it is not clear why the delay is occurring. Bearing in mind past experience of delays 
defaultthat
default have been effectively caused by a bargaining situation, where the UK Government 
defaultare
default not approving legislation because 
defaultthey want
default something else to be agreed to, that experience leads people to wonder what is happening this time. If they are able to pick up the phone and talk to officials it has been much easier to resolve those questions, but is it 
defaultnot
default important to make sure that if there is a reason for delay everybody knows what the reason is?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: Absolutely. I hope there are not too many cases where that is not the case. We definitely encourage them. In fact our lawyers
default—Ruth is behind me—are
default in contact with lawyer
defaults in the Crown Dependencies and, 
defaultif we do have an issue with 
defaulta
default law
default,
default the first step is to pick up the phone to the law offices in the Crown Dependencies and get them to talk through and explain where they are coming from on the law
default. S
defaulto, rather than going through formal letters and e
default&#x2011;
defaultmails that can take time, it is picking up the
default phone, one official to another or
default one lawyer to another
default,
default to try and resolve an issue.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: I have to say
default that
default I am not aware of any delay that has been beca
defaultuse of that kind of bargaining—
defaultcertainly not in the last three and a half years. I would not support such a way of going about business.
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultWould it make much practical difference if Jersey
default,
default Guernsey
default,
default Sark and Alderney moved to the Isle of Man system
default,
default where the Lieutenant
default&#x2011;
defaultGovernor
default in most cases, as it were, delivers the Assent, or would that be more a difference of perception than reality in the process that has to take place?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It depends. Over the summer it could well. For example, the last Privy Council is in July and, by the time we have organised papers and everything
default,
default you are looking a few weeks before then and then the next one is not until October. If something comes to us at the end of June
default,
default it might not get to a Privy Council until October, whereas
default,
default if you had the option of going to the Lieutenant
default&#x2011;
defaultGovernor
default,
default the authorities on the island could then prioritise the last part of it in t
defaulterms of it getting Royal Assent. S
defaulto it could make a difference of a couple of months in the summer period.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: If Jersey and Guernsey came to us and said, 
default“
defaultWe would like to go over to the 
defaultIsle of Man
default system
default,”
default they would not have any objections at our end. Just instinctively, it sounds like it would work better.
defaultChair: defaultTurning to another area in which there are delays, Mr de Bois.
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultI just want to touch on the extension of international instruments to Crown Dependencies. Basically, if I am reading what they are saying so far, the Crown Dependencies seem broadly content with the processes for our insular legislation, but for treaty extensions do you first of all accept that there are delays before we examine what they may be?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannah:default Yes.
defaultNick de Bois:default Good. Okay, that is easy. That is the shortest answer.
defaultChair: defaultIt is a good short answer. We will stick with that.
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultWe will now flatter our witnesses
default.
default One of the reasons I want to explore 
defaultthis 
defaultis 
defaultthat 
defaultthe Ministry of Justice seem to have accepted that the Crown Dependencies are fundamentally capable of carrying out, shall we say, relevant legal scrutiny, but
default,
default it is suggested
default,
default the Foreign Office do not and therefore that is a precursor to delay. Is that a fair assessment?
default&#xa0;
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It is not the Foreign Office so much as the fact that treaties are owned by different Departments, so a treaty on intellectual property would be IPO and BIS. One of the things we are doing at the moment is working with the Crown Dependencies to try and work out what information they need to provide to Departments to make sure it is consistent in terms of their legislation
default—
defaultit makes them com
defaultpliant with international treaties
default so it can be extended. 
defaultSalma
default in my team ran a workshop over the summer with the Crown Dependencies to look at this issue and work out wh
defaultat information Departments need and
default how the Crown Dependencies can best give their Departments that information. We are trying to take a very collaborative approach with the Crown Dependencies so that we can agree a process that the Departments will be happy with and 
defaultthat 
defaultgives them that important ability to check that the Crown Dependencies are compliant with an international treaty
default,
default but, equally, does not second
default&#x2011;
defaultguess and does not end up being a forensic redoing of the work that the law office
defaults within the Crown Dependencies have done. 
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultIs there any chance of an overlap here? It might be something that goes to another Department, another Ministry
default,
default but because it is international does it then have to go through 
defaultthe 
defaultFCO? Do they always want right of oversight because it is international? Is that perhaps where there is
default—
default 
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It has to go through 
defaultthe 
defaultFCO to get the formal extension of the treaty, which is part of the process. We are obviously working with the FCO and looking at the whole process, but it will always need to go to the Department
default which
default owns the subject matter to check compliance because they will be the expert in that area.
defaultQ22 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultSorry to press you;
default it is just my understanding. You think that maybe it is other Departments not accepting that they would have had the ability to do the legal scrutiny
default as well as, for example, the MOJ do.
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It is about them understanding what their obligation is and how they can best go about doing the scrutiny. There is an onus on the Crown Dependencies as well to provide the right kind of information to the Department to make it as easy as possible for them to understand how their laws are compliant. As I said, this is something that we are 
defaultworking with the Crown Dependencies on to try and make sure the process is effective and 
defaultwe are 
defaultdoing it in a collaborative way. The feedback we have had thus far from the Crown Dependencies is 
defaultthat 
defaultthey really appreciate that collaborative working to try and resolve the issue, rather than us com
defaulting up with a solution in the MO
defaultJ and then
default we foist it on to them.
defaultQ23 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultAbsolutely, and t
defaulthat seems very constructive. I understand that 
defaultGuernsey
default have recommended, if you like, presumption of consent to extension of treaties. Their argument is that that will vastly improve the process without, if you like, upsetting any constitutional arrangements. Do you share that view or 
defaultare 
defaultyou working on that view? Is there an acceptance of that?
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: The 
defaultUK
default is ultimately responsible for any treaty that is entered into and then extended to the Crown Dependencies
default. S
defaulto we, as the UK Government, need to satisfy ourselves that the Crown Dependency 
defaultconcerned is suitably compliant.
default 
defaultW
defaulte might not be fully satisfying ourselves 
defaultwith a presumption of consent, 
defaultbut we want to ensure that it is a risk
default-
defaultbased proportionate response to that compliance check and it is not redoing the work that very competent law officers within the Crown Dependencies have done.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: There is a point here that what the Crown Dependencies do and how they do it, particularly in the international sphere, carries a reputational risk for the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default as a whole. Therefore, I suspect that in 
defaultthe 
defaultinternational dimension there will always be a little bit of time delay as opposed to the purely insular legislation that we do. We can do it very quickly in relation to Government Departments and the Crown Dependencies, but this is where I am the candid friend the other way. We, the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default, have a reputation and responsibilities to safeguard and we will need time to make sure that where the Crown Dependencies are acting on the international stage we will want to
default—
default 
defaultQ24 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultI totally understand that point and
default where you are coming from. You think that extending this to international instruments, by definition
default,
default is going to have a default delay that the in
defaultsular legislation won’t have.
default It is just a question of trying to reduce that.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: That is it exactly
default,
default but, again, judge us by our actions. I positively encouraged them to open an office in 
defaultBrussels
default so that they could keep apace. Indeed, I have encouraged them to open an office in the City of 
defaultLondon
default.
default 
defaultQ25 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultI think we
default will be coming on to that a little later. 
defaultI have 
defaultj
defaultust one final
default question. H
defaultave you given any consideration to granting the same status to the matrix of compliance prepared by law officers in the case for treaty extension to the explanatory memorandum proposed to accompany insular legislation? Again, it is another parallel with the insular legislation.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: The compliance matrix, like the Royal Assent amendment, is the most important starting point for the Department reviewing the compliance to the treaty. This is why we are working with the Crown Dependencies at the moment
default to make sure we get that right and i
defaultt has the kind of information the Departments need to make those kinds of decisi
defaultons so that they are not second-
defaultguessing
default. S
defaulto, yes, the compliance matrix could be a useful mec
defaulthanism for that.
defaultQ26 default&#xa0; 
defaultNick de Bois: defaultWill
default it be a dynamic document? I know for years, before I came in
defaultto this place, compliance matric
defaultes
default,
default once started
default,
default are great but they can be very poor finishers if they are not adapted and developed. I am sure it is good practice to review that.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It cannot be a “one size fits 
defaultall
default”
default because all treaties are very different.
defaultNick de Bois: defaultExactly.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: It is a case of having a rough idea of what needs to be included and that the law officers in the Crown Dependencies feel confident enough to know 
defaultthat what 
defaultinformation they 
defaultput
default in will suit the Department. This, again, comes back to the most important part of this process, which is the engagement between the Crown D
defaultependency and the Department that
default owns the treaty so 
defaultthat 
defaultthey can have that dialogue and discussion and, also, forewarn Departments that they may wish in a few months
default’
default time to have a 
defaultcertain treaty extended to them,
default they are doing the work on this treaty
default and this is
default what 
defaultthey
default are looking at
default. T
defaulthat can be factored in as well to the Department
default’
defaults resources so that they know in three months
default’
default time 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are going to get this request for an extension of the treaty and they can prepare for it in terms of resources. This is part of the process we are looking at 
defaultat
default the moment to try and make it as useful as possible.
defaultQ27 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultOne
default of the problem areas seems to be bilateral investment treaties where the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default has ceded competence to the EU under the Lisbon Treaty but the Dependencies have to replace old treaties in those areas. My suspicion is
default—
defaulttell me if I am wrong
default—
defaultthat it is 
defaultnot any nefarious plot anywhere;
default it is just that a Jersey bilateral investment treaty is low down the in
default&#x2011;
defaulttray
default of some busy official somewhere. These are things 
defaultthat
default appear very minor to the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default but are central to the trading activities of the Dependencies.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: Actually, in BIS this is really quite prioritised. An official from BIS who is working on this issue 
defaultcame, 
defaultprobably about a year ago now
default, to one of our Crown Dependencies’
default officials meetings to discuss bilateral investment treaties and the changes that were happening, as you say, with the ceding of competency. They are now in a very close working relationship with the Crown Dependencies on what can happen after this and whether the Crown Dependencies might need to be entrusted to enter into bilateral treaties in 
defaulttheir
default own right. 
defaultI
defaultt is a three
default&#x2011;
defaultway discussion between BIS, the Crown Dependencies and the EU Commission. It is something that I know is prioritised by BIS
default,
default and my understanding is they have a very good working relationship with the Crown Dependency officials in order to try and resolve this.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: That is a good example. Only recently I wrote one of my little billet
defaults
default&#x2011;
defaultdoux to Vince Cable, just to 
defaultensure
default that he was making sure that BIS had enough alertness on these matters
default,
default because the point you make is very valid
default—which 
defaultI made earlier
default—
defaultthat what is the 
defaultNo. 1
default priority for the Crown Dependencies may not be very high on the list of priorities in a particular Government Department. 
defaultI would also say, just listening to 
defaultCathryn
default there, 
defaultthat
default one of the good things to come out of the 
defaultkind of 
defaultfinancial cosh that we have been under is that it is massively, massively in the
default interests of the MO
defaultJ to make sure that this machinery is working and that we are constantly looking to make sure that it is working
default,
default because we do not want massive entanglements that we 
defaultthen 
defaulthave to deal with.  
defaultQ28 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultYou said earlier that you did not know of a case where legislation had been delayed as a bargaining issue. That does not appear to have been the case recently at all of there being such things, but in the area of entrustment it does happen
default,
default because essent
defaultially what happened over the FA
defaultT
defaultC
defaultA agreement with the United States
default—
defaultcan I put it to you this way
default?—
defaultis that
default,
default when 
defaultentrustment was sought for this agreement, the UK Government effectively said, 
default“We rather like this idea. 
defaultYou can
default’
defaultt have entrustment until you have a treaty with us on the same lines
default.”
default Is bargaining still a feature of entrustment?
defaultLord McNallydefault: I would say yes. Is that short enough as well?
defaultQ29 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultShould it be?
defaultLord McNallydefault: Yes. Again, in my candid friend role
default,
default I said to the Dependencies that it really would be intolerable if a fo
defaultreign Government—
defaultin this case the 
defaultUnited States
default—
defaultwas given access to information that was being denied to the Unite
defaultd Kingdom Government. In the FA
defaultT
defaultC
defaultA case it was a perfectly legitimate stand
default-
defaultoff to say that we wanted equality of treatment. That is the grow
defaultn-up world. The FA
defaultT
defaultC
defaultA was another example where the Crown Dependencies are going to have to be alert to being compliant with global demands on transparency in financial services.
defaultQ30 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultWhich is what they were doing by reaching that agreement, was it not?
defaultLord McNallydefault: It was indeed. They did even better by concluding a similar agreement with our Government.
defaultQ31 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultW
defaulthile I have the opportunity, could I pick up a couple of issues where consultation on matters does not seem to have worked very
default well?
default One of them refer
defaults to HM Revenue and Customs, which
default issued new directions on passenger
default information that imposed a 12-
defaulthour notice period for flights into the UK from the Channel Islands, which is a shorter notice peri
defaultod than applies to EU countries;
default 
defaultt
defaulthey have 24 hours. Another one was consultation about transferring the cost of investigating air accidents in their airspace to th
defaultem under the Chicago Convention. Those are
default a couple of issues where decisions appear to have been taken without enough time for a proper consultation.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: Absolutely. First, I do not know much about the second issue so we can write to you on that one
default,
default if that would be helpful.  
defaultChair: defaultWe may have written to you about it, actually.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: On the first issue, I have spoken to the Home Office and HMRC about this. What seems to have happened is that the policy on this was agreed several years ago and then what they were doing was then putting it into practice
default. T
defaulthe consultation should have happened several years ago. The officials assumed that it had
default,
default and then when things came into place we realised that the Crown De
defaultpendencies had not been engaged and were not happy that the practic
defaultes that were currently happening in the 
defaultChannel Islands
default were different 
defaultfrom
default the policy. What has been really positive about this one is how quickly t
defaulthe Home Office and HMRC realised
default the issue and engaged with the Crown Dependencies. There has been regular contact now between officials in the Home Office and the Crown Dependen
defaultcies
default to try and resolve it. My understanding is that they are getting to the point of finding a resolution that will keep all parties happy. It shows how important 
defaultat 
defaultthe earliest stage of policy formation it is that the Crown Dependencies are engaged.
defaultQ32 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultOn
default defaulta
default final international point before we move on to good government, of course in our previous report we reflected on a situation 
defaultthat
default had arisen and probably has not had a 
defaultparallel since then in the Icelandic banking crisis, where the interests of the Dependencies were not the sam
defaulte as those of the UK Government
default but the UK Government had a duty to represent those interests. It seemed to us that there is no mechanism for ensuring that in this case conflicting interests could be advanced and be seen to be advanced in the negotiating process. That was the one recommendation, as I recall it, that was not accepted by the Government, but
default,
default so far
default,
default you have not come up with an alternative way of dealing with the situation in which the assumption that the Dependencies will make
default,
default if there is a conflict of interest and an international negotiation about it
default,
default 
defaultis that 
defaultthe UK will look after its own interests an
defaultd forget about the Dependencies.
defaultLord McNallydefault: I would hope that
default,
default in forming a 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default view
default,
default it would take on board the interests of the Dependencies. What I do not think we could do and what we could concede is 
defaultthat 
defaultin major international negotiations the Crown Dependencies had a separate role. I think that would cause considerable confusion in terms of what are often very crucial international negotiations. You are going down a very dangerous road, in my opinion, if you are going to say that the Crown Dependencies are going to be separ
defaultately represented in such talks. 
defaultThe Government would resist that
default,
default 
defaultbut t
defaulthe counter to that is to make sure that their interests are taken on board by those undertaking those negotiations. This is not unusual in all kinds of countries and federations and the rest, but in the end there has to be 
defaultonly 
defaultone message from the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default.
defaultQ33 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultThe 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default is the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default:
default it is not the Crown Dependencies. Does that mean you go into negotiations saying, 
default“T
defaulthe United Kingdom thinks this
default,” and say
default nothing at al
defaultl about the Crown Dependencies in an issue where
default they are a central player
default,
default as in the Icelandic banking crisis?
defaultLord McNallydefault: Where they are a central player then it is obvious and I would hope that we would take fully on board their interests
default,
default expertise and experience, but I do not think you could go into such negotiations with the Crown Dependencies arguing a different route than the British Government
default,
default unless, as I say, that takes you down a road which clearly the Crown Dependencies do not want to go. There are responsibilities to the relationship with the Crown and the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default, as well as benefits for them. I can go no further than to say I think it will be very dangerous to follow your advice on that particular aspect
default,
default and that remains the view of the Government.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: Can I just add 
defaultthat we do it on a case-by-case basis? T
defaulthere are certain things where the Crown Dependencies are able to represent their views. I know, 
defaultfor example, the recent MONEYVAL—
default 
defaultChair: defaultFor example?
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: MONEYVAL
default is an anti
default&#x2011;
defaultmoney
default laundering and terrorist finance organisation which HMT have engaged in and got 
defaulta 
defaultstatus 
defaultin 
defaultso that the Crown Dependencies can voice their opinions and engage as the Crown D
defaultependencies. It is about a case-by-
defaultcase situation and an understanding where the Crown Dependencies
default’
default priorities are, getting them engaging with policy officials early, particularly on those 
defaultinterests that really do matter, 
defaultand then working with them to find out the best way that their perspectives can be heard
default. B
defaultut, as Lord McNally says, it might not necessarily be that several views are put at the negotiating table at one time.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: I am all in favour
default,
default if some specialist
defaults are
default gathering and they are looking at an area where the Crown Dependencies have specialist knowledge, that we make room for them in 
defaultthe 
defaultteams that go to that
default gathering
default, but 
defaultin 
defaultthe G20, 
defaultG8 and the European Council
default it is not possible.
defaultQ34 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultThe European Council is a different case because
default they are not members of the EU.
defaultLord McNallydefault: No.
defaultQ35 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultCan I turn your attention to issues of good government
default,
default because the independence and the powers of self
default&#x2011;
defaultdetermination of the CDs 
defaultare, the previous Committee concluded, 
defaultonly 
defaultto 
defaultbe set aside in the most extreme and serious circumstances
default—
defaulteffectively where 
defaultthe rule of law has broken down?
default We have had lots of written representations from 
defaultresidents
default of Jersey and the Isle of Man asking for the 
defaultUK
default to intervene on the grounds of good government. 
defaultDo
default you think we have the level of intervention at the right level
default,
default and is it of any benefit to try to describe exactly what that might look like, where the UK may intervene? Would that assist us in any way to 
defaultattempt to 
defaultbe
default more
default clear
default 
defaultabout that?
defaultLord McNallydefault: As I said in my opening remarks, both this Committee and 
defaultKilbrandon
default set out a very high line to clear before the British Government would intervene. Tempting as it sometimes is to say, 
default“
defaultWe will go in and put them right
default,”
default I 
defaultwould 
defaultsay this Committee has been very wise and the Government will still hold to the fact that
default,
default unless th
defaultere is real evidence of a break
defaultdown either in the policing or the integrity of the judiciary or general law and order, we would not. The 
defaultIslands
default are self
default&#x2011;
defaultgoverning. By any criteria they are governed well, but there will always be criticisms of governance and we would have to take them on board in deciding our own relations. 
defaultWhen I say the Dependencies are governed well
default,
default I make an exception in terms of 
defaultSark
default. I do not give Sark a clean bill of health and we may go on to that, but I do give Jersey, Guernsey and the 
defaultIsle of Man
default such a clean
default bill of health—
default 
defaultQ36 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultFor the record
default,
default you had better 
defaultsay whether you 
defaultinclude 
defaultAlderney
default in that list.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: 
defaultAlderney
default as well. 
defaultAlderney
default has other problems but I do not think they are ones of governance. 
defaultW
defaulthen attacks are made on any particular institution in the Crown Dependencies, there are already in existence machineries to test those accusations and to make judgment on them. I do not think it is a good idea for the Minister of the day, as it were, to be making subjective judgments on problems. If you have confidence
default, and 
defaultI do
default, 
defaultin policing, 
defaultand 
defaultif you have confidence
default, and 
defaultI do
default, 
defaultin the judiciary, then they should be able to handle any problems that ar
defaultise in a proper and tested way—and I think t
defaulthey do.
defaultQ37 default&#xa0; 
defaultAndy McDonald: defaultCan I just ask you to revisit the issue of 
defaultSark
default? You specifically mentioned that. Perhaps we could deal with that in a little bit more detail because there have been some issues that have arisen there with the separation of powers with the dual role of the Seneschal and then the suggestion that there 
defaultshould 
defaultbe an observer in place for the 2012 elections. I believe, Sir Alan, when we visited they were about to appoin
defaultt somebody to assist the chief a
defaultdministrator. Perhaps you might comment about that. We ha
defaultve previously said that the MO
defaultJ should maintain a watching brief on 
defaultSark
default.
default 
defaultP
defaulterhaps you might be able to say a little b
defaultit more about how that is going.
defaultLord McNallydefault: Yes. By any standards I have kept a watching brief on 
defaultSark
default, whilst being conscious of the high hurdle that has to be cleared in terms of direct intervention. It is worth remembering that 
defaultSark
default has only had democracy since the 2008 reforms. It has only had two elections. The turnout in those two elections would make us in 
defaultWestminster
default envious in that 
defaultit was
default 78
default%/
default79%. In their own evidence to you
default,
default they say that we do not fully appreciate how wedded at least some people are on 
defaultSark
default to the old ways. Up to 2008 it was a feudal regime. That is true. My experience is that there are people who long for the good old days of feudal rule and the certainty that it provided, but the world has moved on. They have to operate to 21st century standards
default,
default and for some on 
defaultSark
default that has been a painful process. 
defaultMy only interest in 
defaultSark
default is good governance. I have no missionary zeal to push them one way or the other, other than the fact that
default,
default for example
default,
default on the question of the Seneschal
default,
default the Supreme Court told them that the combination of judge and presiding officer was incompatible with a functioning democracy. To say that we had rushed them when it took t
defaulthem three years to implement it
default may be 
default“
defaultrushing
default”
default in 
defaultSark
default terms
default,
default but it was a reasonable time to expect action to be taken.
defaultOn the election observer, we had had talks for a number of months and I did twist arms a little towards the end, partly because I wanted to avoid having an election where immediately afterwards there would be cries of foul. If they reflect, the fact that they had an external observer avoided that. I feel some sense of failure in a way 
defaultin regard to
default an island of 600 people
default that
default in many ways is idyllic
default. 
defaultI can see the attractions of going back to 
defaultthe
default quieter, more leisurely, more certain age it has, but it also has to provide a living for people. It has to have some economic future other than for retirees who have pensions that they have already made. It has to give a future for young people and for a working population. 
defaultI just feel at the moment 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is not enough empathy in the community of people clinging to the old ways, who fear change, who oppose investments and ideas. They just see everybody as an enemy and the others just see the others as barriers to progress. We have made considerable efforts to find common ground
default,
default to encourage dialogue and to work towards some kind of settled future for 
defaultSark
default. 
defaultCathryn
default has given an enormous amount of her time to try and help 
defaultSark
default manage its own way forward.
defaultQ38 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultBefore we hand over to Ms Hannah, anyone listening to the issue who is not familiar with the situation on Sark would wonder what on earth you are talking about when you talked about one group of people and the others. Let us be clear what 
defaultwe are talking about.
default 
defaultT
defaulthose who represent the majority view in the Chief Pleas, which is the 
defaultParliament
default of Sark, and the Barclay Brothers and their management of their economic interests on the island, tend to express their dissatisfaction in extremely strident terms or, of course, to take court action
default,
default which led to some of the democratic changes.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: Yes. I was almost tempted to bring two guides to you. One is the 
defaultSark Scribe
default and the other is the 
defaultSark Newsletter
default. In the 
defaultSark Scribe
default, 
defaultSark
default is a bucolic land of people
default,
default sheep racing, maypole dancing and having tea at the vicarage. In the 
defaultSark Newsletter
default, 
defaultSark
default is a fascist 1930s state. Let me be clear and I say again, as I have said to the Barclay Brothers and to their representative, 
defaultthat 
defaultI wish they would cease publication of the 
defaultSark Newsletter
default because it impedes getting the kind of empathetic relationships in 
defaultSark
default that would take the island forward. 
defaultI also equally say to those who think that the future of 
defaultSark
default is in the past
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthat is not possible. They are going to have to adapt so that they can have the machinery. At the moment it is very difficult to look to somebody who properly gives leadership in 
defaultSark
default. We have had two external individuals who have looked at it and both 
defaulthave 
defaultgiven suggestions of how to improve good governance, which are now the property of the Chief Pleas of 
defaultSark
default. I am not there to draw up solutions for them
default,
default but they do have, to my mind, good suggestions for taking this forward and they would be sensible to do so. I am very grateful that they have recently appointed a chief officer
default,
default who I hope will give some structure to the governance. 
defaultI understand it is going to be a slow process, but I think it would be better if we could take some of the poison on both sides out as well
default,
default because
default,
default as well as the 
defaultSark Newsletter
default,
default I also see some of the blogs that are alive in the island, which are equally intolerant of the other point of view. In such a small community
default,
default these things hurt
default,
default they cause resentment and they make progress more difficult.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: What we have tried to do, really, is help 
defaultSark
default as it takes the governance issues forward, as Lord McNally says. We helped them administer a perception survey of the local population last year, which helped identify some of the issues that the
default local population feel on Sark—
defaultfor example
default,
default people being really worried about the economic situation or 
defaultwishing
default to see more land reform. 
defaultW
defaulte have also tried to run a series of workshops with the Chief Pleas, looking at things such as corporate governance and how you create a strategic plan to give them those tools so 
defaultthat 
defaultthey can progress things. 
defaultIn October, with colleagues from Guernsey and 
defaultJersey
default, we helped organise some economic development workshops, again so 
defaultthat they can
default start planning for the future. There is a lot of impetus from some people within the Chief Pleas to take these bits of work forward and to strengthen Sark for the future
default,
default and a recognition that in order to keep what is special about Sark 
defaultit
default needs to have these governance arrangements in place so 
defaultthat 
defaultit can function effectively.
defaultQ39 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultCan we leave 
defaultSark
default behind and turn to the
default more general issue? I want to have in mind a situation 
defaultthat
default has arisen in the Isle of Man without particularly discussing it because it is not a good thing for pending court matters, even 
defaultwhen they are 
defaultbeyond the reach of our sub 
defaultjudice
default rule, to be discussed in 
defaultthe 
defaultlegislature. One of the things that that kind of experience indicates is that
default,
default if people are to have confidence that the smallness of a jurisdiction is not going to weaken its ability to deal with difficult situations
default,
default it needs to be clear that they can get outside assistance, whether it 
defaultis in the judiciary or among
default the prosecutorial team when a case arises 
defaultthat
default involves someone at a senior level in the local structure. It is a problem 
defaultthat
default can arise in any of the jurisdictions. As far as I understand it
default,
default they all have 
defaultthe 
defaultpractice of bringing in experienced judicial figures or lawyers from the 
defaultUnited Kingdom
default when this kind of thing happens. Is the Ministry of Justice involved in that process
default,
default and are you happy that it is in place and used when it needs to be?
defaultLord McNallydefault: Yes. Again, 
defaultCathryn
default can comment in any detail that she wants, but my feeling is 
defaultthat 
defaultin all the jurisdictions 
defaultthat 
defaulthas worked extremely w
defaultell. 
defaultWhen the 
defaultIsle of Man
default had an issue they informed me very early. They took advice from an external legal opinion and they brought in an acting law officer to cover. We have also suggested, 
defaultfor what
default may be a slight weakness in the 
defaultIsle of Man
default set-
defaultup, th
defaultat they have a Solicitor-General as well as an Attorney-
defaultGeneral
default,
default 
defaultwhich we think gives a good back-
defaultup.
defaultQ40 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultIn other words
default,
default there 
defaultshould be a deputy.
defaultLord McNallydefault: Yes. The 
defaultIsle of Man
default have dealt with the problem well and that shows the system works. From my own experience in terms of visiting the other Dependencies, there is a regular habit of bringing in expert judicial and policing expertise
default,
default which, as you say, gives confidence to the operation of both the judiciary and the police in the Dependencies.
defaultQ41 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair: defaultCan I raise one fairly technical issue
default,
default which, if you do not have the answer with you, you can write to us about? It was raised with us by 
defaultGuernsey
default because of a dispute between them and HM Revenue and Customs about the constitutional position. In the past they were able to refer such disputes to 
defaultthe Cabinet Office legal adviser
defaults for an opinion, which has generally enabled things to move forward. They made such a request in July
default,
default but it was suggested that the Cabinet Office may be unable to assist. When we last heard from them, 
defaultGuernsey
default’s legal advise
defaultrs were waiting to hear whether
default the Cabinet Office legal advise
defaultrs would in the event consider giving the advice. It looks as though a relatively straightforward way of dealing with a problem 
defaultthat
default can arise
default is no longer available to them.
defaultLord McNallydefault: I am tempted to say 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is the first example I have had of the Cabinet Office not being willing to give an opinion on anything
default,
default but, actually, 
defaultCathryn
default has a more judicial answer.
defaultChair: defaultA 
defaultj
defaultudicious
default answer
default.  
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: The Cabinet Office has never been the only port of call for the
defaultse
default kinds of issu
defaultes. At the MO
defaultJ 
defaultwe try and
default look at the specific issue and work out who is the most appropriate part of HMG to deal with it
default,
default but, rather than going into too much detail here, if you are happy
default,
default we can write to you about the background of this and also explain what we are doing to help Guernsey try and resolve this particular issue.
defaultQ42 default&#xa0; 
defaultJeremy defaultCorbyndefault: defaultIs this sort of shadow-
defaultboxing around the fundamental issue of the massive tax imbalance between the taxation regime in the rest of the 
defaultUK
default and the taxation regime on all of the Dependencies?
defaultCathryndefault Hannahdefault: I do not think so. This is more a specific issue in the way that HMRC operates in relation to Customs and the information it shares more broadly
default,
default and ensuring that Guernsey and HMRC have a sensible way of sharing information that is constitutionally sound but also allows for the information to be shared. I do not think it is anything more wide than that.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThank you very much indeed. We are grateful to you bo
defaultth. We wish you well, Ms Hannah, on your
default maternity leave
default,
default and we are grateful for your help this morning.  
defaultLord McNallydefault: We are grateful to the Committee. I understand 
defaulttoday
default is your 40 years and one day as a Member of Parliament.
defaultJeremy defaultCorbyndefault: defaultLife begins at 40
default!
default
