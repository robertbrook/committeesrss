default“The recent Ofsted experience was unjust and it was cl
defaultear to all involved that the result was pre-decided and that the inspectors were drawing conclusions about the school to fit historical data and meet the government agenda.  There is not a member of staff or parent at the school who agrees with the result 
defaultgiven by Ofsted or what is said in the report.”
default&#xa0;
default“It confirmed what I thought about Ofsted.  The criteria they judge a school on is so specific and focused on evidence provided by SLT
default [senior leadership team]
default that they do not notice anything else going on.
default  This just encourages SLT to spend more time on Ofsted evidence and less time on running the school.  A sad state of affairs.  Ofsted serves no useful purpose to education and should be abolished.”
default&#xa0;
default“We are due now and the pressure is so great it is makin
defaultg me ill.  I am considering leaving because of it.”
default&#xa0;
default“Context of the school needs to be taken into account.  We as a profession have little faith that the Ofsted process is anything but a tool for political manipulation, especially in the insane rush for A
defaultcademy status.”
default&#xa0;
default“The inspection judgements and comments did not tell the school anything that they didn’t already know.  Comments as the inspectors left which stated they could see that the ethos of the school was outstanding as they entered the school, b
defaultut couldn’t comment on this, were not helpful in helping the school feel that inspection is broadly based and not just on data.”
default&#xa0;
default“
defaultThe lead inspector was a Cllr with no teaching qualification or experience.  Second inspector seemed to know nothing about pr
defaultimary education and gave feedback on a maths lesson when in fact he had observed a literacy lesson.  Teachers were downgraded for allowing children to drink water during a PE lesson.”
