defaultB&amp;ES is taking a lead role in the development of sustainable building services engineering
default.  
defaultRecent research we have undertaken amongst our members shows that
default:
default1.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe are concerned that system performance should be viewed as a whole rather than concentrating on the primary fuel emissions
default.  
defaultWhatever analysis structure is implemented it should always centre on minimising the energy use at point of delivery and also the energy consumed in the systems that then deliver the energy.
default1.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs buildings become more energy efficient through the application of insulation and control of air infiltration, the energy used in the delivery systems can be as much as 40% of the total energy delivered
default.  
defaultThis auxiliary energy is invariably electricity with its high CO

defaultommittee’s inquiry into Heat and are pleased to submit our response for consideration
default.  We have focussed on space and water heating as the areas most covered by our members, and also which make-up the vast bulk of heat demand.  
defaultIn compiling this submission, we have consulted with our members by circulating an early draft version which was discussed through an online webinar.

defaultOur submission paper presented last year to the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers’ Technical Symposium, resulted from research undertaken for the B&amp;ES 
defaultRenewable Systems Integration Guide
default.  
defaultThe standards referenced 
defaulttherein make for a quantifiable, audible calculation process applicable to both renewable and traditional energy sources
default.  
defaultWe appreciate this paper is too lengthy to provide to committee members with this submission
default.  
defaultHowever
default,
default we 
defaultfeel it is very relevant and would much appreciate the opportunity to give oral evidence to the committee and to discuss it with them then
default.

defaultInquiry questionsdefaultWith regard to the specific questions asked, our responses are as follows:
default2.1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIs the 
defaultGovernment
default taking the right approach to reduce heat energy demand
default?
defaultJust as people in business or in their homes do not wake up and ask themselves, “
defaulthow much en
defaultergy can we  save today
default?”, so they do not value heat until they do not have it
default.  
defaultTheir main awareness comes when a large utility bill arrives on the doorstep
default.  
defaultAs the production of heat for space heating is seldom of strategic financial importance to people, it attracts little attention except in those areas where there is a major impact
default,
default eg in buildings such as hospitals and universities
default.  
defaultThere are few significant drivers for change and almost always competing
default investment opportunities.
defaultIn 
defaultGovernment
default, responsibility for energy demand falls between 
defaultthree dep
defaultartments
default:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment for Energy and Climate Changedefault  
default(“
defaultDECCdefault”) 
default- 
defaultwhere the Energy Efficiency Deployment Office
default (“
defaultEEDOdefault”)
default is at the centre of a new drive by 
defaultGovernment
default to improve the way we use energy across the UK)
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe 
defaultDepartment for Communities and Local Governmentdefault (
default“
defaultCLGdefault”
default - responsible for energy standards in buildings)
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultwhile the 
defaultDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsdefault (
default“
defaultDEFRAdefault”
default) has an interest in energy with regard to emissions of CO
default2
default.
defaultThen, at an operational level, there are 
defaulttwo 
defaultmain non-departmental 
defaultg
defaultovernment
defaultal bodies
default:
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe Energy Saving Trustdefault, working mainly in the domestic sector
default,
default and
default(b)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe Carbon Trustdefault, working with industry and innovative energy technologies.
defaultFinally there is 
defaultOfgemdefault, the energy regulator and responsible for overseeing the introduction of the 
defaultRenewable Heat Incentivedefault (“
defaultRHIdefault”)
default.  
defaultThere is no clear lead body with overall responsibility for reducing heat energy demand
default.  
defaultWith no specific market driver and a lack of 
defaultGovernment
default focus, it is difficult to know how much progress is being achieved, with no clear way of being able to calculate overall costs against carbon emissions and wider sustainability issues
default.  
defaultGovernment policy is delivered through an over-complex mix of disparate initiatives: building regulations, planning requirements, the code for sustainable homes, renewable heat incentive, the 
defaultCarbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Schemedefault (
default“
defaultCdefaultRCEESdefault”
default) and Green Deal to name but some
default.  
defaultThis had led to a ‘tick box’ culture that puts in place minimum requirements at the planning stage, though in effect these requirements are rarely inspected or checked to see if they function 
defaultas designed.
defaultOverall there is no clear joined up approach; more emphasis needs to be made on improving the heat efficiency of commercial and housing projects, which could be incentivised via the planning system, section 106 agreements and proper enforcement
default.  
defaultWhat is needed is a results-based process
default,
default rather than a theoretical planning design process
default.
default2.2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat progress is the 
defaultGovernment
default making on reducing the demand for heat?
defaultReduction in demand for heat should not be confused with de-carbonisation.
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment
default has put in place several initiatives that aim to reduce demand for heat, most significantly the Green Deal / ECO and the 
defaultRHI 
default(designed to encourage a switch to renewable technologies, the heat saving element comes from a requirement to carry out the minimum insulation improvements specified in the Green Deal assessment to trigger funding)
default.  
defaultThe Government has also published revisions to Part L of the Building Regulations
default.  
defaultSo in principle, some progress is being made
default.  
defaultHowever, so far the Green Deal has proven disappointing with little take-up by consumers mainly due to a lack of detailed communication and explanation (the budget for digital switchover was 
defaultc
default £146
default million
default, by comparison the budget for Green Deal is £2.9
default million
default), as well as perceived high interest rates and concerns over the impact upon resale values of properties that have had Green Deal funded improvements.
defaultThe changes to Part L are broadly welcomed though there is a lack of ambition in the new regulations, particularly in relation to the absence of new standards for refurbishments and existing homes, which are responsible for the majority of the UK’s emissions
default.  
defaultDue to the prevailing economic conditions, many developments which have been granted planning permission under the old regulations have stalled, hence we are likely see a continuation to design to the old standards for some time, as developers have 
defaultthree
default years to start a development from being given planning permission
default.  
default 
defaultOverall, we observe that the 
defaultG
defaultovernment is gaining a reputation for setting headline grabbing green targets, then watering down targets when it comes to putting in place the details that lead to firm action and progress in reducing demand for heat
default.  
defaultThis is particularly true in respect of housebuilding
default,
default where lobbying has been very effective in gaining a softening of targets
default.  There is a disconnect, between what is designed and approved for planning and what is built and implemented.  
defaultThere is a particular problem in the new build housing sector with the increasing number of tower blocks that are being built
default.  
defaultBuilders are encouraged to install centralised heating plant and onsite generation through planning and the code for sustainable homes (which triggers funding for social housing)
default.  
defaultThese systems are complex and require close control, usually through a combination of individual controls in 
defaultthe flats and a central 
defaultBuilding Management Systemdefault (
default“
defaultBMSdefault”)
default.  
defaultThe problem with such buildings is that there is usually no clear ‘owner’ of the building’s BMS, so that typically, individual flat dwellers have no right to information from the developer or freeholder
default.  
defaultDavid Frise, B&amp;ES’s 
defaultH
defaultead of 
defaultS
defaultustainability, has personal experience of this situation 
default-
default even though he is a director of his apartment block’s residents association, he has been refused meaningful information from the developer and the freeholder has no interest in getting involved
default.  
defaultThe result is that the system does not operate correctly but the residents cannot get the necessary information to make it work
default.  
defaultThis is an example of the planner’s carbon and energy reduction intent being met through the installation of equipment but with no regard being paid to the “
defaultdoes it work
default” element
default.  
default2.3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultBiomass is deemed a key fuel for heat production from both the cost and GHG perspectives
default.  
defaultWhat should be done to ensure methods of calculating biomass GHG balance represent an accurate picture?
defaultThere should be ‘whole cycle’ analysis and consideration of the transport carbon costs and the displacement of food production, together with consideration of the true embodied energy of any processing of fuels, such as compressed wood pellets or liquefaction of crops.
default2.4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are sustainability guidelines for biomass
default.  
defaultD
defaulto these go far enough?
defaultNo
default.  
defaultThe guidelines that are in place need to be more focussed and integrated
default.  
defaultThe Bio-liquid and the Solid and Gaseous Biomass Carbon Calculators are not user friendly
default.  
defaultBiomass technology is not always as ‘green’ as it is perceived
default.  
defaultCertain fuel sources 
default-
default in particular roundwood specifically grown for biomass installations 
default-
default may not deliver the carbon paybacks needed to meet national emissions targets
default.  
defaultIt is also important that the correct method of measuring environmental performance be used
default.  
defaultA B&amp;ES Forum has advised the 
defaultGovernment
default to consider the ‘Green Ticks’ scheme operated by the Green Business Network
default.  
defaultThis gives organisations credit for putting suitable policies in place; complying with legislation, reviewing suppliers, enthusing staff and using robust environmental management
default.  
defaultGreen Ticks would be a way of ensuring all ‘rival’ methodologies used to assess the performance of buildings receive credit and are operated in a complementary way.
defaultThe new requirements for the RHI for sustainable biomass fuel supply and air quality controls that were recently introduced are welcomed
default.
default2.5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat will the local environmental impact (for example
default,
default air pollution) be from the use of heat generation in urban areas, for example CHP units?
defaultOne specific observation we would like to make is for 
defaultGovernment
default to reconsider providing support for biomass systems in urban settings, due to air quality issues
default.  
defaultWe should like to commend to the committee the 
defaultPolicy Exchange Report
default, 
defaultSomething in the Air - The forgotten crisis of Britain’s poor air quality
default, which says the RHI should 
defaultnot support biomass technologies in cities
default.
default2.6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the relative merits of using gas to directly provide space heating
default, c
defaultompared to centralised electricity production plus domestic heat pumps? 
defaultGas is a reliable, fully-proven fuel source
default.  
defaultUntil such time as electricity generation is significantly de
default-
defaultcarbonised, mains gas is the best option where it is available.
defaultOfgem has been warning about looming electricity shortages and this in turn is focusing more attention on energy security
default.  
defaultThe 
defaultGovernment
default’s electricity generation strategy is based around a switch from fossil fuels to a de-carbonised grid through nuclear, wind, biomass and some localised generation, eg solar PV
default.  
defaultWhile welcome in principle, delays to this programme mean we are somewhere between the two, with the grid de
default-
defaultcarbonisation plan years behind schedule
default.  
defaultIn any case, planning requirements and funding are driving inappropriate choices
default.  
defaultB&amp;ES is seeing heat pump and biomass installations that will not achieve any net carbon emissions savings, where gas with energy efficiency upgrades would be less costly, more effective and easier to achieve
default.  
defaultThis is particularly prevalent on social housing projects
default.
default2.7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy is community heating/CHP not more common in the UK?
defaultThis is largely due to inadequate and ineffective planning legislation and the complexity of building ownership, ie
default 
defaultfreehold / leasehold / tenant agreements
default.  
defaultThere is a fear that such systems will not work and will in turn impact back on the landlord, building owner or occupier
default.  
defaultThe key is to ensure CHP is properly specified and designed
default.  
defaultMost of the problems users have had with CHP in the past were related to over-sizing, which meant the CHP did not run continuously
default.  
defaultIdeally, it should be sized to about 15% of the heat demand, this will mean the engine keeps working hard and continually generating ‘free’ electricity while satisfying the increasing need for low cost, low carbon heat.
defaultCHP now provides 7.5% of the UK’s electricity requirements and saves 14 million tonnes of CO
default2
default per year, according to 
defaultDECC
default.  
defaultHowever, mis-selling and false promises have been a problem
default.  
defaultCHP has suffered in the past from being misapplied including being used simply to get a tick in a box from a planning officer so as to gain planning permission for a development
default.  
defaultAnother often missed opportunity has been the failure to ‘marry’ several technologies to further reduce carbon intensity
default.  
defaultFor example, electricity generated by on-site CHP can be used to power electric heat pumps 
default-
default so increasing the already significant energy and carbon emission benefits of each technology.
defaultThe Carbon Trust has carried out extensive field trials in the UK and concluded that “
defaulta mini-CHP unit can provide savings of between 15% and 20% when it is applied as the lead boiler
default”
default.  
defaultIt works best in applications with high and continuous heating loads like hospitals, leisure centres, sheltered accommodation and fire stations, because the longer it is running to meet heating demand, the more efficient it

default.
default2.8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat are the lock-in, costs and GHG savings from the promotion of different forms of domestic heating solution?
default 
defaultThis is such a wide and generalised question that we feel unable to provide a reasoned response.
default2.9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultShould the 
defaultG
defaultovernment take further any specific actions in relation to cooling?
default 
defaultHeat used for cooling through absorption chillers is included in the RHI because it counts under the Renewable Energy Directive (
default“
defaultRED
default”
default)
default.  
defaultCooling generated by heat pumps is not included
default.  
defaultWith ground source heat pumps in particular, cooling is one half of the equation
default, eg 
defaultcooling in summer replenishes the heat store for the winter, so improving the overall efficiency of the system
default.  
defaultEfforts should therefore be made to have this included within the RED
default.
default2.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy does the RHI not seem to promote heat pumps successfully?
default 
defaultFor single technology suppliers, Biomass is a far easier sell
default.  
defaultSeemingly an easier technology to design and install, it can often be added to a conventional heating system without alteration, as it operates at the same temperatures as say an oil fired system
default.  
defaultIt therefore works well for the off-gas grid boiler replacement market
default.  
defaultHeat pumps need to operate at lower temperatures to achieve the higher COPs (“co-efficient of performances”) that give lower running costs
default.  
defaultIn new-build this is not a problem because the heating system can be designed for lower temperatures with 
defaultunder floor
default heating or larger radiators
default.  
defaultReplacement boilers however would require system upgrades - eg, upsizing of radiators - that add to the costs and inconvenience to the householder
default.  
defaultThere can also be problems in rural areas with inadequate electrical supplies unable to support the additional electrical loads required by heat pumps
default.
default2.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHow successful will the RHI be when rolled out to households?
defaultThis would need a definition of success not currently made clear by 
defaultGovernment
default.  
defaultIndustry has broadly welcomed the scheme and it has led to a marked increase in interest from householders as reported by B&amp;ES installer members
default.  
defaultA number of issues have been raised around contradictory advice from a Green Deal Assessment (“GDA”) and the Microgeneration Installer Standards (“MIS”)
default.  
defaultWe have seen several cases of a GDA recommending one technology, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, whilst the MIS calculation suggested Air Source Heat Pump was the better solution
default.  
defaultClearly these anomalies need to be ironed out
default.  
defaultIf not, while there will be many more installations, some may not be appropriate There is no benefit from installing renewable technologies (except solar thermal) where the gas grid is available
default.
default2.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThermal storage is a potential useful method of balancing electricity/energy demand
default,
default both diurnally and annually
default.  
defaultWhat 
defaultis 
defaultGovernment
default policy doing to promote thermal storage, and should it do more/different?
defaultWe are not clear on how much support the 
defaultGovernment
default is giving to thermal storage
default.  
defaultIt barely warranted a mention in the 
defaultGovernment
default’s December 2011
default,

defaultThere is potential for more encouragement of onsite thermal storage in locations that have the space for it such as schools, office blocks and hospitals
default.  Thermal storage can be successful if combined with smart tariffs and metering, which encourage individuals and organisations to plan when they use, generate and store heat.
defaultLast year, in conjunction with the Technology Strategy Board, DECC launched an Advanced Heat Storage Competition for small businesses, a small-scale
default, 
defaultbut welcome initiative
default.  
defaultWe would like to see more of this type of programme with greater involvement of trade associations like ourselves.

defaultThere is similar potential in the household sector with regard to the increasing number of tower blocks that are being built in British cities by construction companies to address the need for affordable housing
default.  
defaultHowever, an issue with such buildings is that there is usually no clear ‘owner’ of the building’s Building Management System, so that typically, individual flat dwellers have no right to information from the management company or freeholder
