defaultThe Newspaper Society – Written evidencedefault&#xa0;
defaultThe Newspaper Society represents the regional media industry. Its members publish around 1,100 local and regional newspaper titles, read by 31 million people a week and 1600 associated websites, attracting 62 million unique users a month.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Newspaper Society has specific objections to proposals within the draft Deregulation Bill which would affect the public right to know and public oversight of the courts, police and schools. These include proposals to remove statutory requirements to ensure  local newspaper publication of certain public notices, that certain  evidence is made public in the criminal courts, for that journalistic material and confidential sources are properly safeguarded from police search and seizure powers or production applications and anything seized is recovered and for reduction of public inspection rights. These matters raise freedom of expression and open justice issues, engaging Article 10 and Article 6 ECHR.
default&#xa0;
default1.  Removal of mandatory newspaper publication of certain public noticesdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Newspaper Society strongly objects to the proposed amendments to Schedule 15 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Schedule 6 to the Highways Act 1980 to end newspaper publication of certain public notices in favour of local authority websites.

defaultExplanatory Notes ‘
default364. 
defaultParagraph 9 
defaultmakes the following amendments to Schedule 6 to the 1980 Act.
defaultThat Schedule sets out the procedure that must be followed before certain “public 
defaultpath orders
default” are made under that Act, for example, an order extinguishing a public right of
default 
defaultway.
default365. Paragraphs 1 and 4A of Schedule 6 are amended so that the surveying
default 
defaultauthority are no longer required to give notice of the making of a public path
default 
defaultorder by publication in at least one local newspaper circulating in the area. Instead
default 
defaultthey are required to give notice by publication on the authority’s website and on such
defaultother
default websites or through the use of such other digital communications media as the
default 
defaultauthority may consider appropriate. This measure will significantly reduce the cost to
default 
defaultthe 
defaultlocal authority of making an order and the cost to the landowner where the cost is
default 
defaultpassed on to the landowner because the order is for the landowner’s benefit.
default’
default&#xa0;defaultModification of a definitive map has important legal 
defaultconsequences 
default and
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultpublic path orders, such as an order extinguishing a public right of way
default, 
defaultcan have great impact upon individuals, businesses and communities. It is vital that notices of such order
defaults
default continue to be published in the local newspaper,
default rather than on a local authority website. The statutory requirement for newspaper publication ensures that such notices are 
defaultindependently 
defaultpublicised
default 
default in
default the most effective way to
default draw them to the attention of 
default those who
default may 
default be affected by the
default changes to be effected by the orders 
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Bill 
defaultand explanatory notes do not provide convincing justification for the proposed change. The Explanatory Notes simply 
defaultassert that there will be a cost saving to the local authority, without any financial analysis in support
default of that assertion 
default and 
defaulttakes no account of the impact upon the public through the 
defaultineffectiveness of local authority websites for publicising such information, the lack of internet access by significant sections of the population, the impact upon the local communities in general or 
default&#xa0;
defaultparticular interest groups potentially affected by such orders, nor the financial impact upon local newspapers. There has been no detailed impact assessment – the 
defaultpaper 
default indicates
default 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is none and that 
defaultwork 
defaulthas to
default be done before any Bill is 
defaultintroduced 
defaultinto Parliament
default. The paper’s 
defaulttable provides no financial information on these specific proposals
default and discloses no basis for the Explanatory Notes’ assertions.

defaultthe
default Local Audit and Accountability Bill
default in the House of Lords: 
default&#xa0;
default‘
defaultThe purpose of a statutory notice, as everybody clearly knows, is to inform the public about decisions that affect their lives, their property and their amenity. That is especially the case where the public have a limited period in which to respond.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Committee was in broad agreement that notices should be easily 
defaultavailable for local people and that they are vital for local transparency and accountability. The noble Lord has highlighted the cost of statutory notices and suggested that local newspapers are 
defaulton
default of the least effective ways to convey information to people. We do not agree. Research by 
defaultGfK
default for the Newspaper Society found that the reach of local newspapers was much greater that council websites;67% of respondents to that survey had read or looked at their local newspaper for at least a couple of minutes within the past seven days, compared with 9% who had viewed their council website. Some 34% of adults questioned had into accessed the internet at all in the last 12 months.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe most recent intern access quarterly update from the Office of national Statistics published in May, shows that 7.1 million adults in the United Kingdom-14% of the 
defaultpopulation have never used the internet. Two thirds of over -75s, a third of 65 to 74 year olds and 32% of disabled people, as defined by the Disability Discrimination act, have never used the internet. There are quite a lot of people therefore, who do not, would not and could not use the internet for these notices.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe 
defaultGfK
default research for the Newspaper Society showed that local papers are spontaneously cited as the way in which most people- that is 39%- expect to be informed about traffic changes, for example. My noble friend Lord Shipley will be interested to know that 
defaultthe  next
default placed source of information is street signs, at 26%- they come immediately to notice. When prompted, 79% of all adults responding said that they expect to be made aware of traffic changes in their printed local paper, second only to street signs and ahead of any other communication channels…
default&#xa0;
default……..the last Administration consulted in 2009 on removing the statutory requirements  to publish planning notices in newspapers and found that was not well received,  … Some 40% of respondents to that survey were against the proposals, with a further 20% giving only qualified support.. ..the Party opposite concluded that some members of the public and community groups relied on statutory notices in newspapers, and was not convinced that good alternative arrangements could readily be rolled out. A recent debate on alcohol licensing notices showed the strength of cross- party feeling against repealing the requirement to publish the notices in newspapers
default ‘
default..
default[The Government announced that it would not abolish this statutory requirement].
default&#xa0;
defaultWe strongly submit that these provisions should be removed from the Draft Bill. We would be concerned if any new Ministerial powers within the Bill were used to remove such public 
defaultinformation  requirements
default to publish notices in newspapers.
default&#xa0;
default2.Objectionsdefault to the Draft Deregulation Bill’s reduction of  public access to information rightsdefault&#xa0;defaultWe are also concerned by other examples of the draft Bill’s presentation of measures as deregulatory benefits lightening the burden of the public sector, when its provisions are in fact abolishing the public’s rights to information about public services necessary for public oversight, especially concerning the functioning of the schools and the work of the courts.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe statutory rights of members of the public to information and statutory openness requirements intended to ensure public oversight and public scrutiny  ought  not to be disregarded and diminished by being denigrated as a ‘burden’ of which public bodies should be relieved. 
default&#xa0;defaultFor example,  given the relevance of information about schools’ performance by a wider section of the local community than pupils’ parents, there appears little justification for Schedule 14 : ‘Schools: Reduction of Burdens’ paragraph 6 (1)-(4) ‘Publication of Reports’  which amend  the Education Act 2005 to remove the specific duties upon governing bodies to make all  inspection reports and any report on outcomes from a religious inspection  available for public inspection and on request to anyone. 
default&#xa0;
default3 defaultOpen Justice:  objections to removal and reduction of statutory public rights to hear evidence and access court documentationdefault&#xa0;defaultThe draft Deregulation Bill also creates new inroads into open justice through draft Clause 36 Criminal Procedure: written witness statements and draft Clause 37 Criminal Procedure: written guilty pleas. Local newspapers continue to attend and report the work of the local criminal courts to their local communities.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe NS is therefore concerned by the potential effect of the draft Bill’s proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 section 9, which would remove statutory provisions requiring written statements to be read aloud or an oral account to be given in court. We would also oppose the draft Bill’s amendment of Magistrates Court Act 1980 section 12 allowing the Criminal Procedure Rules to dispense with the Act’s statutory requirements for matters to be read aloud in court before the court may accept the guilty plea. Draft clauses 36 and 37 would remove open justice safeguards which assist public scrutiny and understanding of the courts, since the current Acts enable the substance of the case or evidence which forms part of it to be heard in open court, so that the proceedings can be properly understood and subject to public oversight. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThese provisions would also diminish the media’s ability to report the pertinent evidence if it no longer has to be read out in open court and thereby impeded the dissemination of contemporaneous fair and accurate reports of court proceedings, with statutory defences against claims of defamation and contempt. The removal of existing statutory rights would also lead to a corresponding reduction in statutory rights of public inspection and media inspection of court documentation, with or without the leave of the court, which assist accurate reporting.
default&#xa0;
defaultMinimum statutory requirements for material to be read out in open court would apparently be lost. There might not be the same degree of public consultation, discussion and detailed Parliamentary scrutiny over rules, as at present might be possible in respect of amendment of primary legislation to effect changes, if further changes to reduce rather than expand open justice requirements, by way of the rules, were suggested.
default&#xa0;
default4.Policedefault Powers:  Objections to removal of statutory safeguards in primary legislation for journalistic material, including  confidential journalistic material and protection of sources, against police powers of search, seizure, production and retention.default&#xa0;defaultClause 38: Criminal Procedure: powers to make Criminal Procedure Rulesdefault&#xa0;defaultThe Newspaper Society objects strongly to the proposals which remove statutory safeguards for journalistic material (including but not limited to confidential material relevant to the protection of sources) against police applications for production orders, warrants and governing applications for return of seized material, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Terrorism Act 2000, Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The substantive statutory safeguards against unjustified police action are obviously vital.  Procedural matters  
defaultsuch as proper prior notification of police applications  and inter 
defaultpartes
default hearings, enabling the application of those safeguards by proper testing of the police submissions and evidence, are obviously as important.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are alarmed that removal of statutory protections of freedom of expression is regarded as a deregulatory measure.  PACE 1984 currently sets out the statutory framework which Parliament intended to guarantee this protection. There is nothing within the draft Bill to ensure that any Criminal Procedure Rules must replace or replicate the existing safeguards in PACE 1984, even those specifically removed from the Act by the proposed amendments. Its  measures could be interpreted as encouragement to reduce not strengthen the freedom of expression safeguards for journalistic material and confidential sources against inappropriate use of police powers, whatever they might be-  inappropriate police demands for production of journalistic material to them, or inappropriate applications for or execution of, warrants for search, sift and seizure of journalistic material and other information, or  retention of material, or the inappropriate  deployment of other relevant police powers against the media and others in respect of journalistic material. There is no indication as to what such substitute rules, if any, are envisaged or what new regime might be proposed through such rules. The Draft Bill’s proposals might enable the current statutory safeguards to be removed, reduced, weakened or otherwise radically altered. There would not be the same degree of prior detailed public consultation or Parliamentary scrutiny, as currently required for any changes to the primary legislation
default&#xa0;
defaultThere is already concern about the use of police powers under PACE, counter- terrorism legislation and other measures in relation to obtaining material and information from journalists and others or the protection of sources (including any that might be deployed even in investigations into payment for criminal memoirs). The media has already made clear its opposition to any legislative changes to PACE that would weaken any protections given by the longstanding PACE provisions on journalistic material. The procedures have been well used and are therefore well understood by the media, police and courts. There is already strong media concern about the possible effect of any forthcoming Home Office consultation, following the 
defaultLeveson
default Report’s suggestions for changes which would weaken such safeguards as exist to protect freedom of expression and press freedom, including protection of confidential sources. These provisions of the draft Deregulation Bill suggest that there is not even to be coherent consultation. This creates the danger that the cumulative effect of any changes proposed cannot be properly considered and so adverse consequences cannot be properly evaluated and avoided.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe therefore hope that these provisions in clause 38 of the draft Bill would be omitted from any Deregulation Bill introduced into Parliament.
