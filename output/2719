defaultWritten evidence submitted by the defaultRoyal Town Planning InstitutedefaultIntroductiondefault defaultThe Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) is please
defaultd
default to respond to the call for written evidence to the 
defaultEnvironmental Audit Committee Inquiry to 
defaultexamine the 
defaultCode for Sustainable Homes and the Housing Standards Review
default.
defaultThe RTPI is the largest professional institute for planners in Europe, representing some 23,000 spatial planners. The Institute seeks to advance the science and art of spatial planning for the benefit of the public. As well as promoting spatial planning, the RTPI develops and shapes policy affecting the built environment, works to raise professional standards and supports members through continuous education, training and development.
defaultThe views in this 
defaultsubmission
default follow consultation with the members of the RTPI, and specifically the members of the 
defaultEnglish Policy Panel
default. This 
defaultPanel has a 
defaultvaried membership with experts in the full range of 
defaultplanning policy fields
default represented.
defaultSubmission default1.1
default              
defaultWe support the simplification and rationalisation of standards – the Taylor Review of Planning Guidance 
defaulthas 
defaultshow
defaultn
default what can be achieved 
defaultand the potential benefits. However,
default if the objective of clarity is to be delivered, rather than additional confusion
default from poorly focused and uncoordinated change
default, 
defaultthe RTPI believes that 
defaultmore work is required.
default1.2 
default              
defaultA good indication of the additional work required is given by the Challenge Panel in
default 
default‘
defaultTowards more Sustainable Homes
default’.
default1.3 
default              
defaultThe RTPI believes that the Government 
defaultshould set down a clear, timetabled and 
defaultaspirational
default plan for housing standards, in particular showing how the ‘zero carbon by 2016’ commitment is to be delivered by all parties and showing which elements of the Code for Sustainable Homes are being dropped – if any. 
default1.4
default              
defaultWith the 
defaultNational Planning Policy Framework (
defaultNPPF
default)
default including a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’ it would seem 
defaulta perverse and 
defaultretrograde to act 
defaultin any way 
defaultto compromise 
defaultoverall 
defaultsustainability objectives.
default2. defaultThe Role of the Building Regulationsdefault2.1
default              
defaultIt is the RTPI’s view that t
defaulthe G
defaultovernment
default should move immediately to update and amend the Building Regulations rather than ask that, generally overstretched and under-resourced, 
defaultLocal Planning Authorities (
defaultLPAs
default)
default should institute Local Plan reviews to justify and incorporate standards as a merely interim measure. 
default2.2
default              
defaultIt is inevitable that LPA positions on standards will be even less predictable in this interim period whereas builders broadly know where they stand at the present. It is notable 
defaultand concerning 
defaultthat the public sector costs of implementing two changes – through Local Plans and then the Building Regula
defaulttions – have not been assessed.
default2.3
default              
defaultIf the review process for updating and incorporating additions to the Building Regulations is not fit for purpose 
defaultie
default it is too slow and/or unwieldy
default as is implied by the Review document
default, then this deficiency must be addressed to provide the assurance required by local authorities who will be foregoing the potential to innovate with standards as changed expectations are identified.
default3. defaultEco-friendly Standardsdefault3.1
default              
defaultThe RTPI is concerned that too little attention has been given to the potential for higher standards to be justified and marketed on the basis of the significant user savings achievable. 
default3.2
default              
defaultIn particular there is potential for lenders to incorporate more explicitly the savings as an incentive mechanism into their loan-to-income evaluations for lending.
default4. Setting defaultAspirationaldefault Standardsdefault4.1
default              
defaultIt is noted 
defaultfrom
default the Impact Assessment that, “Based on discussions with local authorities and other partners, we have estimated that around 90% of new homes in London are built to the Lifetime Homes standard and 5% outside of London”. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThis seems to indicate that where ‘headroom’ exists in the pricing of housing, so-called 
defaultaspirational
default standards are adopted and welcomed. 
default4.2
default              
defaultTherefore, as 
defaultit would a
defaultppear 
defaultthat we are
default entering another period of increasing house prices, to be matched by increases in supply, it is all the more important that the pathway to raising standards to an equal level across England is 
default&#xa0;
defaultset out now and mechanisms set in motion.
