[normal]Rathbone—Written Evidence[bold]House of Lords 
[normal]Inquiry into 
[normal]EU 
[normal]Youth Unemployment
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Rathbone believe
[normal]s
[normal] th
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]new 
[normal]EU action to tackle youth unemployment does respe
[normal]ct individual Member States powers in the areas of social and employment affairs. 
[normal]I
[normal]ndividual states are able to provide any additional 
[normal]necessary 
[normal]interventions
[normal], providing measures and
[normal] restrictions to EU initiatives
[normal]. They can
[normal] ensure that these are consistent 
[normal]with 
[normal]and can be accommodated 
[normal]within
[normal] 
[normal]national 
[normal]and
[normal] regional 
[normal]economic and social conditions
[normal], f
[normal]or example, taking account of the difference between rural and urban economies and social conditions.
[normal]We
[normal] further believe the
[normal] proble
[normal]m of youth unemployment
[normal] across the EU
[normal] is so great
[normal] today
[normal] that there is the 
[normal]potenti
[normal]al 
[normal]for serious social 
[normal]and economic 
[normal]consequences of not addressing the situation
[normal].
[normal] The economic productivity of Member States is based on having a skilled and flexible workforce
[normal]. Long term youth unemployment reduces competitive advantage and increases welfare dependency with associated poor health impacts.  
[normal].
[normal] Many Member States are struggling with wider economic conditions and without EU support would
[normal] not be able to tackle the
[normal] is
[normal]sue
[normal] of youth unemployment
[normal] without 
[normal]cross bord
[normal]er transnational interventions.
[normal]We would also like to make the point that the 6 
[normal]B
[normal]illion 
[normal]E
[normal]uros that has been 
[normal]committed
[normal] to tackle youth unemployment
[normal] via the YEI
[normal] is a very low amount
[normal] of
[normal] funding in comparison to the problem,
[normal] r
[normal]epresenting around 850 
[normal]E
[normal]uros per individual young unemployed person
[normal].
[normal]Rathbone
[normal] recommend that it is the Member State which i
[normal]s asked to provide any ma
[normal]tch funding required for
[normal] programmes rather than individual organisations
[normal] and 
[normal]service delivery is then publically procured. 
[normal] Moreover, that a differentiated approach is adopted in the allocation of funding to better reflect Member S
[normal]tates particular economic and social conditions. It is further recommended that a differentiated approach is applied more vigorously within countries receiving funding. 
[normal]Furthermore, the restrictions of YEI funds to those Member States with
[normal] youth unemploym
[normal]ent above 25%
[normal] signif
[normal]icantly
[normal] disadvant
[normal]ages
[normal] those nations who have pockets
[normal] of youth unemployment above 25% for example Ireland, UK, Netherlands
[normal] but
[normal] where 
[normal] the national percen
[normal]tage is below the 25% threshold making it ineligible for YEI funding. We agree and s
[normal]trongly support the introduction of 
[normal]EU 
[normal]Yo
[normal]uth Action Teams to instruct and support Member States to reprofile their European Structural Funds towards reducing youth unemploymen
[normal]t. There is an obvious problem when
[normal] collectively EU Member States are currently s
[normal]pending more on subsidies for cows than on initiatives to reduce youth unemployment.  
[normal]The priority now needs to be the implementation of the YEI 
[normal]programme and wider ESF initiatives as the need
[normal]s
[normal] of young people who are unemployed, som
[normal]e for many
[normal] years now are becoming more pressing.
[normal] In summary, to ensure success there needs to be a greater effort to ensure all the interventions are joined up as a com
[normal]prehensive action plan
[normal].
[normal] Overarching coordination is vital if we are to avoid a piecemeal approach. Solving youth unemployment cannot be achieved with isolated interventions; these need to include addressing wider policy issues such as education, 
[normal]social wel
[normal]fare and mobility for young people.
