"&#xa0;\nAFS0090Written Evidence submitted by the IAAThe IAA (Independent Academies Association) \nis \nthe national membership organisation for leaders of academies. \n \nWe are a non-partisan representative organisation committed to supporting our members in the advancement of the education and life chances of all pupils and students in our care. \n \nAn acknowledged and respected national body, we are ‘the voice of academies’\n, run by and on behalf of our continually growing membership. We play a leading role in the development of the wider academy movement, providing help, support and advice to existing, new and converting academies. \n \nWe are the only independent organisation d\nedicated to supporting academies and have a track record of over 20 years’ experience in providing leadership to all types of state-funded independent schools.\n \n \nOur work includes lobbying \ngovernment and opposition on matters relating to education policy\n as\n it affects academies.\n2.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe IAA (Independent Academies Association\n) firmly believes that the overarching principle and foremost priority of the academies \nmovement\n is the urgent need to deliver high quality education to all students and pupils.  \n2.2.\n&#xa0; \nEvidential data demonstrates that the \nacademies \nprogramme has been effective in \nraising standards\n, with the impact being greatest among sponsored academies\n.\n \n2.3.\n&#xa0; \nMore could be \ndone to incentivise increased numbers of good and outstanding converter academies to sponsor failing schools, particularly those that predominantly serve disadvantaged children.\n2.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe \naccelerated pace of\n academisation\n has caused some issues, most notably in \nthe variable quality of sponsors and governing bodies.\n \nWhen problems occur in this area, they must be resolved more quickly than hitherto. Further reform of \nschool \ngovernance\n \nis recommended.\n2.5.\n&#xa0; \nAny temptation to reinvent the ‘middle tier’ along \nprevious \nlocal\n authority lines should be \nresisted\n: instead, greater impetus should be provided to system leadership \non a sub-regional basis \nas part of a truly self-improving system.\n2.6.\n&#xa0; \nLocal authorities \ncould\n continue to \nhave strategic and statutory roles to play but they \nmust not be at the expense of academy independence or autonomy.\n2.7.\n&#xa0; \nThe IAA welcomes the introduction of sub-regional Schools Commissioners and Headteacher Boards as a proportionate response to \nthe ongoing expansion of the academies programme\n.\n2.8.\n&#xa0; \nAcademy chains have a crucial role to play in the new educational landscape, with \nmany demonstrating outstanding ability to transform education\n.   \n2.9.\n&#xa0; \nAcademy status is equally relevant to primary schools as it is to secondary schools and growth in the number\ns of primary academies should be supported and encouraged.\n&#xa0;\n3.1.\n&#xa0; \nIn 2010, the NAO noted that, o\nverall, academies \nincrease\n the rate of improvement in GCSE results when compared wi\nth their predecessor schools. \n Furthermore\n, the proportion of \nacademy students\n achieving five or more A*-C \nat GCSE\n \nhad\n improved\n at a faster rate than in maintained schools\n, particularly those\n with similar intakes\n.\n  \nIn 2011 and 2012 schools with academy st\natus made, on average, more progress between KS2 and GCSE than schools without academy status\n.\n3.2.\n&#xa0; \nThose sponsored academies\n that were established early on in the programme replaced the worst schools in the country and, in nearly every case, transformed provision and dramatically and very rapidly improved outcomes. The focus was on removing \nfrom the system \nthe rump of the 200 \nl\nowest\n performing schools\n, where underperformance was historically endemic and stubbornly ingrained and which were situated in some of the most disadvantaged and challenged areas of the UK. \n3.3.\n&#xa0; \nThe fact that the early academy sponsors turned around these schoo\nls in the most \ndifficult\n of circumstances, with few very failures, is testament to the efficacy of the programme and it is, therefore, no surprise that we have recently witnessed \na \nresurgence in this approach\n, which is welcomed by our association.\n3.4.\n&#xa0; \nIt can also be no accident that the \nsuccess of initiatives such as London Challenge was\n contemporaneous with\n a period of mass academisation of schools within the area.\n3.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe most compelling evidence for the effectiveness of academies has come in the recently\n published Ofsted Annual Report, which notes that: \nSponsor-led academies are delivering a step change in performance for chronically\n underperforming schools. Academies established in 2007 have narrowed the attainment gap of five or \nmore A* to C grades at \nGCSE, including English and \nmathematics, by eight percentage points.\n \n3.6.\n&#xa0; \nThe report also goes on to state that “\nAcademy converters are outperforming all non-academy schools” and that “Sponsor-led academies that have been open since 2007 have made the most im\nprovement at Key Stage 4”, suggesting that the longer an academy is established, the greater its impact\n over time\n.\n￼\n \n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe IAA acknowledges\n and welcomes the moves made by Ministers in recent times to increase the rigour in selecting academy sponsors / free school proposers, in assessing the capacity of existing sponsors to take on additional academies\n,\n and in pausing or halting the expansion \nof chains where there have been concerns about academic performance or financial management.\n \n4.2.\n&#xa0; \nHowever\n, the process \nleading to\n ministerial approval and subsequent academisation remains unwieldy and can be painfully slow\n,\n not only for the prospective sponsor\n but for the children attending \nfailing schools, their parents \nand \nthe \nstaff working in\n them\n.\n \n Schools can find themselves in a protracted state of limbo, where uncertainty and the inability to move forward can impact detrimentally on stakeholder confidenc\ne, the quality of provision and sometimes on outcomes.\n4.3.\n&#xa0; \nT\nhe DfE might usefully consider further refinements to the two approaches to academisation, the so-called ‘fast-track’ and ‘fully sponsored’ routes, which are rightly based on assessments of potential \nrisk, in order to ensure that, where necessary, children’s education can be transformed without delay. \n4.4.\n&#xa0; \nWith regard to the programme as a whole, however, in some ways the converse is true, as t\nhe \naccelerated pace of\n academisation\n has caused some issues, mo\nst notably in the variable quality of sponsors and governing bodies.\n \n4.5.\n&#xa0; \nWhen problems occur in this area, they must be resolved more \nreadily\n than hitherto. \nThe Department should act more quickly to reassign a sponsor/trust where a mistake has been made\n.\n4.6.\n&#xa0; \nExisting governing bodies of schools rated less than good by Ofsted should not be involved in choos\ning their own academy sponsor. \nIt is appropriate that, where a local authority has worked closely with a school and knows it well, they should have a voice i\nn respect of the choice of sponsor but the local authority should not have any power of veto.  \n4.7.\n&#xa0; \nWe acknowledge that there is less “soft sponsorship” of schools than was the case at one time, but more can still be done and similar ‘tightening up’ may be nee\nded in the free schools programme. \n4.8.\n&#xa0; \nTo support sponsor selection and to ensure rigorous accountability, we\n need a transparent, easy to access register of sponsors \nthat\n for each sponsor\n includes\n:\n a list of schools they run\n;\n the\n Ofsted\n judgments of each of t\nhose schools\n;\n and\n the\n improvement\ns in progress and attainment that have\n been achieved\n.\n \n4.9.\n&#xa0; \nFurther reform of \nschool \ngovernance, \nfor example\n to align it more with\n the most successful practice in\n the business sector, is recommended\n, \nwith \nvery clear and transpar\nent accountability, \nmuch smaller boards of non-executive directors, fewer committees and more performance management of governors than is currently the case in the majority of schools and academies.  Within a group setting, the role of the Executive Princi\npal / Chief Executive Officer with regard to governance should be more clearly defined and emphasised, as should that of other Executive Directors.  I\nt may be that radical \ntransformation\n \nof governance \nis required in order to help bring about the next step \nchange in the education system as a whole\n.\n4.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCertainly there remain issues with the recruitment and retention of governors, directors and trustees of sufficient calibre and with adequate capacity \nto fulfil the roles and duties as currently defined and govern\nment would do well to consider means of incentivising the best people to take up these positions\n and to encourage businesses to promote them amongst their workforce\n.\n4.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe IAA s\nupport\ns\n the benchmarking of \nexisting \nHeadteachers \nof failing schools\n, recognising\n that in some cases, for instance where the Headteacher is a recent appointment, a change in leadership may not necessarily be the most appropriate course of action\n.\n4.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nOur association would defend \ncompulsion\n as a route to academisation\n, but \nit should always \nbe \nbased on \nsound \nevidence\n and \nsophisticated\n judgement\ns about \na school’s\n performance and capacity to improve (or otherwise).\n4.13.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is important that academisation is not seen as a punishment but is viewed as being of benefit to children, young people and a lo\ncal community. The DfE may wish to review what messages are communicated to schools ‘in scope’.\n4.14.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHitherto, conversion to academy status has involved the closing of the predecessor school/s and reopening as a new school: this process should be maintained as \nthere needs to be every opportunity to rebrand, ‘re-culture’\n and adopt new approaches.\n4.15.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Free S\nchool\ns\n programme should be more systematically targeted\n in areas of basic need\n (i.e. where there is a significant shortage of school places).\n4.16.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe also believe t\nhat\n \nit is appropriate to open free schools\n where \nthe \nexisting \nquality of \nprovision is poor\n and standards are low.\n4.17.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\nny\n mechanism for opening \nnew \nschools must be \nbalanced\n by a mechanism for closing schools\n that suffer from endemic poor performance.\n  The option of closure should \nbe a mandatory consideration every time a school faces compulsory conversion \nto academy status \nor is \nunder threat of being moved\n to another sponsor\n.\n4.18.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, an outstanding school that is a member \nof an academy chain should have the option to leave its group and set up as a separate sponsor and take on one or more failing schools, providing that doing so will demonstrably not impact negatively on the capacity of the existing sponsor.\n&#xa0;\n5.1.\n&#xa0; \nThe number of academies whose performance causes concern is a very small percentage of the total.\n5.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe current mechanism of issui\nng sponsors with pre warning notices and, if subsequently necessary, warning letters, has led to considerable and quick improvements in these academies.\n5.3.\n&#xa0; \nIn extreme circumstances, where it is considered that standards are unlikely to rise quickly enough, it\n is right and proper that the Secretary of State direct a\n change\n of s\nponsor\n.\n5.4.\n&#xa0; \nIt is important, however, that \naction \nis d\necisive \nand taken without undue delay, in order that children do not miss the opportunity of a good quality education.\n5.5.\n&#xa0; \nAs the programme expands further, \nthe systematic growth of school-to-\nschool support\n will be essential, especially as the Secretary of State implements \na model of \ndevolution to regional regulatory and advisory bodies, as described below, founded on the work\n of successful system leaders and the Office of the Schools Commissioner.  \n5.6.\n&#xa0; \nIt will be a vital corollary to such a framework that the identification and development of these system leaders is accurate and valid.  Therefore, schools and academies should onl\ny be judged ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted if they can demonstrate that they are outward-\nfacing\n and that they have successfully led school improvement beyond their individual institution.\n5.7.\n&#xa0; \nWe \nalso \nhope that the introduction of \nthe ‘P\nrogress 8\n’ measure\n will lead to\n a better understanding of what is\n an outstanding\n school\n in terms of making a difference to children’s learning\n and development\n, and \nof \nwhat makes an\n outstanding\n school\n leader\n.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.1.\n&#xa0; \nLocal authorities should: \nprovide the \nstrategic \nvision for the \neconomic and social \ndevelopment of their defined local area; set key goals; identify challenges\n;\n and provide the framework within which all education and training providers can eff\nectively operate in partnership\n.\n6.2.\n&#xa0; \nClarit\ny is needed regarding the duties of local authorities with regard to education, which should be limited to a narrow set of statutory functions, e.g. safeguarding children, admissions and special educational needs.\n \n I\nt is important that all statutory servic\nes that local authorities provide are of high quality\n. \n6.3.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, any local authority powers, including \nany\n that \nmay \nrelate to promoting high standards in schools, should not impinge on academy independence or autonomy: to do so would undermine a fundamenta\nl premise of the academies movement, namely that with greater freedoms come greater responsibilities. \n6.4.\n&#xa0; \nWithin this context, it is inappropriate for local authorities or, indeed, the Department for Education (DfE) to have a role in ‘supporting’ academies an\nd free schools. It is far more fitting and sustainable in the long term to seek to promote a self-improving system\n where the very best practitioners are always \noutward looking\n and help others to improve rapidly through a school-to-school model.\n \n6.5.\n&#xa0; \nThe IAA we\nlcomes recent statements from Ministers and officials regarding the intention to regionalise more of the DfE’s work and to devolve certain functions and powers to sub-regional Schools Commissioners and Headteacher Boards.  It is wholly appropriate to \nmake \nmore use of \nsuccessful \nsystem leaders \nin this way and to exploit the local knowledge of those closer to the chalk face than officials in Whitehall\n by devolving as many powers as possible\n.\n  \n6.6.\n&#xa0; \nIf, as has been suggested, these new bodies are to be responsible \nfor the early identification of underperformance and for brokering improvement and/or structural solutions, then they should also carry overarching duties in respect of overall performance within their sub-regions. \n6.7.\n&#xa0; \nIn conjunction with the sub-regional \nHeadteacher Boards, i\nt may be appropriate to consider a\nn expanded\n \nrole\n for NLGs (National Leaders of Governance), perhaps in an advisory capacity and/or by establishing regional panels of NLGs \nas a resource to assist with the devolved system leadership fun\nctions.  For instance, outstanding Chairs of Governors might be able to advise on sponsor selection. \n&#xa0;\n7.1.\n&#xa0; \nAcademy chains have a crucial role to play in the new educational landscape, \nwith many demonstrating outstanding a\nbility to transform education. \nT\nhe most successful epitomis\ne\n outstanding governance, leadership\n and financial management and have\n rapidly and dramatically improved\n provision and outcomes\n in schools where previously there was endemic failure\n.\n7.2.\n&#xa0; \nThe very best chains focus on a particular local area, where they maximise the benefits of joint staffing, CPD and economies of scale wit\nhin a \nshared vision and ethos. \nThey expand in a measure\nd\n manner, building capacity just ahead of need and ensure an unrelenting focus on the core purposes of teaching, learning and achievement.\n7.3.\n&#xa0; \nAs an association, we support and encourage the regionalisation of l\narge national chains in order to achieve the benefits outlined above.\n7.4.\n&#xa0; \nThe IAA is in favour of strong \npublic \naccountability and s\nupport\ns\n the inspection\n by Ofsted\n of \nacademy \nchains\n.\n7.5.\n&#xa0; \nChains should be subject to a desktop data dashboard\n exercise\n highlighting the performance of schools within the group. \n7.6.\n&#xa0; \nWhere the desktop \nanalysis \nshows a chain’s performance \nto be\n less than good, they will be subject to inspection.\n \n7.7.\n&#xa0; \nThis exercise should NOT be based on an aggregate average of the academies’ perfor\nmance within the chain but where there is any individual academy facing performance problems, they should be identified and \nthe sponsor \nquestioned.\n7.8.\n&#xa0; \nThere is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to \nthe establishment, structure or modus operandi of multi-academy \ntrusts or \nchains, meaning that \nthe framework\n will need \nto be flexible and inspections differentiated\n \nfor \nvarying contexts\n.\n7.9.\n&#xa0; \nWe also see a place for a searchable directory of academy sponsors / free school operators (see \n4\n.7\n above) which, as with the inspect\nion of chains, should include intelligent, sophisticated and contextualised judgments that take into account improvement trajectories, for example the time taken by a sponsor to move a predecessor school in special measures to a good or outstanding academy\n.  \n7.10.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nfinancial \n‘top slice’ \nlevied by a chain \nshould be more transparent and included in \nthis directory (or \nchain performance tables\n)\n, comparing like for like and detailing the services that are provided for this fee. \n7.11.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFurthermore, it is appropriate for \nEFA to audit c\nhains\n to ensure sound financial management and governance and value for money use of public funds.\n7.12.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn respect of governance arrangements, c\nhains \nmust be free \nto decide what is appropriate for them and the communities they serve. \n There\n should be transparency about structure, resources and decisions, and a clear expectation that \nthe \ncommunity voice will be heard\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.1.\n&#xa0; \nAcademy status is equally relevant to primary schools as it is to secondary schools and growth in the numbers of primary academies should be supported \nand encouraged.\n8.2.\n&#xa0; \nAcademy status represents a particular mind-set and approach to leadership and management, \nwhere \ncomplete responsibility for the performance of one’s own organisation is adopted and therefore \nacademisation\n is appropriate for any school, irr\nespective of age phase or size.\n8.3.\n&#xa0; \nHowever, there are certain challenges that can be faced by small schools in respect of the additional responsibilitie\ns that come with academy status, difficulties in creating a high reliability organisation (given the increa\nsed likelihood of key person dependency) and the sustainability of leadership\n. \n8.4.\n&#xa0; \nTherefore, cluster arrangements are sometimes appropriate and are often most effective when one or more outstanding school is part of the group.\n8.5.\n&#xa0; \nWhether such arrangements are o\nn the basis of a primary only collaborative, ‘a\nll through\n’ structures or otherwise cross-phase, \ngreater v\nalue for money \ncan be achieved\n through \neconomies of scale\n, the group can recruit and retain\n \nhigh\ner\n quality staff \ncommitted to \nthe cluster\n, new career pathways can be developed \nand \nthe opportunities to share staff, best practice and CPD across and between schools within the group \nare beneficial to the raising of standards.\n \n&#xa0;\n9.1.\n&#xa0;
