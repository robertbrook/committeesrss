defaultSome farmers only grow one crop because

defaulte
default produce from that crop is fed to their livestock
default (poultry farmers)
default.  They will now have to grow three crops, two will have to be sold and taken off farm by lorry and feed bought to replace the loss of produce
default, this will have to be
default brought onto the farm

defaultSome farmers grow two crops because that is what their land is suited to and fits in with their farming system
default&#xa0;
default-      Others farmers, usually large farmers, will have no difficulty in g
defaultrowing three or more 
default       crops.  It may be that more than one crop is fed to their livestock (dairy farmers) with  the other crops sold off farm

defaultThe British Government always bends over backwards to keep the European Commission happy even though 
defaultthe  
defaultBritish Government
default, with taxpayers money, 
defaultpays into the 
defaultEuropean Union more than the Government gets back.  Is it not time for the British Government to say that any changes to the CAP will in no way disadvantage British farmers even if the European Commission are not happy with that.

defaultWith the population of hi
defaults country increasing rapidly it should be more important to ensure food production
default for the majority of the people in this country, even to the extent of being self sufficient in some foods,
default rather than environmental benefits
default which benefit to the few.
default&#xa0;
defaultBritish farmers are well aware that this Government would like to do away with subsidies but would the general public be happy having to pay more for food.  The farmer may get a subsidy but in fact so do the general public as the subsidy keeps down the cos
defaultt of food.  The Government should ask 
defaultitself: do you want cheap food to help keep the cost of living down and so keep the general public happy or food production with no subsidy that forces food prices and the cost of living up.
