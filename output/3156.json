"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Susan Hedley (TIC 118)\n1)&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nYesterday, whilst visiting my local library, I happened to find a newsletter containing an article which\n&#xa0;\nI think might be very pertinent to your inquiry.\nI realise that the deadline for submissions has long passed, and that you are therefore probably not allowed to consider this further evidence.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHowever, I thought that I should at least give you the chance to consider it if appropriate.\n&#xa0;\n I am contacting you personally because I wasn't sure which of the Transport Committee staff would be the most appropriate to address in the first instance.\n&#xa0;\n Before sending this, I have deliberately refrained from looking at the other submissions which have been published so that what I am now saying is a personal view and is not influenced by them.\n&#xa0;\nThe article I am referring to is in \nCAN News Summer 2013. This is the newsletter of Community Action Northumberland.\nThe article is on Page 5, and is about \nNEED, a disability and community transport organisation based in \nAlnwick\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe 10th paragraph\n&#xa0;\n says\n \n\"In order to subsidise our community work NEED tenders for and has been awarded contracts with a number of partners which include Home to School contracts for Northumberland County Council, Secure Transport Services and Driver Only Services for Northumberland, Tyne &amp; Wear NHS Foundation Trust, and Passenger Transport Services for North East Ambulance Service.\"\n&#xa0;\nThis seems to confirm to me what I have been suspecting over the last year, that the number of NEED vehicles which I see operating in the locality has increased greatly.\n&#xa0;\n Whilst I certainly do not want\n&#xa0;\nto jeopardise the good work of a community organization which does essential work for the most vulnerable and needy people in our community, I do feel that there might be some risks in this situation.\n&#xa0;\nIf NEED has been tendering for contracts, then it is presumably in competition with other transport businesses.\n&#xa0;\n The large national and international transport companies are unlikely to be affected, because they seem to concentrate on the high volume main routes, and so \nI suspect that it is the few remaining local transport companies, both buses and taxis, who NEED is competing with in order to get money to subsidise its community work.\n&#xa0;\n The viability of these companies is therefore being squeezed between the national companies whose scale allows them to use the most \ncompetative\n pricing on the most lucrative routes, and NEED, who, so far as I understand it, can use volunteer drivers, and has less exacting legal demands to comply with in terms of vehicles and operating procedures.\n&#xa0;\n I think that there is therefore likely to be a\n real danger of jeopardising the viability of the local transport businesses who together provide a transport network which serves the needs of the whole community and not just very specific sections of it.\n&#xa0;\n These transport companies also provide much needed employment, and I suspect that they are certainly not profiteering, but are continuing to operate under very difficult conditions in order to provide services in the particular communities where they are based and\n&#xa0;\ncommitted to.\n&#xa0;\n This applies to taxi services as well as bus services, because it is the taxis who are there to fill in the \ngaps\n&#xa0;\nwhich the buses cannot for those committed bus passengers who can contemplate spending a large amount of money on a taxi when necessary.\n&#xa0;\n Taxi services have also been suffering increasingly difficult trading conditions during the recession, because fewer and fewer people can afford to go out at all, let alone use a taxi.\nLocal bus companies in this area which I know of include \nRothbury\n Motors, now based in \nAlnwick\n, Glen Valley Tours of \nWooler\n, and \nTravelsure\n of Belford, all of whom may be able to tell you of how they are currently managing.\n&#xa0;\nI realise that the various bodies who NEED is operating contracts for&#xa0;may be so short of funds that they are unable to consider any alternative, but I do think that this might well risk creating further problems&#xa0;for communities in the long term.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2) &#xa0;\nIt occurs to me that another partial solution to the problem of funding public transport \nin rural areas would be to \nallow pensioners to use their free passes for the whole day, and not just after the rush hour has finished.\n&#xa0;\n In a rural area, though there may be a significant number of commuters, they are unlikely to fill a whole bus, and so it could probably accommodate early-bird retired passengers as well without any problem. This would allow retired rural passengers more viable connections to the rest of the public transport network, and would alleviate overcrowding of elderly people on the first bus available to them after the rush hour \n(e.g. the number 14 \nThropton\n to \nMorpeth\n service, recently altered by Arriva and Northumberland County Council because of this problem)\n.\n&#xa0;\n \nIt might also mean that some services could be amalgamated so that fewer services needed to be run in the middle of the working day.&#xa0;\n Of course some mid-day services would still be needed to serve those who have to take a lot of medication in the morning, and have to wait for some hours until it has taken effect before they are able to do much.\n&#xa0;\nOctober 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
