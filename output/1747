[normal]BNI0015[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Written evidence submitted by [bold]IBOA [bold]The[bold] Finance Union[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.[bold]              [bold]Introduction[bold]&#xa0;[bold]1.1
[normal]              
[normal]IBOA The Finance Union represents over 18,000 employees in the financial 
[normal]sector
[normal] in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain – predominantly in banking 
[normal]– 
[normal]of 
[normal]whom
[normal] approximately 5,000 work in Northern Ireland. Members of the Union 
[normal]work in
[normal] many areas within the sector, including 
[normal]some 
[normal]managerial grades.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]              
[normal]In Northern Ireland, the Union’s membership is principally located within the four main retail banks: Bank of Ireland, 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank, First Trust Bank and Ulster Bank. Since the banking crisis began, the Union has also secured the right to represent staff 
[normal]in
[normal] the former Irish Nationwide Building Society – which, having merged with Anglo Irish Bank to form the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (now in special liquidation), also operates in Northern Ireland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]              
[normal]Throughout its history, IBOA has contribut
[normal]ed
[normal] to t
[normal]he development of the financial services sector in both jurisdictions in Ireland. 
[normal]As well as representing employees 
[normal]in their own institutions on industrial relations
[normal] and professional
[normal] 
[normal]issues
[normal], the Union has 
[normal]also 
[normal]contributed to national discourse on 
[normal]developme
[normal]nts
[normal] affecting the sector.

[normal]              
[normal]As the representative body for a 
[normal]key 
[normal]stake-h
[normal]older interest in Irish banking,
[normal] 
[normal]IBOA has a unique perspective based on its 
[normal]work
[normal] on behalf of bank 
[normal]staff
[normal] in three jurisdictions. After some general observations on recent developm
[normal]ents in Northern Ireland, we propose to focus 
[normal]on
[normal] four main 
[normal]area
[normal]s:
[normal](a)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]the structure and governance of banks in Northern Ireland

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.[bold]              [bold]General Overview[bold]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]              
[normal]The transformation of Northern Ireland’s major 
[normal]retail
[normal] banks 
[normal]over
[normal] the last five years has been unprecedented in its speed and depth. In terms of ownership
[normal],
[normal] two banks are
[normal],
[normal] to all intents and purposes
[normal],
[normal] State-owned (although by different States); one bank enjoys minority State support with a significant North American shareholding; while the fourth remains in private ownership with its 
[normal]Danish
[normal] parent driving the most ambitious changes in its operating mod
[normal]el.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]              
[normal]None of the banks
[normal],
[normal] which have experienced 
[normal]major
[normal] changes in ownership
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]actively 
[normal]sought 
[normal]them: in each case State intervention w
[normal]as a last resort to prevent 
[normal]a worse
[normal] outcome. But in all cases 
[normal]key
[normal] decisions about the ownership or operation of these institutions – which have profound implications for the
[normal]ir
[normal] staff and customers 
[normal]in Northern Ireland 
[normal]– have been taken outside the jurisdiction – in 
[normal]either London
[normal], Edinburgh, Dublin or Copenhagen.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]              
[normal]Nort
[normal]hern Ireland may 
[normal]also suffer 
[normal]in terms of the quality of investment in its economic, commercial and social infrastructure. Northern Ireland may not 
[normal]rate
[normal] 
[normal]highly in
[normal] 
[normal]either strategic or operational priorities
[normal] 
[normal]– as Ulster Bank
[normal]’s customers
[normal] will readily testify 
[normal]when 
[normal]a
[normal] temporary
[normal] IT glitch for 
[normal]RBS and NatWest 
[normal]customers 
[normal]became
[normal] an IT meltdown for Ulster Bank – lasti
[normal]ng weeks.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] absence of any locally
[normal]-
[normal]owned banking institutions
[normal] may also have a negative impact on
[normal] the availability of credit within Northern Ireland
[normal] since it
[normal] turn
[normal]s
[normal] on lending policy decisions made elsewhere – by 
[normal]parent board
[normal]s 
[normal]with no
[normal] specific concern for the good 
[normal]of
[normal] Northern Ireland.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]              
[normal]Danske[bold] Bank[bold] (formerly Northern Bank) is arguably the most financially sound of the major 
[normal]retail
[normal] banks operating in
[normal] Northern Ireland – since its more prudent
[normal] 
[normal]approach to lending meant that it 
[normal]largely avoided
[normal] the surge in speculative property lending 
[normal]which drove
[normal] Irish banking 
[normal]to the brink of 
[normal]collapse in 2008-9. 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank has recorded operating profits for a number of 
[normal]years and expects to return to overall profitability by the end of 
[normal]2013
[normal] – even after losses for impairments are 
[normal]included
[normal]. However, the position of 
[normal]Danske’s
[normal] Northern Ireland business contrast
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] its Republic of Ireland 
[normal]operation 
[normal](formerly National Irish Bank) – which became heavily involved in 
[normal]property 
[normal]lending 
[normal]before 
[normal]2008 and suffered 
[normal]accordingly
[normal]. The complete overhaul of 
[normal]Danske’s
[normal] Republic of Ireland business – with the virtual elimination of its branch network and its 
[normal]remodelling
[normal] as a niche business bank – has resulted in the transfer of some call centre traffic and processing work to units in Northern Ireland –
[normal] enhancing
[normal] the
[normal]ir viability.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.6
[normal]              
[normal]The expansion in this activity has compensated in employment terms for the contraction i
[normal]n 
[normal]Danske’s
[normal] Branch network in Northern Ireland. Since 2005 the number of offices and sub-offices operated by the Bank has fallen from approximately 130
[normal] 
[normal]to fifty-two – with 
[normal]continuing
[normal] reduction
[normal]s
[normal] likely 
[normal]in
[normal] 2014. 
[normal]Unlike
[normal] other major banks wh
[normal]ere
[normal] branch closures
[normal] 
[normal]may have emerged as desperate cost-cutting measures
[normal], 
[normal]Danske
[normal]/Northern Bank has pursued a deliberate policy – over many years in terms of gestation and implementation – to make greater use of electronic channels to deliver services to customers. While all o
[normal]f the banks in Northern Ireland have begun to 
[normal]promote
[normal] e-banking for customers to some degree, 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank 
[normal]has gone furthest
[normal] 
[normal]both 
[normal]in terms of customer adoption of the technology and the reduction in the comparative density of its branch network.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]First[bold] Trust Bank[bold] is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIB Group which in turn is 99% owned by the Irish State – as a result of the multi-billion euro public investment made to rescue the Group from the disastrous 
[normal]impact of its impaired loans
[normal]. As part of the restruct
[normal]uring of the Group’s overseas holdings required by the EU Commission, AIB’s 
[normal]Polish and US 
[normal]interests were sold. AIB also put its UK division – comprising First Trust Bank
[normal] (FTB)
[normal] and Allied Irish Bank (GB) – on the market. However, 
[normal]with no
[normal] significant interes
[normal]t from prospective buyers, the division was withdrawn from sale. Following substantial engagement by Northern Ireland Ministers and Assembly
[normal] 
[normal]members 
[normal]along with
[normal] concerted lobbying by members of IBOA, 
[normal]AIB
[normal] committed to 
[normal]remain
[normal] in Northern Ireland through 
[normal]FTB
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.8
[normal]              
[normal]AIB Group’s initial decision in 2012 to close over 
[normal]70 branches was primarily focus
[normal]ed on its Republic of Ireland business. 
[normal]Some
[normal] Northern Ireland 
[normal]locations 
[normal]were earmarked for closure under this 
[normal]programme
[normal] 
[normal]– b
[normal]ringing to 9 the total of offices and sub-offices which have closed since 2008. However, since 
[normal]FTB
[normal] continues to operate at a loss, management 
[normal]may 
[normal]seek further branch closures in No
[normal]rthern Ireland – requiring customers to make greater use of electronic banki
[normal]ng
[normal]. As AIB Group 
[normal]attempts to 
[normal]restructure its business to achiev
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]a
[normal] return to profitability 
[normal]and
[normal] to exit State ownership, FTB may also come under pressure from its parent to transfer 
[normal]some 
[normal]“back office” support operations to Dublin.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.
[normal]9
[normal]              
[normal]After 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank, 
[normal]Ba[bold]nk of Ireland[bold] is probably
[normal] the soundest of the four major 
[normal]retail
[normal] banks in terms of its balance sheet performance. The Group 
[normal]received 
[normal]€4.7bn
[normal] in State
[normal] support. It 
[normal]is forecast to return to profit shortly
[normal] and is keen to reduc
[normal]e
[normal] the State’s 15% shareholding
[normal] by
[normal] 
[normal]“e
[normal]xiting the bailout” 
[normal]at the earliest opportunity.
[normal] 
[normal]The Bank’s Northern Ireland 
[normal]operations 
[normal]have been restructured in the last three years from being a semi-autonomous entity to being a fully integrated part of an all-island business. Bank of Ireland also has 
[normal]a significant presence in Britain as the provider of banking services to the Post Office. It also maintains a niche presence in business banking in Britain. However, the viability of this operation 
[normal]may be in question following 
[normal]the EU Commission
[normal]’s decision
[normal] 
[normal]that the Bank should sell 
[normal]some 
[normal]parts of 
[normal]this
[normal] operation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.10
[normal]              
[normal]As for customer
[normal] acces
[normal]s, Bank of Ireland has committed to close the fewest locations of the four major banking groups. Since the onset of the crisis, it has closed nine offices and sub-offices in
[normal] Northern Ireland. However, although it 
[normal]may 
[normal]maintain a presence on most of its existing sites, the Bank's “new branch model” is built on customers accessing services through a battery of electronic devices (monitors, ATMs and dedicated phone lines linked t
[normal]o a call centre) rather than by face-to-face interaction with bank worker
[normal]s.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.11
[normal]              
[normal]Of the four 
[normal]major retail
[normal] banks operating in Northern Ireland, 
[normal]Ulster Bank[bold] has probably suffered most from the crisis, rela
[normal]ti
[normal]ve to its size. While Ulster Bank is a very 
[normal]significant player in Northern Ireland
[normal]’s banking sector
[normal], the majority of its business is located in the Republic of Ireland where it 
[normal]was
[normal] involved in 
[normal]pre-crash 
[normal]speculative property lending. Indeed Ulster Bank’s 
[normal]former
[normal] subsidiary, First Active (which has sin
[normal]ce been merged into the main business) was the first 
[normal]institutional lender
[normal] in the Republic to offer 100% mortgages.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.12
[normal]              
[normal]To
[normal] address the consequences of 
[normal]its
[normal] impaired loan book, Ulster Bank has relied on significant support from its parent, Royal Bank of Sco
[normal]tland – which
[normal] 
[normal]has been sustained on “life support” 
[normal]by
[normal] the State for almost five years. Ulster Bank has also embarked on two major cost-cutting initiatives – each involving 950 job losses achieved through voluntary severance. Although AIB has 
[normal]cut more jobs
[normal] 
[normal]in absolute terms, Ulster Bank has cut deepest 
[normal]relative
[normal] to the size of its workforce. Of the 1900 job cuts already implemented or announced for Ulster Bank, Northern Ireland has ac
[normal]c
[normal]ounted for around 700.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.13
[normal]              
[normal]Ulster Bank has also engaged in branch closure
[normal]s – primarily as a result of the merger of its First Active mortgage business. Having closed eleven offices and sub-offices in Northern Ireland since 2008,
[normal] 
[normal]the Bank is reviewing its branch network. However, s
[normal]enior executives recently told 
[normal]Northern Ireland
[normal]’
[normal]s
[normal] outgoing 
[normal]Finance 
[normal]Minister
[normal], Sammy Wilson, that the number of b
[normal]ranches
[normal] 
[normal]in Northern Ireland to be closed in 2014 would not exceed nine.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.[bold]              [bold]The structure and governance of banks in Northern Ireland[bold]&#xa0;[bold]3.1
[normal]              
[normal]As outlined at 2.2, none of the four major 
[normal]retail
[normal] banks in Northern Ireland are headquartered in the province. 
[normal]FTB
[normal] and Bank of Ireland are subsidiaries of Dublin
[normal]-
[normal]based banking groups. 
[normal]Danske’s
[normal] parent is based in Copenhagen, while Ulster Bank’s Dublin Head Office reports to RBS headquarters in Edinburgh. 
[normal]Of Northern Ireland
[normal]’s
[normal] second tier of financial institutions, only the Progressive Building Society could be 
[normal]regarded as
[normal] truly indigenous.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]              
[normal]The distance between the board rooms where key decisions about cr
[normal]edit and risk are made and the 
[normal]areas in Northern Ireland 
[normal]affected by them
[normal] 
[normal]is a further
[normal] concern – especially 
[normal]as many
[normal] banks with international interests 
[normal]have
[normal] 
[normal]retrenched
[normal] 
[normal]to
[normal] their home markets
[normal] since the crisis began
[normal]. 
[normal]Without the intervention of local public representatives, this trend may h
[normal]ave been more pronounced 
[normal]in Northern Ireland. 
[normal]T
[normal]h
[normal]ese
[normal] 
[normal]interventions
[normal] may have 
[normal]secured 
[normal]add
[normal]itional
[normal] traction because of the substantial level of State support for these institutions
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.4
[normal]              
[normal]Northern Ireland’s
[normal] four largest 
[normal]retail banks
[normal] are
[normal] supervised to some degree
[normal] by three different regulatory bodies – none of which is 
[normal]located in
[normal] Northern Ireland. The recently established Financial Conduct Authority does not have a 
[normal]physical 
[normal]presence on the ground in Northern Ireland – nor did its predecessor, the Financial Services
[normal] Authori
[normal]ty. Quality of oversight is 
[normal]an important issue – in view of the recent history of irresponsible
[normal] 
[normal]behaviour
[normal] by
[normal] the 
[normal]leaderships
[normal] of key financial institutions in both Ireland and Britain – involving high risk property lending, 
[normal]mis
[normal]-selling of insurance-
[normal]based products and interest rate
[normal] manipulation – facilitated by 
[normal]light touch regulatory regimes in each jurisdiction. In such lax regulatory environments, 
[normal]banking leaders
[normal] were facilitated in 
[normal]adopting 
[normal]cavalier a
[normal]pproach
[normal]e
[normal]s – partly 
[normal]because they believed, correc
[normal]tly as it turned out, that if they got into major difficulties, the Stat
[normal]e would assist them.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.5
[normal]              
[normal]Another key factor in the near collapse of 
[normal]banking has been 
[normal]the shift in the 
[normal]sector
[normal]’s prevailing
[normal] culture from one focused on customer service to one dictated 
[normal]by sales targets 
[normal]driven by
[normal] the 
[normal]pursuit of short-term profits
[normal]. 
[normal]The ongoing controversy around bonuses is one facet of culture. Equally troubling has been the pressure on bank workers to sell financial
[normal] ‘products’ – rather than to 
[normal]offer
[normal] dispassionate prudent financial advice to customers.
[normal] 
[normal]The
[normal] pressure 
[normal]on staff 
[normal]to meet targets
[normal] is now based on
[normal] the 
[normal]‘
[normal]stick
[normal]’
[normal] of disciplinary action rather than the 
[normal]‘
[normal]carrot
[normal]’
[normal] of performance awards. At the same time, 
[normal]bank workers
[normal] who speak out – even in the most 
[normal]general terms about the state of the 
[normal]sector
[normal] – 
[normal]risk
[normal] disciplinary action 
[normal]for
[normal] either breaching confidentiality or – with no hint of irony – damaging their employer’s reputation.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]6
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]State’s 
[normal]pivotal
[normal] role 
[normal]in the financial sector 
[normal]at this time provides
[normal] a
[normal]n
[normal] op
[normal]portunity to embed a new culture – 
[normal]which would promote
[normal] the traditional values of prudential lending and 
[normal]genuine
[normal] customer service
[normal] – with technological advances
[normal] used to enhance such a development
[normal] rather
[normal] 
[normal]than being viewed primarily 
[normal]as a means of cutting costs
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]7
[normal]              
[normal]The
[normal] composition of the boards of banks have been justifiably 
[normal]critici
[normal]s
[normal]ed
[normal] 
[normal]as
[normal] a circle of like-minded individuals (indeed with the same individuals frequently sharing interlocking memberships of a number of b
[normal]oard
[normal]s). Greater diversity of membership is e
[normal]ssential 
[normal]for
[normal] avoiding the high
[normal] level “group-think” which was 
[normal]apparent 
[normal]before the
[normal] banking crisis and, 
[normal]also
[normal], 
[normal]perhaps
[normal], 
[normal]since
[normal]. The inclusion of employee representatives with those of other stake-holders should be 
[normal]priorit
[normal]ised
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.
[normal]8
[normal]              
[normal]At the 
[normal]sectoral
[normal] level, IBOA h
[normal]as advocated a Forum on Banking within Northern Ireland – which could bring together all of the stake-holders in the sector – to 
[normal]discuss
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] strategic
[normal] 
[normal]direction 
[normal]so that in future 
[normal]the financial sector
[normal] 
[normal]become
[normal]s
[normal] a loyal servant of economic and social development rather than its untrustworthy master.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.[bold]              [bold]The possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]The possible break-up of RBS is a matter of concern to Ulster Bank’s staff and customers 
[normal]i
[normal]n both No
[normal]rthern Ireland a
[normal]nd the Republic in light of the
[normal] speculation 
[normal]about
[normal] 
[normal]the future of Ulster Bank
[normal]. The 
[normal]suggestion that 
[normal]Ulster Bank 
[normal]could be acquired 
[normal]by the Irish State 
[normal]raises many
[normal] difficult
[normal]ies
[normal]. Apart from question
[normal]s
[normal] 
[normal]about the capacity of the Irish State
[normal] to take on the liabilitie
[normal]s of Ulster Bank, the prospect of 
[normal]the Irish State owning 
[normal]two of the three largest 
[normal]retail 
[normal]banks in the Republic 
[normal]as well as a significant 
[normal]stake in the third – would have serious consequences for competition. In Northern Ireland, the competition issue 
[normal]could b
[normal]ecome
[normal] even more significan
[normal]t
[normal] since the 
[normal]Irish Government would 
[normal]exercis
[normal]e
[normal] 
[normal]more
[normal] influen
[normal]ce over the economy by virtue of its greater presence in retail banking
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]For customers
[normal], 
[normal]this
[normal] scenario would 
[normal]probably involve
[normal] an accelerated 
[normal]prog
[normal]r
[normal]amme
[normal] of branch closures 
[normal]as
[normal] two directly owned State banks operating in parallel 
[normal]might prove
[normal] 
[normal]un
[normal]sustain
[normal]able
[normal] in the longer term. 
[normal]For staff, substantial
[normal] job losses
[normal] might
[normal] 
[normal]also result
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]Further speculation 
[normal]centres
[normal] on
[normal] a merger between Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB, one of the smaller State-owned lenders in the Republic, 
[normal]as
[normal] a joint venture 
[normal]involving RBS, 
[normal]the Irish State 
[normal]and
[normal] unknown private interests
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]While such an alliance may
[normal] 
[normal]offer some benefits to both institutions, i
[normal]t
[normal] 
[normal]c
[normal]ould 
[normal]also exacerbate
[normal] the prob
[normal]lem of Ulster Bank’s toxic debt
[normal], since Permanent TSB also ha
[normal]s significant impairment issues.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.[bold]              [bold]The position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation[bold]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]              
[normal]The “special liquidation” of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) by the Irish Parliament earlier this year has created 
[normal]considerable
[normal] difficulty for IBRC’s employees 
[normal]in Northern Ireland and the Republic
[normal] – not least because the consequences for the I
[normal]BRC workers 
[normal]were not
[normal] 
[normal]considered
[normal] 
[normal]by Parliament
[normal]. The employees 
[normal]became
[normal] collateral damage in a
[normal] legislative
[normal] initiative designed to facilitate the restructuring of interest payments due on the IBRC’s promissory notes and payable by the Irish Exchequer.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2
[normal]              
[normal] 
[normal]Thi
[normal]s
[normal] legislation 
[normal]may 
[normal]be subject 
[normal]to
[normal] litigation
[normal] – not least because, it has been argued, 
[normal]the 
[normal]company
[normal] was solvent
[normal] at the time
[normal], albeit with the support of the Irish Central Bank.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]              
[normal]From the 
[normal]workers’ 
[normal]perspective, th
[normal]e
[normal] liquidation 
[normal]is
[normal] more 
[normal]akin to
[normal] a receivership 
[normal]as
[normal] the company 
[normal]has 
[normal]continue
[normal]d
[normal] to operate as before in wind-down mode but with an accelerated timescale. IBOA has also raised 
[normal]concer
[normal]ns with the EU as to whether the implementation of the 
[normal]Oireachtas
[normal]’ decision has frustrated the European directive on 
[normal]the 
[normal]prote
[normal]ction of employment
[normal] during the
[normal] transfer of undertaki
[normal]ngs – in the case of IBRC
[normal] 
[normal]staff
[normal] 
[normal]transferring to other entit
[normal]ies – such as Capita 
[normal]and
[normal] NAMA. 
[normal]IBRC
[normal] employees in Northern Ireland
[normal] are further concerned
[normal] that the Irish authorities
[normal] may have
[normal] breached the terms of
[normal] the Revised Credit Facility Agreement governing the bilateral loan of £3.25bn provided by the British Government at the end of 2010.

[normal]rationalisation
[normal] of the branch networks of the four major banks in Nor
[normal]thern Ireland raises questions about access to banking facilities in rural communities. While 
[normal]Danske
[normal] Bank has implemented the most d
[normal]ramatic reduction 
[normal]programme
[normal], 
[normal]the other banks are 
[normal]to be
[normal] developing similar strategies involving a concentration of face-to-fa
[normal]ce banking operations in fewer locations while seeking to increase the use of electronic banking services.
[normal] S
[normal]ome institutions may be tempted to accelerate the closure of branches 
[normal]to push
[normal] the adoption of electronic bank
[normal]ing by customers rather than 
[normal]allow cust
[normal]omers to move at their own pace or even retain the option of face-to-face interaction.

[normal]In some rural areas the e
[normal]-banking
[normal] alternative may not be as effective due to major infrastructural problems relating to internet connectivity. So customers in those
[normal] areas may 
[normal]lose
[normal] immediate access – both physical and online. Furthermore, our members' 
[normal]direct
[normal] experience suggests that 
[normal]many 
[normal]customers 
[normal]– es
[normal]pecially in the older age groups - would prefer to bank with humans rather than el
[normal]ectronic devices
[normal].

[normal]The hollowing
[normal] of the physical banking infrastructure may also have adverse consequences for social welfare recipients in both urban and rural areas
[normal] who were previously 
[normal]encouraged to open bank accounts 
[normal]to receive 
[normal]State benefits 
[normal]after
[normal] 
[normal]earlier
[normal] payment 
[normal]channels
[normal] were discon
[normal]tinued. 
[normal]Any reduction
[normal] 
[normal]in
[normal] face-to-face banking 
[normal]may bear disproportionately
[normal] 
[normal]on 
[normal]customers on low fixed incomes 
[normal]and
[normal] 
[normal]un
[normal]able to aff
[normal]ord the electronic alternatives
[normal].

[normal]IBOA is 
[normal]concerned that 
[normal]although
[normal] each banking group is taking decisions incrementally based up
[normal]on its own 
[normal]specific
[normal] interest
[normal]s
[normal], the c
[normal]umulative effect 
[normal]may be to leave many rural areas in Northern Ireland with 
[normal]reduced
[normal] facility. 
[normal]In
[normal] some parts of Britain, banks have come to an understanding that the last branch of any banking group remaining in an agreed 
[normal]catchment area will 
[normal]not face closure
[normal]. 
[normal]T
[normal]his “last branch standing” approach should be considered in Northern Ireland to 
[normal]guarantee
[normal] a minimum threshold of 
[normal]physical as well as online 
[normal]service. 
[normal]With
[normal] the new facility for easier account switching, such 
[normal]an approach
[normal] would not necessarily be 
[normal]commercially disadvantageous
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.[bold]              [bold]Final Thoughts[bold]&#xa0;[bold]IBOA thank
[normal]s
[normal] the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for 
[normal]the invitation 
[normal]to 
[normal]make
[normal] this submission. We would welcome the opportunity to
[normal] 
[normal]engage wit
[normal]h you further. Banking 
[normal]is 
[normal]experiencing
[normal] an unprecedented transformation – mostly under duress 
[normal]after
[normal] 
[normal]its
[normal] catastrophic mismanagement in 
[normal]recent
[normal] years.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n this context, Northern Ireland has particular concerns 
[normal]requiring
[normal] special attention. We welcome 
[normal]your
[normal] interest and will 
[normal]endeavour
[normal] to assi
[normal]st 
[normal]your 
[normal]deliberations.
