defaultIBOA The Finance Union represents over 18,000 employees in the financial 
defaultsector
default in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain – predominantly in banking 
default– 
defaultof 
defaultwhom
default approximately 5,000 work in Northern Ireland. Members of the Union 
defaultwork in
default many areas within the sector, including 
defaultsome 
defaultmanagerial grades.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default              
defaultIn Northern Ireland, the Union’s membership is principally located within the four main retail banks: Bank of Ireland, 
defaultDanske
default Bank, First Trust Bank and Ulster Bank. Since the banking crisis began, the Union has also secured the right to represent staff 
defaultin
default the former Irish Nationwide Building Society – which, having merged with Anglo Irish Bank to form the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (now in special liquidation), also operates in Northern Ireland.

default              
defaultAs the representative body for a

default 
defaultIBOA has a unique perspective based on its 
defaultwork
default on behalf of bank 
defaultstaff
default in three jurisdictions. After some general observations on recent developm
defaultents in Northern Ireland, we propose to focus 
defaulton
default four main 
defaultarea
defaults:

default2.default              defaultGeneral Overviewdefault&#xa0;default2.1
default              
defaultThe transformation of Northern Ireland’s major 
defaultretail
default banks 
defaultover
default the last five years has been unprecedented in its speed and depth. In terms of ownership
default,
default two banks are
default,
default to all intents and purposes
default,
default State-owned (although by different States); one bank enjoys minority State support with a significant North American shareholding; while the fourth remains in private ownership with its 
defaultDanish
default parent driving the most ambitious changes in its operating mod
defaultel.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default              
defaultNone of the banks
default,
default which have experienced 
defaultmajor
default changes in ownership
default,
default 
defaultactively 
defaultsought 
defaultthem: in each case State intervention w
defaultas a last resort to prevent 
defaulta worse
default outcome. But in all cases 
defaultkey
default decisions about the ownership or operation of these institutions – which have profound implications for the
defaultir
default staff and customers 
defaultin Northern Ireland 
default– have been taken outside the jurisdiction – in 
defaulteither London
default, Edinburgh, Dublin or Copenhagen.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default              
defaultNort
defaulthern Ireland may 
defaultalso suffer 
defaultin terms of the quality of investment in its economic, commercial and social infrastructure. Northern Ireland may not 
defaultrate
default 
defaulthighly in
default 
defaulteither strategic or operational priorities
default 
default– as Ulster Bank
default’s customers
default will readily testify 
defaultwhen 
defaulta
default temporary
default IT glitch for 
defaultRBS and NatWest 
defaultcustomers 
defaultbecame
default an IT meltdown for Ulster Bank – lasti
defaultng weeks.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default              
defaultThe
default absence of any locally
default-
defaultowned banking institutions
default may also have a negative impact on
default the availability of credit within Northern Ireland
default since it
default turn
defaults
default on lending policy decisions made elsewhere – by 
defaultparent board
defaults 
defaultwith no
default specific concern for the good 
defaultof
default Northern Ireland.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default              
defaultDanskedefault Bankdefault (formerly Northern Bank) is arguably the most financially sound of the major 
defaultretail
default banks operating in
default Northern Ireland – since its more prudent
default 
defaultapproach to lending meant that it 
defaultlargely avoided
default the surge in speculative property lending 
defaultwhich drove
default Irish banking 
defaultto the brink of 
defaultcollapse in 2008-9. 
defaultDanske
default Bank has recorded operating profits for a number of 
defaultyears and expects to return to overall profitability by the end of 
default2013
default – even after losses for impairments are 
defaultincluded
default. However, the position of 
defaultDanske’s
default Northern Ireland business contrast
defaults
default 
defaultwith
default its Republic of Ireland 
defaultoperation 
default(formerly National Irish Bank) – which became heavily involved in 
defaultproperty 
defaultlending 
defaultbefore 
default2008 and suffered 
defaultaccordingly
default. The complete overhaul of 
defaultDanske’s
default Republic of Ireland business – with the virtual elimination of its branch network and its 
defaultremodelling
default as a niche business bank – has resulted in the transfer of some call centre traffic and processing work to units in Northern Ireland –
default enhancing
default the
defaultir viability.
default&#xa0;
default2.6
default              
defaultThe expansion in this activity has compensated in employment terms for the contraction i
defaultn 
defaultDanske’s
default Branch network in Northern Ireland. Since 2005 the number of offices and sub-offices operated by the Bank has fallen from approximately 130
default 
defaultto fifty-two – with 
defaultcontinuing
default reduction
defaults
default likely 
defaultin
default 2014. 
defaultUnlike
default other major banks wh
defaultere
default branch closures
default 
defaultmay have emerged as desperate cost-cutting measures
default, 
defaultDanske
default/Northern Bank has pursued a deliberate policy – over many years in terms of gestation and implementation – to make greater use of electronic channels to deliver services to customers. While all o
defaultf the banks in Northern Ireland have begun to 
defaultpromote
default e-banking for customers to some degree, 
defaultDanske
default Bank 
defaulthas gone furthest
default 
defaultboth 
defaultin terms of customer adoption of the technology and the reduction in the comparative density of its branch network.

default              
defaultFirstdefault Trust Bankdefault is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIB Group which in turn is 99% owned by the Irish State – as a result of the multi-billion euro public investment made to rescue the Group from the disastrous 
defaultimpact of its impaired loans
default. As part of the restruct
defaulturing of the Group’s overseas holdings required by the EU Commission, AIB’s 
defaultPolish and US 
defaultinterests were sold. AIB also put its UK division – comprising First Trust Bank
default (FTB)
default and Allied Irish Bank (GB) – on the market. However, 
defaultwith no
default significant interes
defaultt from prospective buyers, the division was withdrawn from sale. Following substantial engagement by Northern Ireland Ministers and Assembly
default 
defaultmembers 
defaultalong with
default concerted lobbying by members of IBOA, 
defaultAIB
default committed to 
defaultremain
default in Northern Ireland through 
defaultFTB
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.8
default              
defaultAIB Group’s initial decision in 2012 to close over 
default70 branches was primarily focus
defaulted on its Republic of Ireland business. 
defaultSome
default Northern Ireland 
defaultlocations 
defaultwere earmarked for closure under this 
defaultprogramme
default 
default– b
defaultringing to 9 the total of offices and sub-offices which have closed since 2008. However, since 
defaultFTB
default continues to operate at a loss, management 
defaultmay 
defaultseek further branch closures in No
defaultrthern Ireland – requiring customers to make greater use of electronic banki
defaultng
default. As AIB Group 
defaultattempts to 
defaultrestructure its business to achiev
defaulte
default 
defaulta
default return to profitability 
defaultand
default to exit State ownership, FTB may also come under pressure from its parent to transfer 
defaultsome 
default“back office” support operations to Dublin.
default&#xa0;
default2.
default9
default              
defaultAfter 
defaultDanske
default Bank, 
defaultBadefaultnk of Irelanddefault is probably
default the soundest of the four major 
defaultretail
default banks in terms of its balance sheet performance. The Group 
defaultreceived 
default€4.7bn
default in State
default support. It 
defaultis forecast to return to profit shortly
default and is keen to reduc
defaulte
default the State’s 15% shareholding
default by
default 
default“e
defaultxiting the bailout” 
defaultat the earliest opportunity.
default 
defaultThe Bank’s Northern Ireland 
defaultoperations 
defaulthave been restructured in the last three years from being a semi-autonomous entity to being a fully integrated part of an all-island business. Bank of Ireland also has 
defaulta significant presence in Britain as the provider of banking services to the Post Office. It also maintains a niche presence in business banking in Britain. However, the viability of this operation 
defaultmay be in question following 
defaultthe EU Commission
default’s decision
default 
defaultthat the Bank should sell 
defaultsome 
defaultparts of 
defaultthis
default operation.
default&#xa0;
default2.10
default              
defaultAs for customer
default acces
defaults, Bank of Ireland has committed to close the fewest locations of the four major banking groups. Since the onset of the crisis, it has closed nine offices and sub-offices in
default Northern Ireland. However, although it 
defaultmay 
defaultmaintain a presence on most of its existing sites, the Bank's “new branch model” is built on customers accessing services through a battery of electronic devices (monitors, ATMs and dedicated phone lines linked t
defaulto a call centre) rather than by face-to-face interaction with bank worker
defaults.
default&#xa0;
default2.11
default              
defaultOf the four 
defaultmajor retail
default banks operating in Northern Ireland, 
defaultUlster Bankdefault has probably suffered most from the crisis, rela
defaultti
defaultve to its size. While Ulster Bank is a very 
defaultsignificant player in Northern Ireland
default’s banking sector
default, the majority of its business is located in the Republic of Ireland where it 
defaultwas
default involved in 
defaultpre-crash 
defaultspeculative property lending. Indeed Ulster Bank’s 
defaultformer
default subsidiary, First Active (which has sin
defaultce been merged into the main business) was the first 
defaultinstitutional lender
default in the Republic to offer 100% mortgages.
default&#xa0;
default2.12
default              
defaultTo
default address the consequences of 
defaultits
default impaired loan book, Ulster Bank has relied on significant support from its parent, Royal Bank of Sco
defaulttland – which
default 
defaulthas been sustained on “life support” 
defaultby
default the State for almost five years. Ulster Bank has also embarked on two major cost-cutting initiatives – each involving 950 job losses achieved through voluntary severance. Although AIB has 
defaultcut more jobs
default 
defaultin absolute terms, Ulster Bank has cut deepest 
defaultrelative
default to the size of its workforce. Of the 1900 job cuts already implemented or announced for Ulster Bank, Northern Ireland has ac
defaultc
defaultounted for around 700.
default&#xa0;
default2.13
default              
defaultUlster Bank has also engaged in branch closure
defaults – primarily as a result of the merger of its First Active mortgage business. Having closed eleven offices and sub-offices in Northern Ireland since 2008,
default 
defaultthe Bank is reviewing its branch network. However, s
defaultenior executives recently told 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default’
defaults
default outgoing 
defaultFinance 
defaultMinister
default, Sammy Wilson, that the number of b
defaultranches
default 
defaultin Northern Ireland to be closed in 2014 would not exceed nine.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.default              defaultThe structure and governance of banks in Northern Irelanddefault&#xa0;default3.1
default              
defaultAs outlined at 2.2, none of the four major 
defaultretail
default banks in Northern Ireland are headquartered in the province. 
defaultFTB
default and Bank of Ireland are subsidiaries of Dublin
default-
defaultbased banking groups. 
defaultDanske’s
default parent is based in Copenhagen, while Ulster Bank’s Dublin Head Office reports to RBS headquarters in Edinburgh. 
defaultOf Northern Ireland
default’s
default second tier of financial institutions, only the Progressive Building Society could be 
defaultregarded as
default truly indigenous.
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default              
defaultThe distance between the board rooms where key decisions about cr
defaultedit and risk are made and the 
defaultareas in Northern Ireland 
defaultaffected by them
default 
defaultis a further
default concern – especially 
defaultas many
default banks with international interests 
defaulthave
default 
defaultretrenched
default 
defaultto
default their home markets
default since the crisis began
default. 
defaultWithout the intervention of local public representatives, this trend may h
defaultave been more pronounced 
defaultin Northern Ireland. 
defaultT
defaulth
defaultese
default 
defaultinterventions
default may have 
defaultsecured 
defaultadd
defaultitional
default traction because of the substantial level of State support for these institutions
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default              
defaultNorthern Ireland’s
default four largest 
defaultretail banks
default are
default supervised to some degree
default by three different regulatory bodies – none of which is 
defaultlocated in
default Northern Ireland. The recently established Financial Conduct Authority does not have a 
defaultphysical 
defaultpresence on the ground in Northern Ireland – nor did its predecessor, the Financial Services
default Authori
defaultty. Quality of oversight is 
defaultan important issue – in view of the recent history of irresponsible
default 
defaultbehaviour
default by
default the 
defaultleaderships
default of key financial institutions in both Ireland and Britain – involving high risk property lending, 
defaultmis
default-selling of insurance-
defaultbased products and interest rate
default manipulation – facilitated by 
defaultlight touch regulatory regimes in each jurisdiction. In such lax regulatory environments, 
defaultbanking leaders
default were facilitated in 
defaultadopting 
defaultcavalier a
defaultpproach
defaulte
defaults – partly 
defaultbecause they believed, correc
defaulttly as it turned out, that if they got into major difficulties, the Stat
defaulte would assist them.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default              
defaultAnother key factor in the near collapse of 
defaultbanking has been 
defaultthe shift in the 
defaultsector
default’s prevailing
default culture from one focused on customer service to one dictated 
defaultby sales targets 
defaultdriven by
default the 
defaultpursuit of short-term profits
default. 
defaultThe ongoing controversy around bonuses is one facet of culture. Equally troubling has been the pressure on bank workers to sell financial
default ‘products’ – rather than to 
defaultoffer
default dispassionate prudent financial advice to customers.
default 
defaultThe
default pressure 
defaulton staff 
defaultto meet targets
default is now based on
default the 
default‘
defaultstick
default’
default of disciplinary action rather than the 
default‘
defaultcarrot
default’
default of performance awards. At the same time, 
defaultbank workers
default who speak out – even in the most 
defaultgeneral terms about the state of the 
defaultsector
default – 
defaultrisk
default disciplinary action 
defaultfor
default either breaching confidentiality or – with no hint of irony – damaging their employer’s reputation.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default6
default              
defaultThe
default 
defaultState’s 
defaultpivotal
default role 
defaultin the financial sector 
defaultat this time provides
default a
defaultn
default op
defaultportunity to embed a new culture – 
defaultwhich would promote
default the traditional values of prudential lending and 
defaultgenuine
default customer service
default – with technological advances
default used to enhance such a development
default rather
default 
defaultthan being viewed primarily 
defaultas a means of cutting costs
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default7
default              
defaultThe
default composition of the boards of banks have been justifiably 
defaultcritici
defaults
defaulted
default 
defaultas
default a circle of like-minded individuals (indeed with the same individuals frequently sharing interlocking memberships of a number of b
defaultoard
defaults). Greater diversity of membership is e
defaultssential 
defaultfor
default avoiding the high
default level “group-think” which was 
defaultapparent 
defaultbefore the
default banking crisis and, 
defaultalso
default, 
defaultperhaps
default, 
defaultsince
default. The inclusion of employee representatives with those of other stake-holders should be 
defaultpriorit
defaultised
default.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default8
default              
defaultAt the 
defaultsectoral
default level, IBOA h
defaultas advocated a Forum on Banking within Northern Ireland – which could bring together all of the stake-holders in the sector – to 
defaultdiscuss
default 
defaultits
default strategic
default 
defaultdirection 
defaultso that in future 
defaultthe financial sector

default4.default              defaultThe possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bankdefault&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultThe possible break-up of RBS is a matter of concern to Ulster Bank’s staff and customers 
defaulti
defaultn both No
defaultrthern Ireland a
defaultnd the Republic in light of the
default speculation 
defaultabout
default 
defaultthe future of Ulster Bank
default. The 
defaultsuggestion that 
defaultUlster Bank 
defaultcould be acquired 
defaultby the Irish State 
defaultraises many
default difficult
defaulties
default. Apart from question
defaults
default 
defaultabout the capacity of the Irish State
default to take on the liabilitie
defaults of Ulster Bank, the prospect of 
defaultthe Irish State owning 
defaulttwo of the three largest 
defaultretail 
defaultbanks in the Republic 
defaultas well as a significant 
defaultstake in the third – would have serious consequences for competition. In Northern Ireland, the competition issue 
defaultcould b
defaultecome
default even more significan
defaultt
default since the 
defaultIrish Government would 
defaultexercis
defaulte
default 
defaultmore
default influen
defaultce over the economy by virtue of its greater presence in retail banking
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default              
defaultFor customers
default, 
defaultthis
default scenario would 
defaultprobably involve
default an accelerated

defaultr
defaultamme
default of branch closures 
defaultas
default two directly owned State banks operating in parallel 
defaultmight prove

default in the longer term. 
defaultFor staff, substantial
default job losses
default might
default 
defaultalso result
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default              
defaultFurther speculation 
defaultcentres
default on
default a merger between Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB, one of the smaller State-owned lenders in the Republic, 
defaultas
default a joint venture 
defaultinvolving RBS, 
defaultthe Irish State 
defaultand
default unknown private interests
default.
default 
defaultWhile such an alliance may
default 
defaultoffer some benefits to both institutions, i
defaultt
default 
defaultc
defaultould 
defaultalso exacerbate
default the prob
defaultlem of Ulster Bank’s toxic debt

defaults significant impairment issues.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.default              defaultThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporationdefault&#xa0;default5.1
default              
defaultThe “special liquidation” of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) by the Irish Parliament earlier this year has created 
defaultconsiderable
default difficulty for IBRC’s employees 
defaultin Northern Ireland and the Republic
default – not least because the consequences for the I
defaultBRC workers 
defaultwere not
default 
defaultconsidered
default 
defaultby Parliament
default. The employees 
defaultbecame
default collateral damage in a
default legislative
default initiative designed to facilitate the restructuring of interest payments due on the IBRC’s promissory notes and payable by the Irish Exchequer.
default&#xa0;
default5.2
default              
default 
defaultThi
defaults
default legislation 
defaultmay 
defaultbe subject 
defaultto
default litigation
default – not least because, it has been argued, 
defaultthe 
defaultcompany
default was solvent
default at the time
default, albeit with the support of the Irish Central Bank.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default              
defaultFrom the

defaultcontinue

defaultthe 
defaultprote
defaultction of employment

default 
defaultstaff
default 
defaulttransferring to other entit
defaulties – such as Capita 
defaultand

defaultIBRC
default employees in Northern Ireland
default are further concerned
default that the Irish authorities
default may have
default breached the terms of

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.default              defaultAccess to banking in rural communitiesdefault&#xa0;default6.1
default              
defaultThe 
defaultrationalisation
default of the branch networks of the four major banks in Nor
defaultthern Ireland raises questions about access to banking facilities in rural communities. While 
defaultDanske
default Bank has implemented the most d
defaultramatic reduction 
defaultprogramme
default, 
defaultthe other banks are 
defaultto be
default developing similar strategies involving a concentration of face-to-fa
defaultce banking operations in fewer locations while seeking to increase the use of electronic banking services.
default S
defaultome institutions may be tempted to accelerate the closure of branches 
defaultto push
default the adoption of electronic bank
defaulting by customers rather than 
defaultallow cust
defaultomers to move at their own pace or even retain the option of face-to-face interaction.
default&#xa0;
default6.
default2
default              
defaultIn some rural areas the e
default-banking
default alternative may not be as effective due to major infrastructural problems relating to internet connectivity. So customers in those
default areas may 
defaultlose
default immediate access – both physical and online. Furthermore, our members' 
defaultdirect
default experience suggests that 
defaultmany 
defaultcustomers 
default– es
defaultpecially in the older age groups - would prefer to bank with humans rather than el
defaultectronic devices
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default              
defaultThe hollowing
default of the physical banking infrastructure may also have adverse consequences for social welfare recipients in both urban and rural areas
default who were previously 
defaultencouraged to open bank accounts 
defaultto receive 
defaultState benefits 
defaultafter
default

default6.5
default              
defaultIBOA is 
defaultconcerned that 
defaultalthough
default each banking group is taking decisions incrementally based up
defaulton its own 
defaultspecific
default interest
defaults
default, the c
defaultumulative effect 
defaultmay be to leave many rural areas in Northern Ireland with 
defaultreduced
default facility. 
defaultIn
default some parts of Britain, banks have come to an understanding that the last branch of any banking group remaining in an agreed 
defaultcatchment area will 
defaultnot face closure
default. 
defaultT
defaulthis “last branch standing” approach should be considered in Northern Ireland to 
defaultguarantee
default a minimum threshold of 
defaultphysical as well as online

defaultWith

default would not necessarily be
