"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nAmanda Carter\n (CYS0043)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI am writing to contribute to the Transport Committee because every cycle ride I take, I do in fear of being knocked off my bike. \nThere is much can be done to remedy the current flaws in the \nhotch-potch\n inadequate provision for cyclists.\n&#xa0;\nThe road \nsituation is getting worse for cyclists, in my view, because:\n&#xa0;\nSuggestions to increase safety of cyclists and pedestrians:\n&#xa0;\n* \nthe\n objection that this would hurt business is not, as far as I understand, the experience of other European countries that operate this strategy. Also, surely pedestrians and cyclists have for too long been forced to accep\nt a disproportionate responsibility for adaptation to the needs of motorised traffic.\n&#xa0;\nAt the end of the day, we would all hope to have outdoor space which children and the elderly can enjoy safely and without being in fear of their lives.\nThank you for do\ning your part in making this a reality.\n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
