default2 Ca
defaultrdiff University
defaultCardiff University is among the top tier of Britain’s research intensive universities and is a member of the Russell Group of Univers
defaultities. The University has 17 STEM Schools 
default(including the School of Medicine) 
defaultwithin two of its three Colleges
default: the College of 
defaultBiomedical and Life Sciences and
default the College of 
defaultPhysical Sciences
default and Engineering
default.
default Of its 27,744 students, 14,754 are in 
defaultSTEM
default (58.3% female, 41.7%male).
default 
defaultThe number of academic staff in STEMM schools are 2065 of which1230 Males (59.5%) and 835 females (40.5%)
defaultThe University is committed to addressing the historic under-representation of women across the sector at all levels of aca
defaultdemic employment, and believes that the best way of undertaking this is through embedding equality and diversity into the University culture.
default The university has a structure 
defaultthat 
defaultaims to 
defaulttackle stereotyping and gender bias and provide ways to embed equality
default into everyday activities.
default It starts with the Vice Chancellor and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor leading on equality and diversity and implementing a strategic equality plan which includes mandatory equality and diversity training.

default&#xa0;default3 Information and comments
default on relevant matters
default(a)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy do numbers of women in STEM academic careers decline further up the career ladder?
default&#xa0;
default1
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is often said that there is some kind of built-in bias against women in STEM subjects. Though Cardiff University is not aware of any conscious bias operating in the institution against women in job application and promotion processes, we cannot be certa
defaultin that no unconscious bias exists. This may be especially the case in that, with the best will in the world, the majority of those making the judgements are likely to be male.
default2
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe same may well be true when male academics are mentoring or otherwise suppor
defaultting more junior 
defaultfemale 
defaultcolleagues and, again in a more or less unconscious way, may identify with those who are male like them. Just as in society generally STEM work and the qualities needed for it are often perceived as a male domain, academics too ma
defaultn
defaulty
default, if again unconsciously, share such a perception. This may also apply to the idea that a woman can be a suitable head of department or authority figure.
default3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSuch an idea may be reinforced in female STEM academics by not seeing many women in top academic/rese
defaulta
defaultr
defaultch positions 
defaulta
defaultround them who they can aim to emulate. 
default4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome w
defaultomen academics
default may also
default effectively have ‘two jobs’, their professional role and 
defaulttheir role in starting a family and looking after its
default members
default.
default This means that being present at work sometimes af
defaultter ‘normal’ working hours, as academics, including scientists, are often called upon to do, can place 
defaultdisproportionate 
defaultstrain on female scientists. This makes it more likely they will not keep up with male colleagues in producing research
default outputs
default, keeping
default up with their field and 
defaultsubmitting 
defaultgrant applications. So when new posts are advertised or 
defaultpromotion applications are made, they may present 
defaultless 
defaultstrong 
defaultapplicants 
defaulttha
defaultn
default some of their male counterparts. 
default

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultFor reasons to do with 
defaultcaring
default commitments, it is also often difficult for women STEM academics to transfer to new, and perhaps more career-enha
defaultn
defaultcing, posts in other places. The fact that 
defaultexpiry of 
defaultfixed-term contracts sometimes actually make
defaults
default this 
defaultnecessary
default is a further potential bar 
defaultto career advancement for women. In other words, 
defaultthey
default cannot just ‘up sticks’ at short notice. This is especially troublesome for women in the early part of their careers, when they are most likely to encounter these problems owing to the fixed-term nature
default of external funding and the difficulty of securing posts which give them ongoing contracts of employment.
default In addition, e
defaultvidence suggest
defaults
default that this influences women before the time they actually have these commitments
default.

defaultOne of the consequence
defaults
default of the above 
defaultissues is that universities 
defaulttend to 
defaulthave on their staff a relatively small number of female professors
default to act as role models
default. This imbalance is unlikely to have a positive impact on 
defaultthe confidence of 
defaultfemale staff seeking to make their 
defaultway in academia
default and
default 
defaultm
defaultay have
default 
defaulta vicious circle effect 
defaultin that
default if
default there are
default no 
defaultfemale academics
default in a particular department, 
defaultfemales
default may not 
defaultchoose to 
defaultapply there but go somewhere where the culture already looks more balanced (within or outside academia).

defaultFor women taking 
defaultmaternity leave, there is sometimes great pressure to come back as early as possible. This was felt necessary in order for individuals to retain the same teaching duties and administrative responsibilities, and also keep up their publication output or “res
defaultearch productivity” in this highly competitive arena.
default              
defaultSome female academics on maternity leave feel pressured to maintain regular contact to continue to run projects, manage their manuscripts within the peer review system, 
defaultand work
default with
default PhD students.

defaultWhen women leave academia, what careers do they transition into? What are the consequences of scientifically trained women applying their skills in different employment sectors?
default&#xa0;
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultResearch tends to show that some women who leave academia 
defaultdue to 
defaultfamily commitments have periods at home before attempting to move into other careers. Both these and others who leave academia for other reasons may move into administrative roles within a higher education institution
default, into science teaching at secondary or
default further education level
default or into roles in business and commerce. In 
defaultall
default cases they are likely to put their scientific training to positive effect by 
defaultusing 
defaulttheir 
defaultscientific knowledge, 
defaultand
default their 
defaultability to view problems 
defaultin general 
defaultfrom an objective, ‘scienti
defaultfic’ point of view
default.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis means that scientifically trained women who leave academia are 
defaultunlikely to be
default lost to
default productive employment and indeed are likely to make important contributions to the educational, social
default,
default business
default and economic
default good of the country
default. However, given the relatively 
defaultlow
default number of women in academic science employment, it is the case that this 
defaultunder-
defaultrepresentation is exacerbated by every woman who takes the decision to leave scientific academia.
default It also means that the unique contributions
default and perspectives these women could bring to academic science 
defaultare
default lost
default, at the same time representing a missed opportunity to encourage and stimulate the
default scientific aspirations o
defaultf other
default young 
defaultwomen.
default  
default   
default&#xa0;
default(c)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat should universities and the higher 
defaulteducation sector do to retain woman graduates and PhD students in academic careers? Are there examples of good practice?
default&#xa0;
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThroughout undergraduate 
defaultstudy
default, steps should be taken by institutions and by individual 
defaultuniversity 
defaultdepartments and schools to make 
defaultclear to female science students that their contribution is valued entirely on a par with that of their male counterparts. Any 
defaultsuggestion of gende
defaultr 
defaultbias in the culture should be addressed at this early stage by thoroughgoing equality and diversity training
default for all staff and by having a system that offer
defaults
default support if ever such bias, or indeed discrimination of any kind, seems to manifest itself.
default A contribution towards this would be an ‘inclusive curriculum’ aiming
default 
defaultto support academic schools in reviewing the 
defaultinclusivity and accessibility of their practices in learning, teaching and assessment, and in implementing an action plan to promote equality.
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt goes without saying that this culture should continue at postgraduate level, since this is the point at which 
defaultmany female students will decid
defaulte
default whether they wish to become paid researchers and make a career in academic science. Their experience at this 
defaultstage
default will therefore be crucial.
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOnce female postgraduates are taken into employment, either
default as
default postdoctoral 
defaultresea
defaultrchers 
defaultand/or as 
defaultlecturers
default, the process whereby their value is clearly demonstrated to them by the institution should continue,  by effective mentoring by either female or male colleagues who are fully and consciously aware of the need 
defaultto 
defaultsupport them and foster their confidence in every area. Universities could also 
defaultconsider the way fixed term appointments are managed and look at alternative options 
defaultto extend them after expir
defaulty
default, if necessary by the use of bridging arrangements. 
default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversitie
defaults
default should promote the academic career
default and the many benefits associated with it, such as the flexible working arrangements / generous annual leave entitlement,
default at events to its own undergraduates and PhD students.  
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversity appointment committees could lo
defaultok for a new way in measuring the output of an individual, such as normalising by the number of years working in the post, which takes into consideration part-time work and maternity leave. 
default This is currently used in evaluating research output in the Rese
defaultarch Excellence Framework (REF)
default.
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs mentioned earlier, women in academia can be 
defaultdisproportionately
default penalised by ‘out-of hours’ working patterns, since they are more likely than men to have caring commitments.
default For this reason, it behoves institutions to take into account the need that women scientists may have to keep ‘regular’ hours and to accommodate work arrangements that allow this. Nor should such accommodation be seen as women receiving particular privile
defaultges but rather as a necessary quid pro quo for the diversity of talents
default,
default approaches 
defaultand 
defaultinnovation
default 
defaultthat a diverse workforce necessarily brings to a discipline and 
defaultto 
defaultan institution. 
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultUniversities should seek to give special prominence to women who have gai
defaultned positions of leadership and academic authority in the institution in order to provide role models for other aspiring female academics. 
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn a practical level, universities should make sure that events essential for normal participation in academic life 
default(meetings, outside lectures, etc.) are held at times of day that are not likely to disadvantage female scientists with family commitments.  
default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhat role should the Government have in encouraging the 
defaultretention of women in academic STEM careers?
default&#xa0;
default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultCan the government find a way of mitigating the precarious material situation that many postdoctoral and early career science researchers find themselves in? If a central fund were available to offer more secur
defaulte, or longer-term, employment to these staff it would benefit both men and women. But, crucially, it would almost certainly mean that proportionately a larger percentage of female than male staff would feel sufficiently comfortable not to contemplate the p
defaultossibility of leaving academic research. This would especially be the case for female staff with family commitments on whom pressure
defaults
default can already be great without the added stress of not being sure if contract renewal is likely in the near future.

defaultThe gove
defaultrnment could also 
defaultconsider 
defaultset
defaultting
default up a body to investigate the issue of gender equality
default in the universities
default and the extent to which it is being 
defaultimplemented and 
defaultachieved. Such a body could 
defaultpraise, publicise and recompense good practice while sanctioning institutions where unsatisfactory approaches or lack of progress were 
defaultfound
default. 
default 
default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe same body could also investigate how effectively dedicated schemes for women in science (e.g. Athena SWAN, P
defaultroject Juno) are being implemented and utilised to change the gender culture of universities and the historic under-representation of women in STEM disciplines.
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment could 
defaultinvestigate the possibility of 
defaultrequir
defaulting
default funding bodies to 
defaultmake the achievemen
defaultt of a proven demonstrable level of equality and diversity necessary as a condition of full funding awards to those bodies.

default23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs a positive action measure t
defaulthe government could help in dismantling the barriers that women face by giving the ‘same opportunity’
default to women as men in 
defaultResearch Councils grant submissions.
default 
defaultThis would mean in cases where grants are evaluated with the same academic score, priority is given to grant where applicants in STEM subjects are female or from a minority group. 
default24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment could 
defaultinvestigate the possibility of having
default some kind of adjustment for people who have taken periods of leave/career breaks to care for family members. This would apply equally to men and to women.
default25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGovernment could investigate the possibility of funding mentori
