Recommendations and exploration of other non-chemotherapeutic antimicrobials (hereafter referred to as microbicidal products) to prevent the spread of resistant strains are not being fully considered.\n&#xa0;\nThe number of microbicidal products (i.e. products containing microbicides as defined by the Biocidal Product Regulation) and their applications has increased over the last 10 years. The EC is unable to provide data on the total amounts and types of microbicides and microbicidal products used within the European Union per year. Set against this however, in healthcare settings, usage of microbicidal products, particularly for environmental cleaning/disinfection, has declined in the last 50 or so years, apart from a few exceptions related to the control of \nClostridium difficile\n and methicillin-resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus \n(MRSA).\n&#xa0;\nIt is now well accepted that not only the hands but also environmental surfaces (particularly contact surfaces) contribute significantly to the spread of infection both in hospital and out of hospital settings. By definition this means that these surfaces also contribute to the spread of AMR bacteria. Increased hand hygiene and surface decontamination compliance in healthcare settings has been linked to a decrease in infection rates. Since the routes of transmission, and the transmissibility of AMR bacteria are the same as those for non-AMR pathogens, the same control measures are appropriate to both. Measures to improve cleaning and microbicidal product compliance in both hospital and non-hospital settings and their application are needed. \n&#xa0;\nOn the other hand there is measurable evidence that exposure to microbicides can lead to reduced sensitivity to antimicrobials in microbial populations. The use of microbicides and antimicrobial resistance has been highlighted in recent European documentation. Research and investment on the impact of microbicides on emerging AMR and the spread or maintenance of AMR genetic determinants is scarce. A number of questions about the sue of microbicidal products remain unanswered:\n&#xa0;\n The recommendations from this group are as follows:\n&#xa0;\nAbout this group\n&#xa0;\nThis group of international scientists assembled because of common interests in translational issues about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in relation to the use of microbicidal products. A publication from this group in the November 2013 Microbial Drug Resistance issue (attached), refers to the key literature, debates\n the increasing use of microbicides in consumer products and the raising concerns related to enhance microbicide resistance in bacteria and potential cross-resistance to \nchemotherapeutic\n antimicrobials\n&#xa0;\nReasons for submitting evidence\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe written evidence submitted by this group focuses on the non-chemotherapeutic antimicrobials.\n&#xa0;\nFactual information\n&#xa0;\nHow has antimicrobial resistance developed in the past decade?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the gaps in our knowledge about antimicrobial resistance?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Is there sufficient research and investment into new antibiotics or other treatments and methods to ensure continued protection against infection? If not, how could this be rectified?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat measures (including behavioral change) have been most effective in controlling the spread of resistant pathogens, and could such measures be used to control other pathogens?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat global coordination and action is required to fight antimicrobial resistance and is the UK contributing enough towards cross-border initiatives?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhat are the strengths and weaknesses of the Government’s 2013-2018 strategy for tackling antimicrobial resistance? What changes might be made to further strengthen the Government’s action plan?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRecommendations\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
