[[[Introduction]]]

[[[ ]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru (TAC) is the trade association representing the interests of the Welsh independent production sector. Wales has had an independent TV production sector since 1982, when Channel 4 and the Welsh language broadcaster S4C began broadcasting. Today, with over 40 companies turning over £200m, the sector is now a thriving creative industry that makes a wide range of content – drama, factual, animation, music and entertainment, live events, current affairs, lifestyle and so on. There is also an independent radio production sector in Wales producing for BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru.2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Welsh producers make programmes not only for BBC Wales and S4C but also for the UK–wide channels, for example: the award-winning ‘The Indian Doctor’ made for BBC1 by Rondo Media; 'Helicopter Rescue' by Cwmni Da was broadcast on network BBC1 after first broadcast on BBC Wales; and ‘Arctic with Bruce Parry’ made by Indus Films for BBC2; and Telesgop’s ‘Turner and the Thames’ for BBC4. Productions for UK commercial PSBs include Avanti’s documentary on Britain’s Got Talent finalists Jonathan and Charlotte for ITV1 and Rondo’s ‘My Tattoo Addiction’ for Channel 4. Welsh producers are also working with companies overseas to create international co-productions.3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC clearly has an important part to play in Wales, as does fellow broadcaster S4C which since 2013 has mainly been funded by the Licence Fee. There are major decisions to be made in the next BBC Charter to ensure that public service broadcasting in Wales continues to be diverse, vibrant and sufficiently well-funded to ensure that this UK nation has a continuing and thriving creative sector.  This sector must be able to reflect its voices, creative talent and stories to its own population and also to the rest of the UK and beyond.4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; In this context TAC greatly welcomes the Committee’s decision to hold its inquiry into ‘The Future of the BBC’. We hope that the Committee will find the perspective and proposals presented here of interest and would be grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to expand upon them.  We will briefly address each of the Committee’s areas of interest, before turning to concentrate on the future of the Licence Fee and the BBC’s relationship with S4C.

[[[Answers to the Committee’s Specific Question]]]

[[[s]]]

[[[What should the BBC be for and what should be the purpose of public service broadcasting?]]]5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC should continue to provide content which is not easily available in the commercial space, and content which adds creative competition to commercial broadcasting. It plays a vital role in providing a wide range of challenging and enlightening content without which our society would be poorer.

[[[How well has the BBC performed in the current Charter period in achieving its mission and public purposes?]]]6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC has provided a wide range of content and provided some exciting new services – the i-Player is an unqualified success, as is its news content and also its big audience items such as ‘Strictly’. Also, its wildlife unit remains one of the best in the world. It continues to provide high quality and popular drama and high standard of current affairs and factual output. 7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However while it has sought to increase production capacity in some areas outside London – eg Salford – it has not sufficiently maintained its commitment to the nations, including Wales, where budgets have decreased significantly, with significant reduction in budgets for services like Radio Cymru and Radio Wales (though a service like Radio 4 was exempt from such cuts in the DQF) and in the cost of provision of Welsh language content for S4C. 

[[[Are the public purposes in the current Charter the right ones? How might they change?]]]8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; There should be a greater emphasis on encouraging UK creativity and innovation, as well as greater diversity of content for Licence Fee Payers, via independently produced content. 

[[[What scope, scale and remit should the BBC have?]]]

[[[Should the BBC’s output and services be provided to any greater or lesser degr]]]

[[[ee for particular audiences?]]]9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The BBC should ensure that the nations of the UK are having their stories told and lives reflected both in their own areas and across the UK. Despite the BBC having a major drama centre in Cardiff Bay, there remain very few programmes that are distinctively Welsh in character which are shown on the UK-wide BBC networks.  Of equal importance is output and volume made in Wales which has a UK-wide and international perspective and appeal. 

[[[What balance should be struck in wh]]]

[[[at the BBC produces in-house, commissions externally and leaves entirely to others to create?]]]10.&#xa0; Moving  forward there will be an increasing need for the BBC to be flexible, whilst not allowing for itself to be outpaced by technological advancements and convergence-related change. For this reason a BBC which is more slimline in structure, less bureaucratic and top heavy, with a healthier balance between in-house and externally produced content would make sense.  This will also allow it to provide a greater range of content to the Licence Fee Payer and to better reflect audiences all around the UK.11.&#xa0; The Committee will know that the UK TV production sector has benefitted greatly from interventions undertaken by previous governments, firstly to set up Channel 4 and S4C as PSBs which, as publisher-broadcasters, commissioned wholly from the UK indie TV sector, and secondly introduced the 25% independent production quota. The addition of a Window of Creative Competition by the BBC in 2007, along with the protection of indie companies’ IP rights in the 2003 Communications Act, has resulted in a hugely successful international industry. It has also given the Licence Fee Payer access to a wider range of innovative ideas and fresh talent.12.&#xa0; TAC was encouraged to hear BBC Creative Director Alan Yentob talk at the Edinburgh TV Festival in August of the possibility of the 50% in-house guarantee for BBC in-house producers being removed within five years. TAC hopes this reflects a general understanding in the BBC that, with TV indie producers winning between 75%-80% of commissions competed for by both in-house and indies, the way forward is to allow more such competition. A good next step might be for BBC TV to move to a 50% WoCC, and TAC would welcome such a recommendation being made by the Committee.13.&#xa0; In radio, indie production has less scope, with only a 10% quota and additional 10% WoCC in operation. TAC’s producers involved in radio have noted that in the first year of its operation, the radio WoCC saw 80% of the hours on offer won by indie radio companies. This is a clear sign that BBC Radio could benefit from additional competition. TAC would therefore support the independent radio production sector in its call for a 25% quota and 25% WoCC to allow the sector to grow and provide more creative competition, again for the benefit of the Licence Fee Payer and the UK economy.

[[[How have the BBC’s commercial activities during the current Charter fitted with the BBC’s public purposes and have they achieved an]]]

[[[ adequate return for licence fee payers? What should be the aims, scope and scale of such activities beyond 2016?]]]14.&#xa0; It is fair for the BBC to be able to maximise the value of the content it produces – revenue from international sales, secondary channel deals, DVDs, downloads and so on can be used to increase the content budget. Of course the BBC should always have an eye to whether or not it is adversely affecting commercial organisations through such activity. It should also not use the fact that it owns the IP to in-house produced content as a reason to restrict opening up its commissioning to competition from independent producers. The more successful and high-quality BBC programmes are, the more revenue they can sometimes generate, meaning everybody – the BBC, the indie producer and the Licence Fee Payer – benefits.

[[[What role should the BBC play in developing technology and new way]]]

[[[s of distributing content?]]]15.&#xa0; It is important for the BBC to make sure it has its content on whatever platform the LF payer chooses to access it – eg online, on mobile and so on. However in doing so it must always ensure it is allowing the producers of that content to benefit from the use of their intellectual property. 

[[[How should the BBC be governed, regulated and held accountable beyond 2016?]]]

[[[In a constantly evolving communications environment, does a 10-year Royal Charter and Agreement with the Secretary ]]]

[[[of State, together, provide the most appropriate constitutional framework for the BBC?]]]16.&#xa0; As long as there is a fundamentally flexible nature to the BBC’s structure it should be able to deal with new changes and challenges within the current Charter system.17.&#xa0; TAC believes it is very important for the Secretary of State to have ultimate responsibility for the Public Service broadcasters – for this reason we are unhappy with the BBC Trust having the power to withdraw its funding of S4C ‘in extremis’. It is also one of the reasons why the continued direct grant from DCMS to S4C is important, as this dual funding mechanism provides greater stability in terms of S4C preserving its editorial and operating independence. 

[[[How should the BBC be funded beyond 2016?]]] 

[[[Is ]]]

[[[there a case for distributing funding for public service content more widely beyond the BBC?]]]18.&#xa0; TAC’s opinion is that the TV Licence Fee has provided a very useful way of funding PSB broadcasting in the UK in a way that has successfully augmented the commercial PSB services, in addition to the growing range of pay-channels.19.&#xa0; Whilst the landscape has undoubtedly changed, TAC still believes that the TV Licence Fee provides a valuable and unique way of funding additional programming and services which is of benefit to the UK citizen and which allows creative entrepreneurs to produce a wider and greater range of PSB content.20.&#xa0; Prior to the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010, S4C had an index-linked public grant from the Department for Culture Media &amp; Sport. In 2010 this stood at just over £100m. As part of the 2010 CSR, this arrangement was altered by the DCMS. The new arrangement meant that S4C had its budget reduced in real terms by some 36% - the main part of its continuing funding was to come from the TV Licence Fee, with a remaining c£7m to be a continuing grant from DCMS. Its other sources of funding are from advertising and from programme and format sales, although it obviously shares the proceeds of the latter with the independent producers who originate the content, talent and ideas.21.&#xa0; Since this initial large cut, S4C has been subject to further cuts: as part of the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement in 2012, the DCMS announced a further round of funding reductions for S4C of 1% in 2013-14 and 2% in 2014-15. Following the Chancellor’s Spring Budget Statement in 2013 further cuts were announced of 1.09% in 2013-14 and 1.06% in 2014-15. Lastly, the BBC Trust then included S4C’s non-content costs within the BBC’s own cost-cutting exercise. S4C’s budget was therefore effectively under attack from both the BBC Trust and the Government.22.&#xa0; This situation caused difficulty in terms of S4C being able to plan ahead, and commission content and services in the way that other commercial or PSB  broadcasters are able to do. TAC, alongside several other stakeholders and organisations, consistently argued that this constant stream of cuts should be ceased. As a result the DCMS announced in the CSR earlier this year that the Government grant to S4C would not be the subject of any further cuts until at least 2016.  Though a positive result in the short term, this however leaves many unanswered questions: What will happen to the Government grant post-2016? How can S4C be protected from further cuts imposed on it by the BBC Trust, in the latter’s position as ‘guardian of the Licence Fee’?23.&#xa0; TAC also made a strong case regarding the Operating Agreement which defines the new ‘partnership’ between the BBC and S4C. The Agreement is between the BBC Trust and the S4C Authority, the latter of which is the governing body for S4C.24.&#xa0; Whilst several changes were made to the Agreement which clarified the relationships and further protected S4C’s editorial, operational and managerial independence some areas remained of concern,.  These included the fact that, as stated above, the BBC Trust was inflicting upon another broadcaster cuts agreed by the Trust for the BBC specifically and secondly, the power for the BBC Trust ‘in extremis’ to withdraw its funding from S4C altogether. It is TAC’s view that this power should ultimately lie with the sponsoring Government department – the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport, which also continues to provide funding for S4C &#xad;– alongside the statutory duty to ensure sufficient funding for S4C, which is included in the Public Bodies Act.25.&#xa0; S4C is a unique broadcaster and not in any way part of the BBC. It plays a unique role in the everyday lives of the people of Wales as well as making a progressive and key contribution to Wales, its economy, and the Welsh language.  Its publisher-broadcaster model means that it commissions all of its content externally, from the Welsh independent production sector. It also has a remit of its own to commission programming that meets with the unique requirements and taste of a particular audience namely the people of Wales, be they fluent Welsh speakers, learners or those who aspire to learn the language.  This includes high-level content focusing, issues of great concern to the people of Wales, from the Welsh language to heritage, culture and music, Wales’ agricultural heritage as well as factual programmes, sport, high-quality drama or reflecting the issues specific to different parts of Wales.  It provides invaluable and unique provision for children – from pre-school to teenagers (content originated and produced in Wales) and it also provides content for Welsh language learners. As a national broadcaster it has been vital in enabling a creative sector to be based all around Wales – in the capital city Cardiff and also in Caernarfon, in Swansea and in Llanelli. 26.&#xa0; The Committee will be aware that one of the arguments in favour of a number of PSB and commercial broadcasters is that UK citizens are provided with a richer and more diverse range of content thanks to this plurality combined with stated public purposes.27.&#xa0; Therefore it is important that Wales as a nation with its own language and culture (but which sits within the wider UK) should have a plurality of broadcasters. It is also important for the continuing growth of the UK creative sector as a whole. Having a production sector in Wales, and encouraging Wales to have its own outlook and stories to tell, is a reason why Wales has been able to produce Y Gwyll / Hinterland. This drama series, which has met with much critical acclaim, made use of Welsh cultural touchstones as well as the unique landscape in and around Aberystwyth to make compelling television that is already succeeding internationally as well in the rest of the UK. A second series has already been commissioned on the back of the success of the first. 28.&#xa0; Co-produced by the Fiction Factory with S4C, Tinopolis, the S4C co-production fund and All3Media International, Y Gwyll has already produced strong audience numbers on S4C and this will grow when it is aired on BBC Four and BBC Cymru Wales in 2014. Its high quality, reminiscent of shows such as The Killing, has been demonstrated by the fact that the Danish network which was responsible for The Killing has bought the series to show on its own network. 29.&#xa0; As an independent broadcasting organisation, which simply happens to share the same funding source as the BBC, S4C’s budget should not automatically be cut every time the BBC reduces costs across its service.  S4C has its own business model and needs to have the independence of management and security of funding to be able to deliver it effectively.30.&#xa0; TAC considers it essential that:31.&#xa0; If the plurality of Welsh PSB broadcasting, along with the Welsh language and the independent production sector are to be allowed to flourish, the above measures are essential. If it is not possible within the current arrangement to ensure this editorial and operational independence, TAC believes that the Committee should examine whether or not it would be preferable to allocate a specific proportion of the TV Licence Fee directly to S4C, entirely separately from the Licence Fee money that is the responsibility of the BBC Trust. This would have the added advantage of restoring full operational and managerial independence to S4C.32.&#xa0; TAC is very aware of the contrasting arguments on the merits of such 'top-slicing’ and is not necessarily saying it would support this proposal as a first option, but it is important to make sure above all else that S4C continues to be able to operate effectively as a separate entity with sufficient guaranteed funding to fulfil its objectives. If it cannot do so within the current arrangement then other arrangements including top-slicing the Licence Fee ought to be considered. 33.&#xa0; A plurality of broadcasting is as important in Wales as it is elsewhere. S4C also contributes greatly to the Welsh economy – an independent report published earlier this year showed that every pound spent in the Welsh creative industries generated nearly £2 worth of economic growth. S4C provides high-quality programmes unique in its character and content. It must not be allowed to be damaged by the lack of a sustainable funding arrangement or risk of losing its editorial and managerial independence.&#xa0;December 2013&#xa0; “1.4 The Agreement ensures the editorial, managerial and operational independence of the S4C Authority and the S4C Services provided by it”.
