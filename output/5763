defaultExamination of WitnessesdefaultWitnesses:
default 
defaultDr Ruth Foxdefault, Director and Head of Research, Hansard Society, and 
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault, 
defaultformerly 
defaultLead Researcher on Delegated Legislation, 
defaultHansard Society
default, 
defaultgave evidence.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ1 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Ruth, you are becoming a veteran
default of this Committee.
defaultDr Foxdefault: It feels like it.
defaultChair:default Joel, have you been before us before?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: This is the first time, Chair.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ2 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default I am sure it will not be your last. Thank you for coming here. We are looking at statutory instruments, and we have an excellent set of questions prepared by the 
defaultClerks 
defaultof the Committee
default.
default I am not going to waste any time, because we do not have a lot of time. What prompted the Hansard Society to look into delegated legislation? What is it you were expecting to find?
defaultDr Foxdefault: What prompted it 
defaultwere
default two previous studies that we had done looking at legislative process
default.
default 
defaultIn the interests of transparency, I should say that that research and this research was funded by the Nuffield Foundation. 
defaultFrom
default those two studies of the legislative process, it became clear that delegated legislation was an issue that had not been looked at to any great extent in recent years
default. I
defaultt 
defaultwas 
defaultalso an area of growing concern 
defaultbecause of
default the volume, the complexity and the expansion of the number of scrutiny methods and mechanisms that were, at present, concerned about Henry VIII powers.
defaultWith Joel as our lead researcher on the project
default, what we have done over a two-year period 
defaultis look at six case studies
default:
default three Bills in this Parliament and three Bills in the previous Parliament. We have deliberately looked at controversial elements
default: at where 
defaultthere were concerns about Henry VIII, about the conferring of powers and 
defaultabout 
defaultthe scrutiny mechanisms. We have looked at those Bills through the life cycle
default,
default beginning in 
defaultWhitehall
default.
default 
defaultOur 
defaultconcern is not just what happens here in terms of scrutiny, but what happens upstream in Whitehall in terms of the decision to make the separation between primary and secondary, and then also the drafting and handling process upstream in Whitehall
default,
default and the impact that has, as well as what happens 
defaultthen 
defaultwhen it arrives in the Commons and the Lords.
defaultOur concern throughout has been to think about
default h
defaultow you deal with the most controversial and the most difficult elements of the system, and what that 
defaultthen 
defaulttell
defaults
default us about how we might reform the process to address those difficulties and separate out the less controversial, day-to-day statutory instruments and delegat
defaulted legislat
defaultion from the controversial, and make sure that Parliament is looking at what Parliament wants and needs to look at,
default given the deluge of delegation.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ3 default&#xa0; 
defaultJenny Chapman:default Everything you are saying is ringing lots of bells with me, having sat through too many of these and having to d
defaulteal
default with the
defaultm from the
default 
defaultFront Bench 
defaultas well. It is very rare in my area that we will find anything that is controversial
default. M
defaultost of it we have either done to death as the Bill went through 
defaultCommittee, 
defaultor it is something that is perfectly sensible and we are happy, but you feel obliged to turn up and make a speech. You have to whip a 
defaultCommittee 
defaulttogether
default and y
defaultou are taking 
defaultup Clerks’ 
defaulttime, and you do wonder whether that is the most sensible way to proceed.
default 
defaultI wonder what mechanism you might use
default,
default if you want to sift out some of these 
defaultCommittee 
defaultmeetings
default, and
default how you might go about doing that.
defaultDr Foxdefault: I 
defaultwill 
defaulttake us back to first principles, and then I will ask Joel to comment on the sifting mechanisms. 
defaultO
defaultur approach is that jumping to the mechanisms first is problematic because of the volume and the complexity now
default. T
defaulthere is 
defaultalso 
defaultthe difficulty that other Procedure Committee inquiries and other 
defaultCommittees 
defaulthave looked at this 
defaultpreviously 
defaultover the years and come up with, “We need a sifting mechanism; we need an amendable motion” and so on. I think
default there is a sense that,
default to some extent
default,
default that could be a bit of a sticking plaster and dealing with the problem after the horse has bolted
default. W
defaulthat needs to happen is to take a step back
default,
default look at the whole process in the round and ask
default, 
defaultfrom first principles
default: what 
defaultis being delegated
default,
default and why? What should the balance be
default,
default in terms of detail? What does Parliament collectively want to look at? What does this House care to look at, and what is it happy to leave to the House of Lords? What does this House want to look at additionally
default, and, m
defaultore broadly, given the volume
default, what might it consider leaving to expert bodies
default?
defaultJoel can comment on some of the specifics of that, but our approach would be not 
defaultto 
defaultjump to that immediately and try to solve bits of the process
default, but t
defaulto take a step 
defaultbackwards 
defaultand look at it in a more collective way.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ4 default&#xa0; 
defaultJenny Chapman:default My sense is that 
defaultG
defaultovernments will always want to have a fair chunk of what they want to do as delegated, and we have this debate 
defaulton 
defaultevery Bill I have ever done. We want it on the face of the Bill and they want to have the ability to do it this way. Assuming that they are going to carry on doing it that way
default,
default and they are 
defaultprobably 
defaultnot going to be persuaded to change that aspect of the decision-making process, what could you do to filter out perhaps the less controversial S
defaultIs? Would 
defaultyou look at it in terms of how controversial they are, or would you look at it in some other way?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: 
defaultT
defaulto add to what Ruth was saying, when we interviewed parliamentarians and particular public officials on the drafting process, there was very much a sense that assigning an SI to a procedure was very much a gut feeling
default.
default In 1996
default,
default 
defaultthe Procedure Committee 
defaultpointed 
defaultit 
defaultout and took evidence
default,
default 
defaultand
default I think it was one of the parliamentary 
defaultClerks 
defaultwho 
defaultsaid that sometimes it can lead to chance
default,
default and that is where mistakes can be made. Reiterating what Ruth was saying
default,
default a sifting committee of some type may just 
defaultbe 
defaultputting a plaster on the situation
default. First, w
defaulte need to sit down 
defaultand think 
defaultcarefully about the set criteria for what Parliament wants to be see
default,
default and then we can move on from there. I think the sifting committee would benefit from that open and honest discussion about set criteria for an affirmative 
defaultprocedure, something 
defaultcontroversial
default,
default or something that Parliament wants to 
defaultactually 
defaultsee and talk about.
defaultDr Foxdefault: We have not finished our project
default,
default and we have not concluded our recommendations
default.
default 
defaultI imagine w
defaulte will have 
defaultdone so 
defaultby the time your inquiry is finished, so you will have a view in advance. One of the issues we are looking at is
default this: 
defaultif you were to try to establish criteria, can that be done across Government as a whole, or are there ways in which you might break it down in terms of types of legislation, different circumstances and different 
defaultd
defaultepartments? For example, tax
default,
default welfare 
defaultor
default form
defaultal
default legislation might be very different in terms of the criteria and the balance for another 
defaultd
defaultepartment and whether that is feasible. 
defaultAt
default the moment 
defaultwe
default do
defaultn’
defaultt know
default the answer
default,
default becaus
defaulte are still working through the mechanics of it
default. B
defaultut that is the sort of thing we are looking at. Then the 
defaultCommittee 
defaultmodel could follow from that.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ5 default&#xa0; 
defaultJenny Chapman:default I think that MPs are going to want to be able to call things in, should they want to
default. Or s
defaultomething might come up that this criteria would not apply to but
default,
default for whatever reason, the Opposition feels that it wants a bit of an airing
default,
default and that is the only opportunity to do so, and 
defaultthat it
default is important to keep that in the system
default, so—
defaultDr Foxdefault: 
defaultY
defaultou could have a sifting committee. The question is then, 
defaulti
defaults it duplicative of what the House of Lords is doing? One of the questions is
default: 
defaultgiven the volume, 
defaultdoes this House look at mechanisms it puts in place 
defaultand do it unilaterally
default—
defaultput a measure in to address its concerns
default—
defaultor does it look at it in conjunction with the Lords and come up with a streamlined process? This House specifically 
defaultdecides
default, as the elected House, 
defaultwhat 
defaultit particularly wants to do and what it is content to leave to the Lords.
defaultChair:default 
defaultT
defaulthe point is that
default,
default potentially
default,
default there could be a way of doing things so 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are 
defaultfewer
default SIs going to 
defaultCommittee
default—so 
defaultthat
default the ones that do go in are the ones of greatest interest to the House
default. I think that
default has attractions
default because, a
defaults you know, 
defaulta lot of SIs 
defaultgo in to 
defaultCommittee 
defaultand are dealt with in a matter of minutes, but there is a lot of time spent getting to that point. Who was going to raise concerns about Henry VIII and all 
defaultof 
defaultthat?
default&#xa0;
defaultQ6 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Nuttall:default Yes. Before we turn to Henry VIII clauses, while you have been conducting the research so far, have you come across any specific examples of where the procedure that is being followed for SIs has been inappropriate?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: There was one case with the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and the orders that came about from those. 
defaultDo 
defaultyou know about the process
default? The 
defaultGovernment decides and lets the 
defaultCommittee 
defaultknow what procedure it prefers and what it thinks it should be scrutinised at
default. O
defaultne of the particular orders was a negative procedure in the Government’s eyes, 
defaultbut
default the Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
default 
defaultdecided to upgrade that to a super-affirmative procedure, which is quite a giant leap in terms of 
defaultCommittee 
defaultprocedures.
defaultI think it goes back to the point that we were making at the beginning in terms of leaving it to gut feeling 
defaultwhen
default assigning a procedure, and the switch between the affirmative and the negative can lead to mistakes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ7 default&#xa0; 
defaultMr Nuttall:default Turning to the Henry VIII powers, have you come across any examples where they have been used inappropriately while you have been doing this?
defaultDr Foxdefault: In terms of the Bills we have looked at, 
defaultthere was the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act; 
defaultthe initial powers on the Bill were very, very wide
default. You 
defaultthen 
defaulthave 
defaultthe inclusion of 
defaultpublic bodies. I gave evidence just before Christmas on the 
defaultd
defaultraft Deregulation Bill, where there w
defaultere
default very, very wide Henry VIII powers that I would regard as inappropriate in the context of what the Government was doing. 
defaultT
defaulthe concern we have about Henry VIII powers—they are not always a bad thing, and I think there is an assumption now too much that perhaps every Henry VIII is wrong and we should not have any of them
default—
defaultis that the first instinct of the Government
default is
default to go to the Henry VIII and to do it through the delegation, whereas it ought to be the last stage if they have considered things like repeal consolidation, Law Commission and so on
default,
default as options for revising the statute book. Too often it is a first resort and there are too many of them.
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: Just to add to that, one of our objectives was to tell the story of delegated legislation throughout the last century
default,
default the reform processes and the inquiries that have taken place on delegated legislation. Henry VIII powers were first raised in 1932 by the Donoughmore Committee
default. T
defaulthey said that they should be used only in exceptional cases and in times of emergency, so we are going over the same issues again and again. As Ruth rightly says, not all Henry VIII powers are bad, but three of the cases that we have seen were framework Bills. Three of them had some very wide powers. 
defaultOn introduction to the House of t
defaulthe Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 
defaultin 
default2006, the first clause was enabling the Minister by order to reform legislation
default.
default I think there is a concern with academic
defaults and
default people 
defaultwho are 
defaultinterested in this that we may have reached the bottom line and 
defaultthat 
defaultthe floodgates may have opened
default, and w
defaulte are 
defaultnow 
defaultseeing around 100 Henry VIII clauses appearing per 
defaultSession
default.
defaultDr Foxdefault: One of the concerns is
default:
default is the debate shifting in Parliament to focus on the scrutiny procedure to constrain the power, rather than the question of whether the power should be there in the first place? The Government has responded on the 
defaultd
defaultraft Deregulation Bill, and the 
defaultfinal version of 
defaultBill that has 
defaultbeen 
defaultbrought forward does not have those clauses in it. They have taken it out and responded to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage
default. B
defaultut there is an awful lot of discussion now
default,
default in terms of focusing on the Henry VIII 
defaultpowers, 
defaultaround
default, “H
defaultow do we constrain it with these enhanced or super-affirmatives?
default”
default The consequence of that is that the debate becomes more about the control of it, rather than the principle of whether it should be there in the first place. We have ended up in a situation where, because of the way the Government handles it and grants concessions
default—
defaultparticularly in the Lords
default—
defaultaround the enhanced and affirmative procedures to constrain the power, you are ending up with 
defaulta
default huge number of variations of scrutiny
default. That is 
defaultadding layer on layer of complexity and making it even more difficult for people, parliamentarians included, to understand, let alone anybody else outside. It goes back to the question of whether they should be there in the first place as opposed to the constant focus on the constraint.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ8 default&#xa0; 
defaultMartin Vickers:default The Lords have much more comprehensive SI scrutiny. Are there any examples of good and bad practice that you have come across that you can draw to our attention?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: The Delegated Powers Committee in particular
default; 
defaultthere are some examples of good practice there. The reports are very good. I think there is a lot of respect for the recommendations made by the Committee, and the Government tends to accept them, although there are issues. Although the Committee is viewed by other jurisdictions as a benchmark for good practice, throughout our research we have noted things that could be improved, particularly with regard to talking about precedent when it comes to procedures. Also, there is significant variability in the delegated powers memorandum that is submitted by 
defaultDepartments 
defaultto that Committee
default. I think
default the Committee is yet to really push and use the powers that they exercise to improve that in some cases. The other 
defaultCommittees 
defaultas well
default—
defaultdo you want to talk about those, Ruth?
defaultDr Foxdefault: Yes. One of the things that the Lords 
defaulthave
default done particularly well is to push the boundaries. I take the point that the Government wants its legislation through as quickly as possible, but the Lords Committees have been quite strong at pushing at the boundaries, first of all by Delegated Powers issuing its detailed guidance, which now is encompassed in the Cabinet Office 
defaultGuide to Making Legislation
default. 
defaultCertainly all the Bill teams—when they are working on the Bills and developing them in the 
defaultDepartments
default—have to make reference to that and use that as a guide to how they develop the Bill. 
defaultAs Joel says, the consequence of that is that there is often a consultation process with the Committee in advance before they move forward to try to avoid difficulties. 
defaultClearly t
defaulthat is not perfect
default,
default but it certainly helps. The consequence of that is that a lot of the recommendations of the Committee are adhered to.
defaultThe other 
defaultCommittee 
defaultin the Lords where they pushed at the boundaries a few years ago—I think it was 20
default06 or 2007—was the s
defaultuper
default-c
defaultasino 
defaulto
defaultrder, where they took evidence for the first time on the reasons why 
defaultManchester
default had been chosen over 
defaultBlackpool
default. I think that occasionally pushing at the boundaries of their remit, stepping out a little bit and pushing the Government, has really changed how delegated legislation is dealt with in the Upper House. As Joel says, it is not perfect in the sense that we have found instances where the Delegated Powers Committee has missed things
default that 
defaultget either a lot of consideration in this House or
default,
default indeed
default, in the Lords.
defaultOne of the interesting 
defaultquestion
defaults for the Commons is
default 
defaultthis:
default while
default the Delegated Powers reports are regarded as very useful, they only kick in on Lords starters to benefit this House. On a Commons starter, you do not get that information until it is in the Lords, and then it comes back
default.
default I wonder if there is a gap there for the Commons
default,
default in terms of the information and pushback provided, and whether some kind of model is needed
default.
default 
defaultB
defaultut then you do not want to duplicate and replicate what is going on, so is there a way to try to get that information on Commons starters earlier? You get into fairly tortuous issues around the relationship between the two Houses, but I do think there is a gap there in terms of the material available to this House when it begins scrutinising those.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ9 default&#xa0; 
defaultMartin Vickers:default Are there other additional points that you would want to make that could improve the Commons system in order to complement what is happening in the Upper House?
defaultDr Foxdefault: Changes to the Delegated Legislation Committees
default.
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: Yes, I think many of you will understand the difficulty of being on a Delegated Legislation Committee and the frustrations that you can have sometimes on those 
defaultCommittees
default. I think there are some quick-fix reforms that could really improve the way that statutory instruments are debated on those 
defaultCommittees
default. We like the idea of having consistency of membership. A lot of the interviews that I held with people 
defaultwho 
defaultwere focal in terms of the Welfare Reform Bill or the Public Bodies Bill really wanted to carry on that process after 
defaultRoyal Assent
default, and wanted to sit on Delegated Legislation Committees and look at the regulations that were quite a substantial part of that Bill, but they were frustrated by the 
defaultWhips
default. We think that 
defaultperhaps
default a consistency on the Public Bill Committee and moving that on to a DL Committee would be a good thing.
defaultAlso, 
defaulton 
defaultthe European Scrutiny Committees and when they move paperwork 
defaulton 
defaultto the A, B or C Committees, you can have one or two of the Select Committee members on that 
defaultCommittee 
defaulttoo, which 
defaultagain 
defaultprovides consistency
default. 
defaultI think that would enable and enhance debate. We do not like the time limits. They seem quite arbitrary. A lot of the time limits across the whole delegated legislation process seem quite arbitrary, like the 40 days or 60 days. It feels as if they are picked up 
defaultfrom 
defaultthere
default. Fo
defaultr example,
default there is the question of 
defaultwhy Northern Ireland Committees can look at an SI for 
defaulttwo and a half 
defaulthours but DLCs can only 
defaulthave
default 
defaultone and a half
default. There is no explanation for it
default—
defaultthings like that.
defaultIn the research that we were doing, we were thinking a lot about incentives, in terms of incentivising MPs to want to take part and really be passionate about the work they do on these 
defaultCommittees
default. Then you move into questions about amendable SIs and amending delegated legislation, but I think that—
defaultDr Foxdefault: I think we have concerns about the amended ones. I am sure that comes up as one of the usual list of reforms. We would prefer the conditional approach, where you reject, subject to X, Y and Z being done, 
defaultand then
default you would be prepared to accept. I think there is an issue about doing amendables, and there are potential drafting consequences and difficulties that arise from that. Departments should have to do the heavy lifting; not 
defaultMembers
default, not the 
defaultClerks
default, not the legal advisers. Overall, it would be better. You would still have the incentive. You would still have a bit more capacity in terms of what influence can be exercised, but you would not necessarily lead into the legal d
defaultifficulties
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ10 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default I want to follow up on your answer on people wanting to carry on, if they have been on a Bill, to be on the Statutory Instrument Committees. They are allowed to turn up and speak. Do they not feel that is sufficient, or do they not know that they are allowed to do that? They are also allowed to
default go
default on the European Scrutiny Committees, and I think there is some confusion. I am glad Mr Hemming has just come back in because he will give an example of an MP who had no right to vote at an SI Committee, but turned up, spoke, and the statutory instrument was withdrawn by the Minister. This is obviously very rare, but how important do you think that right is?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: I think it is very important. You are right, Mr Rees-Mogg
default: 
defaultt
defaulthere is an issue in terms of understanding of the process by parliamentarians. Hopefully the research that we have been doing will lift the lid on that process, and it is important. In 
defaultthe case 
defaultMr Hemming’s 
defaultrefers to, I think 
defaultthere was a drafting issue
default,
default or there was an issue that 
defaulta 
defaultconstituent had brought up to 
defaultthe MP
default, and by being at the Committee he raised the issue almost informally
default, but it
default sparked interest in the Minister and they could then revoke it and start again and improve the process.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ11 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Hemming:default It was about
default fjords and rivers, 
defaultand when you were in the sea and when you were not in the sea. Basically, he demonstrated how, as it was worded, it would not work.
default 
defaultSorry, have you finished?
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Yes
default, I have
default.
defaultJohn Hemming:default I can come in on that, because it does raise
default an 
defaultinteresting question
default? 
defaultI have just been at the Joint Committee and the 
defaultSelect Committee on Statutory Instruments
default, 
defaultwhich looks at the v
defaultir
defaultes
default. A
defaultlthough it was very short,
default there
default is an important function there
default,
default because it is an opportunity for 
defaultOfficers 
defaultof the House
default—
defaultthe legal advisers there
default—
defaultto look at the v
defaulti
defaultres and whether the instruments are correct, and
default the Committee has the 
defaultauthority 
defaultto 
defaultbounce them back to Whitehall
default; that 
defaultis what its function is. The question then is the function of the individual Delegated Legislation Committees or debates on the 
defaultF
defaultloor of the House. We have 
defaulta 
defaultgood example of that particular 
defaultquestion in
default 
defaultthe 
defaultrenewable fuel obligation.
defaultDo you know of other instances where defective SIs have come into force without 
defaultthat 
defaultbeing picked up
default—where 
defaultthe SIs themselves are defective? You can argue about to what extent you upgrade benefits, and you can have a political argument about that, but some are defective in practice. Do you know of any examples?
defaultDr Foxdefault: Defective in drafting, you mean?
defaultJohn defaultHemmingdefault:default Yes, defective drafting. The scrutiny process has allowed something through that was inherently defective. Do you know any examples of it?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: There is an order. I forget the name of the order now, but I can find out for you. I think there is an order that has been amended four times. It has gone out into the field and failed. They have tried to redraft it. It has gone out again, failed, and that has happened three or four times. It does happen.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ12 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Hemming:default That is the important area of it. To me, what is key about the process is for people outside the House to be able to contact their Member of Parliament and feed their concerns about delegated legislation into the process. What I have noticed is people noticing it more and starting to lobby members of Delegated Legislation Committees
default.
default I sit on
default a lot of them
default. I have noticed people engaging more with the process, which in itself is important.
defaultDr Foxdefault: I think that raises a broader question that we are also touching on, linked to parliamentarians’ and the public’s
default level of interest
default. 
defaultB
defaulty and large, 
defaultthe public 
defaultwould struggle to understand the process and even to locate the information and the documentation and so on. It is a minefield. Joel knows it far better than me because he has to do this for six Bills and all the various orders and so on. For an ordinary, interested constituent who has a particular concern, to be able to follow and understand what is happening is nigh-on impossible.
defaultI
defaultn terms of our interviews with parliamentarians, to be very honest, 
defaultit 
defaulthas been quite difficult because we have found that parliamentarians do not necessarily understand some elements of the system
default. When we
default go back through Hansard
default—
defaulttalking about Bills with 142 Henry VIII powers in it, when there were five, and other things there
default—we are finding t
defaulthe sheer complexity of it now means that the ability to access and understand it, no matter where you stand in the process, is incredibly difficult. 
defaultU
defaultpstream in 
defaultWhitehall
default, 
defaultyou are dealing 
defaultwith people who
default, in their career, 
defaultwill have 
defaultperhaps only 
defaultever drafted one Bill or one public body order or one legislative reform order, and that is it. There is a constant lack of knowledge and experience in the system at the 
defaultWhitehall
default end
default.
default I think 
defaultthat 
defaultalso contributes to some of the problems in terms of things like drafting, precedence, which procedure should be allocated to which power, and whether or not things should be on the face of the Bill.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ13 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default The Procedure Committee has twice recommended a sifting committee, in 1996 and 2000. This was met with deafening silence by the Government. One was a Conservative Government and one was a Labour Government
default. Both 
defaulthad one thing in common
default: 
defaultThey did not respond to the Select Committee report recommendations. Do you think 
defaultthat 
defaultthere are flaws with our previous proposals for a sifting committee? If you think a sifting committee would work, why do you think 
defaultthe 
defaultGovernment finds the idea so unpalatable?
defaultDr Foxdefault: We go back to our earlier point. 
defaultThe issue with a sifting committee will be
default:
default is it putting a sticking plaster on the problem? 
defaultThis is why I would encourage a wider look, because I think repeating the same reforms will probably get the same result
default. T
defaulthis issue is now much bigger because of the complexities of 
defaultthe 
defaultscrutiny procedures
default and
default the variations because of the number of Henry VIIIs and so on
default. So a
default bigger look, exploding some of the big problems going back to first principles
default,
default might have more effect. I do not suggest that the Government is going to respond and do things in the next few years. Our experience of parliamentary reform is you are looking at a 10-year period before sometimes you get the reforms that you want, but it is about building the argument. The 
defaultproblem of going back to some of these—not small-bore reforms, but in the grand scheme of things perhaps they are—is that you are going to get exactly the same answers
default. If you come away with the same answer, you are going to get the same response, and I think the debate needs to be broadened and widened.
defaultThe issues with sifting are
default:

default;
default 
defaultthe issue of whether 
defaultthe horse has bolted
default and it is 
defaulttoo late
default; t
defaulthe degree to which the Committee would be very, very reliant on 
defaultClerks 
defaultand outside experts
default; 
defaultand whether

defaultreally doing it
default.
default Our experience in the Lords is that you are very dependent on a very good Chair. That is absolutely crucial to make the Committee effective. There may be other ways of doing sifting. There are a number of expert bodies that are distributed through the delegated legislation process
default. There is the issue of 
defaultwhether there are ways to link those to a sifting committee as well
default, 
defaultpossibly
default, 
defaultor 
defaultto have 
defaultreporting in in a different way to this House on the controversial things.

defaultQ14 default&#xa0; 
defaultJohn Hemming:default I wonder whether there is merit in having a more transparent system whereby, if people look on the website, it is more obvious which statutory instruments are going t
defaulthrough. W
defaultith the Bills, the website is very good. It tells you what stage a Bill has got to. The concern I have is that people outside Parliament do not know what is going on
default. They 
defaultcannot then contact parliamentarians about it and take it on from there
default. W
defaulthereas, with the Bill process, everything works
default—
defaultnot brilliantly in 
defaultevery
default way
default,
default but there is a process.
defaultDr Foxdefault: Clarity, yes.
defaultJohn Hemming:default 
defaultWhere p
defaulteople know what is going on and can engage with it.
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: My concern 
defaultis that 
defaultif you introduce a sifting committee, the next step is fraught with difficulties
default,
default too. If you look at prayers in the House of Commons, they have rapidly declined to the point where not many 
defaultBack Benchers 
defaultsubmit a prayer because of the EDM process in particular. If you are going to have a sifting committee and you are raising the alarm and the attention of 
defaultMembers 
defaultof the House to something that is quite controversial
default, which
default should be debated and should be discussed, the existing procedures there are not fit for purpose in some 
defaultre
defaultspects. That is an issue.
defaultGoing back to the point about the Lords Merits Committee—or the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee as it is called now—it has re-energised the House of Lords and has done some very notable work. 
defaultIt can be very reliant on the Chair and the personality of the Chair in terms of sifting and getting the House energised
default. B
defaultut there is that issue there with the House of Lords
default, 
defaultits self-denying ordinance
default,
default and the fact that it does not normally, by convention, vote down SIs, which only really works if the House of Commons is performing a function as well. At the moment, when you look at prayers, sadly, I do not think the House of Commons—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ15 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Before I move to Jacob, you mentioned the procedures were not really up to scratch. Can you expand on that
default slight
defaultly?
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: If you take prayers, for example, the fact that you have to table an Early Day Motion is very difficult. I think it puts a lot of people off. Speaking to members of the Opposition as well, it is usually they who will lead the 
defaultopposition, 
defaultor 
defaultit will be 
defaultthe Shadow Leader of the House tabling a prayer motion. The lack of resource for those two to really research the SI that they want to pray against creates difficulties
default. T
defaulthat is one very small aspect of the delegated legislative scrutiny process that perhaps is not fit for purpose.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ16 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Before I come on to the European side of it, Dr Fox, you mentioned the sticking plaster, and I want to try to understand what you think we should be doing, because if changing the procedures to filter
default things, 
defaultor whatever
default,
default is a sticking plaster and you go back to first principles, what would we then be trying to do? Are we trying to change the whole system of legislation so that Henry VIII clauses are simply not possible or are heavily restricted? Are we trying to change the balance between primary and secondary legislation? These are outside the remit of this Committee, but in a way there is no point in us improving the procedure at the back end if the front end is completely hopeless. I want an idea of what you think ought to be done, or whether you think you can make this system work if you get the back end right, and whether quite wide powers of secondary legislation are necessary to prevent endless primary legislation of an enormously detailed nature.
defaultDr Foxdefault: I think our starting point is that secondary legislation is not going to go away, and the volume is probably not going to go away either
default. Q
defaultuite rightly, across the board and in particular departmental areas, you would not want it all on primary legislation. It would be impossible. Secondary legislation has a purpose and will continue.
defaultI confess I have no answer for the Committee today. We will probably have an answer for you in a couple of months’ time, but we are still working through some of this. The fundamental question has to be, what does this House want to see again? Can you define what it is that you want to look at? Are there particular criteria that you could do that by? Are there particular areas of legislation you want to keep a closer eye on, and are there particular areas where, in general, there are few problems and 
defaultyou
default are content for that to carry on? Are there areas where you would be content for other individuals or bodies with greater expertise in very technical, specific areas to do that, and to report to the House, which would narrow the number? An example we looked at is the Statutory Examiner of Instruments in the Northern Ireland Assembly, who is an Officer of the House who looks at these and, in a sense, performs something of a legal sifting mechanism and draws that to the attention of the Assembly.
defaultI confess
default that 
defaultwhere we are struggling is how you would define the criteria upstream in terms of the relationship with 
defaultWhitehall
default.
default I do not want to get into the detail of that today because, as I say, we are still working through it
default. Also
default, as I indicated to the 
defaultClerks 
defaultearlier, I do not want to say too much about our recommendations when we are still going through some of the detail, although we will certainly provide that to the Committee at a later stage. It is that fundamental question
default:
default what do you want to look at, and why? If you can narrow that down, then I think you utilise that as the basis for thinking about what the procedures should be, rather than just accepting that there is the volume coming forward, accepting that and trying to fit a procedure around that. 
defaultI think it is about trying to narrow down within that volume what it is you are most concerned about as parliamentarians and where you think
default—
defaultin terms of what the public would want, in terms of accountability, oversight and scrutiny
default—
defaultthat that lies in the array of delegated legislation that you are seeing.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ17 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default From a scrutiny point of view, it needs to be a parliamentary procedure, rather than, as it currently is, a very much Executive-directed procedure?
defaultDr Foxdefault: Yes.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ18 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default Thank you very much. I
default will
default 
defaultnow 
defaultmove on to 
defaultEurope
default. A
defaults I am sure you know, a huge number of statutory instruments come under the 1972 European Communities Act, and the Scrutiny Committee has recommended that all such SIs should automatically come under the affirmative process. Do you think that is a good idea?
defaultDr Foxdefault: This is an area that we have not looked at in terms of our research, so I could not say 
defaulty
defaultes or 
defaultn
defaulto from an informed perspective. 
defaultWe avoided broadly two areas in the research because of just adding in a whole new layer of complexity and expanding the remit. One was the European issue and the second was the devolution issue, so there are two areas where we would not want to comment, unless you want to add anything
default, Joel
default.
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: At the moment, they are automatically negative procedures. What we 
defaultwant
default to start a discussion about is mov
defaulting
default away from that gut feeling of the choice between the affirmative and the negative, and trying to think about what makes an affirmative, what is a negative, and working in that way rather than automatically setting an affirmative bar, which will not be necessary. As the 1996 Committee rightly pointed out, it leads to an awful lot of triple affirmatives, so you are stuck in a 
defaultCommittee 
defaultand the average time 
defaultyou need to be there 
defaultis 10 minutes, and that is the issue with setting an affirmative bar.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ19 default&#xa0; 
defaultJacob Rees-Mogg:default The other recommendation that the European Scrutiny Committee made—and you may not want to answer this either, for very good reasons; it is not a criticism—was that every statutory instrument that has a European legal base, even if it is not under the European Communities Act 1972, ought to say so, so that people know its origins. If you are willing to give a view, do you think that is sensible?
defaultDr Foxdefault: Our view generally on these is that the more information that is provided and the greater transparency about the origins and the decision-making, the better.
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: But there would have to be consistency. I think that is the problem with a lot of the paperwork that 
defaultac
defaultcompanies SIs at the moment
default: 
defaultthere is no
default consistency
default and it is a highly variable performance by 
defaultDepartments
default. 
defaultI think that the Merits Committee
default,
default when they looked at the management of S
defaultI
defaults
default in 2006
default-
default07,
default rightly raised a lot of concerns about that variability in the quality of paperwork.
default&#xa0;
defaultQ20 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Somewhere along the road you mentioned 
defaultsome form of 
defaultexpert scrutiny 
defaultto
default decid
defaulte
default what statutory instruments should go into 
defaultCommittee
default. What sort of experts were you envisaging?
defaultDr Foxdefault: You already have a range of bodies
default now
default. The Banking Bill created the Expert Liaison Panel that oversees the statutory instruments of the 
defaultspecial resolution regime 
defaultfor the 
defaulttripartite
default financial management of the Bank of England
default,
default Treasury and so on, so you already have that group of financial experts and lawyers who then report on their views on those particular instruments. 
defaultIn a different way, you have 
defaultthe Social Security Advisory Committee looking at DWP instruments. It reports to the Secretary of State, not to Parliament, but that 
defaultis the 
defaultkind of model 
defaultthat I am talking about, 
defaultwhere it is looking at a vast array
default. I
defaultt can deal with the volume
default. I
defaultt brings expert and technical knowledge, and it is able to sift some of the issues of defective drafting and likely problems in terms of implementation. As I said, 
defaultNorthern Ireland
default has—I cannot remember the exact title
default—e
defaultffectively, a parliamentary officer who is the—
default&#xa0;
defaultQ21 default&#xa0; 
defaultChair:default Who would sit there? Would it be parliamentarians sitting on these bodies?
defaultDr Foxdefault: It depends how many you would have. You would structure it. Generally speaking, these bodies tend to be external people. What happens at the moment is, by and large
default—
defaultcertainly in the 
defaultWestminster
default examples
default—they report 
defaultto Government 
defaultDepartments
default. I could foresee a situation in which you would have a number of these bodies in some of the particular areas that you were most concerned about that were reporting to Parliament. It is almost like an NAO model supporting the Public Accounts Committee. You might have a series of small expert bodies supporting a 
defaultCommittee 
defaultor a series of 
defaultCommittees 
defaultin particular areas, looking at the legislation. There is a problem of understanding in complexity. There is a problem about appetite among 
defaultMembers 
defaultto do this because of the complexity, and, bluntly, because of the time constraints. Therefore, is it possible in that process of trying to narrow down and get 
defaultMembers 
defaultfocused on the most controversial
default or 
defaultbiggest areas of concern, to utilise other things that are out there
default?
default Are there
default 
defaultpotential models to help Parliament
default and
default this House do the job in a different way
default, 
defaultand 
defaultt
defaulto think about it differently
default,
default rather than assuming that a 
defaultCommittee 
defaultmodel is necessarily always the right and best way
default? External 
defaultexpertise is already be
defaulting used.
defaultJoel Blackwelldefault: When you look at the original justifications for the use of delegated legislation, the last time it was looked at was in 1921, which is probably the only book that has ever been written exclusively on delegated legislation. It was the elaboration and the involvement of external expertise. We are seeing more and more statutory consultations added to orders, but again, the Secondary Legislati
defaulton
default Scrutiny Committee has spoken about the highly variable practice of consultation. They have raised issues particularly in relation to public body orders. I think there is a lot of merit in that involvement.
defaultChair:default 
defaultThe Committee are
default content
default. 
defaultCan I thank you both for giving us some of your time? Thank you for the conciseness of your answers. It is much appreciated, and no doubt we shall see you again at some stage in the future.
defaultDr Foxdefault: We will send you our reports, once they are done.
