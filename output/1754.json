"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Professor Emma Smith (WSC077)&#xa0;\n&#xa0;This \nsubmission\n \npresents a summary of recent research findings into \ngendered patterns of participation in post-compulsory \nSTEM \neducation\n in the UK\n. It examines the trajectory of learning which takes students from A-level qualifications, through undergraduate work and into \nearly \nemployment or further study. It also takes a \nlong term view \nto \nmonitor participation and attainment over an extended period of time.\n The findings suggest that almost three decades of initiatives to increase participation in STEM subjects have had little noticeable impact on the recruitment data and g\nendered patterns of participation persist in several subject areas. \nThis is despite more women entering HE and little gender difference in the entry qualifications for STEM subjects.\n \nWhile more women are studying science, as broadly conceived, than ever be\nfore; \nrecruitment to key areas, namely physics and engineering remains stagnant.\n \nHowever for those women who do remain in \nthe ‘science stream’, patterns of employment in graduate careers and further study appear relatively equitable\n for most of the main su\nbject groups, however concerns \nabout early employment trajectories\n among the engineering and computer sciences are still apparent.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nData is presented on\n \nlong term\n trends in \nthe \nparticipation\n of men and women\n in post-compulsory science\n \nprogrammes. The datasets used for this analysis are of the highest quality available and they represent many hundreds of thousands of individuals\n (see appendix for further information on the datasets used)\n. They enable us to take a long term view on how \nth\ne \nparticipation of male and female students in post-compulsory STEM subjects has been shaped by an expanding HE sector and allow us to evaluate the long term impact of policies and initiatives which have aimed to encourage more young women, in particular, \nto study the sciences. \nThe results presented here span three phases of post-compulsory STEM training: attainment at A-level, uptake of STEM subjects at undergraduate level and the \nearly\n career destinations of recent STEM graduates.\n They address the followi\nng research questions:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.1 Participation\n&#xa0;A consideration of long term trends in participation in \nA-level\n pure science courses (biology, chemistry and physics) suggests that not one of these subjects appears\n to be thriving. In physics there are now fewer male students studying the subject than in the 1960s, with numbers in decline since the early 1990s (Graph\n 1). The stability in the female participation figures comes despite initiatives (such as \nGIST and WISE)\n that focus on encouraging girls to study physics after the age of 16. While t\nhere is no evidence\n to suggest\n that female candidates are being turned awa\ny from \nstudying A-level physics\n in greater numbers\n \nthan previously,\n there is nothing to suggest that \nthese \ninitiatives have had a notably positive effect on recruitment either.\n&#xa0;\nGraph 1: Participation in A-level physics, male and female candidates 1961-2011Source: DES, DfES, DCSF, QCA, JCQ, AQA, Edexcel, IoP\n&#xa0;\nUntil relatively recently A-level chemistry was a male dominated subject (Graph 2). From the early 1990s there has been a gradual narrowing of th\ne participation gap\n. This has\n largely been due to a decline in the number of male candidates\n, although numbers are starting to increase. \nThe introduction of compulsory science \nin the late 1980s\n \nappears in itself to have \nhad no noticeable impact on A-level recruitment to chemistry, for\n either \nmen or women\n. \nAlthough w\ne have seen a steady feminisation of the\n subject to the extent to which, at present, \nparticipation in A-level \nc\nhemistry is \nlargely\n gender neutral.\n&#xa0;\nGraph 2: Participation in A-level chemistry, male and female candidates 1961-2011Source: DES, DfES, DCSF, QCA, JCQ, AQA, Edexcel, IoP\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nAttainment \n&#xa0;\nIn order to examine how \ngendered \npatterns of attainment \nhave\n varied over the history of the A-level we examined changes in the\n relative attainment of male and female students at A-level grade C or higher\n. What this historical \noverview\n shows is that the \ngender achievement gap \nin the pure sciences has hardly varied over the last five decades providing no evidence that male student\ns have ever outperformed females at this level\n.\n For example, in physics \nthere has been some shifting of the achievement gap in favour of female candidates\n s\nince the \nmid\n-\n1990s\n (Graph 3).\n \nHowever the \ngap is negligible and overall it can be said that attainme\nnt at the higher grade levels is gender neutral.\n The same is true for chemistry. U\nntil the late 1990s \nthere was no difference in the proportion of male and female candidates achieving a grade C or higher in A-level chemistry, m\nore recently the achievement \ngap has \nmoved to be slightly\n in favour of female candidates. \nAs with physics, t\nhis appears to coincide with \na \ndecline in the number of men entered for the subject\n, which may suggest that c\nhemistry is losing some of its higher attaining male entrants. However, the achievement gap between \nmen and women\n is still relatively small suggesting that \nattainment in c\nhemistry\n at \nthis level\n is gender neutral.\nA positive value indicates overall higher achievement among female candidates\n. Values of less than 4% are not considered to represent a noticeable gap\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1 \nThe expansion of the UK Higher Education system over the last twenty years or so is reflected in a quadrupling of the number of candidates offered places to study\n at undergraduate level\n. \nThis\n increase is particularly apparent among previously under-represented groups: i\nn 1986, 47,696 women accepted places on UCCA and PCAS-administered HND and \nfirst \ndegree programmes; b\ny 20\n12\n this had risen to\n over\n 2\n25\n,0\n00\n. The early 1990s saw the end of long e\nstablished trends of \nHE\n courses recruiting more male candidates. Now more female candidates \napply and are accepted, a rate of increase since 1994 which has been faster than that for men (Graph \n4\n).\n&#xa0;\nGraph 4: Male and female home acceptances to all first degree and HND programmes, 1986-20124.2 \nSince 1986, the \ndifferent \nSTEM \nsubject groups\n have tended to recruit a steady share of female candidates with rates only varying by around 1-2 percentage points. For example, in 1986 5% of \nall places accepted by female candidates were in the Physical Sciences, this has varied only slightly in the intervening years, although currently the trend is towards a slightly lower share \n(3%) \nof female candidates who are accepted to study this group of\n subjects. \nAlmost half of all places on STEM undergraduate courses are now taken by women, a proportion which, as Graph 5 shows, has steadily increased since 1986 and is in line with the increasing numbers of women studying at university. \nWhile this sugges\nts that a relatively large and stable proportion of women do wish to study science (as broadly conceived), \ngender stereotyped patterns of subject choice still persist\n - over 50% of candidates studying \nthe \nb\niological and \nmedical s\nciences \nare female\n,\n \nwhile \nthe proportion o\nf female students studying the engineering s\nciences has hardly varied over the period considered\n (Graph 5)\n.\n \n&#xa0;\nGraph 5: Proportion of candidates accepted to main STEM subject groups who are female, 1986-2011&#xa0;\n4.3 \nThe extent to which certain \nscience \nsubjects continue to divi\nde students according to their \nsex\n can be seen \nin Table 1\n below. \nWhile trends ha\nve varied for certain subjects\n, indeed higher proportions of women\n \nnow study\n c\nhemistry and \nm\nathematics, gender ster\neotyped patterns of participation \ndo still \npersist in subjects such as \np\nhysics, \ne\nngineering\n, computing \nand \np\nsychology.\n&#xa0;\nTable 1: Percentage of female candidates accepted to the largest-recruiting science subjects, selected years 1986-2011.&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1986\n1990\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2007\n2009\n2011\nMedicine\n46\n49\n52\n56\n61\n56\n55\n54\nPharmacy\n58\n61\n57\n60\n64\n59\n58\n59\nBiology\n51\n54\n56\n57\n61\n58\n56\n55\nPsychology\n72\n74\n74\n80\n80\n81\n80\n79\nSports Science\n-\n-\n-\n36\n34\n34\n31\n29\nChemistry\n31\n35\n35\n39\n42\n41\n40\n40\nPhysics\n17\n16\n16\n19\n19\n18\n20\n17\nMathematics\n32\n35\n37\n37\n39\n39\n40\n40\nComp.

T\nhe robust\nness of the\n \nparticipation\n figures for female p\nhysics and \ne\nngineering candid\nates is illustrated in Graph 6 below.\n Note also the gradual increase in the proportion of women who study mathematics.\n&#xa0;\nGraph 6: Variation in the number of female candidates accepted to study selected STEM subjects, 1986-2011&#xa0;\n5.1 General destinations\n&#xa0;\n5.1.1 \nTables 3a and 3b show the \nmain destinations of male and female graduates\n in the computer and engineering sciences\n. The\n majority of students enter some form of employment, with a \nrelatively \nsmall\n proportion \nentering further study\n. This trend differs from the physical, biological and mathematical sciences where higher proportions of students enter further study (around one third\n of physical science graduates, both male and female, u\nndertake further study\n,\n for example)\n. As the tables show, there is some fluctuation in the trends over the period considered but the proportions of m\nen and women at each stage tend\n to be reasonably similar.  \n \n&#xa0;\nTable 3a: First destinations of UK domiciled computer science graduates, selected years&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2008\n2010\n&#xa0;\nM\nF\nM\nF\nM\nF\nM\nF\nM\nF\nFull-time work\n78\n74\n82\n75\n66\n65\n61\n59\n68\n65\nFurther study \n8\n10\n6\n9\n16\n18\n18\n19\n15\n15\nUnemployed\n10\n11\n7\n10\n13\n10\n18\n16\n15\n15\nTotal (N)\n4620\n1266\n5382\n1409\n8590\n2480\n6450\n1220\n7095\n1440\n              \nTable 3b: First destinations of UK domiciled engineering science graduates, selected years&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2008\n2010\n&#xa0;\nM\nF\nM\nF\nM\nF\nM\nF\nM\nF\nFull-time work\n69\n71\n73\n75\n65\n66\n59\n61\n67\n70\nFurther study \n15\n15\n14\n15\n18\n21\n21\n22\n19\n18\nUnemployed\n11\n8\n7\n4\n11\n7\n14\n10\n11\n9\nTotal (N)\n11368\n2245\n9795\n1884\n8300\n1695\n8335\n1640\n10090\n1870\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.1.2 Graph 7 below, shows unemployment rates for male and female computer science students compared with all graduates. Note the relatively \nhigh unemployment rates for computer science graduates, although unemployment appears to be generally slightly lower among female graduates (although see following section for data on low skilled employment).\n&#xa0;&#xa0;5\n.2\n \nGraduates \nentering employment\n&#xa0;\n5.\n2\n.1 \nT\nable\ns\n \n4\n and 5\n \ncompare\n the \npercentage\n \nof male and female \nSTEM\n graduates who are employed in the largest recruiting \nscience-\nrelated \ncareers\n.\n \nThe figures in parenthesis \nare\n the Standard Occupational Class groupings\n which represent the official UK government’s classifications for employment. \n&#xa0;\n5.\n2\n.2\n Well over half of engineering science students who enter employment remain in the field, indeed by far the largest recruiter of engineering graduates are the engineering \nprofessional occupations (civil engineers, production engineers and so on). However, this is an area where gender stereotypes patterns of participation persist and to some extent they remain when female engineers leave education and enter the workforce, es\npecially when the proportions who enter professional occupations is considered. Gende\nred recruitment patterns among m\nathematical s\ncience graduates are relatively slight\n with a\n large proportion of these graduates who enter employment work\ning\n in the \nbusiness\n and f\ninance \nsector\n. Having a computer science degree, \no\nn the other hand, appears to be more of an advantage for men, in terms of entry to graduate professions – note in particular that almost 30% of female computer science graduates are in relatively unsk\nilled jobs six months after graduation. This later trend is one that exists to a certain degree between men and women in each of the three subject areas considered here.\n&#xa0;\nTable 4: First destinations of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science graduates who enter employment (%), 2010/2011&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nEngineering Sci.\nMathematic\nal Sci.\nComputer Sci.\nOccupation\nMale \nFemale\nMale \nFemale\nMale \nFemale\nManagers &amp; Senior Officials (SOC1)775477Professional occupations (SOC2)573941415023Engineering professionals \n47\n31\n-\n-\n2\n-\nICT professionals \n6\n3\n9\n4\n44\n26\nTeaching professionals \n-\n-\n6\n10\n1\n4\nBusiness &amp; statistical profess \n2\n1\n23\n25\n1\n2\nAssociate Prof/Technical (SOC3)172529232121Science/Engi\nneering tech \n2\n2\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIT Service Delivery Occ. \n1\n0\n-\n-\n8\n7\nDesign Ass.

Note the difference in \nproportions\n for men and women engineers who enter professional occupations (SOC2) and those who work in sales and c\nustomer services jobs (SOC7) si\nx months after graduation.\n&#xa0;\nGraph 8: Employment patterns for engineering science graduates, selected occupational groups only5.2\n.4\n \nAs Table \n5\n shows, \nin the physical sciences, the majority of graduates who enter employment work in managerial, professional or technical fields (SOC1-3). Gender differences are relatively small in terms of occupational\n destinations for chemistry and physics graduates\n, who were generally more likely to be working in a field related to their degree subject. Occupations in the business and statistical professional group (namely accountancy and economist jobs) were particul\narly appealing to recent physics graduates, while relatively high proportions of chemists were employed as science professionals or technicians. There are some differences in the types of employment sought by physics graduates, namely teaching for women an\nd ICT roles for men, but otherwise the types of jobs taken by both groups is fairly similar. Among chemistry graduates a higher proportion of women take jobs as science professionals and or as teachers but otherwise, patterns again are relatively similar f\nor men and women. In contrast to several other subjects examined here, relatively small proportions of physics graduates, of either sex, undertake employment in routine occupations (SOC6-9). However, \nthere is a large difference in the proportions of physic\nal science graduates entering professional fields\n (33% and 23% for men and women respectively). In the biological sciences, the largest recruiter appears to be the associate professional/technical group with relatively few graduates entering professional o\nccupations within six months of graduation. With the exception of the relatively high proportion of male biological science graduates undertaking managerial type work (13%), gender differences in terms of occupational destination among this group appear li\nmited. \n&#xa0;\nTable 5: First destinations of Biological and Physical Science graduates who enter employment&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBiological Sci.\nBiology\nPhysical Science\nChemistry\nPhysics\nOccupation\nMale \nFemale\nMale \nFemale\nMale \nFemale\nMale \nFemale\nMale \nFemale\nManagers and Senior Officials (SOC1)13585765643Professional occupations (SOC2)12131619332339354947Science professionals \n2\n2\n4\n6\n9\n8\n14\n12\n4\n8\nEngineering professionals \n-\n-\n-\n-\n4\n2\n-\n-\n9\n8\nICT professionals \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n14\n5\nTeaching professionals \n4\n5\n4\n5\n4\n4\n5\n5\n6\n13\nResearch professionals\n2\n2\n5\n4\n4\n4\n10\n8\n-\n-\nBusiness &amp; statistical profs)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4\n2\n5\n4\n9\n8\nAssociate Prof/Technical (SOC3)31272527252828282321Science/Engineering technicians \n2\n3\n6\n9\n6\n7\n12\n10\n-\n-\nSocial Welfare ass. profs \n3\n6\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSports &amp; Fitness Occ\n.\n12\n4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nBusiness &amp; finance ass. profs\n3\n3\n4\n4\n6\n5\n6\n6\n11\n11\nSa\nles and related ass. profs \n4\n4\n3\n4\n4\n5\n-\n-\n-\n-\nConse\nrvation ass. professionals \n-\n-\n-\n-\n2\n3\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPublic \nService &amp; other ass profs. \n3\n3\n-\n-\n2\n3\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSUBTOTAL (SOC1-3)56454951655772697671&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Administrative and Secretarial (SOC4)61181161259613Skilled Trades occupations (SOC5)2-313-1-2-&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nPersonal service occupations (SOC6)1018712364413Sales and Customer Service (SOC7)161818171316111168Process, Plant, Machine Op.s (SOC8)1-211--1--Elementary occupations (SOC9)1081491098675SUBTOTAL (SOC6-9)37444139273123221416Total (N)\n6005\n9450\n775\n1135\n3385\n2640\n660\n582\n695\n190\nAll figures are % (except where noted) and non-bold figures \ncorrespond to the largest recruiting groups within the main SOC category\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n6.1 \nThis \nsubmission has presented findings from recent and on-going research projects that have tracked the\n gendered patterns of partic\ni\npation\n \nin STEM-related \npost-compulsory education\n in the UK\n. It has examined the trajectory of learning which takes students from A-level qualifications, through undergraduate work and into employment or further study. As well as looking at how levels of engagemen\nt between men and women var\ny at each stage\n, the research reported here has also taken a long term view and considered the best available evidence to monitor participation and attainment over\n an extended period of\n time.\n \n&#xa0;\n6.2 D\nespite \nmany years of \ninitiatives \nto encourage more women into STEM education and careers\n, \nwomen\n \nremain under-represented \nin\n many parts of\n the field \nand as the\n results presented here show\n, levels of unequal participation in key STEM subjects have varied little over the last twe\nnty five years. T\nh\nis is despite more\n women\n entering HE and little \ngender \ndifference in \nthe entry\n qualifications\n \nfor\n STEM subjects\n. So i\nf qualification is not a barrier\n to participation, then why ha\nve\n the \nincreased number of women studying in HE not\n been \nreflected in\n subjects such as physics and engineering?\n The answer according to much of the literature in this area \nappears to\n lie in the various socio-cultural barriers \nto \nSTEM \neducation\n \nwhich women experience. \nIndeed\n t\nhe data presented here \nshows\n that wom\nen are engaged with science and wish to study the subject at t\nhe\n highest levels. \nRather\n, the types of science \nsubjects\n they study, and p\nsychology is a notable example here, are not\n necessarily\n t\nhose\n which policy makers and employers \nconsider to be the ‘\nstr\nategic, important \nand\n vulnerable\n’ science\n \nsubject\ns.\n \nWomen are \nalso \nstudying \nmany \nscience \nsubject\ns in higher numbers tha\nn previously\n \nand\n yet recruitment to\n subjects such as\n physics and engineering remains stagnant.\n This may be a reflection of the critical mass \nmodel which suggests that female recruitment to these subjects is still too low to\n \nbe\n \nself-sustaining\n \nand generate future growth. However,\n \nit is \nimporta\nn\nt to remember that numbers of m\nale participants in \nphysi\ncs\n and engineering subjects\n are \nalso stable.\n \nIn addition,\n f\nor women who do\n remain in the ‘\nSTEM\n \npipeline\n’, patterns of employment in graduate careers and further study appear relatively equitable: over half of all chemistry and physics\n graduates (male and female) who enter employment remain in the field and similar proportions engage in further study.\n \nHowever there are some notable exceptions, especially among the engineering and computer sciences where \nin the later subject, relatively \nhigh proportions of graduates are unemployed or undertaking relatively low skilled jobs.\n&#xa0;6.3 \nIt is very difficult to provide policy recommendations that will easily remedy inequalities in the numbers of women who participate in physics\n,\n engineering\n and co\nmputer science\n in HE. Decades of well-funded and well-targeted initiatives have had limited impact and even mak\ning all young people study the sciences \nup to the age of 16 had little long term \neffect \non recruitment \nat the next educational level\ns\n. \nAs male an\nd female students achieve at similar levels in gateway qualification\ns\n, there is limited evidence that attainment is a barrier to participation and \nfor women who do study these shortage subjects evidence suggests that many are likely to remain in the field \nupon graduation. Whatever socio-cultural barriers \nare preventing the recent expansion of the HE system being reflected in female participation in physics and engineering, they \nappear to also apply to men\n, to some extent,\n and \nseem\n largely unaffected by gend\ner\n-\nrelated widening participation initiatives.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\nAppendices&#xa0;\nA1 Sources of dataA1.1 Post-compulsory schooling: data were obtained electronically and as hard copy from a number of government departments and other official organisations, including the Department for Children, Schools and Families (and its predecessors the Department fo\nr Education and Skills and Department for Education and Science), the former Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Joint Council for Qualification, the Institute of Physics and the \nAssessment and Qualifications Alliance\n.\n \nA1.2 Higher Education: D\nata\n retrieved from the Universities Central Admissions Service (UCAS) \nwere used to investigate patterns of participation in STEM first degree and Higher National Diploma programmes at UK universities. \nA1.3 Graduate destinations: Data on participation in furt\nher study and employment destinations were retrieved from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Analysis of the UCAS data shows that the majority of STEM graduates are UK-domiciled, full-time students, so the focus here was limited to this group. \nThe HESA first destination survey gathers information on the activities of graduates six months after they leave university. Response rates tend to be relatively high: for the Physical Sciences they are over 80%. It is recognised that this dataset only con\nsiders destinations six months after the student has left university and that career trajectories may be very different in the subsequent period. However, it tells us a great deal about the sorts of jobs that are available to science graduates.\n&#xa0;\nA2 Calculation of Achievement gaps&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAchievement gap = performance  -  entry\n  gap              gap\n&#xa0;\n                    \n&#xa0;\nGP = number of girls achieving that grade or better \nBP = number of boys achieving that grade or better\nGE = number of girls entered \n              \n              \nBE = number of boys entered\n&#xa0;A3 UCAS main subject group categories for science and science-related subjects:&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n See appendix for a description of the method used to measure relative achievement \n The organisation of UCAS STEM subject groups is provided in the Appendix\n"
