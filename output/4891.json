"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nSanjeev Appicharla\n (CYS0110)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe\n ai\nm of the S\nubm\nission is to inform the decision making process of the Chair and Members of Transport Select Committee by advancing support for the arguments presented \nand \ncorrecting an \nerror in \nthe \nprobabilistic argument \nin the earlier Written Evidence dated 08 Jan 2014.\n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDuring\n the last 10 years\n or so\n, he \nhas \nspecialised in \nthe activity of \nmodelling and analysis of safety critical system and accidents\n following \nthe\n generalising the\n \nhazard identification and analysis \nprocess \nand information decision making framework \ncontained in the IEC 61508, a generic safety standard, to conduct hazard identification and analysis using the \nengineering analytical fault \nManagement Oversight and Risk T\nree\n and Human factors Framework, Skills-Rules and Knowledge Framework\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nAuthor‘s expertise\n in system \nsafet\ny engineering research \nis evidenced by the publications of \nsix\n peer reviewed publications at the \nInstitute of Engineers and Technology ( IET) \nIntern\national System Safety Conf\nerences in 2006, 2010, 2011, \n2012\n and 2013\n. Author\n worked as a Command Controls Signalling Engineer \npromoting the idea of System Approach to Safety \nat RSSB from 2004 till 2010\n. \n \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nUsing the published data, the pattern of Poisson distribution is used to infer occurrences of fatalities and result of Excel sheet calculations \nare published in the following text. These figures can be verified by readers to be correct or wrong. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor does not envisage greater \nmathematical \neffort to be \napplied \ninto statistics \nawareness \nfor the purposes of risk management\n. This is\n because \nthe \npa\nttern of causality is evident from the hazard identification and analysis in the earlier paper b\ny the\n author. \nThe results of statistical analysis indicated that there are high chances of fatalities to recur if there is no intervention. Reason\n for  that non\n-repeating \n of pattern of accidents at Bow Roundabout can be attributed to learning of the hazardous nature of the Bow Roundabout by cyclists and motor vehicle drivers alike. When memories fade patterns re-appear. \n&#xa0;\nArgument that there is small size of dat\na\n \nis refuted \nby using\n Poisson distribution applies to rare events by an uninterested observer\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe behavioural pattern observed in the data (outlier) coinciding with financial crisis of 2008 is a project waiting further research. \n&#xa0;\ndata\n&#xa0;\nPoisson Distrib\nution\n20\n&#xa0;\n88.94%\n19\n&#xa0;\n83.91%\n8\n&#xa0;\n2.73%\n21\n&#xa0;\n92.68%\n19\n&#xa0;\n83.91%\n15\n&#xa0;\n50.69%\n15\n&#xa0;\n50.69%\n13\n&#xa0;\n30.83%\n10\n&#xa0;\n9.21%\n16\n&#xa0;\n60.56%\n1\n&#xa0;\n0.000279%\nExpected Mean\n15.6\n&#xa0;\nExpected Median\n15.5\n&#xa0;\nExpected Mode\n19\n&#xa0;\nVariance\n18.71111\n&#xa0;\nStd deviation\n4.325634\n&#xa0;\nConfidence\n Interval\n2.681007\n&#xa0;\nMaximum fatality\n18.28101\n&#xa0;\nMinimum fatality\n12.91899\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman, \nargues that people are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately; to situations that require statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking derives conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and ensembles. Unfortunately, System 1 do\nes not have capability for this mode of reasoning: System 2 can learn to think statically, but few people receive the training. He writes that psychology of causality was the basis of the decision to describe psychological processes by metaphors of agency,\n with little concern for consistency (pp77)\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \n&#xa0;\nAuthor argues that engineers do get trained in the use of statistics and probability, but they do not appreciate the errors they introduce into their reasoning when they confound intentional and physical causality.  Several examples of this nature emerge f\nrom the consideration of \nscientific \nliterature \nsince Rene Descartes time. Arthur Schopenhauer (1813) gives an example of heat, a property of matter, being the cause of rising quicksilver in a thermometer as an example of physical causality(pp155)\n \n(Schopenhaeur, 1813/2006)\n.   Arthur Schopenhauer (1813) refuted Rene Descartes’s \nontological argument for God by saying that the immensity of God is a logical reason, from which it follows, that God needs no cause; whereas Rene Descarte\ns confounds the two \ntogether and obviously has no clear consciousness of the difference between reason and cause\n. \nProperly speaking however, it is his intention which mars his insight\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe Descartes error of dualism between the world of objects (soulles\ns bodies) and world of mental subjects (bodies less souls) makes appearance in the writings of Daniel Kahneman drawing upon writings of Paul Bloom (pp77)\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \nPsychologist Paul Bloom\n writes on his website that t\nhe\nre is considerable evidence that adults are natural dualists--we see\n \nthe world as Descartes did, as containing physical things (or bodies) and social entities (or souls). I am interested in how this common-sense dualism emerges in development, and the impl\nications that it has for domains such as morality and religion.\n \n&#xa0;\nManagers and engineers, author speculates, without the background in design of systems, are prone to confound\n reasoning about\n intentional and physical \ncausation. This can be treated as a rep\nresentative bias which appears in reasoning over human error frequently in accident investigations (pp149)\n \n(Kahneman, 2011)\n. \nEvery policy decision on risk and safety involves assumptions about human nature, in particular about \nchoices that people may make and the consequences of choices for themselves and society. The Exhibition \nRoad \nhas become safer because there is less chance of interaction between pedestrians and motorised vehicles\n because British vehicles drivers use a para\nllel road after hundred million pound investment, but few exemplary organisations think otherwise\n. Managers and engineers who made decisions on planning and delivery of technological projects and associated activities rarely appear on the radar of the acc\nident investigator\n \ninvestigating a particular rare event in operations that \nhas \nled to fatalities.\n&#xa0;\nAuthor did not find evidence that Danish Roads afford any more safety to cyclists than British Roads \nfrom the limited information available \non the Web\n article\n.\n1\n&#xa0;\n More details can be located here: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution\n&#xa0;\n More details can be located here:\n \n \nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Fourfold_Root_of_the_Princ\niple_of_Sufficient_Reason\n More details can be located here:\n \nhttp://psychology.yale.edu/faculty/paul-bloom\n More details can be located here:\n \nhttp://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/Teaching-resources/Newsthink/Discussion-store/Shared-spaces\n&#xa0;\n More details can be located here:\n \n \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Denmark\n"
