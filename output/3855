defaultThe Clerk to the Committee's further letter dated 11 May 2010.
defaultMatters were left very unsatisfactorily in 2010 
defaultwith the suggestion that my clients somehow represented a threat to the operation of democracy in Sark.  Indeed this has affected the media's perception of events on Sark ever since.
defaultBy contrast, 
defaultmy clients regard themselves as v
defaultindicated by events since 2010 and hope that this will be reflected in your forthcoming report, which should itself take the opportunity to redress the balance of your one-sided report of 2010.
defaultA number of important points emerged from Lord McNally's recent evidence to your committee on 5 November
default:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients have noted the exchange you had with Lord McNally as follows:
default              
defaultSir Alan 
defaultBeith
default:
default… let's be clear what we are talking about:  Those who represent the majority view in the Chief Pleas … and the Barclay brothers and their management, their economic interests on the island who tend to express their dissatisfaction in extremely strident terms or to take court action which led to some of the democratic changes.
defaultLord McNally:
defaultI was almost tempted to bring two guides to you, one is the Sark scribe and the other is the Sark Newsletter.  In the Sark Scribe, Sark is a bucolic land of people, sheep racing and maypole dancing and having tea at the vicarage and the Sark Newsletter, Sark is a fascist 1930s state.
defaultLet me be clear, and I'll say again as I have said to the Barclay Brothers and their representative, I wish that they would cease publication of the Sark newsletter because I think it impedes getting the kind of empathetic relationships in Sark that would take the Island forward.
defaultLord McNally appeared to identify Sir David and Sir Frederick as publishers of the Newsletter.  This is incorrect.  Mr Delaney alone is the editor and publisher of the Newsletter.  He is 
defaultultimately
default responsible for its content, not Sir David and Sir Frederick.
defaultWhat is clear from Lord McNally's evidence is that nothing has come of the suggestion in the 2010 report that my clients were somehow responsible for Sark's ability to function properly as a democracy.  The problems identified by Lord McNally have nothing whatsoever to do with my clients.  The criticism is of what can be labelled 
default"
defaultthe Sark establishment
default"
default.  Those who would take Sark back to 
defaultfeudalism
default and obstruct reform, investment and 
defaultprogress
default generally, even at the expense of future generations.  That, my clients say, is the true scandal of Sark, 
defaultthe 
defaultcapacity 
defaultof its establishment 
defaultto damage itself in the stubborn defence of the
defaultindefensible and the spurning of assistance and opportunities 
defaultwhich 
defaultany right-minded community would leap at.
defaultOf course, 
defaultLord McNally's evidence
default takes as its premise that there is genuine democracy on Sark, but my clients say there is not
default, and this is a fundamental part of the problem on Sark and its lack of progress
default.
defaultIt is remarkable to have to report that
default even in the second decade of the 21
defaultst
default century and even under legislation made only as recently as 2008, the following remains the case on Sark:
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultMeanwhile the 
defaultSeigneur
default continues to enjoy an index-linked annuity exceeding £30,000 for 
defaultunspecified
default duties which will, as matters stand, be inherited by his son
default and future generations
default.
defaultIt is a mystery to my clients how the British Government can support the role of 
defaultSeigneur
default in Sark.  The idea of such a figurehead in the United Kingdom only has to be considered to be dismissed as absurd.  The 
defaultSeigneur
default has considerably greater powers 
defaultin relation to Sark 
defaultthan the Queen
default has in relation to the United Kingdom or any part of it
default.  He is very far from being a mere constitutional head of state acting on the advice of elected politicians.
defaultMy clients note though that it was the express intention of the MoJ to push forward reforms of the role of the 
defaultSeigneur
default at the time of the making of the 2008 Law.  It was a beginning of reform not an end.
defaultAfter what were, to any objective onlooker, very deliberate attempts to avoid reforming the 2008 legislation, the dual role of Seneschal and President of Chief Pleas was finally split in 
defaultearly 2013, only for Lt
default.
default Col
default.
default 
defaultReg
default 
defaultGuille
default to remain in office as the unopposed candidate for the post (which would otherwise have been filled on a vote of Chief Pleas members, not the electorate at large).  Lt
default.
default Col
default.
default 
defaultGuille
default has been in office since 2000 and was the appointee of the 
defaultSeigneur
default.  My clients have had cause to make repeated complaints to the Lt
default.
default Governor about the conduct of Lt
default.
default Col
default.
default 
defaultGuille
default, including defamatory statements and obvious partisanship when conducting Chief Pleas business.  Again it is clear to any objective observer that Lt
default.
default Col
default.
default 
defaultGuille
default is an obstacle to progress on Sark.
defaultBy contrast, i
defaultt should be as clear as 
defaultit 
defaultpossibly can be that it is my clients who have championed true democracy on Sark, only to be obstructed and 
defaultvilified
default by the Sark establishment and the vested interests it represents, something which is only now coming to light and being appreciated fully.  Sark is not governed well and that is the exclusive responsibility of those in positions of influence and power 
defaulton Sark, and again it is my clients' complaint that those in Chief Pleas not elected by Sark's electorate 
defaultretain
default considerable influence and power to obstruct progress, namely the 
defaultSeigneur
default and the President of Chief Pleas, along with other prominent individuals who openly oppose progress.
defaultSark has no clear leadership because of the 2008 legislation
default,
default which left the feudal establishment very largely intact
default and an incomplete democracy
default.
default  Sark has been left with two conflicting systems of government.
default  An ineffectual committee
default-
defaultbased system of government continued with chairmen who had no additional powers, not even the committee generally recognised to be the most important, the General Purposes and Advisory Committee.  Even the seating arrangements of Chief Pleas continued unchanged, notwithstanding the supposed introduction of democracy, with the 
defaultSeigneur
default sitting on a large wooden throne on an elevated dais, flanked by the President on a slightly smaller wooden throne.
default  There is no opposition or opposition party of any political persuasion and no separation of powers between Chief Pleas as a whole, Chief Pleas as a legislature, or as an executive given the confusion of all roles and the committees drawn from it.  Indeed the 2008 Law gets off to a bad start when it expressly provides at s.1 that "all legislative and executive functions which may be exercised within Sark are exercisable by the Chief Pleas ..".
default  Sark's elected politicians enforce the laws they make, which is  not a healthy system of government.
defaultThe 
defaultSeigneur
default even continues to own the Island of Sark itself and, therefore my clients say, 
defaultits
default very constitution.  It is open to him to surrender the fief and the Island to the Crown and he has threatened to do so in the past when matters have not gone his way.  At the same time land reform is long overdue with a system of land law which is medieval and entirely without justificat
defaultion, including the inability to sub-divide Sark tenements (the parcels of land into which Sark was divided by the settlers of 1565) or to mortgage Sark land.
default  The 
defaultSeigneur
default continues to own the foreshore and all of the "common parts" of Sark not expressly in private or other public ownership.
defaultTrue democracy and true democratic leadership on Sark has no chance of success while feudal institutions remain intact.  It is the ultimate cause of the inability to give Sark a clean bill of health.
defaultApart from 
defaultSark's continuing feudal state
default, my clients say that
default there is a further and considerable threat to functioning democracy through the ability of a single group of interests to dominate Chief Pleas entirely and then misuse the assembly by using its legislative powers as a weapon against my clients' interests.
defaultIt is a point which has been raised repeatedly before, but Sark is a single constituency.  All voters
default vote for all candidates
default (and the qualification period 
defaultfor the electoral role 
defaultwas very deliberately extended from 1 to 2 years in 2010, which is part of a pattern of the 
defaultestablishment tightening its control over Sark, a recent example has been to redefine what it is to be ordinarily resident on Sark to qualify as a local person as requiring residence for full
defaulty 
default273 days a year
default for 15 years).  This means that if a single interest group (here the Sark establishment, those opposing change) can organise sufficient votes to secure the last seat to be filled then you have what amounts to a single party state – which is what Sark effectively has and hence the obstruction even to "ideas", which Lord McNally so strikingly identified.
default  It also means that no individual resident can point to any single 
defaultConseiller
default and identify that person as "their" 
defaultConseiller
default.  All 
defaultConseillers
default nominally represent all residents, in reality they represent only themselves.  It is very rarely that a 
defaultConseiller
default says that he or she has been asked to take up an issue or a point of view on behalf of a resident.
defaultAs to the use of Chief Pleas as a weapon since 23 March 2010 my clients point to the following
default events in Chief Pleas (and please bear in mind that Chief Pleas only meets 4 times a year, plus the occasional extraordinary meeting)
default:
default14
defaultth
default April 2010:
default              
defaultChief Pleas passe
defaultd
default legislation, the only purpose of which is to hamper further the ability of my clients' cargo vessel, the 
defaultBrecqhou
default Warrior, to operate – no other vessel of any significance was affected.  At the same time the monopoly 
defaultposition
default of the Chief Pleas' owned shipping line was strengthened.  A challenge by way of judicial review was discontinued when in fact my clients managed to secure licenses from the Lt Governor to carry on operating as before, but the intention of Chief Pleas was clear;
default              
defaultChief Pleas also resolved to introduce legislation to control marquees and signs.  This again appeared to be a direct response to activities on behalf of my clients' interests;
default7
defaultth
default July 2010:
default              
defaultAt very short notice (an addendum to the agenda dated 25
defaultth
default June 2010) newly drafted legislation was introduced to give new powers to Chief Pleas to regulate the placing of moorings in Sark waters; this was in direct response to my clients
default'
default company on Sark (Sark Estate Management Limited) placing new visitor moorings in 
defaultDixcart
default Bay in the vicinity of their hotel, the 
defaultDixcart
default Bay Hotel.  This is a prime example of Chief Pleas attempting to obstruct and stifle investment/the economy;
default6
defaultth
default October 2010:
default              
defaultChief Pleas refused to adopt the civil remedies sections of the Protection from Harassment (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2005 (itself copied from English legislation which contains both criminal and civil remedies) again to 
defaultfrustrate
default attempts to secure greater protection in law for the manager of my clients' interests on Sark, Mr Delaney;
default              
defaultChief Pleas vote
defaultd
default to instruct the Guernsey Law Officers to draft legislation to regulate the production of alcohol in Sark and to allow it to tax alcohol production.  This was a clear 
defaultand direct 
defaultresponse (despite denials) to the planting of vineyards in Sark by my cl
defaultient's interests;
default18
defaultth
default January 2011:
default              
defaultThe Chief Pleas meeting was used as a platform (exploiting the protections against liability for defamation introduced by the 2008 Law) to publicise and attack confidential correspondence from my clients to the 
defaultSeigneur
default.  I
defaultn response my clients disclosed correspondence 
defaultpassing between them and the 
defaultSeigneur
default 
defaultoffering to buy the 
defaultSeigneur's
default feudal rights in order to give th
defaultose rights
default to Chief Pleas, which prompted another debate 
defaulton 4
defaultth
default May 2011 
defaultagain 
defaultattacking my clients;
default6
defaultth
default July 2011:
default              
defaultSark passe
defaultd
default the Housing (Control of Occupation) (Sark) Law 2011 which further stifles the possibility of developing Sark property by making any sub-division of "open" market dwellings automatically "local" market and thereby uneconomic as a proposition;
default              
defaultPlanning application fees 
defaultwe
defaultre increased with express calls from members to impose swingeing increases for commercial developments (
defaulti.e. 
defaultby my clients)
default;
default              
defaultAttempts were made to prompt Chief Pleas to introduce conservation areas, again in response to my clients' investment and the planting of vineyards (a later attempt was made expressly to prevent the planting of new vineyards but came to nothing);
default18
defaultth
default April 2012:
default              
defaultChief Pleas vote
defaultd
default to spend public funds
default engaging a consultant on night-time helicopter medical 
defaultevacuation
default rather than use the freely 
defaultoffered services of the 
defaultBrecqhou
default helicopter and the facilities already installed on Sark permitting night-time landings
default.  Emergency evacuation by sea from Sark takes not less than two hours whereas the 
defaultBrecqhou
default helicopter can transfer a casualty in 15 minutes.  Chief Pleas would rather waste public funds than liaise with my clients.  A similar situation arose where Chief Pleas replaced the Island's crane at a cost in excess of £200,000 rather than take up offers to transport a failed part for repair at a fraction of the cost;
default              
defaultThe Seneschal (and still President of Chief Pleas) made a highly charged and political speech (unlawfully under the 2008 legislation
default preventing him from speaking
default) saying:  "Our rights and privileges have been trampled underfoot by wealthy men who claim to bring democracy to Sark but don't go on the electoral role" and that they were "assisted in (their) assaults on Sark" by expensive law firms, 
defaultand 
defaultcomplain
defaulted
default that "We have not been properly protected by the UK from those attacks".  He complained that the role of Seneschal was to be "wiped out for no other purpose than revenge for rejecting their vision of Sark"
default;
defaultThis 
defaultwa
defaults again a prime example of the Sark establishment obstructing reform and progress, here the implementation of the Court of Appeal's ruling concerning the non-compliance of the Seneschal's role with the Convention.  At the same meeting the proposed legislation to regulate and tax alcohol (wine) production on Sark advanced further.  The Seneschal was
default later 
defaultreprimanded by the Lt Governor for his conduct but remains in office
default as President of Chief Pleas
default;
default3
defaultrd
default October 2012:
default              
defaultChief Pleas passe
defaultd
default the Regulation of Production of 
defaultAlcoholic
default Products (Sark) Law 2012.  The only business it affects is that of my clients.  The Alderney and Sark (Licensing of Vessels) (Sark) Law 2010 
defaultwa
defaults also implemented, again 
defaultthe
default only 
defaultvessel 
defaultit affect
defaults
default 
defaultin practice 
defaultis that of my clients;
default10
defaultth
default April 2013:
default              
defaultChief Pleas vote
defaultd
default to introduce new requirements for a license to import construction vehicles into Sark, again 
defaultperceived as a direct attack on my clients' interests;
default              
defaultChief Pleas vote
defaultd
default to impose charges for the assistance of the harbour master when embarking/disembarking more than 12 passengers whether or not such assistance 
defaultwa
defaults actually 
defaultrequested
default (there being no equivalent mandatory service in Guernsey or elsewhere that my clients are aware of).  
defaultT
defaulthis was in direct response Sark Estate Management's objections to charges for unwanted 
defaultharbour 
defaultservices.  Again the measure stifled Sark's economy by obstructing successful day trips between Sark and 
defaultBrecqhou
default;
default              
defaultChief Pleas voted to introduce legislation to protect wildlife in Sark which again seemed aimed at stifling my clients' investments and an attack on the vineyards, nothing has come of this to date;
default4
defaultth
default October 2013:
default              
defaultChief Pleas passes legislation which provides that one can only become Sark qualified for housing purposes (
defaultie
default the right to live in local market and therefore cheaper housing) if you have been ordinarily resident for 273 or more days a year for 15 years
default;
default              
defaultDetailed proposals for the taxation of alcohol production are put forward.  
defaultT
defaulthese 
defaultproposals 
defaultmean that my clients
default'
default business 
defaultwill be
default the only business
default on
default Sark to be taxed because there 
defaultare 
defaultno other business taxes; it also seems to be proposed to tax not only domestically consumed alcohol but also exported alcohol, which is contrary to all other known systems of 
defaultimposing duty 
defaultin related jurisdictions.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients say from the above that it is obvious to any objective observer that Chief Pleas has targeted them and their interests, and indeed this has been noticed by the Guernsey Press, the Island of Guernsey's newspaper
default,
default which is entirely independent of my clients.  
defaultI attach 
defaultan editorial
default published by the Guernsey Press 
defaultdated 7 November 2012 expressly taking Chief Pleas to 
defaulttask for "government by grudge".
default&#xa0;
defaultThe closest that Sark has had to a democratically elected leader was the last Chairman of the General Purposes and Advisory, Charles Maitland, who resigned after the April 2013 meeting where he made a speech 
defaultwhich included the following comments, as reported in the official minutes
default:
default&#xa0;
default"
default… 
defaulthe had likened Chief Pleas to a vessel which had been given a new crew with the arrival of democracy but unfortunately, nothing has been done to make sure that the ship is seaworthy; the steering remains doubtful and there is no sign of a functioning Captain. 
default…  If you look up Sark in the ‘phone book expecting to be directed to the Government, what do you find? 
default 
defaultThe 
defaultSeigneur
default, Seneschal, 
defaultGreffier
default, 
defaultPrévôt
default, Tax Assessor, but no mention of a government.  At the bottom of the list there is a Committee Office phone number. 
default 
defaultIt illustrates the work that has to be urgently undertaken. Sark does not have political leadership because none is provided for in the present set up.  …  Without help the present situation is just not sustainable. 
default 
defaultIt’s not surprising that there is no rush to fill the chairmanship of the GP&amp;A Committee when he retires at the end of this meeting. 
default 
defaultHe confessed that it is not only the work that has worn him out, but the refusal of many 
defaultConseillers
default to listen to the arguments for reform. 
default 
defaultThey have been spelt out by both Belinda Crowe and Colin 
defaultKniveton
default (at considerable financial cost) as well as this Committee over at least the last two to three years. But to get to this point has been an exhausting uphill struggle.
default 
default He can only assume that there are too many vested interests here that are being threatened, too many Committees that are content to meander onwards.
default 
default This may have been enough in the past but it is certainly not appropriate for dealing with 21st Century problems where a great deal more is expected of an administration, small though Sark may be. 
default 
defaultConseillers
default are surely elected to act in the best interests of the Island, which at times means being bold and taking potentially unpopular decisions."
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients ask you to reconsider very carefully what you wrote in 2010 in light of all of the above and where the true problem on Sark lies because they believe it lies with the feudal establishment and the failure to establish a true and functioning democracy on Sark.
default  
defaultSark has two conflicting systems of government, feudal and democratic, with the former 
defaultcontrolling
default the latter. 
defaultThe United Kingdom's responsibility for the good governance of Sark requires it to act.  My clients 
defaulturge you to recommend further reform of Sark's constitution with the express aim of removing all of its remaining feudal elements and the creation of a clear and democratically elected leadership, and, additionally, the implementation of thoroughgoing land reform, to include the status of Sark as a fief, which again cannot be right in the 21
defaultst
default century.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients understand that Sark may already have lodged evidence with you and would wish to see that evidence and to have an opportunity to respond.
defaultYours sincerely

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDear Sirs
default&#xa0;
defaultEmbargoed copy of the Justice Committee Crown Dependencies Report
default&#xa0;
defaultI am instructed on behalf of Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay.
default&#xa0;
default I write with reference to paragraphs 46 to 49 of the above report under the heading "Sark".
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients are very concerned to see that a number of allegations are made in your report without any right of reply being given to them.
default&#xa0;
default Your
default&#xa0;
defaultCommittee travelled to Sark
default&#xa0;
defaultand met in person with the Sark political authorities but afforded no opportunity to my clients to comment on what was being
default&#xa0;
defaultsaid against them, which is fundamentally
default&#xa0;
defaultunfair and a breach of natural justice.
default&#xa0;
default It is not sufficient that the Committee states that it has not tested the allegations and does not take sides if it nevertheless publishes the allegations.
default&#xa0;
default Indeed it gives credence to the allegations through the recommendation it makes that "... any threat to the ability of (democratic government) to operate fairly and robustly has the potential to raise good government issues which might require UK Government intervention".
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients ask you to note the following:
default&#xa0;
default1
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultThe events of December 2008 were not reported fairly at the time and are 
defaultmisdescribed
default by you in your report.
default&#xa0;
default The businesses were closed for a matter of days, not weeks.
default&#xa0;
default You should note also that the political authorities who complained that the businesses were closed had actively sought election on an anti-Barclay family/anti-Barclay investment platform in circumstances where, without that investment, all such businesses on Sark would have been closed throughout the winter in any event.
default&#xa0;
default The Barclay family's investment programme has in fact continued at
default&#xa0;
defaulta rate of millions of pounds per annum and has sustained Sark's economy throughout the recession.
default&#xa0;
default2
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default It is unfair to present Sir David and Sir Frederick as repeatedly threatening proceedings and Islanders capitulating because of a lack of resources.
default&#xa0;
default Sir David and Sir Frederick are entitled to protect their interests and reputation in the same way as anyone else.
default&#xa0;
default Where letters have been written there has been ample justification, nor have such complaints been pursued in the way that they could have been pursued if Sir David and Sir Frederick carried on in the way you imply.
default&#xa0;
default There have been no Court proceedings in Sark against individuals of the kind you refer to.
default&#xa0;
default3
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default What your report fails to note is the fact that, but for the considerable efforts of Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, there would be no democracy on Sark at all.
default&#xa0;
default When they first came to 
defaultBrecqhou
default in the 1990s Sark was still a feudal society with a feudal government.
default&#xa0;
default It is largely due to the Barclay family that:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe right of male primogeniture in the context of inheritance has been abolished;
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthe 
defaultSeigneur's
default feudal right to take 1/13th of the purchase price of all real property transactions by way of private taxation has been abolished; and
default&#xa0;
defaultc)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultthere is a nearly fully elected assembly in Sark rather than one
default&#xa0;
defaultdominated by unelected landowners.
default&#xa0;
default4
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Unfortunately there is still no fully elected assembly on Sark because the Reform (Sark) Law 2008 failed to reform the roles of the 
defaultSeigneur
default or the Seneschal, the 
defaultSeigneur
default being the feudal overlord of Sark and the Seneschal being both the speaker of the assembly and the island's principal judge.
default&#xa0;
default Both are unelected and unaccountable to the elected 
defaultConseillers
default.
default&#xa0;
default Both have considerable powers in the new assembly.
default&#xa0;
default The Seneschal is the 
defaultSeigneur's
default appointee for life (no retirement age is stated, he can only be removed voluntarily or by the Lieutenant-Governor for cause).
default&#xa0;
default The 
defaultSeigneur
default can both speak and move legislation.
default&#xa0;
default The Seneschal controls debate and runs the business of the assembly.
default&#xa0;
default5
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay brought Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court in London challenging the Ministry of Justice/Privy Council decision to recommend the 2008 Law for Royal Assent.
default&#xa0;
default The English Court of Appeal upheld their challenge to the role of the Seneschal as a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
default&#xa0;
default The challenge under Article 3 of the First Protocol (right to free elections) went to the Supreme Court and will now go to Strasbourg.
default&#xa0;
defaultFar from the Ministry of Justice having to keep a watchful or protective eye over the Sark political authorities/establishment it is Sir David and Sir Frederick who have repeatedly appealed to the Ministry over the years to do what they can to ensure that Sark in fact meets its international law obligations to have a system of government which complies with the European Convention on Human Rights.
default&#xa0;
default Your statement of general principle could not be further from the mark when it comes to the experience of my clients when dealing with Sark.
default&#xa0;
defaultEven now, and notwithstanding the UK government's acceptance of the English Court of Appeal decision as to the Article 6 breach
default&#xa0;
defaultof the dual role of the Seneschal, the Sark political authorities are failing to amend the 2008 Law to separate his roles.
default&#xa0;
default Sark is, in effect, failing to make reforms which the UK itself accepted as inevitable when the roles of the Lord Chancellor were separated.
default&#xa0;
defaultMeanwhile I have instructions to write to the Ministry of Justice again asking them to intervene to urge Sark not to make legislation which patently discriminates against Sir David and Sir Frederick by attempting to prevent them from using their own vessel to transport cargo to and from Sark and 
defaultBrecqhou
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultYour section on Sark fails to recognise that a small jurisdiction can itself become dominated by establishment interests, vested interests
default&#xa0;
defaultand other such cliques requiring
default&#xa0;
defaultthe Ministry of Justice to keep a watching brief.
default&#xa0;
default That is the case with Sark and I have files of correspondence with the Ministry to support my clients' position.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients ask that if your report is to be published in its present form that this communication is added to it by way of clarification and answer.
default&#xa0;

defaultCrown Dependencies, Eighth Report of Session 2009-10
default&#xa0;
defaultI am instructed on behalf of Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay and write further to my letter of 29th March, copy attached for your convenience.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients wish to record formally their concern and
default&#xa0;
defaultobjection to the fact that your Committee visited Sark, met with individuals who have exhibited bitter enmity against the Barclay family and then
default&#xa0;
defaultpublished their allegations
default&#xa0;
defaultin a Select Committee report to the House of Commons without first giving my clients the opportunity to respond.
default&#xa0;
default The mere fact that the Committee professed not to take sides or adjudicate on the allegations is neither here nor there.

default You have provided a very public and one-sided platform to Barclay family critics in Sark.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients have asked me to point out that until they began their very substantial investment programme on Sark, there was little or no employment 
defaulton Sark for 7 or 8 months of the year.
default&#xa0;
default The Barclay investment programme is worth in the region of 4.5 times the Island's annual public revenue/expenditure.
default&#xa0;
default It is intended to create a long term, sustainable economy for Sark based upon an integrated tourist industry.
default&#xa0;
default There is, however, a strong establishment clique which is bitterly opposed to any change on Sark at all, and any investment by the Barclay family in particular.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients
default&#xa0;
defaultask me to emphasise that they have no political role
default&#xa0;
defaulton Sark of any kind.
default&#xa0;
default They have no seats in Chief Pleas.
default&#xa0;
default However, they do insist upon transparency and accountability from the elected 
defaultConseillers
default and administrators and work hard to promote the kind of standards which you would accept unquestioningly in the functioning of the House of Commons.
default&#xa0;
defaultAgain I point out the irony that it is my clients who have consistently lobbied the Ministry of Justice to ensure Sark government reform as opposed to the Sark authorities lobbying the Ministry for protection or anything of the sort.
default&#xa0;
defaultIt is unfair to imply, as your statement of general principle does, that my clients have skewed the operation of democratic government.
default&#xa0;
default Quite the contrary is the case.
default&#xa0;
default Without my clients there would be no recognisable democracy on Sark at all.
default&#xa0;
default Again as noted already, the real risk in a small jurisdiction such as Sark is of internal cliques.
default&#xa0;
default I would draw to your attention the fact that there is no constituency system on Sark of any kind.
default&#xa0;
default All 
defaultConseillers
default are elected to represent the whole island; which in reality means that no single 
defaultConseiller
default identifiably represents any given
default&#xa0;
defaultsection of the populace.
default&#xa0;
default There is no sense at all of a 
defaultConseiller
default representing the interests of those whose views he does not share.
default&#xa0;
default My clients' very strong impression is that they are entirely without representation in Chief Pleas; a body which consistently works against their interests.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients do require an explanation for the coverage you have given of Sark and why they were given no opportunity to reply and how that omission can be rectified beyond the rather weak proposals put forward by the Clerk to the Committee.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours faithfully

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultDear Sir
defaultCrown Dependencies, Eighth Report Session 2009-10
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients have instructed me to write further to you on the subject of your report and the impression it gives that their activities have somehow threatened the ability of democratic government on Sark to operate fairly and robustly.
default&#xa0;
defaultThey
default&#xa0;
defaultsay that this is very far from the truth and have asked me to send to you the attached diagram which they believe summarises the true state of affairs on Sark.
default&#xa0;
default The reference to SEM at the side of the graph is "Sark Estate Management".
default&#xa0;
default This is the organisation which runs Barclay affairs on Sark.
default&#xa0;
defaultYou will see that my clients maintain that political power on Sark is in fact held by the unelected 
defaultSeigneur
default, the unelected Seneschal and the Chairman of the General Purposes Committee, Charles Maitland, himself not directly elected by the people of Sark to that position.
default&#xa0;
default My clients point out that they have no influence or control over any of these office holders.
default&#xa0;
default They further point out that they regard themselves as having no representation in Chief Pleas itself.
default&#xa0;
default There 
defaultis no constituency system and 
defaultBrecqhou
default has no separate representation.
default&#xa0;
default Indeed they
default&#xa0;
defaultsee themselves as having no political power in Sark at all and therefore find it extremely surprising that it should be suggested that they threaten democracy on that Island.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients believe that the true history of Sark politics and what passes for democracy over the last few years has been the domination of Sark by a clique which has the 
defaultSeigneur
default and the Seneschal at its centre.
default&#xa0;
default The reforms which took place in Sark have affected matters hardly at all.
default&#xa0;
default Indeed the 
defaultSeigneur
default continues to sit on a dais in Chief Pleas with his appointee for life, the Seneschal, at his side, controlling and conducting the business of Chief Pleas.
default&#xa0;
defaultBy way of illustration only I outline the nature of the Seneschal's office:
default&#xa0;
defaulta)
default              
defaultit is unelected, whether directly or indirectly;
default&#xa0;
defaultb)
default              
defaultthe holder is appointed by the unelected feudal overlord of Sark;
default&#xa0;
defaultc)
default              
defaultno retirement age is specified;
default&#xa0;
defaultd)
default              
defaultthe holder cannot be removed from office by Chief Pleas, only by the (again unelected) Lieutenant-Governor and then only "for good cause";
default&#xa0;
defaulte)
default              
defaultthe holder has considerable powers over Chief Pleas, as evidenced by the Reform Law and the Rules of Procedure.
default&#xa0;
default The Seneschal
default&#xa0;
defaultdraws up the Agenda and controls the order of business, which can have a significant effect on how business is in fact disposed of.
default&#xa0;
default He controls the debate, the order of speakers, the length of debate, when a vote is taken and
default&#xa0;
defaultwhether a named vote is allowed.
default&#xa0;
default He has a considerable discretion as to the application of the rules and whether there are
default&#xa0;
defaultin fact any rules for any given issue;
default&#xa0;
defaultf)
default              
defaultthe Seneschal operates in a parliament with
default&#xa0;
defaultno organised political parties,
default&#xa0;
defaultand no ministerial system; there is no true Chief Minister or opposition leader, all 
defaultConseillers
default are, in effect, at the Seneschal's beck and call, there is a sense in which he is the true Chief Minister as well as being
default&#xa0;
defaultSpeaker;
default&#xa0;
defaultg)
default              
defaulthe controls the calling of meetings, indeed his consent is required in some circumstances
default&#xa0;
defaultto call a meeting (for example when 
defaultConseillers
default request that an
default&#xa0;
defaultextraordinary
default&#xa0;
defaultmeeting take place);
default&#xa0;
defaulth)
default              
defaulthe is the returning officer for elections;
defaulti
default)
default              
defaulthe is the principal judge in both criminal and civil matters; he decides both issues of fact and law sitting alone and without any legal qualification;
default&#xa0;
defaultj)
default              
defaulthe is one of the three
default&#xa0;
defaulttrustees of Sark's publicly owned assets,
default&#xa0;
defaultthe other two being more junior officers of Chief Pleas;
default&#xa0;
defaultk)
default              
defaultthe present incumbent has a personal manner which is
default&#xa0;
defaultpowerful and domineering.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultAs a matter of law
default&#xa0;
defaultthe Seneschal
default&#xa0;
defaulthas no vote and is supposed to have no voice, but in practice he frequently speaks beyond the limits of his role of President and is politically active outside of Chief Pleas as evidenced
default&#xa0;
defaultby the memorandum he submitted to your Committee and comments he has made in the past, particularly after the December 2008 elections.
default&#xa0;
default His personal opposition to my clients is well known; 
default&#xa0;
defaultl)
default              
defaultthe Seneschal is, in many respects, the central focus of Sark politics.
default&#xa0;
default He works closely with the 
defaultSeigneur
default and the Committee Presidents.
default&#xa0;
default He works closely with the Guernsey authorities.
default&#xa0;
default All legislation passes through his hands.
default&#xa0;
default He reports to the Guernsey authorities after each Chief Pleas meeting; 
default&#xa0;
defaultIn summary,
default&#xa0;
defaultthe Seneschal is the 
defaultSeigneur's
default appointee and man.
default&#xa0;
default He controls Sark politics, Sark's justice system, Sark's electoral system, Sark's 
defaultconveyancing
default system, Sark's liquor licensing system and is the dominant trustee of the publicly owned assets.
default&#xa0;
default He is unelected by the people and unaccountable to them whilst having strongly held and very publicly known political views opposing
default&#xa0;
defaultmy clients.
default&#xa0;
defaultNotwithstanding the 
defaultunappealed
default judgment of the English Court of Appeal from as long ago as 2
defaultnd
default December 2008 that the Seneschal's role breaches Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Sark has still failed to introduce legislation (even in draft) to reform his office and separate his judicial and legislative roles.
default&#xa0;
default Indeed when the issue was considered by Chief Pleas on 14
defaultth
default April the matter was placed at item 20 of a 31 item agenda, by the Seneschal.
default&#xa0;
default This is another powerful indicator of the Sark's establishment's disregard for true
default&#xa0;
defaultdemocracy and an indication of where the real problem lies.
default&#xa0;
default As noted before, without the consistent pressure brought to bear by my clients, there would be no democracy on Sark, not even the seriously flawed version that exists today.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients maintain that your report gave
default&#xa0;
defaulta one-sided account reflecting
default&#xa0;
defaultexclusively the point of view of those who oppose them on Sark.
default&#xa0;
default You failed, inexplicably,
default&#xa0;
defaultto obtain the views or comments of my clients before publishing your report.
default&#xa0;
default That
default&#xa0;
defaultreport has since been relied upon on a number of occasions by their detractors as some kind of
defaultauthority or support for their viewpoint.
default&#xa0;
default Your report has also been misrepresented in the Guernsey Press,
default&#xa0;
defaultleading to correspondence
default&#xa0;
defaultand a printed apology.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy clients would wish to know what you intend to do to remedy the injustice they believe they have suffered at your Committee's hands.
default&#xa0;
defaultYours faithfully
