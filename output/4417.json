"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by RESULTS UK &#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNow is the moment to act on inclusion of disabled people – the negotiations towards a \npost-2015 development framework represent a unique opportunity to\n reverse the neglect of disability as a core development issue\n. \n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID’s welcome recent commitments should be the \nbeginning of positioning the UK to lead a revolution in disability-inclusive development\n, starting by \nembedding disability as a core part of DFID’s work.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nshould move in a \ncareful, phased approach towards disability-inclusive development as part of a wider strategic focus on equity and inclusion. These principles should be embedded throughout DFID’s \nstrategy, structures and processes, with \na \nstrategy \nchampioned at a senior level \nreflected by the inclusion of disability as a \ncore requirement of country plans, business cases and the \ndisaggregation of programme plans and results.\n DFID should move towards making disability-inclusion a \nrequirement of bilateral and multilateral funding.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEducation should be an early priority for DFID’s inclusive approach. The exclusion of di\nsabled ch\nildren \ndenies their human right to education and \nwill prevent the world reaching MDG 2. DFID is the leading donor to \neducation and should lead the way with a \nstrategic focus on equity and inclusive education that benefits all child\nren (not just disabled children). \nInclusive education is the right approach to strengthening education systems, improving teacher-training and delivering better quality education. This should be complemented by additional efforts to \nreach the most marginalised disabled children out of school.\n&#xa0;\n1.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn inclusive approach will only become reality \nif implemented on the ground by DFID’s Country Offices and in-country partners. \nT\nhe \nimplementation of central strategy and \nguidance can be\n challenging \nwith\nin\n DFID’s devolved structure. Embedding inclusion will require \nstrong\n accountability mechanisms, designated leads within country offices, \nthorough\n training for all country advisers, and \nsubstantive\n \nconsultation with Disabled People’s Organisations.\n&#xa0;\n1.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe UK has a crucial role in \nleading its global partners on inclusion. DFID’s \ndialogues\n with \ndeveloping country governments provide an \nopportunity to challenge \nattitudes toward disability and encourage an incl\nusive education approach. DFID\n should urge the \nGlobal Partnership for Education to champion education for disabled children and should work with the \nGlobal Partnership on Children with Disabilities, the UN Washington Group on Disability Statistics, UNICEF, the World Bank and UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics \nin \na global \neffort\n to improve \ndisability data.\n&#xa0;\n1.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe Prime Minister and DFID should continue to \nchampion a disability-inclusive post-2015 framework, parti\ncularly the “\nno one left behind” principle, the \ndisaggregation of indicators by disability, and the approach that \nno target should be considered met unless for all social groups, including disabled people. The UK is well-positioned to lead on \na \npost-2015 \n‘\nGlobal Partnership on Disability Data’.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRESULTS is an international grassroots advocacy organization working to generate the public and political will to end hunger and extreme poverty. RESULTS supports a network of volunteer\ns\n across the UK and in five other countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico and USA). RESULTS works in \npartnership with decision-makers, experts and civil society to take effective action and to speak out in favour of anti-poverty measures that really wor\nk. RESULTS UK is a \nsteering group \nmember of the Global Campaign for Education \n(GCE) \nUK and the \nBOND Disability and Development Group\n. We\n \nprovide the secretariat to the \nAPPG on Global Education for All.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;3.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability has long been neglected as a “niche” area of development, deemed by many to be too complex or too small an issue to be core to development efforts. The MDGs fai\nled to mention disability\n, yet we now know that disabled people make up an \nestimated 15% of the global population, and that disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty. 80% of disabled people live in developing countries and the UN calls them “\nthe world’s largest minority”\n. Without including \ndisabled people\n, it is cl\near that \nmany of \nthe MDG targets will not be reached.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nUN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has \nled to\n \na step-change in \nthe \nrecognition of the right\ns\n of disabled people to be included in all aspects of their own development. The UNCRPD also places an obligation on signatories like the UK \nto ensure aid programmes include disabled people.\n&#xa0;\n3.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA major barrier to the recognition of disability as a core devel\nopment issue has been the \nappalling lack of data available. Information is often speculative and out of date. A lack of reliable and consistent data at national level feeds a lack of clarity internationally. This has ultimately \nleft disabled people invisible, left behind by development efforts. \nHowever,\n \nwith dramatic improvement\ns in data over recent years\n, there is now \nan unprecedented opportunity to bring the needs of disabled people into the light.\n&#xa0;\n3.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPost-2015 n\negotiations \nrepresent a unique opportunity to\n reverse the neglect of disabled people\n by ensuring that \nthe new framework explicitly includes disability as a core issue. \nDFID’s recent commitments should be \nthe first step towards the UK leading a revolution in disability-inclusive development, starting by embedding disability as a core part of DFID’s work.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;4.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRESULTS and our grassroots volunteers have long campaigned for disabled children to have a\nccess to quality education. It is estimated that there are 93 million disabled children globally\n, and in most \ncountries, they are \nmore likely to be out of school than any other group of children. \nIn Nepal\n, it is estimated that 85% of all children out of s\nc\nhool are disabled. In Ethiopia\n, fewer than 3% of disabled children have access to primary education\n. In some countries \nbeing disabled more than doubles the chance of never enrolling in school. Disabled children are also less likely to remain in school \nand transition to the next grade\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe exclusion of disabled children not only denies their \nhuman\n right to education, but makes it impossible for the world to reach the MDG of universal primary education by 2015. \n57 million children of primary age are still out of school around the world and progress all but stalled\n. \nIt is estimated that \ndisabled children may make up over a third of the out-of-school population. \n \n&#xa0;4.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLack of understanding, negative attitudes and discrimination towards \ndisability\n are major\n challenges, \noften\n leading parents \nin low-\nincome countries \nto \nhide away their disabled children and leading governments and education decision-makers to segregate disabled children into\n “special” schools – often inappropriately – which tend\ns\n to compound the exclusion from the mainstream and perpetuate the myth that disabled people should be “helped” and not empowered to lead their own productive lives\n. \n&#xa0;\n4.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDisability is also \ninextricably linked to other factors which exacerbate exclusion and inequality. For instance, \nethnic minority \ngirls\n living with disabilities experience triple exclusion. A recent GCE UK report noted that of all the excluding factor\ns, disability has the strongest correlation with poor educational outcomes\n.\n \n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n5.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe recent commitments made by DFID\n are \nimportant and welcome progress, and as part of \nthe Global Campaign for Education (\nGCE\n)\n UK\n,\n RESULTS has sought to support DFID in this process\n. The announcement that \nall future schools built with direct UK support will be built accessibly is \nan important \nstatement \nto \nDFID’s\n developing country \nand donor \npartners. DFID’s\n commitment to work with global partners to \nimprove the data and evidence on disability goes to the heart of the \ncurrent invisibility of disabled people. DFID should now \nbuild on these steps to embed disability-inclusion within its work and position itself to champion disability-inclusive development with its partners and \nwith\nin the post-2015 dialogue.\n&#xa0;\n5.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn\n 2010\n, \nRESULTS UK published\n \na \nreport which \nraised\n serious concerns about implementation\n,\n since then, progress has been made\n. At the time, DFID had been \namong\n the first donors to recognise the importance of a \n“twin-track” approach which sees the “mainstreaming” o\nr inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of their development work (\neg.\n ensuring education support disabled \nchildren\n), coupled with additional inputs and resources which recognise the extreme marginalisation of disabled people and go further in suppor\nting them.\n DFID has since put in place \nuseful \nguidance \nfor its Country Offices\n. \n&#xa0;\n5.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nHowever, despite \nsome examples of good practice, \nDFID still\n \nhas no formal framework for the systematic inclusion of disabled people throughout its programmes, and \nno formal checks are in place to ensure that \nDFID’s work results in \nimproved \ndevelopment outcomes for disabled people.\n As part of GCE\n UK, RESULTS UK has raised concern\ns\n that \nimplementation remains a real problem. For instance, in a survey of six Country Offices in 2\n012, GCE UK found that \nonly half of the offices were \naware of the \nexisting \nguidanc\ne\n, and \nonly one was implementing it. I\nn a \nlater \nreport, GCE UK noted that there \nwere\n \nonly two mentions of the word “disability” across 14 DFID Country Operational Plans. There is substantial risk that the current momentum will be lost unless \nthere is \nrobust implementation to embed disability-inclusion within DFID’s work.\n&#xa0;\n5.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID should move in a \ncareful, phased approach towards disability-inclusive development as part of a wider strategic focus on equity and inclusion that could be similar to its ‘\nStrategic Vision for Girls and Women\n’\n. These principles should be embedded throughout DFID’s \nstrategies, structures and processes, with a high level \nprioritisation\n \nreflected by the inclusion of disability as a \ncore requirement of country plans, business cases and the disaggregation of programme plans and results to demonstrate \nhow\n DFID’s work is supporting disabled people. DFID should move towards making disability-i\nnclusion \na requirement of bilateral and multilateral funding agreements, starting with the next cycle of aid reviews.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThis strategic focus should be \nchampioned at a senior level. The work of Judith Heumann, Special Advisor for International Disability Ri\nghts at the US State Department\n, could provide a useful reference point. Ms Heumann told the APPGs on Disability and Global Education for All in 2012\n that\n she works closely with USAID to embed disability within their work, with focus on their funding deci\nsions, internal processes and training for staff\n. The AusAid strategy ‘\nTowards a disability-inclusive Australian aid programme\n’\n could also be a helpful \nmodel\n.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n6.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nEducation should be an early priority for DFID’s inclusive approach, building on the recent commitment on accessible school construction\n. \nThe UK is the \nlargest bilateral donor to basic education and \nso has an \nopportunity to lead and influence oth\ner donors and developing countries\n. \n&#xa0;\n6.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nshould le\nad the way with \na strategic focus on equity and inclusive education that benefits all children, particularly the most marginalised\n (not just disabled children). \nAs a recent \nGCE\n report emphasises\n, the UNCRPD established inclusive education as the key mechanism to deliver the right to education for disabled children. \nInclusive education systems can be defined as all children learning together in mainstream classrooms, irrespective of the different \nranges of abilities and disabilities, with teaching methods, materials and school environments that address the needs of all \nchildren\n, and additional, individually tailored support as needed\n. \nThey can be a powerful tool in addressing inequalities, tackling\n discrimination and changing societal attitudes towards embracing \ndiversity\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUNICEF notes that inclusive education \nis\n by no means \na luxury\n available only to the privileged. Rather, examples of inclusion in education can be found in all regions, and challe\nnge the notion that such an \napproach cannot be taken in low resource contexts\n. \nThe GCE report \nargues\n that \ninclusive education is the right approach to strengthening education systems, improving teacher-training and delivering better quality education for all. \n&#xa0;\n6.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nInclusive education is a good investment, enabling developing count\nry governments to spend limited \nbudgets on a system which benefits all children rather than inefficiently channelled towards a few children in segregated schools (which again reinforces the perception that disability is a cost to the state). \nDirectly relevant to DFID’s recent commitment \non accessible school construction, UNICEF \nhighlights\n that the \ncosts of integrating accessibility into new buildings can be negligible (less than 1% of the total cost) compared to the higher cost of \nadapting\n completed buildings\n.\n Ultimately, supporting the \neducation of disabled children will \nyield \na substantial economic benefit \nto \nthe developing countries where DFID works\n.\n&#xa0;\n6.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID is a \nleader in supporting \nteacher-training, which is fundamental to meeting MDG 2 and improving \neducational \nquality\n. \nDFID should match its commitment on accessible school construction with this equally crucial aspect of inclusion, committing that \nDFID will integrate disability and inclusive education throughout the teacher-training it supports.\n&#xa0;\n6.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn line with a “twin trac\nk” approach, DFID should \nalso \nput in place additional projects and resources to support disabled children. DFID already takes this approach with \ngender\n through its ‘Girls Education Challenge’ fund\n. \nSimilarly,\n DFID \ncould have a dedicated fund to \nsupport projects to reach out-of-school disabled children; tackle discrimination about disability; and support children with complex needs in community settings. DFID should take a \ncross-sector approach, linking to \nearly childhood, \nnutrition, health and humanitarian\n programmes and ensuring that these too are inclusive. \n&#xa0;\n6.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAn inclusive approach will only become reality if implemented on the ground. \nRESULTS UK’s experience\n suggests that implementation of central strategy and guidance is challenging given DFID’s devolved structure. Embedding inclusion will require \nstrong accountability mechanisms. \nRESULTS UK recommends that \ndesignated leads \nshould\n \nbe identified in DFID’s Cou\nntry Offices to be responsible and accountable for ensuring \nthat \nthe needs of disabled peop\nle are included in DFID’s work. \nThorough training on inclusion should be made mandatory for all Country Advisers.\n As part of GCE UK, RESULTS UK has welcomed discussi\nons with DFID about incorporating disability into ‘continuous professional development’ for Country Advisers, and we urge DFID to proceed with integrating disability and inclusive approaches \ninto\n future training.\n Finally, DFID’\ns Country O\nffices should be r\nequired to engage in \nsubstantive, regular consultation with Disabled People’s Organisations to ensure the participation of disabled people in the planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;7.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID’s dialogues with developing country governments provide \nopportunities\n to challenge \nunhelpful \nattitudes toward disability and encourage an inclusive approach\n at national level\n. \nDFID should seek to \nbuild the capacity of national governments to put in place appropriate legislative frameworks and deliver these through ambitious national plans for inclusion \nsupported by improved \ndata on disabled people. \n&#xa0;\n7.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn education,\n one systemic barrier is the problem of \ndivided ministerial responsibility within developing country governments, where education for disabled children is the responsibility of a different ministry than that responsible for the education of non-disabled children\n. This division reflects \nand reinforces \nthe view that the disabled n\need welfare rather than \nequal access to\n education\n,\n and \nit \noften leads to \na \nsegregated \neducation system with disabled children separated into “special schools”\n. \nDFID should call on national governments to invest in inclusive systems, with responsibility for\n the education of \nall\n children\n \nclearly within the remit of the Ministry for Education.\n&#xa0;\n7.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nshould \nuse its role on the Board of \nthe \nGlobal Partnership for Education (GPE) to \nurge the GPE to champion inclusive education for disabled children.\n The GPE is the only multilateral partnership devoted to getting all children into\n school for a quality education\n. The \nGPE\n’s unique partnership model, which \ncoordinates\n donors, civil society and private sector investments in support of nationally-led educa\ntion plan\ns\n, provides an important vehicle for DFID to give global reach to its disability commitments. The GPE \nhas already committed to supporting disabled children \nwithin\n its new strategic plan\n.\n \nIn June 2014, the GPE will hold a replenishment campaign to re-galvanise the education community with pledges to its fund and commitments to increase domestic financing and bilateral aid to education. \nDFID should use this important moment to call for a global effort to improve support for disabled children’s education.\n&#xa0;\n7.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDFID \nshould \nplay a leading role\n \nin improving\n \ndata on disability at a global and national level. Progress is already being made through the \nGlobal Partnership on Children with Disabilities, and work by the \nUN Washington Group on Disability Statistics. \nUNICEF, the \nWorld Bank and \nUNESCO’s Institute for Statistics all have expertise which should \nform part of\n a more coordinated effort. Donors like DFID should seek to turn global knowledge-sharing into national action by \nsupporting capacity-building within national governments and statistical agencies in developing countries.\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\n8.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nPost-2015 \nnegotiations represent a \nonce in a lifetime opportunity to reverse the neglect of disabled people. \nThe Prime Mini\nster \nhas already played an important role as a co-chair of the UN High Level Panel \n(HLP) \nand has been champion\ning\n disability-inclusion and the principle of “no one left behind”. The \nUN High Level Meeting on Disability and Development in September was the highest level gathering of decision-makers on this issue for many years, and DFID Minister Lynne Featherstone MP’s intervention at this event was widely praised\n.\n&#xa0;\n8.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWe urge DFID to \ncontinue championing these issues throughout the tough inter-governmental negotiations that lay ahead. We cannot be complacent – with so many priorities on the table, there is a great risk that concepts like ‘disaggregation by disability’ \nwill be lost. We all have a collective responsibility to ensure that do\nes not happen. DFID should fight for \nthe “\nno one left behind” principle\n, the\n disaggregation of indicators by disability to measure progress, and the approach that\n no target should be considered met unless for all social groups, including disabled people. \n&#xa0;\n8.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe \nHLP\n called for a \n“\ndata revolution” \nfor post-2015\n, and \nnowhere is this more needed than with disability. The MDGs have resulted in dramatic strides in development data, but disability has been left behind. \nW\ne urge the UK Government to \nlead\n a “\nGlobal Partnership on Disability Data” that would bring the needs of disabled people into the light and demand the urgent action \nneeded \nto achieve\n the UN Secretary-General’s vision of\n “\na life of dignity for all\n”\n.\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n UN Enable (2013), ‘Factsheet on Persons with Disabilities’, \nhttp://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=18\n ‘UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Optional Protocol’, Article 32, \nhttp://www.un.org/disabil\nities/documents/convention/convoptprot-e.pdf\n Global Campaign for Education (2013), ‘Equal Right, Equal Opportunity: Inclusive Education for Children with Disabilities’, \nhttp://www.campaignforeducation.org/docs/reports/Equal%20Right,%20Equal%20Opportunity_WEB.pdf\n Global Campaign for Education (2013), ‘Equal Right, Equal Opportunity: Education and Disability’, \nhttp://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/campaigns/education-and-disability\n \nFilmer, Deon, ‘Disability, Poverty, and Schooling in Developing Countries: Results from 14 household surveys’, World Bank Ec\nonomic Review, vol. 22, no. 1. \n World Health Organization and The World Bank 2011, The World Report on Disability.
