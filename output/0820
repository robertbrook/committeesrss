Written evidence from defaultNappdefault defaultPharmaceutical defaultGroup default(LTC 70)default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefaultThe Napp Pharmaceutical Group is a UK group of companies that is part of a worldwide network of independently associated pharmaceutical companies. The Napp 
defaultPharmaceutical 
defaultGroup manufactures and supplies medicines to the UK healthcare market, and exports medicines to our independently associated companies worldwide. We have a long heritage in the field of pain management, and have been supporting healthcare professionals to understand and manage chronic pain for over 30 years. In addition to the significant impact on individuals’ quality of life, poorly managed chronic pain places a financial burden on the NHS and the wider economy, which is why we continue to work towards better understanding and treatment. Our commitment to pain management extends beyond the provision of innovative medicines to include research into the impact of chronic pain on patients’ lives and further education for healthcare professionals in the management of pain.

default 
defaultto
default ask the Secretary of State for Health whether it is his policy that chronic pain is a long-term condition that requires the preparation of care plans
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultChair Paul 
defaultBurstow
default MP responded
default:
defaultThe Department recognises chronic pain as a long-term condition, either in its own right or as a component of other long-term conditions. Everyone who suffers persistent pain should have a timely assessment in order to determine the cause of the pain—if a cause can be determined—and to advise on options for treatment, including self-help. Patients with refractory chronic pain will benefit from the care planning approach, but decisions should be taken on an individual basis depending on the severity of symptoms and any co-morbidities.

defaultOfficial Report
default, columns 147-150, what plans he has to introduce a quality standard for chronic pain management.
defaultNorman Lamb:
default The Department has asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to develop a quality standard on pain management for young people and adults as part of a library of approximately 180 NHS Quality Standards. NICE has not yet published a time scale for the development of this quality standard. NHS England is now responsible for the strategic direction of NHS quality standards.

defaultThere is also variance of pain status across the devolved nations e.g. Scotland recognising it as a specific condition in its own right with SIGN guidelines currently being developed.
defaultPain is also poorly recognised, diagnosed and under managed in vulnerable patients with conditions such as dementia. Improvements here would clearly demonstrate “compassionate care”.
