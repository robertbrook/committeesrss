"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from \nIan Williams\n (SRN 009)\n“\nThe LASER model shows that \nthe \nimpact on morning peak travel of loosening the\n \nland use policy guidance would be a rise in car passenger-km by 4% by 2016 in the\n \nSouth East and East of England, over and above the lev\nel under Current Policy. \n… This suggests that the rise in the car passenger-km would be between 3-4% over the Current Policy Scenario, which is equivalent to 15-20% of the total forecast growth in car passenger-km for the period 1997/98 to 2016.” (page 56,\n WSP\n &amp; Arup\n, 2005)\nWilliams I \n&amp; Y Jin\n (2013)  \nThe Impacts \no\nf Urban Densification \no\nn \nt\nhe Supply \na\nnd Demand \nf\nor Transport\n.  Presented to the European Transport Conference, ETC13 at \nGoethe University, Frankfurt\n, September, 2013.\nWSP \n &amp; Arup \n(2005)  \nImpacts of Land Use Planning Policy on Transport Demand and Congestion.  Final Report for\n \nDepartment for Transport Contract Number PPAD /151/1.  \nhtt\np://www.wspgroup.com/upload/documents/PDF/news%20attachments/PPG13_Final_Report.pdf\nOctober 2013\n1\n of \n5\n \nSee\n \nhttp://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/npp/national-population-projections/2008-based-projections/index.html\n"
