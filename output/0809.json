"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the British Specialist Nutrition Association (LTC 59)&#xa0;The following response has been submitted by the British Specialist Nutrition Association (BSNA) Ltd. \nThe \nBSNA is the trade association representing manufacturers of products designed to meet the nutritional needs of individuals at different life-stages or with specific health requirements. BSNA members include companies that\n manufacture gluten-free foods which are reimbursed on\n prescription for sufferers of coeliac disease.\n&#xa0;\nThe \nBSNA \nwelcomes the Health Select Committee’s inquiry into the management of long term conditions\n given their prevalence and significant impact on health service budgets in England\n. This response deals with the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease on the NHS\n. \nWe would welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues with you in more detail and answer any questions you may have. \n&#xa0;\nThe BSNA is \nthe \ntrade association representing manufacturers of products designed to meet the nutritional needs of individuals at different life-stages or with specific health requirements. BSNA members include companies that manufacture gluten-free foods available on prescription for sufferers of \ncoeliac\n disease including: Dr. \nSchär\n, \nJuvela\n and \nWarburtons\n. The BSNA wishes to work with the Department of Health (DH) and with\n Clinical Commissioning Groups (\nCCGs\n)\n to create a sustainable solution for coeliac disease sufferers to continue to access \nstaple \ngl\nuten-\nfree foods on prescription. \nExecutive Summary &#xa0;\n1.1.\n              \nCoeliac\n disease is a long term, autoimmune condition triggered by intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. Around 1 in 100 people in the UK are affected, although only 10-15% of those with the condition are diagnosed. \n1.2.\n              \nCoeliac\n disease is not ‘curable’; the only treatment is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet.\n \nThere is no medical intervention or alternative treatment programme. Without proper management, \ncoeliac\n disease can lead to a greater incidence of chronic conditions including osteoporosis and cancer, placing unnecessary strain on health services. \n1.3.\n              \nManagement of \ncoeliac\n disease can be delivered effectively in the community; with areas of England pioneering pharmacy led prescribing schemes that reduce the impact on primary and secondary care. \n1.4.\n              \nA clearer patient pathway and earlier diagnosis would speed up the proper management of \ncoeliac\n disease and reduce the health complications associated with it. \n1.5.\n              \nCoeliac\n UK, the national charity working for people with \ncoeliac\n disease, have developed national guidelines for the prescribing of gluten-free foods exist recommending basic unit allowances and appropriate staple products for prescription such as fresh bread and pasta. However, contrary to these guidelines, restrictions to the basic unit allowance as well as types of staple products prescribed have been imposed in various parts of the country. Those with \ncoeliac\n disease greatly value the provision of gluten-free foods on prescription and have strongly indicated their opposition to unfair restrictions or barriers to access. \n1.6.\n              \nThe BSNA believes that the provision of an essential gluten-free prescription provides good value, fosters good dietary adherence, and, in the long-term, will help save the NHS money. \n&#xa0;\n2.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoeliac\n disease is an autoimmune disease which affects 1 in 100 people in the UK. For people with the condition, the consumption of gluten triggers an immune reaction, making the body attack itself. Eating gluten damages the lining of the small intestine and affects \na patients’ \nability to \nabsorb nutrients from\n food properly\n. \n&#xa0;\n2.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoeliac disease is a life-long condition\n, the only treatment for which is adherence to a strict\n gluten-free diet\n.\n \nCoeliac disease requires on\n-\ngoing review and management.\n&#xa0;\n2.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoeliac\n disease isn't an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. In cases of coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them.\n&#xa0;\n2.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDiagnosis times for coeliac \npatients \naverage\n around\n \n13 years as symptoms are commonly mistaken for \nother gastrointestinal disorders \nsuch as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). \nFor a diagnosis of\n coeliac disease\n to be confirmed\n,\n patients \nneed to undergo a \nsmall \nintestinal biopsy\n, \nalthough in certain instances children displaying symptoms can be put straight onto a gluten-free diet following blood tests.\n&#xa0;\n2.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe main health risks linked to untreated and poorly managed coeliac disease include deficiencies of essential nutrients, leading to conditions such as anaemia; osteoporosis and associated increased risk of fractures due to a lack of calcium; \nit\n can lead to the development of bowel cancer and in women it can also cause infe\nrtility and adverse outcomes in \npregnancy\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe NICE 2009 guidelines state \nthat “coeliac disease can be very effectively treated with a gluten-free diet\n. I\nt is important to identify people with the undiagnosed disease so as to provide satisfactory individual treatment and also to improve the overall health of the community.”\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt is vital for people with coeliac disease to be able to access basic gluten-free foods, including fresh bread, on prescription. \nAdhering to a strict gluten-free diet is the medically advised treatment for coeliac disease. Choice is not an option as deviation from the diet will have a direct effect on health and morbidity.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nN\national prescribing guidelines titled ‘Gluten-free prescribing: a revised guide 2011’\n which provides information on the recommended amounts and type of products available to coeliac patients on prescription was produced by the NHS and endorsed by Coeliac UK, the Primary Care Society of Gastroenterology and the British Dietetic Association.\n \nIt highlights the importance of adherence to a gluten-free diet in order to minimise the \nrisk of \nassociated complications and reflects current guidance on the prescribing of gluten-free foods\n.\n&#xa0;\n3.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nSpecialist gluten-free foods have been developed and made available on prescription to replace everyday starchy foods such as breads, flour, pasta and cereals.\n Prescription gluten-free food products\n are \napproved by the Department of Health’s Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS). Only essential gluten-free foods which contribute to a healthy balanced diet are approved for availability on prescription.\n \n&#xa0;\n3.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPrescription gluten-free products are specifically selected to\n provide a guaranteed supply of essential staple \nfoods, which should provide around\n 15% of \npati\nents’ energy requirements. \n&#xa0;\n3.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPatients can purchase \ngluten-\nfree products including pastas and flour in \ncertain \nlarger supermarkets\n however these are often priced \nsignificantly higher\n than gluten-containing \nalternatives. This \ncost disproportionately affects\n people on lower incomes and those who live in more rural areas with \nlittle or \nno access to larger stores.\n&#xa0;\n3.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe social and psychological impact of sticking to a li\nfe-long gluten-free diet is significant \nand\n,\n if managed inappropriately\n,\n may result in further hidden costs to the NHS including repeated visits to the GP, further investigations and related prescription costs. \n&#xa0;\n3.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe annual ingredient cost in England of the 2012 provision of ACBS approved gluten-free foods was approximately £26.8 million Prescription Cost Analysis England 2012\n, NHS \nInformation Centre, April 2013. Since the net ingredient cost for all prescriptions in England was £8.53 billion, gluten-free foods comprise only 0.31% of the total net ingredient cost for all prescribed products\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRestrictions have been\n introduced \nby a number of Clinical Commissioning Groups\n (and formerly PCTs) \non cost rather than clinical grounds and run \ncontrary to national guidance\n \n(as discussed above) \ndeveloped by \nthe patient group Coeliac UK. The Government\n publically stated support for \ncoeliacs\n to have access to such products on the NHS.\n \n&#xa0;\n4.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe decision to withdraw patient access to a staple gluten-free food such as fresh bread conflicts with national guidance developed by the patients’ organisation Coeliac UK, as well as the Government’s publically stated support for \ncoeliacs\n to access such staple products on prescription.\n&#xa0;\n4.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWithin the new NHS, CCGs should operate on a level playing field \nto \nprovide access to essential staple gluten-free foods such as bread and flour on prescription, to allow those with coeliac disease to successfu\nlly manage their own condition. \n&#xa0;\n4.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe transition to CCGs has made it more difficult to understand the policies being operated in different areas in the UK. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;5.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nResponding to a recent BSNA survey, over e\night in ten (86%) \npeople \nwith coeliac disease \nagreed that accessing gluten free foods on prescription was important \nin aiding adherence to a gluten-\nfree diet. \nThe survey\n indicated that the poorest rely more heavily on\n prescriptions to manage their condition, and appeared to have fewer options available to them.\n&#xa0;\n5.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTwo-thirds \nof those who had had their prescriptions limited or stopped reported a negative impact on their ability to manage their condition.\n \nOne third of those surveyed said that cuts had made it more difficult for them to access gluten-free foods whether on prescription or in shops. \n&#xa0;&#xa0;6.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nClinically led NHS services for the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease can be delivered through a variety of routes including the acute care setting, community pharmacy and primary care practices. \n&#xa0;\n6.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFollowing diagnosis of coeliac disease or dermatitis \nherpetiformis\n (DH), it is essential that referral is made to a dietitian for expert advice on following a gluten-free diet that is tailored to the individual.\n&#xa0;\n6.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoeliac UK, the national c\nharity supporting people with coeliac disease, offers help and support to those diagnosed. It supports the m\nove towards increasing pharmacy-\nled prescribing schemes and encourages \nthose diagnosed with \ncoeliac disease to see \ndieticians\n to \nhelp \nmanage their condition\n. \nA\n dietitian can give individual advice and a step by step plan on how to remove gluten from the patient’s diet.\n&#xa0;7.1.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRegular review is part of the foundation o\nf support for promoting good adherence\n to a gluten-free diet. \nIntegrated care is also essential to the foundation of support. \n&#xa0;7.2.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nNew more cost effective care pathways are currently being developed which will place primary care at the centre of on-going care for coeliac patients. \n&#xa0;7.3.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPublic Health England\n recently published its priorities for the year 2013\n–\n14 which included a commitment to ‘reducing the burden of disease’. Local Health and Wellbeing Boards are looking to focus on strategies which manage conditions and reduce the likelihood of future illness. Easy and widespread access to gluten-free food for coeliac patients is an example of this type of policy as it is the only way to help those with coeliac disease to overcome their symptoms\n and reduce the risk of associated long-term complications\n. The BSNA will look to work with Local Health and Wellbeing Boards to becoming good advocates for managing conditions.\n&#xa0;\nDieticians\n7.4.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCommunity based specialist \ndieticians\n would be ideally placed to offer patients clinically led support in the community\n&#xa0;\n7.5.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nGiven the importance of a gluten-free diet in the treatment of coeliac disease, Coeliac UK has set out steps to setting up a dietitian led coeliac clinic.\n \nDiet \nis essential in the management of patients with coeliac disease and a dietitian is \nbest \nplaced to provide support and advice on individual nutritional requirements.\n&#xa0;\nPharmacy\n-\nled prescribing schemes\n7.6.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nPharmacy led schemes can help improve compliance and diagnosis as they are more accessible to a greater number of people with coeliac disease. \n&#xa0;\n7.7.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nP\nharmacy\n-\nled prescribing scheme\ns\n \nsee patients initially assessed by a \ndietician\n \nwho will then assign them a recommended number of \nunits of \ngluten-free\n foods\n required for\n a balanced diet. Once assessed\n under the scheme\n,\n community pharmacists are provided with a list of \nprescribable\n products from which patients can order up to the number of units that they are entitled to each month. The number of units is based on national guidance available from Coeliac UK.\n&#xa0;\n7.8.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nS\ncheme\ns\n \nhave\n been introduced in Bedfordshire, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Cumbria, Derby, Northamptonshire, South We\nst Essex and Tayside\n in Scotland\n.\n There are plans for such schemes to be \nrolled out across\n the whole of\n Scotland and \nin \nWales. \n&#xa0;\n7.9.\n&#xa0;&#xa0; \nCoeliac UK has produced a toolkit\n for Commissioners advising on \nthe provision of gluten-free foods, which aims to support commissioners in developing a cost-effective, enhanced service through pharmacy-led prescriptions for patients with coeliac disease.\n&#xa0;\n7.10.\n&#xa0; \nThrough the use of a pharmacy-led supply scheme\ns\n, gluten-free foods are supplied directly from community pharmacists, thus\n minimising the workload for \nGP practice\ns\n. A review of established schemes in Northamptonshire and Cumbria show\ns\n savings of between 20% and 40%. If this approach was applied nationally, there is the potential to save between £5 and £11 million per year in England alone, as well as freeing up GP time.\n&#xa0;\n7.5 The potential benefits of changing to pharmacy-managed supply of gluten-free foods include: \nawareness of coeliac disease should result in increased diagnosis \n&#xa0;\nMay 2013\n http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG86FullGuideline.pdf\n http://www.coeliac.org.uk/sites/files/coeliac/a5_prescribing_guidelines_hires_for_print_and_web_april_12_2.pdf\n \nPrescription Cost Analysis England 2012 \nhttp://www.hscic.gov.uk/catalogue/PUB10610\n Restrictions still exist in Middleton and Rochdale; Telford and Wrekin; Greenwich; Stockport; Oldham; Manchester; Suffolk; Leigh and Wigan. \n \n\"The aim of providing gluten-free food products on NHS prescription is to encourage patients with coeliac disease to stick to a gluten-free, nutritious diet so they do not go on to develop more serious illnesses, which can affect their quality of life as well as being much more costly for the NHS,\" Andrew\n \nLansley\n Health Secretary May 2012 \n Opinion Leader conducted an online survey of 1,000 Coeliac Disease patients, parent and carers between February 4th and February 25th 2013.
