This obviously\n \nrequires a very different sort of contingency planning. Overnight rainfall of over\n \n68mm in the area significantly\n \nexceeded Met Office foreca\nsts causing the worst flooding in the airport's living memory.\n2.4 Gatwick issued its first passenger communications via twitter at 4:29am about possible\n      \ndisruption.\n2.5\n \nAs\n \na\n \nresult\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nrain\n \ntwo\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nsix\n \nswitch-rooms\n \nlocated\n \nin\n \nthe\n \nNorth\n \nTerminal\n \nflooded,\n \nknocking\n \nout \nmuch\n \nof\n \nthe\n \npower.\n2.6 Simultaneously on the airfield three substations flooded and the Runway Instrument Landing System was\n \ndisabled. This is a known\n \nand understood risk and the contingency\n \nworked with the backup generators kicking \nin to provide\n \ncontinuity of power.\n \nThe South Terminal continued\n \nto operate as normal and the airfield remained operational throughout.\n2.7 However by 7:30am it was clear that the damage to the North Terminal switch-room\n \nwas severe and \nthat \nfull power\n \nwould\n not be reinstated to the North Terminal on Christmas Eve.\n2.8\n \nBy\n \n9:00am\n \nwe\n \nhad\n \nissued\n \na\n \nstatement\n \nto\n \nall\n \nmedia\n \noutlets\n \nabout\n \nthe\n \nsituation\n \nat\n \nthe\n \nairport.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;3.

Flood Preparations&#xa0;\n4.1 Since the change of ownership\n \nin 2009, Gatwick has, \nwith the full backing of its new shareholders, invested over £1bn with the end aim of transforming Gatwick into a world-leading airport\n \ncapable of competing successfully.\n4.2 This investment programme included over £20 million in mitigating and alleviating\n flood risk.\n4.3 The majority of this investment\n \nhas been focused on the South Terminal, which had been assessed as having a 1 in 20 year risk of flooding. These works were successful in preventing flooding of the\n \nSouth Terminal during the recent exception\nal weather.\n4.4 The North Terminal had been assessed in 2008 as being at a low risk of flooding- less than a 1in 100 year risk.\n4.5 Gatwick will be working with the Environment\n \nAgency to reassess all flood modeling, and provides\n \nan unqualified assurance th\nat all necessary further\n \ninvestment will be carried out as a matter\n \nof urgency.\n&#xa0;\n5.  Passengers&#xa0;\n5.1 Despite the lack of warning and despite the flooding\n \nand the subsequent loss of the switch rooms at the North Terminal it is clear that there is a lot more\n Gatwick could ·and should · have done with\n \nits airport partners to help make the disruption as painless as possible for passengers.\n5.2 Gatwick did attempt to communicate\n \nwith passengers via twitter, issuing over 300 tweets\n \non the day. It also issued thre\ne media statements\n \nwhich were sent to key news rooms and media outlets\n \nas well as briefing local and national media throughout the day.\n5.3 As an Airport\n \nGatwick sets itself very high standards in performance and customer service. It \nhas worked hard along \nwith its airport\n \npartners to achieve a good reputation for dealing with disruptions. On this occasion Gatwick's actions and those of its airport\n \npartners fell short.\n5.4 Gatwick has offered\n \neach passenger whose flight was cancelled £100 of high street vouc\nhers as a goodwill gesture. The McMillan review {see 6.1) will focus in particular\n \non how Gatwick can learn the lessons for the future. At times like this passenger information and comfort must always be a priority.\n&#xa0;\n6.  Review&#xa0;\n6.1 David McMillan, a Non \nExecutive Director at Gatwick, is leading a comprehensive review of what happened, the lessons that can be learnt and what actions are required to avoid a reoccurrence.\n6.2 David McMillan is Chair of the Board of Governors of the Flight Safety Foundation a\nnd was Director\n \nGeneral of Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates air traffic\n \nacross 40 European states, from 2008 to 2012. Before that he was UK Director General of Civil Aviation and spoke for Europe on environmental issues at ICAO. Earlier in his career, he \nled for Government on the establishment\n \nof the NATS PPP and was Secretary to the RUCATSE study on airport\n \ncapacity in South East England. David started his career in the Diplomatic Service and is a fellow\n \nof both the Chartered Institute of\n \nTransport and th\ne Royal Aeronautical Society.\n6.3 The Review will be published in February.\n&#xa0;\n7.  Conclusion&#xa0;\n7.1 There is never a good time for something like this to happen but Gatwick Airport recognises that Christmas Eve is probably the worst with so many passengers tr\navelling to be with their families over the festive period.\n7.2 Gatwick Airport\n \nwill learn the lessons, make any additional\n \ninvestment required\n \nand continue\n \nto do everything it can to give its customers the quality of service they should expect.\n7.3 Gatwic\nk Airport's Chief Executive extends a sincere apology to those whose travel plans were disrupted.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary\n \n2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;\n"
