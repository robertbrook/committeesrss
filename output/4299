defaultA response by Wildlife and Countryside Linkdefault&#xa0;
default1.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWildlife and Countryside Link (Link) believes that food must be produced in a way that protects and enhances the natural resources on which 
defaultfood
default production depends
default.
default It should also be produced 
defaultin a sustainable and humane manner. Securing food supplies should not be 
defaultused as justification
default to intensify farming. 
defaultThe level of
default food 
defaultsupply
default needed will depend on a range of factors including population 
defaulttrends
default,
default 
defaultchanging diets
default, 
defaultthe extent of food that is wasted
default and consumer choice.
default 
defaultIt does not follow that securing food supplies requires further intensification of agriculture; rather the issue of food provision for a growing population requires core issues relating to human and also environmental health and wellbeing to be addressed.
default The challenge is to work towards a
default food production model that provides everyone with sufficient healthy food over the long-term, at no cost to the environment
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultt is also important to understand that increased production also does not automatically lead to 
defaulta reduction in
default global hunger. The number of undernourished people in the world has increased by 9%
default,
default despite a 12% rise in global food production per capita since 1990
default.
default This suggests
default that
default the most pressing 
defaultneed
default is to address global poverty and access to food
default,
default rather than just to increase the amount of food available.
default&#xa0;
default1.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultLink believe
defaults
default that creating and maintaining a high quality natural environment is critical for our food production capacity. It is vital that we protect the productive base of agriculture – the environment and its resources
default –
default and protect the welfare needs of any animal that is being farmed.
default&#xa0;
default1.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis response is supported by the following seven organisations:
default&#xa0;default2.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultFood security 
defaultrelates not just to
default the amount of
default, or efficiency with which,
default food 
defaultis 
defaultproduced. 
defaultRather, i
defaultt concerns the affordability of food, access to it and dietary choices. In 2009, the U
defaultnited 
defaultN
defaultations (UN)
default and World Bank-sponsored International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development
default (
defaultIAASTD
default)
default 
defaultreport
default was published
default.
default This comprehensive and peer 
defaultreviewed report highlighted 
defaultthe fundamentally unsustainable nature of
default conventional, resource intensive farming
default, 
defaultand 
defaultthat 
defaultfocussing solely on increased production 
defaultis
default not a long
default-
defaultterm solution to food security. Instead, IAASTD emphasised the importance of supporting agro-ecological farming methods 
defaultthat
default place equal emphasis on providing non-food ecosystem goods and services. 
defaultThe report therefore
default highlights the folly of concentrating on a narrow view of food security 
defaultthat
default focuses on increasing production or maximising the efficiency of current production methods. 
defaultThe European Commission have also shown
default the links between intensifying production and increased disease risks
default,
default 
defaultwhich lead 
defaultto food security issues
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultEfficiency is not a proxy for sustainability
default. I
defaultndeed there is a danger that concentrating on efficiency could result in investment in unsustainable systems
default,
default making it more difficult for the agriculture sector to restructure 
defaultand
default become more sustainable. 
defaultA
defaultlthough useful in eliminating waste
default, t
defaulthe drive for greater efficiency can also result in a less resilient system
default,
default as processes become more specialised and reliant on single sources of inputs.
default&#xa0;
default2.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultLink member
defaults
default believe that creating and maintaining a high quality natural environment is critical for our food production capacity. The conservation of water resources and soil fertility, along with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, is crucial to lasting productivity. Well-functioning ecosystems associated with farmland provide a number of agro-ecological services
default, such as
default pest control, pollination
default and 
defaultnutrient cycling
default,
default which support crop production
default.
default A highly connected network of wildlife habitats is needed to maintain healthy populations of species that contribute to agricultural productivity
default,
default as well as helping other species to survive in intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes and in a changing climate
default.
default&#xa0;
default2.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultProtecting our biodiversity, soil and water resources for the long
default-
defaultterm is therefore critical 
defaultin
default enhancing the resilience of agriculture to changes in climate, 
defaultthe 
defaultimpacts of existing and future plant and animal diseases
default,
default and fluctuating prices in global markets.
default&#xa0;
default2.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt is also critical to examine the impact of intensifying food production. Over the past ten years a number of EU scientific reports have shown that the welfare of farm animals in intensive systems has been compromised.
default EU farm ministers have responded to this by reducing the rate of intensification and prohibiting systems such as the barren battery cage for laying hens, the sow stall system for pigs and the veal crate system. This move towards a more humane farming system, in response to the public and consumer demand for more extensive production, has not affected food security within the EU. But as these systems have been prohibited in the EU there has been a move to start such systems in other countries, particularly in the developing world such as sub-Saharan Africa, India and southwest Asia. 
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe drivers for food price increases, which have
default made food less affordable for those on low incomes
default, are
default complex
default, and include:
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultLink believes that the answer to rising food prices is not to drive down the cost of production of our current system. Indeed
default,
default we already pay several times over for the production of our food
default:
default at the till, through our water bills and through a loss of wellbeing as our environment is degraded. Instead
default,
default we believe the best approach to bring down the cost of food to society 
defaultin the 
defaultlong
default-
defaultterm is to 
defaulta) 
defaultbetter support a more sustainable approach to agriculture
default, 
defaultand b) to reduce supply chains, by promoting local food, which will reduce costs and ensure that more of the purchase price goes directly to the producer
default.
default&#xa0;

defaultT
defaulthe rising demand for biofuel crops means 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are often 
defaultin 
defaultdirect competi
defaulttion
default 
defaultwith
default land 
defaultfor food
default crops. This is turn contributes to higher food prices and can affect crop types and the availability of food in developing countries. A 2009 report into the land implications of producing biofuels, involving more than 75 scientists from around the world, cast doubt on the idea of using land that cannot be used for growing food to grow biofuels. It noted that there is no evidence that non-food crops can be grown efficiently for energy production on land that could not also grow crops for food
default.
default 
defaultA recent report by Action
default 
defaultAid
default 
defaultsuggest
defaulted
default that if all global biofuel targets were met, food prices could rise by up to an additional 76% by 2020, leading to an estimated 600 million more people going hungry.

default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe have made reference to some of the causes of volatility in global prices, and we have also stated our belief that the best way to combat these is to create and maintain a high quality natural environment to ensure our own food production capac
defaultity.
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe have also 
defaultnoted
default that
default the rising demand for food across the globe is largely driven by a growing middle class who demand diets richer in meat and dairy
default.
default These foods have a much higher environmental impact than other foods. The UK should take a lead in reducing overall levels of meat and dairy consumption; this would have a positive influence on the sustainability of global food production. Meat and dairy consumption in the UK continues to be high by global standards
default,
default and developing countries consume more meat and dairy products as prosperity rises.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultAround 30% of the Earth’s land mass is now dedicated to feeding livestock
default.
default Although a significant proportion of this is represented by extensive grazing of natural habitats, animal feed is consuming a major share of the world’s arable land and 
defaultthe creation of
default new grazing land is a major factor in tropical deforestation. 
defaultThe climate change footprint of livestock
default is also significant, and the sector is estimated to account for 18% of global 
defaultgreenhouse gas
default emissions
default.

default products will help 
defaultto

defaultthe health of the UK population.
default 
defaultThe added benefits of extensive livestock systems associated with High Nature Value farms should also be recognised, for example protection of wildflower rich grasslands and landscapes that in turn provide wider benefits to society.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultI
defaultn the future 
defaultgenetically modified (GM)
default crops may play a role in helping meet the challenge of global food security, 
defaultbut 
defaultthey are not a silver bullet and there are existing alternatives (such as changes to farming practices) which help to address this challenge whilst also providing multiple benefits at lower costs and with fewer risks
default.
default&#xa0;default5.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultGM technology is regularly championed as an essential tool 
defaultfor
default produc
defaulting
default more to feed the growing global population. Biotechnology interests have used the food security argument to press governments to introduce less restrictive policies on the use of GM technology and streamlined approvals of GM crops
default,
default and to develop new areas such as cloned animals.
default&#xa0;
default5.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultGM technology, accompanied by plant breeding techniques and intellectual property rights frameworks, tends towards selecting and developing a small number of crop varieties. This reduces the diversity in the genetic resource ‘library’ of crop traits. However, it is likely that such diversity will be essential in the future to cope with specific local conditions or 
defaultwider
default challenges
default, such as 
defaultclimate change. Additionally, there is evidence that genes in GM crops can be transferred to wild relatives, which drives a concern that ‘superweeds’ can be formed by the hybridisation of GM herbicide-resistant crops with their wild relatives
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe d
defaultevelopment of crop varieties that are able to respond to challenges such as drought or saline soils, or which confer nitrogen fixing ability to crops such as wheat
default (
defaultreducing the need for fertiliser
default)
default, could help increase production by currently unproductive land
default to come into use
default. However, such varieties are yet to reach the market. Furthermore, there are concerns that due to the cost of GM seed and associated agri-chemicals, GM technology is likely to be inappropriate for many farmers in developing countries who farm in low-cost, low-input, small-scale agricultural systems. Agricultural research should address the need to increase crop yields in a sustainable way by developing innovations and technology appropriate to the scale and economic circumstances of these agricultural systems
default.
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultDiscussions on limiting cloning for farm animals also highlight the problems of new technologies.  Attempts to overturn the EU’s ban on cloning were stopped by the European Parliament in 2012. Whilst a new Commission proposal is due out in 2013, the same arguments are likely to be repeated, pitching animal welfare concerns on cloning against industry demands to allow cloning to meet increasing food demands.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe horsemeat scandal 
defaultdemonstrated
default both the importan
defaultce
default of transparency within supply chains, and the need for effective

defaultoversight
default to prevent fraud and to protect the environment and consumers
default.
default 
defaultMore 
defaulteconomic 
defaulttransparency within the food chain 
defaultto highlight the true economic, social and environmental costs of different production systems would help us to understand the overall benefits of these approaches. For example, the benefits to local communities through greater employment by organic farms. 
defaultShorter supply chains, greater promotion of local food and clear messages about provenance and quality would all contribute to increased resilience.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default7.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultClimate change has already started to alter ecosystems and agricultural conditions
default,
default and 
defaultthis 
defaultwill 
defaultintensify
default over the coming decades. 
defaultClimate change
default will be manifested through changes in, for example, rainfall amounts and patterns, temperature and the timing of seasons, all of which will affect agricultural capacity and yield. More frequent extreme weather events such as drought or flooding
default,
default and the potential increase in invasive and damaging non-native species and diseases
default,
default will also affect agricultural production. Water shortages are likely to be one of the most important factors for agriculture across the globe and in England and Wales
default.
default 
defaultW
defaulte are looking to the Government to put in place a resilient sustainable abstraction regime so that the potential impact of drought on agriculture is minimised.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultA healthy natural environment will help agriculture to be more resilient to climate change by providing services such as water management, nutrient recycling and pollination. It is therefore 
defaultimportant that in adapting to climate change, agricultural businesses ensure that their actions do not further damage the environment.

defaultThe obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase prodefaultduction and access new marketsdefault&#xa0;default8.1.
default&#xa0; 
defaultFarmer
defaults
default should not be seeking to increase production, they should instead focus on making their systems sustainable – environmentally, economically and socially. Increased production does not necessary result in increased profit. Farming creates a range of benefits to society
default such as
default wildlife habitats, carbon storage, flood alleviation, the landscape, recreation and employment
default. Producing food in a more humane manner is something being demanded by consumers throughout the EU, as shown by the two Eurobarmometer surveys on animal welfare. 
defaultTo support farmers to be more sustainable we need better joined up advice and knowledge transfer. 
default&#xa0;
default8.2.
default&#xa0; 
defaultBeing more sustainable and utilising natural processes can open up new markets. For example
default,
default farming buffalo on flood meadows has enabled a market in British mozzarella to develop and acts as flood alleviation from other parts of the farm where farmers may want to grow other products.

default Tried and tested examples include the use of traditional crop varieties/ landraces, and a plethora of organic and locally-adapted low-technology farming techniques. Such solutions may have multiple benefits: most GM crops are designed to address one specific problem (e.g. drought tolerance), whereas changes in practice may have multiple benefits (e.g. the UN estimates that organic farming techniques that build soil fertility and structure could increase crop yields in Africa by 2–4 times while building up levels of natural, human, social, financial and physical
