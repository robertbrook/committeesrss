[normal]A response by Wildlife and Countryside Link[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]1.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Wildlife and Countryside Link (Link) believes that food must be produced in a way that protects and enhances the natural resources on which 
[normal]food
[normal] production depends
[normal].
[normal] It should also be produced 
[normal]in a sustainable and humane manner. Securing food supplies should not be 
[normal]used as justification
[normal] to intensify farming. 
[normal]The level of
[normal] food 
[normal]supply
[normal] needed will depend on a range of factors including population 
[normal]trends
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]changing diets
[normal], 
[normal]the extent of food that is wasted
[normal] and consumer choice.
[normal] 
[normal]It does not follow that securing food supplies requires further intensification of agriculture; rather the issue of food provision for a growing population requires core issues relating to human and also environmental health and wellbeing to be addressed.
[normal] The challenge is to work towards a
[normal] food production model that provides everyone with sufficient healthy food over the long-term, at no cost to the environment
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]t is also important to understand that increased production also does not automatically lead to 
[normal]a reduction in
[normal] global hunger. The number of undernourished people in the world has increased by 9%
[normal],
[normal] despite a 12% rise in global food production per capita since 1990
[normal].
[normal] This suggests
[normal] that
[normal] the most pressing 
[normal]need
[normal] is to address global poverty and access to food
[normal],
[normal] rather than just to increase the amount of food available.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Link believe
[normal]s
[normal] that creating and maintaining a high quality natural environment is critical for our food production capacity. It is vital that we protect the productive base of agriculture – the environment and its resources
[normal] –
[normal] and protect the welfare needs of any animal that is being farmed.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]This response is supported by the following seven organisations:
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]2.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Food security 
[normal]relates not just to
[normal] the amount of
[normal], or efficiency with which,
[normal] food 
[normal]is 
[normal]produced. 
[normal]Rather, i
[normal]t concerns the affordability of food, access to it and dietary choices. In 2009, the U
[normal]nited 
[normal]N
[normal]ations (UN)
[normal] and World Bank-sponsored International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development
[normal] (
[normal]IAASTD
[normal])
[normal] 
[normal]report
[normal] was published
[normal].
[normal] This comprehensive and peer 
[normal]reviewed report highlighted 
[normal]the fundamentally unsustainable nature of
[normal] conventional, resource intensive farming
[normal], 
[normal]and 
[normal]that 
[normal]focussing solely on increased production 
[normal]is
[normal] not a long
[normal]-
[normal]term solution to food security. Instead, IAASTD emphasised the importance of supporting agro-ecological farming methods 
[normal]that
[normal] place equal emphasis on providing non-food ecosystem goods and services. 
[normal]The report therefore
[normal] highlights the folly of concentrating on a narrow view of food security 
[normal]that
[normal] focuses on increasing production or maximising the efficiency of current production methods. 
[normal]The European Commission have also shown
[normal] the links between intensifying production and increased disease risks
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]which lead 
[normal]to food security issues
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Efficiency is not a proxy for sustainability
[normal]. I
[normal]ndeed there is a danger that concentrating on efficiency could result in investment in unsustainable systems
[normal],
[normal] making it more difficult for the agriculture sector to restructure 
[normal]and
[normal] become more sustainable. 
[normal]A
[normal]lthough useful in eliminating waste
[normal], t
[normal]he drive for greater efficiency can also result in a less resilient system
[normal],
[normal] as processes become more specialised and reliant on single sources of inputs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Link member
[normal]s
[normal] believe that creating and maintaining a high quality natural environment is critical for our food production capacity. The conservation of water resources and soil fertility, along with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, is crucial to lasting productivity. Well-functioning ecosystems associated with farmland provide a number of agro-ecological services
[normal], such as
[normal] pest control, pollination
[normal] and 
[normal]nutrient cycling
[normal],
[normal] which support crop production
[normal].
[normal] A highly connected network of wildlife habitats is needed to maintain healthy populations of species that contribute to agricultural productivity
[normal],
[normal] as well as helping other species to survive in intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes and in a changing climate
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Protecting our biodiversity, soil and water resources for the long
[normal]-
[normal]term is therefore critical 
[normal]in
[normal] enhancing the resilience of agriculture to changes in climate, 
[normal]the 
[normal]impacts of existing and future plant and animal diseases
[normal],
[normal] and fluctuating prices in global markets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]It is also critical to examine the impact of intensifying food production. Over the past ten years a number of EU scientific reports have shown that the welfare of farm animals in intensive systems has been compromised.
[normal] EU farm ministers have responded to this by reducing the rate of intensification and prohibiting systems such as the barren battery cage for laying hens, the sow stall system for pigs and the veal crate system. This move towards a more humane farming system, in response to the public and consumer demand for more extensive production, has not affected food security within the EU. But as these systems have been prohibited in the EU there has been a move to start such systems in other countries, particularly in the developing world such as sub-Saharan Africa, India and southwest Asia. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The drivers for food price increases, which have
[normal] made food less affordable for those on low incomes
[normal], are
[normal] complex
[normal], and include:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Link believes that the answer to rising food prices is not to drive down the cost of production of our current system. Indeed
[normal],
[normal] we already pay several times over for the production of our food
[normal]:
[normal] at the till, through our water bills and through a loss of wellbeing as our environment is degraded. Instead
[normal],
[normal] we believe the best approach to bring down the cost of food to society 
[normal]in the 
[normal]long
[normal]-
[normal]term is to 
[normal]a) 
[normal]better support a more sustainable approach to agriculture
[normal], 
[normal]and b) to reduce supply chains, by promoting local food, which will reduce costs and ensure that more of the purchase price goes directly to the producer
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he rising demand for biofuel crops means 
[normal]that 
[normal]they are often 
[normal]in 
[normal]direct competi
[normal]tion
[normal] 
[normal]with
[normal] land 
[normal]for food
[normal] crops. This is turn contributes to higher food prices and can affect crop types and the availability of food in developing countries. A 2009 report into the land implications of producing biofuels, involving more than 75 scientists from around the world, cast doubt on the idea of using land that cannot be used for growing food to grow biofuels. It noted that there is no evidence that non-food crops can be grown efficiently for energy production on land that could not also grow crops for food
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]A recent report by Action
[normal] 
[normal]Aid
[normal] 
[normal]suggest
[normal]ed
[normal] that if all global biofuel targets were met, food prices could rise by up to an additional 76% by 2020, leading to an estimated 600 million more people going hungry.
[normal] The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), F
[normal]ood and

[normal]griculture 
[normal]O
[normal]rganization of the UN
[normal] 
[normal](FAO) 
[normal]and 
[normal]UN
[normal] Energy have all warned that government support for biofuels could have serious negative effects on food prices, 
[normal]from which
[normal] the world’s poorest people 
[normal]are 
[normal]likely to suffer 
[normal]the most.
[normal] 
[normal]I
[normal]n addition
[normal],
[normal] the
[normal]re are
[normal] negative environmental consequences 
[normal]associated with
[normal] renewable targets such as large-scale changes in land use, 
[normal]which 
[normal]often 
[normal]impact
[normal] areas of important natural habitat.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We have made reference to some of the causes of volatility in global prices, and we have also stated our belief that the best way to combat these is to create and maintain a high quality natural environment to ensure our own food production capac
[normal]ity.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]We have also 
[normal]noted
[normal] that
[normal] the rising demand for food across the globe is largely driven by a growing middle class who demand diets richer in meat and dairy
[normal].
[normal] These foods have a much higher environmental impact than other foods. The UK should take a lead in reducing overall levels of meat and dairy consumption; this would have a positive influence on the sustainability of global food production. Meat and dairy consumption in the UK continues to be high by global standards
[normal],
[normal] and developing countries consume more meat and dairy products as prosperity rises.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Around 30% of the Earth’s land mass is now dedicated to feeding livestock
[normal].
[normal] Although a significant proportion of this is represented by extensive grazing of natural habitats, animal feed is consuming a major share of the world’s arable land and 
[normal]the creation of
[normal] new grazing land is a major factor in tropical deforestation. 
[normal]The climate change footprint of livestock
[normal] is also significant, and the sector is estimated to account for 18% of global 
[normal]greenhouse gas
[normal] emissions
[normal].
[normal] Encouraging people to consume healthy levels of more sustainable meat and 
[normal]d
[normal]ai
[normal]ry
[normal] products will help 
[normal]to 
[normal]reduce the environmental impact of food production and would also benefit
[normal] 
[normal]the health of the UK population.
[normal] 
[normal]The added benefits of extensive livestock systems associated with High Nature Value farms should also be recognised, for example protection of wildflower rich grasslands and landscapes that in turn provide wider benefits to society.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]I
[normal]n the future 
[normal]genetically modified (GM)
[normal] crops may play a role in helping meet the challenge of global food security, 
[normal]but 
[normal]they are not a silver bullet and there are existing alternatives (such as changes to farming practices) which help to address this challenge whilst also providing multiple benefits at lower costs and with fewer risks
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]5.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]GM technology is regularly championed as an essential tool 
[normal]for
[normal] produc
[normal]ing
[normal] more to feed the growing global population. Biotechnology interests have used the food security argument to press governments to introduce less restrictive policies on the use of GM technology and streamlined approvals of GM crops
[normal],
[normal] and to develop new areas such as cloned animals.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.3
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]GM technology, accompanied by plant breeding techniques and intellectual property rights frameworks, tends towards selecting and developing a small number of crop varieties. This reduces the diversity in the genetic resource ‘library’ of crop traits. However, it is likely that such diversity will be essential in the future to cope with specific local conditions or 
[normal]wider
[normal] challenges
[normal], such as 
[normal]climate change. Additionally, there is evidence that genes in GM crops can be transferred to wild relatives, which drives a concern that ‘superweeds’ can be formed by the hybridisation of GM herbicide-resistant crops with their wild relatives
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.4
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The d
[normal]evelopment of crop varieties that are able to respond to challenges such as drought or saline soils, or which confer nitrogen fixing ability to crops such as wheat
[normal] (
[normal]reducing the need for fertiliser
[normal])
[normal], could help increase production by currently unproductive land
[normal] to come into use
[normal]. However, such varieties are yet to reach the market. Furthermore, there are concerns that due to the cost of GM seed and associated agri-chemicals, GM technology is likely to be inappropriate for many farmers in developing countries who farm in low-cost, low-input, small-scale agricultural systems. Agricultural research should address the need to increase crop yields in a sustainable way by developing innovations and technology appropriate to the scale and economic circumstances of these agricultural systems
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.5
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Discussions on limiting cloning for farm animals also highlight the problems of new technologies.  Attempts to overturn the EU’s ban on cloning were stopped by the European Parliament in 2012. Whilst a new Commission proposal is due out in 2013, the same arguments are likely to be repeated, pitching animal welfare concerns on cloning against industry demands to allow cloning to meet increasing food demands.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.1
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]The horsemeat scandal 
[normal]demonstrated
[normal] both the importan
[normal]ce
[normal] of transparency within supply chains, and the need for effective 
[normal]regulatory 
[normal]oversight
[normal] to prevent fraud and to protect the environment and consumers
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]More 
[normal]economic 
[normal]transparency within the food chain 
[normal]to highlight the true economic, social and environmental costs of different production systems would help us to understand the overall benefits of these approaches. For example, the benefits to local communities through greater employment by organic farms. 
[normal]Shorter supply chains, greater promotion of local food and clear messages about provenance and quality would all contribute to increased resilience.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Climate change has already started to alter ecosystems and agricultural conditions
[normal],
[normal] and 
[normal]this 
[normal]will 
[normal]intensify
[normal] over the coming decades. 
[normal]Climate change
[normal] will be manifested through changes in, for example, rainfall amounts and patterns, temperature and the timing of seasons, all of which will affect agricultural capacity and yield. More frequent extreme weather events such as drought or flooding
[normal],
[normal] and the potential increase in invasive and damaging non-native species and diseases
[normal],
[normal] will also affect agricultural production. Water shortages are likely to be one of the most important factors for agriculture across the globe and in England and Wales
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]W
[normal]e are looking to the Government to put in place a resilient sustainable abstraction regime so that the potential impact of drought on agriculture is minimised.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]A healthy natural environment will help agriculture to be more resilient to climate change by providing services such as water management, nutrient recycling and pollination. It is therefore 
[normal]important that in adapting to climate change, agricultural businesses ensure that their actions do not further damage the environment.

[normal]The obstacles facing food producers, including small farmers, seeking to increase pro[bold]duction and access new markets[bold]&#xa0;[bold]8.1.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Farmer
[normal]s
[normal] should not be seeking to increase production, they should instead focus on making their systems sustainable – environmentally, economically and socially. Increased production does not necessary result in increased profit. Farming creates a range of benefits to society
[normal] such as
[normal] wildlife habitats, carbon storage, flood alleviation, the landscape, recreation and employment
[normal]. Producing food in a more humane manner is something being demanded by consumers throughout the EU, as shown by the two Eurobarmometer surveys on animal welfare. 
[normal]To support farmers to be more sustainable we need better joined up advice and knowledge transfer. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]8.2.
[normal]&#xa0; 
[normal]Being more sustainable and utilising natural processes can open up new markets. For example
[normal],
[normal] farming buffalo on flood meadows has enabled a market in British mozzarella to develop and acts as flood alleviation from other parts of the farm where farmers may want to grow other products.

[normal] Tried and tested examples include the use of traditional crop varieties/ landraces, and a plethora of organic and locally-adapted low-technology farming techniques. Such solutions may have multiple benefits: most GM crops are designed to address one specific problem (e.g. drought tolerance), whereas changes in practice may have multiple benefits (e.g. the UN estimates that organic farming techniques that build soil fertility and structure could increase crop yields in Africa by 2–4 times while building up levels of natural, human, social, financial and physical
