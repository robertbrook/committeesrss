"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence \nfrom\n Sharon and Peter Matthews (TWR0009)\nFour family members were booked on EZY8349 from Gatwick north terminal to Nice due to depart at 07.15 on 24 December. \n \nWe\n were travelling from Farnham and our son and his partner from central London. \nAs requested, we checked the \neasyJet\n website before leaving home at 04.00 and no problems were indicated. We arrived at departures north terminal at 05.\n15\n and were immediately t\nold that our flight would be delayed and asked to go down one floor and wait for further instructions.\n \n At this stage none of the information boards were working. \n \nAt 06.29 \nwe\n received a t\ne\nxt from \neasyJet\n to say flight delayed and offering refreshment vouc\nhers but not telling us where to get these.\n \n \nA further t\ne\nxt was received \nat 06.43 \ngiving an apology\n. \n \nWe kept trying to visit the hopelessly \novercrowded departures\n area to try and find someone who could tell us what was going on or at least could reassure \nus that the growing crowd downstairs would not be forgotten if there was some news. The information boards were still not functioning although evidenced by the \nfrequent Microsoft\n messages\n,\n someone was obviously trying to reboot the whole system numerous ti\nmes. \n \nAt 09.39 a further t\ne\nxt was received asking us to wait for announcements to go to South terminal to check in.\nDuring this long wait, we managed to buy food and drink\n,\n but \ndue to lack of power\n only one\n of \nthe toilet blocks\n in the terminal \nwas\n working\n,\n and \nimpossibly \nlong queues built up\n for \nit\n.\n  \n \nOur\n only option \nwas to take the train to\n the\n toilet\ns\n in South terminal\n,\n \nalthough\n there was \nno one\n \nsuggesting to\n \nothers\n that this \nwas\n what they \ncould\n do. \n \nAmazingly t\nhe lack of power only seemed to affect \nthe \nt\noilets –\n the Christmas tree lights were working as were the escalators and lifts and all the shops\n,\n including the gaming arcade.\nEventually,\n around midday, \nwe were \ncalled\n to go to South terminal to be checked in for our flight and this we did. \nWe joined th\ne crowds there where there\n was a person calling forward travellers for particular \nflights and\n \ndirecting \nthem \nto a check in desk.  \nOur baggage was \nchecked\n in and we were asked to go through security \nthen\n head to \na specific gate\n.  There, instead of boarding \na flight,\n we were faced with a huge queue for a bus – apparently there was only one available. \n \nAfter a very uncomfortable 60 minutes of waiting in a very \nover\ncrowded area, we got the bus \n- \nnot to the plane\n,\n but back \nagain \nto \nan entrance to \nNorth t\nerminal.\n There was nobody from \ne\nasyJet\n \nhere and the atmosphere was pretty tense as there were hundreds of people from different flights and different airlines trying to find out what to do next. \n Why on earth were we not simply asked to go back to the North termin\nal via the shuttle train?  We eventually found our way back to the departure hall (now airside) to await boarding information.  \nBy this time, the information boards were showing the flights but no indication of any cancellations or expected departure times\n. We managed to find seats in restaurants \nand \nremained there\n.  The\n restaurant staff were\n very accommodating\n,\n \nthey\n did not mind us staying there \nas by now most of their food had run out.\nWe only discovered that our flight was cancelled when our son called u\ns from France to say that he had seen it on \nthe \neasyJet\n website, around 6pm.  \nI\n went to the information desk which was by then only being manned by the police and was surrounded by a huge crowd. \nI\n managed to get confirmation that our flight \nhad been cancel\nled but no clues as to when\n or whether\n it might be rescheduled.\n \n \nAmongst the confusion, we were \nfinally\n \ntold\n to go through a \nside\n door\n, queue again for immigration\n \nthen go to\n baggage reclaim. The route was quite dangerous as a large section of the wide cor\nridor near to baggage reclaim was in almost complete darkness with only a couple of totally inadequate emergency lights. \nThere were only two carousels \nworking and\n n\no attempt was made to manage the baggage reclaim by flight\n.\n  \nWe were there for \nnearly three \nhours\n.\n \nA\n number of people had obviously just given up an\nd\n abandoned their luggage\n which was clogging up the belts\n. \nThe huge\n crowd includ\ned\n people who were disabled, elderly, had very young children etc. There was nobody in evidence from either \neasyJet\n or t\nhe airport\n \nalthough\n \nsome \npolice were there being helpful\n.\n \n \nWith the help of passengers they started to remove baggage from the belts and pile it on the floor.  This caused further problems as both abandoned baggage and new baggage were now piling up togeth\ner and passenger floor space was quickly reducing. \n \nWe\n were \nfinally\n \ntold\n that no further bags would come out via the baggage carousels as they were all now being delivered to the pavement area outside the terminal building. There was additional confusion d\nue to a rumour that baggage checked in at South terminal needed to be reclaimed there – but there was nobody around to check this with. We emerged on to the pavement area to be greeted by more chaotic scenes and a huge police presence. These policemen were\n again friendly and helpful but luckily our son had stayed in bagg\nag\ne reclaim\n \nwhere\n \nhe \neventually discovered\n our cases.\nWe had still not been given any information about the possibility of our flight going the next day nor any information of how to handle \na hotel booking etc. \n \nOur decision was to leave the airport and go home. \n \nWe left the airport at 22.00 after seventeen wasted and very frustrating hours and still nowhere nearer our Christmas with family in France.\n \nOnce we \ngot home, at 23.54 we\n \nfinally \nrec\neived an email \nfrom \neasyJet\n \ninforming us of the cancellation of our flight. \n \nOn Thursday 26 December, \nwe\n received a further email with an apology – \ncancellation ‘\ndue to unplanned runway closure\n’\n – and asking for feedback, although there was no link to give this.\nWe would like answers to the following points:\n1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy were there no senior airport staff in evidence in North terminal even though there must have been many senior people in the airport?\n&#xa0;\n2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWh\ny were the toilets in North terminal not working when all the revenue earning shops, restaurants, and arcades were fine?\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy were we routed through South terminal and then a lengthy, confusing and convoluted route back to the North terminal we had left a\n couple of hours earlier?\n&#xa0;\n4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy were we not told formally of the cancellation until we got home?\n&#xa0;\n5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nWhy did it take 3 hours to get our baggage back.\n&#xa0;\n6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUnplanned runway closure as the reason for cancellation does not seem to stack up as Gatwick only has one run\nway and there were numerous flights landing and taking off from South terminal.\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
