defaulthe LGA is advocating a radical new approach

defaultDemocratically elected councillors must be at the heart of any programme of public service reform. Councillors are 
defaultcrucial
default in
default reinvigorating local governance, ensuring strong democratic accountability, and 
defaultleading
default local government to make a difference, deliver and be trusted.

defaultCentral government can learn much from how councils have delivered efficiencies and come together to share services, not just with other councils but with organisations in all areas of public services. However, councils could achieve much more if they were
default freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and the direction of artificial Whitehall silos. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1.
defaultPeople increasingly feel that English democracy is facing a crisis. Disillusionment with politics, frustration over unequal distribution of power in the United Kingdom,
default and low levels
default of trust in central government
default have led us to a place where the current model of public services is unsustainable. However well-intentioned Government reforms might be, it is 
defaultultimately 
defaultlocal leadership that 
defaultcan best deliver economic growth, transformed 
defaultpublic services and a rejuvenated democracy. 
default&#xa0;default3.2.
defaultIn 
defaultRewiring Public Services
default, the
default LGA
default has set out an approach to public service transformation that will give local people a clear say in the important matters that face them and their communities, and a local vote that matters once more. 
defaultThe
default challenges England faces require a different appro
defaultach that reflects the needs of local communities, based on joined-up services, economic 
defaultgrowth 
defaultand a new democratic deal. 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;
default4.1.
defaultCommunity budgets 
defaultlook at the whole system rather than 
defaultindividual
default 
defaultservices; they are rooted in evidence; and they demand new models of investmen
defaultt to set up and sustain the most effective interventions.
default Independent analysis
default for the LGA of the work of the four community budget pilot areas showed that
default,
default if their proposals on health and social care, troubled families and work and skills were implemented across the country
default,
default up to £20 billion could be saved over five years. The four areas expect to see a range of wider benefits. For example Essex is redesig
defaultning its vocational skills such that it will create 
default8,000 additiona
defaultl apprenticeships by 2020, with 
defaulttraining better aligned to current and future vacancies in the area.
default 
default&#xa0;
default4.2.
defaultWhat is clear is the community budget led public service reform agenda offers a much g
defaultreater potential for ensuring better value for money and improved services. It is therefore essential that all Whitehall Departments buy into this approach and make positive moves 
defaultto devolve budgets and responsibility to the local level to enable local pub
defaultlic service providers to bring resources together to deliver more efficient public services with improved outcomes
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.3.
defaultThese findings are supported by an extensive body of evidence from councils, for example through the customer-led transformation programme
default and innovative procurement by councils following the introduction of the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default(b)defaultHow do we ensure open access to public services underdefault defaultalternative forms of ownership, provision and control?default&#xa0;default(c)defaultWhat are the challenges and opportunities in moving power awaydefault defaultfrom Whitehall and into the hands of citizens?default&#xa0;
default5.1.
defaultPublic services in England face 
defaultchallenges which require a 
defaultfundamental
default response at both national and local level. 
defaultS
defaultervices must be transformed through local leadership by rebuilding democratic participation, rewiring public services, and revitalising the economy. The risks of staying the
default same far outweigh those of leading a transformation that ensures public services are effective, efficient and locally responsive.
default&#xa0;
default5.2.
defaultThe role of elected councillors is 
defaultcrucial 
defaultin ensuring communities can access responsive, effective, and accountable 
defaultservices. Local government could do much more to rewire public services and rebuild democratic participation. A fundamental redesign of the national framework of local democracy would ensure decisions about local arrangements are made by people who are acc
defaultountable to local voters. Reinvigorating this democratic relationship will give communities a meaningful say in the delivery of their services, no matter what form those services take.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default(b)defaultHow can public service contracts be designed to enable servicedefault defaultusers to choose from a wider range of providers, includingdefault defaultcommunity-based defaultproviders, to achieve self-defined outcomes?default&#xa0;default(c) defaultWhat impact has the Community Right to Bid, Community Rightdefault defaultto Challenge, and Community Right to Build had on localdefault defaultcommunities?default&#xa0;default6.1.
defaultLocal 
defaultauthorities
default are crucial in delivering the services people value. 
defaultT
defaulthe P
defaultublic Services (Social Value) Act 2012 has added impetus to how councils and other commissioners consider their procurement processes to support a wide range of providers d
defaultepending on the outcomes requ
defaultired by that particular service: 65 per cent of council
defaults have already adapted their processes to take account of the Act. 
default&#xa0;
default6.2.
defaultC
defaultouncils are
default however
default frustrated by 
defaultsome 
defaultnational schemes. 
defaultFor instance,
default 
defaultthe Work Programme should help councils and their partners better support those who are hardest to reach. Despite good intentions, the model was designed, commissioned, implemented and delivered in isolation and at speed, preventing councils and local part
defaultners from offering expertise on client groups. In most cases, it has had the effect of providers operating in isolation from one another and local partners. Critically, the model has not led to successful outcomes for those 
defaultit is meant to help. March 2013 
defaultfigures suggest all Work Programme providers have failed to support Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants, averaging 5.3% aga
defaultinst contracted levels of 16.5%
default.
default June 2013 figures have not improved.
default 
default&#xa0;default6.3.
defaultIf given the freedoms and responsibilities, local 
defaultgovernment can make public services effective, efficient and locally responsive
default,
default through place-based public service budgets. Many
default councils have 
defaultlead the way in opening up service delivery
default in relation to personal budgets
default, for example through
default ‘catalogues’
default, g
defaultuides
default and 
defaulttargeted 
defaultwebsites.
default 
defaultCouncils also work with the users and other stakeholders themsel
defaultves before setting up contracts.

defaultCouncils have a successful

default.
default Community Rights 
defaultare one part of a whole host of relationships, activities, and strategies at play across local government. 
defaultData from government indicates l
defaultevels of interest in the Right to Bid appear high
default.
default Many councils
default are working positively with local community groups 
defaultand parish councils
default to implement the Right effectively
default, for example
default through Swale Borough Council’s ‘Localism Prospectus’.
default defaultAnecdotal evidence of the Rights to Build and Challenge suggests that the uptake of these Rights is much lower
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default6.5.
defaultHowever
default 
defaultt
defaulthe LGA
default has argued 
defaulta 
defaultformal Communi
defaultty Right to Challenge process being
default use
defaultd
default is a sign that local relationships with community groups are
default 
defaultn
defaulto
defaultt working as well as they might be. 
defaultA better
default way to go about the provision of services by parishes or community groups is as
default part of a strong set of local relationships and a good commissioning strategy. 
defaultThe 
defaultuse of legal rights is a last resort to be avoided if at all possible
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthis is because
default 
defaultm
defaultany councils are taking proactive approaches to engage positively with their local 
defaultcommunities, such ‘Speak Out Sutton’
default and Kirklees’ ‘It’s Time to Talk’
default.

defaultCouncils
default recognise the 
defaultimpetus
default of reduc
defaulting
default 
defaultfunding
default 
defaultand increasing demand 
defaultas being an imperative for working together
default.
default Ninety-five per cent of councils now share services, resulting in at least £278 million of efficiency savings.
default Sharing services is business as usual for councils; they are now building on that expertise to deliver more effective outcomes for local commun
defaultities by working across the public, private, and voluntary and community sector.
default 
defaultThe LGA and the National Association for Local Councils (NALC) have also produced a publication illustrating how principal and town and parish councils are working together to
default best meet the needs of their communities.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.2.
defaultThere is nevertheless room for improvement in the way central and local government work together.
default 
defaultThe current model of local government in the context of a highly centralised national state will not serve for m
defaultuch longer. While there are some instances of more joined-up working, for example the Commissioning Academy programme or the Whitehall secondees to the community budgets areas, they are still too few. The LGA is calling for a new framework for public servi
defaultces which is able to be both strategic and locally responsive and which is supported by a more grown-up relationship between local and central government.
default&#xa0;default7.3.
defaultWhitehall’s siloed structures and at times conflicting policy objectives can mean councils find it u
defaultnnecessarily difficult to improve outcomes for local people. This has been seen, for example, in working 
defaultto reduce re-offending
default, where c
defaultouncils are regularly frustrated at a lack of engagement from some Government departments, such as the Department of Hea
defaultlth, which are failing to recognise t
defaultheir key role in reducing crime, for 
defaultexample through its funding of treatment for people with alcohol or drug addictions.
default The LGA is calling for a Crime Reduction Board that would 
defaultallow central government to replicate n
defaultationally the success achieved by councils and their partners, including the police and health services, through 
defaultthe 
defaultinnovative multi
default-agency community budget areas.
default&#xa0;
default7.4.
defaultIt is l
defaultocal government
default, through its democratically elected councillors, that is best placed to lead rewired public services. This is because they are closest to those affected by the decisions they make. A transformed and independent local government can make public services ef
defaultfective, efficient, and locally responsive. 
default&#xa0;
default7.5.
defaultThe LGA proposes that alongside a wide-ranging localisation of public services, remaining national functions be brought together into a single England Office. This would not only reduce bureaucracy and red tape
default but also remove the 
defaultartificial silos that promote duplication, waste, and conflicting policy drivers. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default8.1.
defaultThe LGA 
defaultsuppo
defaultrts councils in their ambitions to find innovative ways to deliver public services. Our Future Councils
default and Creative Councils
default programmes show how councils are taking the lead in innovative public service delivery in everything from 
defaultlooked after children and adult social care to energy supply and work readiness.

defaultCouncils

defaultThe LGA’s 
defaultRewiring Public Services 
defaultcampaign puts choice at the 
defaultheart of our vision for health and social care by proposing “personal wellbeing budgets” to provide choice and control to individuals for the services and support they require to improve their health, wellbeing and independence, enabling people to make cho

defaultCouncillors have the democratic legitimacy to ensure that

defaultSafeguards are 
defaultalso created by improving
default contract and supply chain management
default. The
default 
defaultN
defaultew EU procurement rules will allow 
defaultcouncils
default to take into account relevant skills and experience of consultants and will enable 
defaultcouncils
default to exclude suppliers with a poor track record.
default Taken together these are significant steps towards robust safeguar

default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;default(b)defaultAre there any types of public services that you think should notdefault defaultbe opened up to new defaultmodels of design, delivery or provision?default&#xa0;default11.1.

defaultCommissioners learn best when they are working together on shared challenges. Building in learning support to programmes such as community budgets and Our Place! is important in making sure that best practice is shared within and between sectors. The LGA

defaultWe

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultHowever, it is not simply a matter of taking good practice from one area and replicating it in another. Each area has its own geographical, demographic and political context
default,
default which will be reflected in its commissioning and market 
defaultsupport approaches. Councils, through their elected councillors, are best placed to understand and respond to that context, and to take the lead in public service provision.
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default12.1.
