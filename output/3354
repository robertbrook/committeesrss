[normal]The Local Government 
[normal]Association (LGA) is the national voice of local government.
[normal] 
[normal]We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are a politically-led, cross party organisation which
[normal] 
[normal]works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a 
[normal]strong, credible voice with national government.
[normal] 
[normal]We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.

[normal]T
[normal]he LGA is advocating a radical new approach
[normal] which provides solutions to how we can deliver public services within an ever-tightening fiscal environment. The LGA’s 
[normal]Rewiring Public Services
[normal] is an ambitious programme which would allow local authorities, through greater local autonomy, to 
[normal]help communit
[normal]ies to meet people’s future needs and aspirations and 
[normal]help generate economic growth. 
[normal]2.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Democratically elected councillors must be at the heart of any programme of public service reform. Councillors are 
[normal]crucial
[normal] in
[normal] reinvigorating local governance, ensuring strong democratic accountability, and 
[normal]leading
[normal] local government to make a difference, deliver and be trusted.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]2.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Central government can learn much from how councils have delivered efficiencies and come together to share services, not just with other councils but with organisations in all areas of public services. However, councils could achieve much more if they were
[normal] freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and the direction of artificial Whitehall silos. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]3.1.
[normal]People increasingly feel that English democracy is facing a crisis. Disillusionment with politics, frustration over unequal distribution of power in the United Kingdom,
[normal] and low levels
[normal] of trust in central government
[normal] have led us to a place where the current model of public services is unsustainable. However well-intentioned Government reforms might be, it is 
[normal]ultimately 
[normal]local leadership that 
[normal]can best deliver economic growth, transformed 
[normal]public services and a rejuvenated democracy. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]3.2.
[normal]In 
[normal]Rewiring Public Services
[normal], the
[normal] LGA
[normal] has set out an approach to public service transformation that will give local people a clear say in the important matters that face them and their communities, and a local vote that matters once more. 
[normal]The
[normal] challenges England faces require a different appro
[normal]ach that reflects the needs of local communities, based on joined-up services, economic 
[normal]growth 
[normal]and a new democratic deal. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]4.1.
[normal]Community budgets 
[normal]look at the whole system rather than 
[normal]individual
[normal] 
[normal]services; they are rooted in evidence; and they demand new models of investmen
[normal]t to set up and sustain the most effective interventions.
[normal] Independent analysis
[normal] for the LGA of the work of the four community budget pilot areas showed that
[normal],
[normal] if their proposals on health and social care, troubled families and work and skills were implemented across the country
[normal],
[normal] up to £20 billion could be saved over five years. The four areas expect to see a range of wider benefits. For example Essex is redesig
[normal]ning its vocational skills such that it will create 
[normal]8,000 additiona
[normal]l apprenticeships by 2020, with 
[normal]training better aligned to current and future vacancies in the area.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2.
[normal]What is clear is the community budget led public service reform agenda offers a much g
[normal]reater potential for ensuring better value for money and improved services. It is therefore essential that all Whitehall Departments buy into this approach and make positive moves 
[normal]to devolve budgets and responsibility to the local level to enable local pub
[normal]lic service providers to bring resources together to deliver more efficient public services with improved outcomes
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.3.
[normal]These findings are supported by an extensive body of evidence from councils, for example through the customer-led transformation programme
[normal] and innovative procurement by councils following the introduction of the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold](b)[bold]How do we ensure open access to public services under[bold] [bold]alternative forms of ownership, provision and control?[bold]&#xa0;[bold](c)[bold]What are the challenges and opportunities in moving power away[bold] [bold]from Whitehall and into the hands of citizens?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]5.1.
[normal]Public services in England face 
[normal]challenges which require a 
[normal]fundamental
[normal] response at both national and local level. 
[normal]S
[normal]ervices must be transformed through local leadership by rebuilding democratic participation, rewiring public services, and revitalising the economy. The risks of staying the
[normal] same far outweigh those of leading a transformation that ensures public services are effective, efficient and locally responsive.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]5.2.
[normal]The role of elected councillors is 
[normal]crucial 
[normal]in ensuring communities can access responsive, effective, and accountable 
[normal]services. Local government could do much more to rewire public services and rebuild democratic participation. A fundamental redesign of the national framework of local democracy would ensure decisions about local arrangements are made by people who are acc
[normal]ountable to local voters. Reinvigorating this democratic relationship will give communities a meaningful say in the delivery of their services, no matter what form those services take.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold](b)[bold]How can public service contracts be designed to enable service[bold] [bold]users to choose from a wider range of providers, including[bold] [bold]community-based [bold]providers, to achieve self-defined outcomes?[bold]&#xa0;[bold](c) [bold]What impact has the Community Right to Bid, Community Right[bold] [bold]to Challenge, and Community Right to Build had on local[bold] [bold]communities?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]6.1.
[normal]Local 
[normal]authorities
[normal] are crucial in delivering the services people value. 
[normal]T
[normal]he P
[normal]ublic Services (Social Value) Act 2012 has added impetus to how councils and other commissioners consider their procurement processes to support a wide range of providers d
[normal]epending on the outcomes requ
[normal]ired by that particular service: 65 per cent of council
[normal]s have already adapted their processes to take account of the Act. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.2.
[normal]C
[normal]ouncils are
[normal] however
[normal] frustrated by 
[normal]some 
[normal]national schemes. 
[normal]For instance,
[normal] 
[normal]the Work Programme should help councils and their partners better support those who are hardest to reach. Despite good intentions, the model was designed, commissioned, implemented and delivered in isolation and at speed, preventing councils and local part
[normal]ners from offering expertise on client groups. In most cases, it has had the effect of providers operating in isolation from one another and local partners. Critically, the model has not led to successful outcomes for those 
[normal]it is meant to help. March 2013 
[normal]figures suggest all Work Programme providers have failed to support Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants, averaging 5.3% aga
[normal]inst contracted levels of 16.5%
[normal].
[normal] June 2013 figures have not improved.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.3.
[normal]If given the freedoms and responsibilities, local 
[normal]government can make public services effective, efficient and locally responsive
[normal],
[normal] through place-based public service budgets. Many
[normal] councils have 
[normal]lead the way in opening up service delivery
[normal] in relation to personal budgets
[normal], for example through
[normal] ‘catalogues’
[normal], g
[normal]uides
[normal] and 
[normal]targeted 
[normal]websites.
[normal] 
[normal]Councils also work with the users and other stakeholders themsel
[normal]ves before setting up contracts.
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]or example 
[normal]Central Bed
[normal]fordshire’
[normal]s 
[normal]work 
[normal]on 
[normal]procuring domiciliary c
[normal]are
[normal],
[normal] or the innovative approaches undertaken by the Co-operative Councils 
[normal]N
[normal]etwork. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]6.4.
[normal]Councils have a successful 
[normal]record 
[normal]of working with their communities
[normal].
[normal] Community Rights 
[normal]are one part of a whole host of relationships, activities, and strategies at play across local government. 
[normal]Data from government indicates l
[normal]evels of interest in the Right to Bid appear high
[normal].
[normal] Many councils
[normal] are working positively with local community groups 
[normal]and parish councils
[normal] to implement the Right effectively
[normal], for example
[normal] through Swale Borough Council’s ‘Localism Prospectus’.
[normal] [bold]Anecdotal evidence of the Rights to Build and Challenge suggests that the uptake of these Rights is much lower
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]6.5.
[normal]However
[normal] 
[normal]t
[normal]he LGA
[normal] has argued 
[normal]a 
[normal]formal Communi
[normal]ty Right to Challenge process being
[normal] use
[normal]d
[normal] is a sign that local relationships with community groups are
[normal] 
[normal]n
[normal]o
[normal]t working as well as they might be. 
[normal]A better
[normal] way to go about the provision of services by parishes or community groups is as
[normal] part of a strong set of local relationships and a good commissioning strategy. 
[normal]The 
[normal]use of legal rights is a last resort to be avoided if at all possible
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]T
[normal]his is because
[normal] 
[normal]m
[normal]any councils are taking proactive approaches to engage positively with their local 
[normal]communities, such ‘Speak Out Sutton’
[normal] and Kirklees’ ‘It’s Time to Talk’
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](b)[bold]What impact does the Whitehall federal [bold]department structure[bold] [bold]have on contracting for public services that fall across[bold] [bold]departmental or organisational boundaries?[bold]&#xa0;[bold](c)[bold]How does the Government ensure that public services develop[bold] [bold]the [bold]right kind of leadership as they become more open, more[bold] [bold]subject to scrutiny and more customer-focused?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]7.1.
[normal]Councils
[normal] recognise the 
[normal]impetus
[normal] of reduc
[normal]ing
[normal] 
[normal]funding
[normal] 
[normal]and increasing demand 
[normal]as being an imperative for working together
[normal].
[normal] Ninety-five per cent of councils now share services, resulting in at least £278 million of efficiency savings.
[normal] Sharing services is business as usual for councils; they are now building on that expertise to deliver more effective outcomes for local commun
[normal]ities by working across the public, private, and voluntary and community sector.
[normal] 
[normal]The LGA and the National Association for Local Councils (NALC) have also produced a publication illustrating how principal and town and parish councils are working together to
[normal] best meet the needs of their communities.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.2.
[normal]There is nevertheless room for improvement in the way central and local government work together.
[normal] 
[normal]The current model of local government in the context of a highly centralised national state will not serve for m
[normal]uch longer. While there are some instances of more joined-up working, for example the Commissioning Academy programme or the Whitehall secondees to the community budgets areas, they are still too few. The LGA is calling for a new framework for public servi
[normal]ces which is able to be both strategic and locally responsive and which is supported by a more grown-up relationship between local and central government.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]7.3.
[normal]Whitehall’s siloed structures and at times conflicting policy objectives can mean councils find it u
[normal]nnecessarily difficult to improve outcomes for local people. This has been seen, for example, in working 
[normal]to reduce re-offending
[normal], where c
[normal]ouncils are regularly frustrated at a lack of engagement from some Government departments, such as the Department of Hea
[normal]lth, which are failing to recognise t
[normal]heir key role in reducing crime, for 
[normal]example through its funding of treatment for people with alcohol or drug addictions.
[normal] The LGA is calling for a Crime Reduction Board that would 
[normal]allow central government to replicate n
[normal]ationally the success achieved by councils and their partners, including the police and health services, through 
[normal]the 
[normal]innovative multi
[normal]-agency community budget areas.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.4.
[normal]It is l
[normal]ocal government
[normal], through its democratically elected councillors, that is best placed to lead rewired public services. This is because they are closest to those affected by the decisions they make. A transformed and independent local government can make public services ef
[normal]fective, efficient, and locally responsive. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]7.5.
[normal]The LGA proposes that alongside a wide-ranging localisation of public services, remaining national functions be brought together into a single England Office. This would not only reduce bureaucracy and red tape
[normal] but also remove the 
[normal]artificial silos that promote duplication, waste, and conflicting policy drivers. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]8.1.
[normal]The LGA 
[normal]suppo
[normal]rts councils in their ambitions to find innovative ways to deliver public services. Our Future Councils
[normal] and Creative Councils
[normal] programmes show how councils are taking the lead in innovative public service delivery in everything from 
[normal]looked after children and adult social care to energy supply and work readiness. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](b) [bold]How do we make sure that all citizens are able to influence public services?[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]9.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Councils
[normal] play a crucial role in ensuring that services are delivered in a joined up way that is accountable, maximises efficiencies and provides capacity to support individuals in exercising choice. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The LGA’s 
[normal]Rewiring Public Services 
[normal]campaign puts choice at the 
[normal]heart of our vision for health and social care by proposing “personal wellbeing budgets” to provide choice and control to individuals for the services and support they require to improve their health, wellbeing and independence, enabling people to make cho
[normal]ices that sustain their independence
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]9.3.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]recent 
[normal]announcement of £3.8 billion worth of funding to ensure closer integration between health and social is an opportunity to give 
[normal]some of the most vulnerable people in our society 
[normal]control, placing them at the c
[normal]entre of their own care and support and, in doing so, provid
[normal]ing
[normal] them with a better service and better qualit
[normal]y of life. 
[normal]The LGA is committed to helping councils work with Clinical Commissioning Groups to seize
[normal] this 
[normal]opportunity to do something radically diff
[normal]erent
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]10.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Councillors have the democratic legitimacy to ensure that 
[normal]service providers who fail to deliver services 
[normal]are properly held to 
[normal]accoun
[normal]t. This is because
[normal] they have a key leadership role in localised decision-making and service delivery
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]10.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Safeguards are 
[normal]also created by improving
[normal] contract and supply chain management
[normal]. The
[normal] 
[normal]N
[normal]ew EU procurement rules will allow 
[normal]councils
[normal] to take into account relevant skills and experience of consultants and will enable 
[normal]councils
[normal] to exclude suppliers with a poor track record.
[normal] Taken together these are significant steps towards robust safeguar
[normal]ding mechanisms against poor performance. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold](b)[bold]Are there any types of public services that you think should not[bold] [bold]be opened up to new [bold]models of design, delivery or provision?[bold]&#xa0;[bold]11.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Commissioners learn best when they are working together on shared challenges. Building in learning support to programmes such as community budgets and Our Place! is important in making sure that best practice is shared within and between sectors. The LGA 
[normal]i
[normal]s 
[normal]a champion of sharing learning from areas taking a community budgeting approach. 
[normal]We 
[normal]support the Commissioning Academy which brings together senior commissioners from across different parts of the public sector to build a shared understanding of good prac
[normal]tice in commissioning. 
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]11.2.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]However, it is not simply a matter of taking good practice from one area and replicating it in another. Each area has its own geographical, demographic and political context
[normal],
[normal] which will be reflected in its commissioning and market 
[normal]support approaches. Councils, through their elected councillors, are best placed to understand and respond to that context, and to take the lead in public service provision.
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]12.1.
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]No one service delivery mo
[normal]del will fit all circumstances
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]D
[normal]ecisions about how local services are commissioned should be a matter for individual local authorities to decide.
[normal] 
[normal]Councils also face challenges in committing 
[normal]resources required to develop new model
[normal]s
[normal] of service delivery in a time of severe cuts to local government funding.
[normal] The LGA is supporting councils to explore innovative ways of funding service delivery, for exampl
[normal]e though social investment. We are working with Social Finance to support 
[normal]those
[normal] councils interested in
[normal] 
[normal]developing social impact bonds 
[normal]and other Payment by Results
[normal] 
[normal]based social investments as part of
[normal] the Big Lottery Fund’s
[normal] Commissioning Better Outcomes
[normal] fund
[normal].

[normal] M
[normal]utuals are a good service model when deployed in the right way and the right place by councils that choose to do so
[normal]. Many 
[normal]councils are looking to 
[normal]deliver services through mutuals
[normal], case studies of which are available on the LGA’s website
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]The LGA 
[normal]supports
[normal] 
[normal]councils to explore 
[normal]a range of 
[normal]new models of service delivery
[normal] in a number of ways, including
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]November 2013
[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;
[normal] According to 
[normal]the British Social Attitudes survey 2013, 
[normal]t
[normal]he proportion of people in England who think Scotland gets more than its fair share of public spending has doubled since 2000 to 44%.
[normal] Data
[normal] available at 
[normal]http://www.bsa-30.natcen.ac.uk/read-the-report/devolution/introduction.aspx
[normal] Independent national polling for the LGA shows that 79 per cent of people trust councils to make decisions about the future of local services. Just
[normal] 11 per cent trust central government to do so.
