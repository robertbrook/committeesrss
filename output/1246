[normal]Joint written evidence submitted by [bold]Professor Sue Black, [bold]Dr Jonathan Mendel, and [bold]Dr [bold]Hauke[bold] [bold]Riesch[bold] (WSC003)[bold]&#xa0;[bold]It is widely accepted that w
[normal]omen are
[normal] significantly
[normal] under-represented throughout 
[normal]Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (
[normal]STEM
[normal])
[normal] based subjects
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]From 
[normal]secondary school level
[normal] and onwards what 
[normal]Blickenstaff
[normal] 
[normal](2005) 
[normal]describes as “layers in a sex-based filter”
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]or what the Committee refer
[normal]s
[normal] to as a ‘leaky pipeline
[normal]’,
[normal] 
[normal]systematically and disproportionately 
[normal]remove
[normal]s women from 
[normal]STEM
[normal] subjects
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]In
[normal] direct and stark contrast with this
[normal],
[normal] however, i
[normal]t 
[normal]is well recognised and accepted
[normal] that women 
[normal]predominate
[normal] in forensic science
[normal] 
[normal]in ways 
[normal]that are 
[normal]atypical 
[normal]of the pattern
[normal]s
[normal] seen in
[normal] all
[normal] other
[normal] STEM subjects
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Houck (2009
[normal]) 
[normal]observes
[normal] a situation where “the percentage 
[normal]of females 
[normal](
[normal]on US forensic science degrees
[normal])
[normal] was
[normal] 
[normal]78%
[normal] when
[normal] the average percentage of females for non-forensic science bachelor’s degrees range
[normal]d
[normal] from
[normal] only
[normal] 32% to 47%”.
[normal] 
[normal]Although under-researched, the situation seems to be even more dramatic in
[normal] the
[normal] UK forensic anthropology 
[normal]community
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]For example, 
[normal]in the 10 years that the 
[normal]undergraduate forensic anthropology degree 
[normal]has been offered 
[normal]at Dundee University
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]it 
[normal]has alway
[normal]s 
[normal]attracted
[normal] over 75% female students 
[normal]and 
[normal]in some years
[normal] 
[normal]this has risen to 
[normal]over 90%
[normal] femal
[normal]e representation
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Th
[normal]e
[normal] situation 
[normal]in forensic science 
[normal]has led to the suggestion that 
[normal]the subject
[normal] might be “
[normal]a Gateway for Women in Science
[normal]” (Houck 2009)
[normal] and t
[normal]he unusual demographics 
[normal]displayed 
[normal]in forensic anthropology 
[normal]may 
[normal]offer a
[normal]n even
[normal] more focussed opportuni
[normal]ty to interrogate
[normal] and exploit the potential for
[normal] this unusual pattern as we attempt to understand this 
[normal]well
[normal]-
[normal]recognised, but little understood, 
[normal]reverse gender bias phenomenon
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]That this is an international situation is borne out by the fact that 
[normal]women 
[normal]form
[normal] t
[normal]he majority of
[normal] forensic
[normal] laboratory staff 
[normal]in the US 
[normal](Houck 2009
[normal])
[normal] and in the UK
[normal], the 
[normal]British Association for Forensic Anthropology 
[normal]has confirmed that it 
[normal]currently has 102 female members and only 44 males
[normal] - a ratio of nearly 2.5:1
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Interestingly, 
[normal]despite an i
[normal]ncreasing focus on addressing gender inequalities in S
[normal]TEM (
[normal]for example, as part of the Athena Swan Programme)
[normal], forensic science has been curiously
[normal] overlooked
[normal] as a possible template for a solution
[normal] and
[normal],
[normal] in this, we 
[normal]believe that we may 
[normal]have missed a golden 
[normal]opportunity
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]W
[normal]e do know that f
[normal]orensic anthropology offers 
[normal]clear 
[normal]evidence
[normal] to falsify the common (though weakly-evidenced) claim that under-representation of women in STEM is down to
[normal] lower ‘natural’ ability levels
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]Forensic anthropology 
[normal]is an especially use
[normal]ful 
[normal]and powerful 
[normal]example
[normal],
[normal] as it 
[normal]demands rigorous,
[normal] robust and defensible science that is tested in the adversarial arena of the UK judicial courts on a daily basis.
[normal] 
[normal]A recent audit undertaken by the British Association for Forensic Anthropology showed that
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]of those forens
[normal]ic anthropologists who
[normal] 
[normal]regularly
[normal] defend their science in court, 
[normal]over
[normal] 80% are female
[normal] – suggesting that the ‘leaky pipeline’ has been 
[normal]firmly 
[normal]plugged in this STEM science
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]If women are able to progress notably 
[normal]well
[normal] in one 
[normal]challenging 
[normal]branch of 
[normal]STEM, it becomes harder to argue that there is any intrinsic reason why they cannot do so in others.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]F
[normal]orensic anthropology in the UK 
[normal]may therefore offer
[normal] 
[normal]strong indicators
[normal] for possible solution
[normal]s to the 
[normal]‘leaky pipeline’
[normal] in other STEM subjects
[normal]. I
[normal]t may have s
[normal]ome lessons that could be learned 
[normal]and best practice that could be adopted 
[normal]to 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]reverse
[normal],
[normal] or at least 
[normal]slow down,
[normal] the 
[normal]way this ‘leaky pipeline’ affects 
[normal]women entering, remaining and progressing in STEM subjects
[normal].
