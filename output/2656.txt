[[[About The Children’s Society]]]&#xa0;The Children’s Society supports nearly 50,000 children and young people every year through our specialist services and children’s centres. We believe in achieving a better childhood for every child but have a particular focus on children who have nowhere else to turn, such as children living in poverty, young refugees, children at risk on the streets, disabled children and children in trouble with the law. We seek to give a voice to children and young people and influence policy and practice so they have a better chance in life.&#xa0;We believe that every child has the right to a decent home that their family can afford. We welcome the opportunity to raise our concerns with the committee about the impact that reforms to housing support in the welfare system could have on this.&#xa0;

[[[Introduction]]]&#xa0;This submission focuses on the following three key areas of reform:&#xa0;1. Local Housing Allowance (LHA) reforms2. The household benefit cap3. Localisation of support with housing costs4. Housing support in Universal Credit

[[[&#xa0;]]]Key issues:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[1. Local Housing Allowance (LHA) reforms]]]&#xa0;Housing Benefit for claimants in the private rental sector has gone through a period of radical change:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;As a result of a combination of these changes, if rental prices rise rapidly, prices will increasingly draw away from eligible rents for LHA purposes.&#xa0;

[[[Figure 1: Shortfall between LHA eligible rent (English average]]]

[[[) and actual expected rent 2010-2013]]]

[[[, by size of property]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The losses are greatest for larger families. A low income family with four or more children requiring a four bedroom property  in private rental accommodation can expect to see a shortfall of £24 per week (£1250 per year) as a result of changes to LHA entitlements between 2010 and 2013.&#xa0;For a family in a three bedroom home, between 2010 and 2013, the average eligible rent of a private rental property has fallen by around £8 per week. Over the same period, we would have expected rents to have risen by £6 per week. This would leave a £14 per week shortfall between eligible rents and actual expected rental prices – around £730 per year.&#xa0;This is shown in the table below. Clearly, the change from the 50th to 30th percentile of local rents had a major impact in 2011. However, since then, the gap has continued to widen as a result of LHA rates rising more slowly than private rents.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Figure 2: Eligible rent and expected rent for three bedroom property (English avera]]]

[[[ge) 2010-2013]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;It is notable that the government did not expect changes to LHA entitlement to increase eligible rents with inflation rather than local rents, to create behavioural change, given the costs of moving home.&#xa0;“No behavioural impact is assumed over the forecast period as differences in rents will be small in the early years compared to the transaction costs of moving. The current estimate of the anticipated reduction in benefit expenditure is in the order of £400m in 2014/15 (real terms, 2012/13 prices).”&#xa0;We are concerned that that given the costs of moving home and the lack of availability of affordable private rental properties, many families will reduce disposable income as a consequence of reductions in their LHA payments. This means that money intended to cover the costs of living is needed to cover shortfalls in assistance with housing costs.&#xa0;Given the evidence that private rental prices are increasing faster than Housing Benefit rates, it is unsurprising that it is becoming increasingly common for families to become homeless as a result of Assured Shorthold Tenancies ending and not being renewed.  &#xa0;The table below shows the number of households accepted as being owed a main homelessness duty by their local authority, who lost their last home as a result of the end of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy. The number have nearly tripled since 2010.&#xa0;

[[[Figure 3: households accepted as owed a main homelessness duty by the Local Authority who lost their last home as a result o]]]

[[[f the end of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy: 2010-2013]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;As private sector housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable, access to social housing is also becoming increasingly limited. Numbers of households on social housing waiting lists has increased by more than 800,000 since 1997, including a rise of around 100,000 since 2010 (see figure 4). &#xa0;

[[[Figure 4: Local Authorities’ housing waiting lists 1997-2012]]]&#xa0;It is crucial that the lowest income families are able to afford the cost of their home. We are concerned that for those families on the very lowest incomes the increasing gaps between eligible rents for Housing Benefit and private rents, combined with increasing inaccessibility of social housing are together making housing unaffordable for many families with children. &#xa0;During a recent debate in the House of Lords regarding linking the uprating of local LHA rates to CPI, Lord Freud committed to review the situation if local allowance rates and rents become out of step.

[[[Recommendation 1: The government should commit to a review of the affordability of private rental sector accommodation following reforms to LHA since 2011. ]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[2. The household benefit cap]]]&#xa0;The household benefit cap applies a maximum benefit entitlement of £500 per week for most out of work families with children. Housing Benefit entitlement is reduced in order to reduce household entitlement to this limit.&#xa0;The following table shows how the income of families in private rental housing after the cap is applied, may compare to the poverty line for their household.&#xa0;

For families with 5 or more children, their income after housing costs could be less than 50% of the poverty line.&#xa0;Suggestions have been made that the level of the cap be further reduced – one MP suggested a cap of £17000 (£327 per week). This would reduce disposable incomes after the cap is applied still further. A couple with four or more children could have their disposable income limited to around £91 per week (about £2 per person per day) – with which they would need to cover all of their household needs, including food, clothes, transport and utilities.  This is less than 20% of the income they would need to be lifted out of poverty.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Figure 5. Disposable income after cap applied (out of work couple with average private rental sector rent for a relevant property size, and varying numbers of children) compared to poverty line for each ]]]

[[[household size.]]]&#xa0;The benefit cap is already having severe consequences for households in the private rental sector, including households who succeed in making the move into work.&#xa0;One The Children’s Society family support worker supporting a family affected by the benefit cap told us:&#xa0;“The family have been served a section 21 notice as a result of their inability to pay full rent.&#xa0; They have been awarded a discretionary housing payment however there is still a shortfall.&#xa0; The family is large - 5 children - and have lost £92 pound a week with the introduction of the cap.&#xa0; Since the introduction of the cap mum has got herself a part time job of 16 hours which now means she comes off of the benefit cap and can now reapply for housing benefit to assist.&#xa0; They are still being evicted though as they have already gone into arrears.”&#xa0;We welcome the Government’s assurances that they will monitor the impact of the benefit cap and review it in 2014 following its first year of operation.  &#xa0;

[[[Recommendation 2: Given that around three quarters of those affected by the cap are children, it is particularly important that the review pays specific regard to the impact of the benefit cap on the well-being of children.  It is important that as part of]]]

[[[ this the review considers – ]]]&#xa0;

[[[3. Localisation of support with housing costs]]]&#xa0;Increasingly, support with housing costs is determined on a local, and discretionary basis. Local authorities have been provided with additional funding for Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) to help deal with difficult cases caused by reforms, such as the benefit cap. Additionally, following the abolition of parts of the discretionary Social Fund, local authorities have been allocated resources to introduce local welfare assistance schemes to provide support for families.  &#xa0;

[[[i. Discretionary Housing Payments ]]]&#xa0;In 2010/11 £20 million was available to local authorities for DHP, this was increased to £30 million in 2011/2012 and £60 m illion in 2012/2013.  The 2013/14 allocation included an additional £30 million and £65 million to address the social rented sector size criteria and the benefit cap respectively, as well as £5 million to support the most sparsely populated areas. In 2014/15 The DHP pot available will be £125 million.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Figure 6: Discretionary Housing Payment funding (Great Britain) 2010-2015]]]&#xa0;Clearly, local authorities have been given considerably more scope to address families housing needs on a local basis. The challenge is to ensure that this support gets to those families who need this most.

[[[ii. The introduction of local welfare assistance schemes]]]From April 2013, crisis loans for living expenses and community care grants were abolished. Instead, funding was provided for local authority administered welfare assistance schemes.Our recent report Nowhere to turn examined the local emergency and community support now available through local welfare assistance schemes. We found that the vast majority of the schemes are providing support for similar needs that were covered by crisis loans and community care grants. &#xa0;A significant exception is that some schemes have stated that they will not be providing rent in advance. For example, Medway council states that their local welfare provision is scheme is “not a rent deposit scheme or a rent in advance scheme” and Buckingham council’s scheme also states it does not provide this support.&#xa0;We are concerned that the areas where local welfare schemes do not provide support for rent in advance, families will find it more difficult to access permanent housing and this could lead to increased homelessness. Research from Crisis found that 69% of housing advisors who work in private rented housing access schemes have used crisis loans to fund rent in advance. As one housing adviser who responded to the Crisis survey said: “Crisis loans are absolutely vital in enabling clients to source rent in advance”. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Recommendation 4: Local w]]]

[[[elfare assistance schemes should make provision for rent in advance.]]]&#xa0;Our Nowhere to turn report also found that the majority of local schemes had some form of residency or local connection entitlement criteria. Around half of schemes indicated that the claimant needed to be resident within the borough. In three stricter cases claimants had to have been resident for at least a year before they could apply for help.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Figure 7: Local welfare assistance eligibility – residency criteria]]]&#xa0;Reforms to housing benefit in both the private and social rented sectors are likely to lead to more low income households moving home and area. Our concern is that families will not be eligible for support through local welfare assistance schemes if they have to move to areas with strict residency criteria. Only a small number of local welfare assistance schemes allowed claimants to apply for assistance if they were moving into the area or if they had a local connection, such as family living there. &#xa0;Some schemes had exceptions to residency criteria such as families fleeing domestic violence, care leavers housed outside the local area or homeless households, but this was not universal.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[4. Housing support in Universal Credit]]]&#xa0;Support with housing costs is radically changing as a result of the introduction of Universal Credit. Help with housing costs is rolled into the provision of other support. This will mean that a significant additional cohort of middle income renting families will receive support with housing costs.&#xa0;For example, a single parent family with two children and with eligible rent of £100 per week would stop being entitled to Housing Benefit when the parent earned £395 per week (£20500 per year) or more. Under Universal Credit, they will continue to be entitled to receive some help with their rental costs with an income of up to around £655 per week (£34000 per year).&#xa0;The introduction of Universal Credit will raise a number of challenges made all the more important as a result of the increased cohort of claimants receiving help with their housing costs. This section will consider three issues in particular: 

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[i. Variations in work allowances by levels of housing cost]]]&#xa0;It has always been intended that under Universal Credit, households would have different levels of work allowances depending on whether they have housing costs. &#xa0;However, initally, DWP stated there would be different levels of allowance for households with and without housing costs, with the level of "maximum" allowance reduced by 1.5 x the level of housing costs claimed, until it reached a "minimum" level.&#xa0;So, for example, the "maximum" allowance for a lone parent with two children would be £8,800 per year, and the minimum would be £3,150.&#xa0;However, UC regulations now provide for only a maximum level of work allowance (for households without housing costs), and a minimum level (for those with housing costs). We are concerned this measure actually makes the system considerably more complicated, since households with low levels of housing costs in receipt of UC would have to make a determination of whether they would be better off claiming for help with housing costs but receiving a reduced earnings disregard, or making no claim for help with housing costs. For example:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Recommendation 7: There should be a minimum and maximum level of disregard, with the maximum reduced by 1.5 x the rate of housing costs until they reach the minimum d]]]

[[[isregard.]]]

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[ii. Housing costs for owner-occupiers]]]As with the current system, Universal Credit makes some provision for help with housing costs for home owners. We are very concerned by the "zero earnings rule" to be introduced within the Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) regulations which mean that SMI can only be applied where the household is undertaking no paid work.  This is considerably less generous than the current system where the attachment of SMI to out of work income replacement benefits means that households may receive support on working up to 16, or in some cases 24, hours per week.&#xa0;The regulations note that for those attempting part-time work, the removal of SMI will "in part be compensated by the operation of the full disregard".  However, for households undertaking very small amounts of paid work this compensation will be extremely limited, or non-existent.&#xa0;Many parents attempt part time work to keep labour market skills up to date and as a route back into long term employment, for example, parents who are disabled and are considering making a move back into work.&#xa0;This new rule risks creating great complexity in accepting money for any period of employment, and creates an enormous “cliff edge” of entitlement.  In the worst cases, claimants may find that they lose very significant amounts of money as a result of taking on a couple of hours of work, and as a result losing their SMI entitlement.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[Recommendation 8: Households earning up to the level of their maximum earnings disregard s]]]

[[[hould be entitled to receive SMI payments as part of their Universal Credit claim]]]

[[[.  ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[iii. Direct payment to tenants]]]&#xa0;Under Universal Credit, payments for housing costs will normally be paid directly to the tenant (rather than to the landlord). This will be a significant change for many households living in the social rented sector who currently have payments made to their landlord.The government believes this will promote financial capability and independence. However, we are concerned that some families with children may struggle to manage their rental payments.&#xa0;One survey found that 86% of social tenants believe “strongly” that it is better for housing benefit to be paid direct to the landlord and 35% were not confident that they can keep up rental payments if they receive their rent direct.&#xa0;&#xa0;The direct payments demonstration project has been established in six areas across Britain. In May, 17% of the total claimants had had their payments switched back to their landlord.Additionally, concerns have been raised in the project review that the outcomes achieved within the pilot areas required resource intensive interventions and may not be scalable following the roll out of Universal Credit.&#xa0;The government do acknowledge that some households will require alternative payment arrangements (APAs) for payment of housing costs. The current guidance on the application of APAs specifies two tiers of problem which would indicate claimants that are “highly likely” and those that are “less likely” to require alternative payments.

If it then becomes apparent that local allowance rates and rents are out of step, they can (during the debate this was later changed to “will”) be reconsidered.” Following the introduction of Universal Credit, overall Universal Credit entitlement will be reduced since Housing Benefit will no longer exist as a separate entitlement.
