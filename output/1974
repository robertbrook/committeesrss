[normal]3.3
[normal]              
[normal]API members build 
[normal]4000 playgrounds
[normal] and play 
[normal]space
[normal]s annually and 
[normal]bid 
[normal]for hundreds of local authority contracts every year
[normal].  A
[normal]ccording 
[normal]to its membership, 
[normal]poor practice 
[normal]in local authority playground procurement 
[normal]is rif
[normal]e.  As a result, the API believes that c
[normal]urrent 
[normal]public sector 
[normal]procurement practice 
[normal]is failing to 
[normal]deliver valu
[normal]e for money to the public purse.  This is the reason the API is submitting evidence.   
[normal]  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.0[bold]              [bold]Factual information[bold]4.1
[normal]              
[normal]API 
[normal]members 
[normal]report that they are 
[normal]spend
[normal]ing
[normal] increasingly more time on long, drawn-out tenders that are
[normal] no
[normal]t fit for purpose
[normal].  P
[normal]lay
[normal] spaces and play
[normal]grounds are
[normal] no
[normal]t commodities like paper clips
[normal] – they are 
[normal]designed by 
[normal]e
[normal]xperts and should be bespoke according to locality, the communities they serve, and the outcomes delivered to children.  Yet time after time, the 
[normal]procurement 
[normal]process is reduced to over-simplistic box-ticking.  Tighter, more streamlined practices would reduce costs for local aut
[normal]horities and contractors alike.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]4.2
[normal]              
[normal]API members regularly report tenders 
[normal]inviting
[normal] submissions from over ten contractors.  While competition is healthy, the value for money represented is
[normal] not c
[normal]lear.  One recent County Council tender for basic outdoor play equipment invited eight contractors to apply, each required to complete seven separate submission documents. 
[normal]4.3
[normal]              
[normal]This is 
[normal]just one example of a local authority going through a procurement process for the sake of going through the process.  The 
[normal]notion 
[normal]that inviting large numbers of contractors to bid for work delivers value for money is 
[normal]false
[normal].  The resources used by 
[normal]play 
[normal]contractors on these wasteful processes would be better spent developing the next generation of innovative play equipment, particularly 
[normal]at a time when 
[normal]barriers to 
[normal]active 
[normal]play are rising.  No tender should invite more than three bidders to take part, then those taking part can focus on delivering the very best submission possible with ge
[normal]nuine value for money built in.
[normal]4.4
[normal]              
[normal]The API argues that this 
[normal]flawed procurement culture 
[normal]actually 
[normal]devalues play
[normal] by encouraging
[normal] less reputable companies to take part.  
[normal]While p
[normal]roducts on a drawing can look alike
[normal], 
[normal]cut-price operators cut corners on quality, standards
[normal], materials and safety 
[normal]to deliver cheaper deals.  
[normal]The rationale 
[normal]for the original tender – the 
[normal]provision of 
[normal]high quality play spaces that meet local need - is 
[normal]then 
[normal]obscured.  
[normal]4.5
[normal]              
[normal]The API believes that 
[normal]playground procurement
[normal] tenders should:
[normal]4.6
[normal]              
[normal]One 
[normal]grey area of playground procurement is the role of children.  
[normal]The API 
[normal]wholeheartedly support
[normal]s
[normal] their involvement from the earliest stages
[normal] but believes that the 
[normal]delegati
[normal]o
[normal]n 
[normal]of 
[normal]the role of 
[normal]ultimate 
[normal]decision-maker to children is an abdication of responsibility and accountability
[normal] by local authorities
[normal].  
[normal]Asking 
[normal]child
[normal]ren
[normal] what they want in a 
[normal]playground will usually result in them choosing a 
[normal]swing, slide and roundabout
[normal] because those are the pieces of play equipment that tend to come to mind instantly and that they are likely to be using currently.  By asking children what kind of 
[normal]experiences
[normal] 
[normal]they would like to have 
[normal]in a playground, they will give a quite different and more imaginative 
[normal]response. 
[normal]4.7
[normal]              
[normal]The API is currently sourcing examples of local authority playground procurement best practice, sourced from amongst its membership.  The Association will be happy to share these findings with the Committee.
