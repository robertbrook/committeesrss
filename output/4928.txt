[[[ the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FDC19)]]]1.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) believes that the 

[[[current devolutionary settlement can be best described as an improvement on having no city government whatsoever, but still incomplete and unsatisfactory.]]]2.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The business environment in London can be improved if local government is given a stake in economic growth through greater fiscal devolution.  We recommend:3.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Additional funds raised through the retention of existing taxes should be off-set by a commensurate reduction in the overall central government grant to the GLA, so that any fiscal devolution to London will not negatively impact on the grant received by any other UK city or region. 4.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; LCCIis the capital’s largest and most representative business organisation with 2,500 member companies from across Greater London. LCCI membership ranges from small- and medium-sized enterprises through to multi-national corporates. LCCI member companies operate within a mix of sectors, across the Greater London area, genuinely reflecting the broad London business spectrum. 5.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; Given the location of our membership base in London, this submission will only refer to the prospect of greater fiscal devolution to the capital. We will mainly respond on the ‘details’ of devolution rather than the ‘concept’, since the institutions and geography of London governance are already understood. 6.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; However, there is no reason why the principles for additional fiscal powers for the capital could not be replicated to other UK cities; indeed,

[[[.]]]7.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The creation of the GLA as a strategic authority, the office of the Mayor of London and a 25 member Assembly with scrutiny powers in 1999 has been overwhelmingly positive for London, Londoners and London businesses. Successive Mayors have championed London in Whitehall for a better financial settlement and around the world in the search for foreign direct investment. The GLA has been invaluable in highlighting where deficiencies exist in London’s services and infrastructure, and how these could be hampering its competitiveness. 8.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; While the ability to identify challenges, forecast increased demand and scope potential remedies has been useful, it is regrettable that the GLA and London LAs remain powerless to act in the strategic interests of the capital. This inability stems from the fact the GLA and London local government have little control over their revenues and are dependent on a grant from central government that is unpredictable and often set without consultation. 9.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; The lack of ownership over revenue streams results in two deficiencies in London governance that hinder economic growth:10.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[Until ]]]

[[[these two issues are]]]

[[[ addressed, London’s current devolutionary settlement should be considered incomplete and unsatisfactory.]]]11.&#xa0;&#xa0; Until April 2013, there was no financial incentive for London government to encourage economic growth as they were unable to retain any growth in business rate yields. This means that local government policymakers are actively disincentivised from making decisions that will improve the business environment if it comes into conflict with other interest groups that are able to vote in local elections.12.&#xa0;&#xa0; Even after the Local Government Finance Act (2012) introduced the Business Rate Retention Scheme (BRRS), councils only benefit if they permit new forms of physical growth in their area, placing LAs (where there is little physical space to grow) at a disadvantage. The decision to exclude increases in rateable value from the BRRS means that councils have no financial incentive to improve the economic viability of their area through improving community safety or investing in infrastructure or the public realm. 

[[[Even after reform, ]]]

[[[council incentives continue to be institutionally separated ]]]

[[[from the needs of business.]]] 13.&#xa0;&#xa0; This was demonstrated by the LCCI report Driving Local Growth: The Business Case, in which  businesses were asked what should be the top priority for their local council and the top three responses were “investing in local infrastructure” (62% of respondents), “improving community safety” (40%) and maintaining the built environment (35%).14.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[The same report found that just 12% of London businesses felt]]]

[[[ that]]]

[[[ their local council was aware of their needs as a business]]]. If London LAs (and the GLA) were given a stake in the success of their local businesses through ownership and retention of 100% of business rates, it is likely that engagement with the business community would improve, confidence in the local council would increase and more decisions made by local government would be positive for the local economy rather than directed at the interests of a small group of residents. Retaining and spending the taxes that most pay locally would improve accountability and transparency, remove complication and add no significant costs to the collection process.15.&#xa0;&#xa0; The dependence of the GLA and London LAs on an unpredictable central government grant means that they are unable to raise the finance necessary to deliver the improvements in infrastructure and public services because they are stripped of the ability to plan for the future. Moreover, restrictions on borrowing beyond the existing prudential borrowing code prevent the GLA and London LAs from independently financing major infrastructure projects, leaving them reliant on the cooperation of HMT.16.&#xa0;&#xa0; An example of where this arrangement has severely hindered essential infrastructure investment is Crossrail. Proposals for a new link on the rough axis of the current design can be found in the Abercrombie plans for London of the 1940s. The earliest mention of the term “Crossrail” in LCCI archives is found in a policy paper from 1973. The term then appears in the London Rail Study of 1974 and the Central London Rail Study of 1989. A parliamentary bill to build the line fell at Committee Stage in the early 1990s. A Hybrid Bill was introduced to Parliament in 2005, receiving Royal Assent in 2008. Construction work began in mid-2009 but the project was still at risk of being cancelled during the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR). It is now anticipated that the first trains will run on the line by 2018.

[[[.]]]17.&#xa0;&#xa0; There are also relevant international comparisons to be made between how the enhanced fiscal powers of London’s competitors have enabled better infrastructure planning and delivery: 18.&#xa0;&#xa0; Paris is not alone in the degree of its fiscal independence: 37% of Madrid’s income is dependent on central government grant, falling to 30.9% in New York, 25.5% in Berlin and 7.7% in Tokyo. 

[[[London, with 73.9% of its income dependent on central government, is an]]]

[[[ extreme]]]

[[[ outlier.]]]19.&#xa0;&#xa0; London will have 1.6m extra residents by 2030 and over half a million new jobs, yet its ageing infrastructure is already struggling to cope with current population demands, be it a shortage of affordable homes, overcrowded trains or slow broadband connections. London cannot afford delay in delivering the vital infrastructure projects to ensure that the projected economic and demographic growth is sustainable. 20.&#xa0;&#xa0; The efficient and cost-effective delivery of infrastructure can only be achieved if there is a known and credible pipeline of projects where finance has been guaranteed. The delivery of this infrastructure will create jobs and distribute prosperity well beyond the GLA area – 62% of businesses that won contracts for the construction of Crossrail are located outside of London.

[[[)]]]

[[[ collected within the GLA area]]]

[[[.]]] Property taxes are the most appropriate for devolution. The supply of property and land is slow to change, and this immobility creates a steady stream of revenue from the taxes collected.  Furthermore, in many cases, LAs are already responsible for collecting them.22.&#xa0;&#xa0; By devolving all property taxes rather than just one element of them will remove the potential distorted incentives to prioritise one type of development over another. If only Council Tax was devolved, for example, it could lead to the prioritisation of housing over other types of commercial development.23.&#xa0;&#xa0; 

[[[If fully devolved, it is estimated that]]]

[[[ property taxes could fund 50% of all current GLA and local council services]]] and would replace the reliance on the ever fluctuating central government grant. This allows London government greater certainty over future income, enabling the timely and cost-effective delivery of infrastructure projects as well as providing the incentives to create a more competitive business environment in order to grow total tax yields.24.&#xa0;&#xa0; The full devolution of all property taxes opens up the possibility of the GLA, or even London LAs, being able to determine the rate, thresholds and exemptions of each. This could cause uncertainty for businesses; without adequate safeguards, it is entirely possible that some local councils would look to “shake down” local businesses to increase their own revenue streams. Moreover, businesses with multiple premises across in England and Wales might face the added complexity of paying different multipliers for different sites.25.&#xa0;&#xa0; However, on balance, and with the right safeguards and consultation with the business community,

[[[ ]]]for the following reasons:&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;26.&#xa0;&#xa0; Key to delivering efficient and cost-effective infrastructure projects is the ability to secure sustainable finance in advance. If the GLA and London LAs were able to retain property taxes and had a stake in creating the conditions to accelerate economic growth, it would make sense to allow them to borrow against future projected growth in the tax receipts from those investments.

[[[ no further restrictions on their ability to borrow should be applied.]]]28.&#xa0;&#xa0; One of the greatest infrastructure needs for the capital over the coming years is providing enough affordable homes for working Londoners. By allowing the GLA and London LAs to retain property taxes, there will be a certain stream of funding to enable strategic investment to augment London’s housing stock.
