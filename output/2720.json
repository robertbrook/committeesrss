"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Supplementary written evidence from RMT (TIC 091A)&#xa0;Bus services in rural areas&#xa0;Key points&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n1.0&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDeregulated bus market and isolated communities – First Devon &amp; Cornwall&#xa0;1.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nFirst Devon &amp; Cornwall announced on 18\nth\n September\n that they planned to withdraw 6 bus services serving communities living around Plymouth which would leave many communities, particularly elderly residents\n, young people and people with disabilities\n, isolated and without any access to public transport.\n&#xa0;\n1.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nTh\nis follows First Devon and Cornwall’s closure of its depot in Barnstaple in July 2013 and an end to all bus routes in North Devon, massively impacting on people, particularly pensioners and young people, living in this area of the South West.\n&#xa0;\n1.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn Cornwall,\n the company announced\n on 20\nth\n September their plans to reduce and cut routes between Truro, Camborne and Falmouth, cutting vital transport links between isolated communities and major towns and cities in the county.\n&#xa0;\n1.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nBetween 2011-12 and 2012-13, First \nGroup cut 500 jobs from their UK bus operations. Whilst these jobs were predominantly in London, a minority were in Devon and Cornwall, more job losses are expected and the social and economic impact on isolated communities will be significant.\n&#xa0;\n2.0               Targeting the deregulated bus market for profit&#xa0;The UK’s de-regul\nated bus market has an estimated annual value of £4 billion. \nThe chart at \n2\n.1\n below\n illustrates the market share between bus companies:\n              \n2.1\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nUK deregulated bus market share\n2.2\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe second largest operator in the de-regulated bus market, First Group announced pre-tax profits \nof\n £90.7m operating profit from UK buses in 2012-13, contributing to £335m\n (27%)\n in total operating profits for \nthe \ncompany as a whole. \n&#xa0;\n2.3\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nDespite this overall\n profitability, less profitable operations, particularly those serving remote areas such as First Devon and Cornwall have had jobs, routes, services and vehicles repeatedly cut in recent years.\n&#xa0;\n2.4\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nAccording to TAS Partnership research\n, in 2011-12 three of t\nhe ten least profitable services were deregulated First operations (including First Devon and Cornwall) whilst the company also operated three deregulated bus services that recorded \noperating profits in excess of 15%, in \nLeicester (17.3%), Bristol (17.7%) \nand West Yorkshire (18.7%).\n&#xa0;\n2.5\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nLocal authority cuts are also having an impact on access to bus services in isolated communities.  RMT note that isolated communities in the \nSouth West of England\n are \nbeing hit\n particularly\n hard by these cuts, with Cornwall County Council alone slas\nh\ning £500,000 from the\n2013-14 budget for bus \ntransport\n. This has resulted in \nlocal operators\n, such as \nWestern Greyhound cutting services across\n \nCornwall\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.6\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe effect of these cuts in Cornwall wil\nl have a knock on effect on \nthe integration of\n public transport. B\nus services from isolated communities to Bodmin \nand Truro are being lost, so \nlinks \nto the national rail network are \ncut\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.7\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRMT is concerned at the strategy adopted by some of the big 5 transp\nort \ncompanies in \nthe de-regulated bus market and the impact that \nit\n will have in isolated communities across the UK. For example, First Group’s latest annual report states that the c\nompany \nis\n reforming \nits \nbusiness model on UK buses to increase passenger n\numbers through ‘tailored local solutions.’ \n&#xa0;\n2.8\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nConsidering this point alongside First’s withdrawal from the regulated London bus market, this can only mean th\nat the company will only focus o\nn urban operations in relatively sparsely populated areas of the \ncountry, such as the South West of England. As noted above, the company strategy is clear – cuts to services, routes and jobs to maximise profit.\n We believe that this will have a disproportionate effect on passengers in rural communities.\n&#xa0;\n2.9\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition, \nGo-Ahead has a target of £100m operating profit by 2015-16 from its UK bus operations. In 2012-13, Go-Ahead recorded total operating profits of £102.5m\n, 37% of which came from the deregulated bus market, only 2.3% less than the £40m operating profits from \nthe regulated bus market in London. This is significant, as Go-Ahead only has a 7% share of the deregulated market but 22% of the regulated London bus market.\n&#xa0;\n2.10\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn its latest annual report, Go-Ahead state that they will be seeking to achieve their £100m ope\nrating profit from bus services by 2015-16 through growth in passenger revenue from the deregulated bus market. The company is seeking annual growth of 3.5% in deregulated areas, compared to 2.5% annual growth in London (regulated).\n&#xa0;\n2.11\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe biggest operator o\nf deregulated bus services in the UK, Stagecoach has 22% of the market. Deregulated bus services in 2012-13 accounted for over 64% (£165m) of Stagecoach’s total operating profits for the year (£256.3m). \n&#xa0;\n2.12\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nRMT believe that this makes\n Stagecoach\n bus services\n \nin isolated rural areas \nvulnerable to cuts. Research by the TAS Partnership\n revealed\n that Stagecoach account for seven out of the top ten most profitable bus operations in the UK – none of these \noperations are in\n isolated \nregions\n.\n&#xa0;\n2.13\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIn addition\n and in conclusion\n, Stagecoach \noperates two of the least profitable bus operations, Orkney Coaches Ltd and Highland Country Buses Ltd having recently bought them from local operators. These services almost exclusively serve isolated communities and \nsupport\n RMT’s view\n that the deregulated bus market does not operate in the interests of \npassengers or workers, especially those\n living in isolated communities.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \nhttp://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Communities-cut-Plymouth-bus-routes-axed/story-19808328-detail/story.html\n \n \nhttp://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Savage-cuts-bus-services-affect-elderly-Devon/story-19821062-detail/story.html#axzz2fpLAXW9f\n; \nhttp://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/bus-services-cut-union-warns-domino-effect/story-19839944-detail/story.html#axzz2fz5nZamc\n \n Source: Pg 21, Go-Ahead Annual Report and Accounts 2013.\n \nBus Industry Monitor – 2013 Performance \nAugust 2013\n \nhttp://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/bus-services-cut-union-warns-domino-effect/story-19839944-detail/story.html#axzz2fz5nZamc\n \nBus Industry Monitor – 2013 Performance \nAugust 2013\n"
