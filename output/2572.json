"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Terry James [OLS0050]&#xa0;Having been brought up in a Christian household and taught Christian values and principals as set out in the Holy Bible from a child, it is of great concern to me that there is not more protection for young people today from the extremely harmful effects o\nf \nonline pornography.\nIt is equalling distressing to hear of the \nongoing abuse of children being used to create pornographic images.\nIt is the parentâ€™s responsibility to protect their children from any type of danger be it physical or moral but is also the\n responsibility of the government to use its powers to take steps to enforce this \nprotection\n.\nIf a child by any means has gained access to unsuitable material then \nthat is a \nsad \nfailure on the part of the parents, the government and the internet providers.\n \nIf everybody \nshoulders \ntheir bit of responsibility our children can be protected and must be protected. \nAs for the ongoing use of the internet for child abuse and pornography, this is an evil that cannot be tolerated. \nThe government has powers \nit can us\ne to fight this terrible activity. Action must be taken to protect these innocent children from exploitation.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
