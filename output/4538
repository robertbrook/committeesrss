defaultAFS0030defaultWritten evidence submitted by Graham E ConwaydefaultThe news is again highlighting the expensive failure of 
defaultFree
default 
defaultSchools
default (Â£6.6 m. each to set) and Academies, under this Government, having departed from the initial intention to bring failing schools under control, before returning them to local authority control
default.
default&#xa0;
defaultCurrently Academy status
default&#xa0;
defaultsimply means privatisation by the b
defaultack door, for profit, resulting in sub-standard teaching by un- or under-qualified staff. 
defaultWe are a long way from when the overriding mantra of the Government was
default "Education, Education, Education"
default&#xa0;
defaultand no Party is
default highlighting the shortcomings of these Acade
defaultmies at every opportunity and putting forward policies regarding how we will modify the sub-standard teaching post 2015.
default&#xa0;
defaultI speak from some experience; I was head of an 
defaultIndependent
default 
defaultSchool
default for over 15 years before retiring, caring in the main for forces fa
defaultmilies' children. Not only were we subject to regular
default&#xa0;
defaultOfsted inspections, but were regularly inspected by MoD education officials and had to come up to the standard expected by my professional organisation - i.e. HMC etc.
default&#xa0;
defaultMy daughter has been employed fo
defaultr three years by a nearby Academy (for her sake I will not name it - suffice it to say it comes from
default&#xa0;
defaultone of the 'better' Companies, 
defaultand she is 
defaultnow concluding 
defaultthe
default first term of her NQT year. Nevertheless, throughout this time she has been employed, unsuperv
defaultised in the main, on a standard teaching timetable, responsible for exam classes. After Christmas, due to staff vacancies and maternity leave, she will effectively be head of her subject department. The only others in the section have NO teaching qualifica
defaulttions, one isn't even a graduate, nor are training for such.
default&#xa0;
defaultLast week alone, in the same School, two members of staff walked out after being humiliated by the Head in front of their students. All Geography and History classes have, since the start of th
defaulte year, been covered - not by supply staff but by other staff on 'free' periods. No work set, of course, there's no-one employed to set it!
default&#xa0;
defaultThis is just one example of what I suspect is happening in many so-called Academies around the Country, which are 
defaultputting profits first to the continuing 
defaultdetriment of students' education and future careers. Gove continues with the fallacy that workplace experience is more important that teaching qualifications. [It's a good job the same 
defaultcriterion is
default not used in pickin
defaultg MPs and the Cabinet.] Is the Labour front bench too embarrassed by its own background to stand up for qualified teachers against this hyped-up 
defaultGovian
default fallacy?
default&#xa0;
defaultOf course, this is the old 
defaultThatcherite
default Tories all over - privatise everything - put their sup
defaultporting business interests
default&#xa0;
default and their profits first; but why, oh why 
defaultis 
defaultthis disgraceful policy and Government 
defaultnor being more carefully scrutinised, failure to do so allowing the Government to
default get away with it?
default&#xa0;
defaultI know there's a cost of living crisis but 
defaultCameron isn't ever going to answer one of Ed
default 
defaultMilliband
default's
default questions on Wednesday lunchtime if he carries on asking about it until 
defaultDomesday
default. 
defaultSomeone needs to take him to task 
defaulton education, highlight what is being done to the lives and futures of our children
default all over the country to support Gove's misguided experiment in education.
