"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from London \nTravelWatch\n and Passenger Focus (SLC 005)\n1.  London \nTravelWatch\n and Passenger Focus are the official consumer watchdogs for users of the main line, metro, light rail and tram networks in \nEngland\n and \nWales\n, and of the main line railways in \nScotland\n.    In 2011/12 about 2.8 billion passenger trips \nwere made on these systems.\n2.  Both organisations are members of the Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety (PACTS) and are represented on its Rail Safety Working Group, which proposed this topic.  We are therefore pleased that the Select Co\nmmittee has chosen it as a topic for an inquiry.\n3.  Our evidence below relates solely to the main line railways operated by Network Rail.  There are comparatively few level crossings on the other rail systems within our remit, and most of these are on tra\nmways which operate mainly on line of sight (i.e. without signals), in some cases on-street, and present a different profile of risk.\n4.  The paper comprises an introductory note on the level and pattern of risk presented by level crossings, followed by a \ncomment in reply to each of the questions listed by the Committee.  It concludes with some suggested recommendations.\n&#xa0;Level crossing risk in context&#xa0;5.  Risk on the rail network is measured in terms of fatalities and weighted injuries (FWI), a composite \nstatistic which applies weightings to injuries of varying severity in order to equate these to fatalities.  For details of the methodology, see table 1 in RSSB (formerly the Rail Safety &amp; Standards Board)’s \nAnnual Safety Performance Report 2012/13\n, \nfrom wh\nich\n \nmost of the other data cited in this note are drawn.\n&#xa0;\n6.  The industry’s risk profile is continuously updated by RSSB by means of the safety risk model, which is derived from the data captured by the industry-wide safety management information system (\nSMIS) in which all rail operators are required by their licences to participate.  Risk presented by \ntrespassers, suicides and suspected suicides is\n excluded from the following statistics.\n&#xa0;\n7.  The model shows that the total current annual FWI rate associat\ned with level crossings is 10.7, of which all but 1.1 is represented by fatalities.  Of the total, 9.5 is risk to members of the public, 1.0 is to passengers and 0.2 is to members of the railway workforce.\n&#xa0;\n8.  Most of the risk arises from individuals bein\ng struck by trains while using crossings (6.6), followed by road vehicles being struck by trains (3.2), with much lesser amounts associated with slips/trips/falls (0.5) or individuals being struck by road vehicles or crossing equipment  (0.1). \n&#xa0;ANNUAL LEVEL CROSSING RISK (FATALITIES + WEIGHTED

terms of the three categories of people \nexposed to it, it represents only 2% of the risk faced by passengers and \n1% of that faced by the workforce, but 71% of that faced by non-trespassing members of the public (who in this context are mainly road and path users).\n&#xa0;\n10.  \nData collected by the Eur\nopean Rail Agency (ERA) relate only to fatalities and to accidents involving moving trains, and are normalised \nby train kilometres run.  \nBy this more restricted definition, Britain has the lowest level of risk of any of the European Economic Area member st\nates which have railways (i.e. excluding Cyprus, Iceland and Malta), with an average during 2009-11 of 19 level crossing fatalities per billion train kilometres, compared with an EEA average of 260 [see ERA’s \nIntermediate report on the development of railw\nay safety in the European Union 2013\n].  Care should be taken in making such comparisons, because the level of risk is heavily dependent on the density and type of crossings on the network, and the volume and speed of both rail and road (or foot) traffic ov\ner them.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging that \nBritain\n’s crossing safety performance appears to bear comparison well with other similar rail systems.\n&#xa0;\n11.  Since most casualties occurring at level crossings are suffered by pedestrians, cyclists or the occu\npants of road vehicles, it is arguable that level crossing risk is best considered in the context of the overall safety of travel by road (or on footpaths), rather than by rail.  In the past decade, about 0.2% of fatalities suffered by road vehicle users h\nave occurred at level crossings, but in the case of cyclists, motor cyclists and pedestrians, this proportion rises to about 0.5%.  When weighted to reflect the distances travelled by each mode (i.e. per billion passenger/ pedestrian kilometres), the risk \nto other road/path users is about 50 times greater than to vehicle users [data derived from the Department for Transport’s \nTransport Statistics Great Britain 2012\n].\n&#xa0;\n12.  In the light of these statistics, it could be argued that for most road and rail user\ns, level crossing risk is minimal, and resources expended on mitigating it further would deliver greater returns if they were directed elsewhere.  But a number of points should be borne in mind.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n13.  The Committee has listed seven issues on which evidence is specifically \nsought.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAre current safety measures at level crossings adequate?  How should they be improved? \n&#xa0;\n14.  In common with all employers, Network Rail has a legal duty to conduct its business in such a manner as to reduce risks to health and safety so far as is “reasonably practicable”.  Taking account of court rulings over the years, the rail industry has \nproduced guidance (see RSSB’s manual on \nTaking safe decisions\n)\n to assist its members in interpreting this obligation.  To put the matter at its simplest, the legal duty does not (and cannot) require the total elimination of risk, but rather that it should \nbe controlled at a level at which the cost, time and effort required to do so are not in “gross disproportion” to the safety benefits secured.  \n&#xa0;\n15.  There is no single, simple test of the adequacy of crossing safety measures, and they can only properly b\ne judged in the context of the physical and usage characteristics of individual sites.  But Network Rail has been a world leader in the development of crossing risk modelling to inform its decisions, and its overall crossing safety performance compares fav\nourably with that of any other equivalent rail network in Europe.  So while there is always scope for further improvement, and lapses can and do occur from time to time, the industry’s achievements and current performance should not go unacknowledged.\n&#xa0;\n16.\n  The range of possible improvements currently being deployed \nincludes :\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIn addition to bridges and underpasses what other cost-effective measures can be introduced to replace or improve safety at level crossings?17.  Short of outright closure, grade-separation (i.e. replacing crossings by bridges or underpasses) is the only means of ensuring that the r\nisks associated with crossings are eliminated.  That is why the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the industry’s safety regulator, no longer allows new crossings to be opened, other than in wholly exceptional circumstances, and does not permit line speeds o\nn existing routes to be raised above 125 mph without all crossings being removed.  But such infrastructure improvements (even if they are designed only for use by pedestrians) invariably cost hundreds of thousands – if not millions – of pounds, and it is o\nnly at very high-risk crossings that such expenditure is likely to pass the test of “reasonable practicability” and thus be cost-effective on grounds of its safety benefits alone.  \n18.  However, where both rail and road traffic densities are high, crossin\ngs can cause extended delays to road vehicles and generate significant traffic congestion.  Logically, the economic impact of this congestion should be factored into the appraisal of crossing improvements.  In practice, this seldom happens, because in Brit\nain – unlike some other countries – the entire cost of crossing upgrades or replacements is usually borne by the railway, and highway authorities are under no obligation to contribute towards the cost of infrastructure improvements even if its primary purp\nose is reduce risk and delay to road users.  This apportionment of the cost burden is an historical anomaly which is overdue for correction.  Crossing-related costs should be borne equally by both the railway and the road authority, and where identifiable \ncosts arise directly from (e.g.) development of land leading to higher vehicle or pedestrian \nusage,\n these should be recoverable from those responsible.\n19.  Several means of improving crossing safety are listed in response to the preceding question.  Other\ns include providing open or user-worked crossings with barriers, and/or installing telephones (to signallers) at gated crossings which do not yet have them, and/or fitting warning lights and audible alarms at footpath crossings to alert users to the approa\nch of trains, and/or installing obstacle detectors at automatic crossings to allow half-barriers to be replaced with full-barriers.\n&#xa0;\nHow should expenditure on improving safety at level crossings be prioritised in relation to other demands on the rail budget?20.  In order to optimise the allocation of its investment and maintenance budgets, Network Rail should apply a common appraisal yardstick both to level crossing schemes and to other \nprojects, including those with a specific safety objective.  If the go\nvernment believes that there are legitimate societal concerns that justify a higher level of expenditure on crossings than this would provide, then it should allocate earmarked funding for this purpose.\n&#xa0;\n21.  In practice, this approximates to the current a\nrrangements. Network Rail is required by the Health &amp; Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) \nto reduce\n risk so far as is reasonably practicable\n, as part of its day-to-day role as the owner, operator and maintainer of the infrastructure of the national rail sys\ntem.  It does this \nthrough, for example, \nits \nroutine risk assessment\ns and its\n renewals and enhancements programmes. \n&#xa0;\n22.  Every five years, the Secretary of State for Transport (in respect of England and Wales) and Scottish Ministers are required to publi\nsh their desired high level output specifications (HLOS) for the railways, and a statement of the public funds which will be available (SOFA), in the next “control period”.  In response, Network Rail sets outs its strategic business plan, itemising what it\n intends to deliver for the level of funding indicated.  It then falls to the ORR (as the industry’s economic regulator) to determine whether the plan represents an efficient and effective use of resources, and to specify in more detail the required output\ns.  \n&#xa0;\n23.  This process provides ample opportunities for all three parties (government, industry and regulator) to review Network Rail’s record and policies towards safety in general and towards level crossings in particular, and to assess the scope for fu\nrther improvements alongside all of the competing claims on the allocated funds.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs Network Rail giving sufficient priority to improving safety at level crossings?24.  In 2010 to 2012, Network Rail achieved a 20% reduction in crossing-related risk.  The two governments’ combined SOFAs for Control Period 5 (i.e. 2014-19) made provision for £75 million of ring-fenced funding to be devoted specifically to further enhan\ncements in crossing safety.  \n25.  In response, in its strategic business plans for this period, published in January 2013, Network Rail has set itself \na target of reducing \nlevel crossing risk\n by a further 8\n% over the control period\n. \n This target may at first sight appear low in the light of its recent achievements, but it is important to remember that as the most cost-effective schemes are implemented, so the rate of return on further schemes diminishes, and additional increments in s\nafety improvement become more expensive to deliver.\n26.  The intention is to use this ring-fenced funding to close 30 particularly high-risk crossings and to install a further 200 enforcement cameras, as well as replacing whistle boards with train-detectio\nn equipment and providing additional telephones, miniature warning lights, power-operated gates and improved decking.\n&#xa0;\n27.  Network Rail’s published policy statement on managing crossing safety commits it, inter alia, to\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n28.  No organisation, least of all Network Rail, is perfect in every respect – as periodic reports from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch bear witness.  But there is clear evidence of a \ncorporate desire further to improve its record on level crossing safety, which is already superior to that of most comparable rail systems. This is a not inconsiderable achievement, and one for which it deserves due recognition.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nIs Government policy and regulatory action by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) in relation to safety at level crossings adequate?  What more should the Government and ORR do?&#xa0;\n29.  \nThe government has not sought in recent years to involve itself directly in the detail of rail sa\nfety policy.  But in its July 2012 HLOS statement, it asserted that “\nThe Secretary of State specifically wishes the industry to reduce the risk of accidents at level crossings. \n \nIn accordance with advice from ORR she has made a ring-fenced provision of \n£65m over CP5 to facilitate the achievement of this outcome by enabling Network Rail to invest to reduce risk.\n”\n&#xa0;\n30.  \nThe equivalent statement by Scottish Ministers, published the previous month, announced the establishment of a\n separate\n £10 million level \ncrossings fund.  This would be made \navailable,\n it was stated, \n“\nin addition to the baseline funding requirement for level crossing safety in Scotland\n, to support Network Rail, local a\nuthorities and other local stakeholders to work in partnership to facilita\nte the closure of level crossings in Scotland.”\n&#xa0;\n31.  No similar provision was made for any other facet of rail safety.  Both governments have therefore acknowledged the priority to be given to level crossings in the industry’s overall safety enhancement p\nrogramme.\n&#xa0;\n32.  In its \nDraft determination of Network Rail’s outputs and funding for 2014-19\n (published in June 2013 and subject to public consultation until October this year) the ORR proposes that \n“\nNetwork Rail should provide us with its plan to maximise\n the reduction in the risk of accidents at level crossings in CP5 and using the ring-fenced fund, before March\n \n2014. \n \nWe ex\npect the ring-fenced fund to \nbe :\n \n(a)\n \nused to deliver the maximum risk reduction irrespective of geographical location\n \n(England, Scot\nland and Wales);\n \n(b)\n \nretained as a central fund; and\n \n(c)\n \nused across the whole level crossin\ng portfolio.  \nThe delivery of the planned package of projects in CP5, to achieve the maximum reduction in risk of accidents at level crossings using the £67m ring-f\nenced fund is a\n \nregulated output\n.”\n  \nIt adds that “t\nhe risk redu\nction achieved by using the ring\n-fenced level crossing fund is in addition to reducing risk so far as is reasonably practicable through, for example, routine risk assessment and the renewals \nand enhancements programmes.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\n33.  ORR’s \nHealth &amp; Safety Report 2013 \nnotes that “\nNetwork Rail is committed to reducing level crossing risk 25% by 2019 and it is currently on-target, as\n \nmeasured by its own model, to deliver this. \n \nThis improvement has com\ne through strong leadership from senior managers and demonstrates what can be achieved with the right focus\n.”  However, the report goes on to record that “w\ne found that in the routes,\n \nsome level crossing risk assessments were poor and did not identify the \nbest risk controls. We also found that risk assessments were\n \nnot always being carried out at the right stage of the renewal and enhancement process, which introduced delays and additional costs at the\n \nlevel crossing commissioning\n \nstage.\n  \nWe note that Netwo\nrk Rail has recently introduced route\n-\nlevel crossing managers and a national level crossing team, which should improve the quality of the risk assessment process.\n”\n \n&#xa0;\n34.  \nORR has summarised its policy on level crossings in the following \nterms :\n“\nGreat Britain’s level crossing safety record is among the best in the world, but every incident has the potential for significant human and economic loss. \n \nLevel crossings are the single biggest source of railway catastrophic risk, but overall the risks ar\ne well managed. \n“\nWe seek to influence \ndutyholders\n and others to reduce risk at Britain’s level crossings. \n \nWe do this through a variety of means ranging from advic\ne to formal enforcement action…  \nRisk control should, where practicable, be achieved through the elimination of level crossings in favour of bridges, underpasses or diversions. \n \nWhere elimination is not possible, we aim to ensure that duty holders reduce risk \nso\n far as is reasonably pract\nicable and in accordance with the principles of protection.\n“As the safety regulator for Britain’s railways, our role is to provide clear advice and enforce relevant legislation – including that which relates to level crossings.  We also exercise delegated\n powers of the Secretary of State in making level crossing orders under \nthe \nLevel Crossings Act 1983\n.\n“We believe that it is neither effective nor efficient for onl\ny rail companies to be responsible for managing safety at level crossings.  Decisions about level crossings should involve rail companies, traffic authorities and other relevant organisations as early on as possible. \n \nRelevant authorities should recognise \nthe wider benefits that safety improvements at level crossings (for example, replacing them with bridges) can bring about, particularly for road users.  If wider benefits can be achieved, the appropriate funding bodies should agree on how the costs of maki\nng safety improvements will be met. \n“We are also committed to helping people understand the importance of the \nsafe use of level cro\nssings\n.”\n35.  \nIn\n furtherance of the last of these policies. ORR has published a more detailed statement of its \nPolicy on level crossings\n,\n \ntogether with a guide for road (and path) users on \nUsing\n level crossings safely \nand a technical manual entitled \nLev\nel Crossings: a guide for managers, designers and operators\n. \n  \nIt is evident that enhancing crossing safety occupies a central place in ORR’s regulatory strategy.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow should the legislation governing level crossings be updated?&#xa0;36.  \nIn June 2008\n the two Law Commissions (i.e. for England &amp; \nWales,\n and for Scotland) announced that at the suggestion of ORR they would jointly be conducting a review of level crossing law.  The exercise has proved complex and time-consuming, and the Commissions’ final p\nroposals are not now due to appear until later this autumn.  There has, however, been an extremely thorough process of public consultation as part of the review, to which Passenger Focus and London \nTravelWatch\n have contributed fully.  We do not wish to pre\n-empt the outcome of the Commissions’ work, but we anticipate that it is likely to encompass recommendations relating to (inter alia\n) :\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nHow should public awareness of safety at level crossings be improved?37.  \nThere are a number of different \ntarget audiences, and the communications strategy must be tailored to their circumstances.  They include, for \nexample :\n&#xa0;\n38.  International Level Crossing Awareness Day, promoted by the International U\nnion of Railways, provides an annual opportunity to run co-ordinated awareness-raising events across the network, to maximise the impact of their message.\n&#xa0;Key recommendations&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDocuments cited&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDepartment for \nTransport :\n \nTransport Statistics Great Britain 2012 \n: \nhttps://www.gov.uk/\n government/uploads/system/up\nloads/attachment_data/file/71279/tsgb-2012.pdf\n&#xa0;\nE\nuropean Rail \nAgency :\n \nIntermediate report on the development of railway safety in the European Union 2013\nhttp://www.era.europa.eu/Document-Register/Documents/\n SPR% 202013%20Final%20for%20web.pdf\n&#xa0;\nLaw \nCommission :\n \nLevel Crossings \nhttp://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/level-crossings.htm\n&#xa0;\nNetwork \nRail :\n \nOur Approach to Managing Level Crossing Safety \nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents4424Level20Crossing20Policy.pdf\n&#xa0;\nNetwork \nRail :\n \nStrategic business plan for England and Wales \nand \nStrategic business plan for Scotland \n \nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/publications/strategic-business-plan-for-cp5/\n&#xa0;\nRSSB :\n \nAnnual Safety Performance Report 2012/13\nhttp://www.rssb.co.uk/SPR/REPORTS/\n Pages/AnnualSafetyPerformanceReport2\n01213.aspx\n&#xa0;\nRSSB :\n \nSafety risk model\nhttp://www.rssb.co.uk/SPR/Pages/SAFETYRISKMODEL.aspx\n&#xa0;\nRSSB :\n \nTaking safe decisions\nhttp://www.rssb.co.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/\n \npdf\n/Taking %20Safe%20Decisions.pdf\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOffice of Rail \nRegulation :\n \nHealth &amp; \nSafety Report 2013\nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/health-safety-report-2013.pdf\n&#xa0;\nOffice of Rail \nRegulation :\n \nLevel Crossings\n : A\n guide for managers, designers and op\nerators\n \nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/level_crossings_guidance.pdf\n&#xa0;\nOffice of Rail \nRegulation :\n \nPeriodic Review 2013 : \nDraft determination of Network Rail’s outputs \nand funding for 2014-19\nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/pr13/PDF/pr13-draft-determination.pdf\n&#xa0;\nOffice of Rail \nRegulation :\n \nPolicy on level crossings\nhttp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1564\n&#xa0;\nOffice of Rail \nRegulation :\n \nUsing level crossings safely\nht\ntp://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/pdf/using_level_crossings_safely.pdf\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
