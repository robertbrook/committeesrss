defaultKey to improving the safety of cyclists is to alter the 
defaultmindset
default of the minority of drivers who cause the danger through inattention or aggressive driving. The introduction of strict liability combined with an education campaign aimed at both drivers and 
defaultcyclists would go a long way in this regard.
default&#xa0;
defaultI am 63 years old and a very experienced cyclist and car driver. I have commuted by bike in Glasgow for the last 8 years. I that time I have been hit twice by cars in circumstances where the drivers just simply
default did not look properly. I have also had many close shaves, most due to carelessness on the part of drivers, but a small number due to deliberately aggressive driving.
default&#xa0;
defaultI have to say that in this part of the world, HGV's are not a significant problem for cy
defaultclists, but I recognise that this is not the case in other parts of the country.
