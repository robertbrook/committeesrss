[normal]Written evidence from Boyd Johnston (CYS0100)
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Key to improving the safety of cyclists is to alter the 
[normal]mindset
[normal] of the minority of drivers who cause the danger through inattention or aggressive driving. The introduction of strict liability combined with an education campaign aimed at both drivers and 
[normal]cyclists would go a long way in this regard.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I am 63 years old and a very experienced cyclist and car driver. I have commuted by bike in Glasgow for the last 8 years. I that time I have been hit twice by cars in circumstances where the drivers just simply
[normal] did not look properly. I have also had many close shaves, most due to carelessness on the part of drivers, but a small number due to deliberately aggressive driving.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I have to say that in this part of the world, HGV's are not a significant problem for cy
[normal]clists, but I recognise that this is not the case in other parts of the country.

[normal]uggestions for improvements are
