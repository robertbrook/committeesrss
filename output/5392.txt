[[[Cabinet Office]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;The ‘Nudge Unit’ or Behavioural Insights Team did not have any formal discussions with Defra on the proposed plastic bag charge. Although there is good evidence that introducing a 5p charge for single use carrier bags in Wales did dramatically decrease the number of bags issued, specifically by about 80%. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]All the charging schemes in place and proposed across the UK have similar structures.&#xa0; They put in place a 5p charge on carrier bags in order to reduce litter and the environmental cost of producing all that plastic.&#xa0;There are differences across the UK to reflect local circumstances.&#xa0; In England the charge will focus on plastic bags as it is a targeted, proportionate approach to the problem of carrier bag distribution and littering. The Government will exempt small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce the administrative burden. We also intend to exempt biodegradable bags that meet certain standards.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;21 January 2014&#xa0;
