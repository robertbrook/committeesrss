[normal]&#xa0;[bold]Letter to the Chair of the Committee from Andrew Rose, [bold]Chief Executive, [bold]Homes and Communities Agency[bold]Ref:  [bold]The Performance of the Department for Communities and Local Government[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]T
[normal]hank you for your letter
[normal] of 17
[normal]th
[normal] October 2013 seeking further information on some of the points that emerged in the Select Committee session on 14
[normal]th
[normal] October.  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You 
[normal]have requested a note explaining
[normal] why HCA was guaranteeing payments under loan obligations f
[normal]or Home Group.
[normal] 
[normal]By way of background
[normal],
[normal] on 
[normal] 6 May 1987
[normal] a predecessor body of the Agency
[normal],
[normal] together with 19 other public sector bodies jointly and severally guaranteed the payment of interest and capital in respect of up to £100m of 8.75% guaranteed loan stock 
[normal]of Home Group. The Agency’s currently assessed share of this contingent liability is 21.65%, and the repayment of capital is due in 2037. The guarantee was issued with the 
[normal]then 
[normal]Secretary of State’s consent.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]D
[normal]etails can be found in HCA’s own Annual Report 
[normal]and Financial Statement
[normal]s 2012/13
[normal] 
[normal]under Note 43 
[normal]on 
[normal]page 
[normal]106
[normal], a cop
[normal]y
[normal] of which is 
[normal]enclosed
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Home Group is a Registered Pro
[normal]vider and as such 
[normal]is 
[normal]subject to regulation by the HCA
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]I hope you will appreciate that as the 
[normal]guarantee was 
[normal]issue
[normal]d over 
[normal]26
[normal] year
[normal]s
[normal] ago, it is difficult for me to ascertain the rationale for extending the guarantee at the time.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]You also identify in your lett
[normal]er the case raised by 
[normal]John Pugh about a landlord in Kirklees using money that was intended for affordable homes to build homes for market rent. 
[normal]I
[normal]n this particular case, the landlord was provided with funding by Kirklees Council as part of their overall all
[normal]ocation of £2.8m under the Clusters of Empty Homes programme, which is administered by local authorities. HCA played an advisory role in allocating funding at a high level to the local authorities involved.  Those local authorities then make decisions abou
[normal]t investing the available monies at a local level.  The HCA does not deliver or manage this programme. The funding is un-ringfenced grant, under section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003, given directly from DCLG to 
[normal]l
[normal]ocal 
[normal]a
[normal]uthorities participating in the
[normal] programme. The monitoring arrangements will be set up betw
[normal]een DCLG and the local authorities
[normal] 
[normal]it
[normal] funds to monitor how this money is spent. It is worth noting that the terms of the programme do not prevent market rent being charged as part of a blend of mar
[normal]ket and affordable rent properties. It is a matter for Kirklees Council to confirm under what conditions the funding was allocated in this particular case. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]While the HCA did not allocate the funding in this case, you asked about the arrangements HCA has 
[normal]in place for ensuring that the public money we discharge is being spent in the way it was intended. Across all of our affordable housing grant funded programmes, we commission an annual programme of compliance audit checks
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]Through these, we require
[normal] exter
[normal]nal auditors
[normal] to
[normal] carry out compliance checks
[normal] on a
[normal] sample of eligible schemes and providers against the information submitted to us 
[normal]and 
[normal]which form
[normal] the ba
[normal]sis for our investment decision
[normal].   It is rare that the compliance audit process finds non-compliance wher
[normal]e monies have knowingly been improperly claimed.  Where errors are found (which may be clerical or procedural), our options include requiring that the r
[normal]ecipient corrects the error, or
[normal] 
[normal]where correction is not possible or the breach is considered to be del
[normal]ib
[normal]erate
[normal],
[normal] reclaiming all, or a proportion of the grant
[normal].  In extreme cases, if our findings indicate that there may be a more widespread issue within the registered provider, we can refer the case to the regulator for their consideration.
[normal]   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The high level of
[normal] compliance in correctly claiming funding in line with originally agreed proposals demonstrates that our partners are meeting our requirements, and act in cognisance that we have monitoring systems in place to identify discrepancies.  The National Audit Of
[normal]fice, as part of its annual audit of the HCA’s processes
[normal],
[normal] reviews our compliance audit processes 
[normal]in order to assure
[normal] itself that these are operating effectively. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Your last point referred to Pat Ritchie’s intention to reintroduce a staff survey in 2012 and I can confirm that HCA carried this out in July 2012. The survey is 
[normal]now 
[normal]run on an annual basis. We ran 
[normal]a subsequent
[normal] staff survey in 
[normal]May
[normal] of this year and I enclose
[normal] a summary of the latest results for your information. You will see from the results that we compare well with wider government
[normal] though we are striving for annual improvements
[normal]. We publish our results internally for staff alongside agreed action plans to add
[normal]ress areas where we are focussing on improving scores. 
[normal]We r
[normal]u
[normal]n a number of programmes focused on improving the HCA as an employer of choice
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Please feel free to contact me again should you require further information on this response.
