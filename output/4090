[normal]Written submission from Bill Manning (BRC 68)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]Part P seems a waste
[normal] of time, very bureaucratic
[normal], any 
[normal]individual can purchase 
[normal]electrical accessories from say B&amp;Q, carry out electrical installations, 
[normal]theoretically only 
[normal]just need to sub
[normal]mit building notice to comply.Â  
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Part P is if applied is reactive 
[normal]rather than proactive, if non-qualified person install, may not notify Building Control, and how do you evaluate an installation after completion, h
[normal]ard to see if electrics comp
[normal]ly with BS after installation by potential novice.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]I strongly believe that 
[normal]elect
[normal]rical works should only be carried out by qualified electricians, 
[normal]need something like gas safe legislation.
