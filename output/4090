defaultWritten submission from Bill Manning (BRC 68)default&#xa0;
defaultPart P seems a waste
default of time, very bureaucratic
default, any 
defaultindividual can purchase 
defaultelectrical accessories from say B&amp;Q, carry out electrical installations, 
defaulttheoretically only 
defaultjust need to sub
defaultmit building notice to comply.Â  
default&#xa0;
defaultPart P is if applied is reactive 
defaultrather than proactive, if non-qualified person install, may not notify Building Control, and how do you evaluate an installation after completion, h
defaultard to see if electrics comp
defaultly with BS after installation by potential novice.
default&#xa0;
defaultI strongly believe that 
defaultelect
defaultrical works should only be carried out by qualified electricians, 
defaultneed something like gas safe legislation.
