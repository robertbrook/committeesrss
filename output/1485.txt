&#xa0;‘As far as it is I'm concerned it's an equal playing field. Women get just the same opportunities as men and are treated just the same - it's up to them - if they're good they'll get on but at the moment there aren't enough good women.’ ‘If you give (women) a task they will do it …you say … I think we should do this, or there’s a problem and we’re going to try and solve it, try this, try that, and it’s just done, you know they just do it.’ Though presumably offered as a positive appraisal of women’s potential, women who follow instructions and are accommodating are less likely to be seen as having the characteristics required of a leader in science.‘I was an expert in my field, and used to attend a lot of overseas committee meetings representing the UK. But, over the years, because I’ve moved away from my science subject and the overseas things and have more skills now in project-management and setting up new things, and I think that’s where they see my skills.’‘I really do like my job and I would love to work up in the sort of work I’m doing but I don’t feel like there is room there for me and I’ve actually been told on occasions that it’s not my position to suggest things. They don’t really want me to move up so I don’t see how I can stay when I feel like I’m being held back but I don’t know where to go.’ August 2013&#xa0;
