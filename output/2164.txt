[[[Summary]]]&#xa0;Publicly funded and collected data can have a significant value for economic growth, for health and for society more broadly. The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) are committed to the RCUK Common Principles on Data Policy, which set out an overarching framework for individual research councils’ data policies . The RCUK principles recognise that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest and should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.  Research data generated by research council funding must be discoverable, accessible and usable. In addition to funding research programmes which generate data, the research councils also support infrastructure, build capacity in key disciplines and deliver a policy framework for data sharing and preservation which ensure the research community and others can maximise the value of data.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Why is open data important?]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;8.              As noted in the introduction above, the research councils are committed to the principle that publicly-funded data should be openly available to the maximum extent possible, this may include open-data publication or some form of managed access to ensure data are safe.   It is also important to ensure that data made open are used and re-used by suitably qualified, trained and experienced researchers as effectively as possible; this is in order to maintain the integrity of the data and to ensure the trust of research participants, both of which are essential to maximise its contribution to informing public policy and services. This is particularly important when bringing together data produced by different government departments or public bodies where individual’s identities may inadvertently be discoverable; thus suitable governance arrangements may need to considered to undertake cross-departmental analyses.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
