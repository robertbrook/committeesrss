[normal]Written evidence from [bold]T[bold]he [bold]C[bold]ivil [bold]S[bold]ervice [bold]P[bold]ensioners’ [bold]A[bold]lliance (PEX 0007)[bold]&#xa0;
[normal]With nearly 60,000 members and 100 local groups in England and Wales and branches in Malta, Northern Ireland and Scotland, we are a powerful voice for 
[normal]pensioners.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A number of concerns have been brought to our attention by our members 
[normal]over the current proposals for older people in the care system
[normal] in England
[normal].  There does not seem to be a lot of clarification around these points in the public domain at pre
[normal]sent, but 
[normal]we have noticed 
[normal]there is a great deal of anger.  The following is a summary of what people are saying
[normal].  
[normal]If people’s perceptions are accurate, and they act as stated, 
[normal]the
[normal]re is 
[normal]a potential
[normal] 
[normal]impact
[normal] on public expenditure 
[normal]for
[normal] both care and health
[normal]:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If 
[normal]somebody has a house to sell are they going to be able to use that to get extra choice and a better care home?  Does that mean people like me will be put in one of those homes that are cheaper for the local authority, but are really badly run?  I have hear
[normal]d about places like Orchard 
[normal]V
[normal]iew and I am scared.
[normal] 
[normal]2)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]If I am being cared for at home and can’t afford to pay, will I be left with minimum hours, or nothing at all, as nobody can make a profit from me? 
[normal](They had heard of a case in which an 84 year old had bee
[normal]n refused help from a private provider for being unprofitable).
[normal]3)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We feel that care homes are 
[normal]sometimes 
[normal]being set up by people with no background in care, 
[normal]and the press has shown that
[normal] 
[normal]staff in some homes 
[normal]are badly trained and bullied
[normal] by 
[normal]management
[normal]. Older peo
[normal]ple, even if they are paying a great deal of money, can end up abused and neglected.  
[normal]Not all homes are like this, but too many are, and there is not always a choice as the good homes are filled up. 
[normal]4)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]They seem to want us to give up everything we have worke
[normal]d for all our lives.  Well I am not paying a penny, I would rather die first. This
[normal] reply
[normal], now becoming increasingly common,
[normal] was often added as a further response to the other comments we have 
[normal]summarised
[normal].  
[normal](
[normal]We feel that this
[normal] 
[normal]runs the risk 
[normal]of leading
[normal] to more
[normal] A&amp;E and hospital visits 
[normal]and admissions,
[normal] thus
[normal] putting a greater strain on the NHS. If people refuse to pay, care services may be lost, too.
[normal])
[normal]5)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]They are talking about taking our houses and valuables.  When will they do this?  Even if they don’t throw my husba
[normal]nd out of our house
[normal] straight after I die
[normal], will they be coming for my personal possessions?  If I am the last survivor, will they be after even the rings I want to be buried in.  Will this override my will?  I want to give family stuff to my children…this 
[normal]is like something out of Dickens.
[normal]6)
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Why should we pay all this money to live in cramped conditions, share a bathroom, and be fed overcooked bland food, followed by sitting in a circle around a TV?
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Our 
[normal]organization is
[normal] concerned that 
[normal]current
[normal] proposals have th
[normal]e potential to lead to a two tier system, 
[normal]where
[normal] 
[normal]frail 
[normal]vulnerable 
[normal]older 
[normal]people, without the means to pay, 
[normal]will be increasingly 
[normal]denied funding
[normal] on the grounds they are not eligible
[normal] (even if they are very frail and vulnerable)
[normal], by cash strapped Local Authoriti
[normal]es. 
[normal]The
[normal]re is
[normal] also
[normal] the fear of
[normal] being sent to “second class” care homes
[normal], since
[normal] they are relying on a Local Authority that may not have the money available to pay extra for a better placement. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]P
[normal]eople
[normal] 
[normal]are 
[normal]also 
[normal]worried that,
[normal] seeing a potential for profit
[normal] fro
[normal]m self funders
[normal],
[normal] 
[normal]but lacking the appropriate background and ethos, entrepreneurs and businesses 
[normal]will look to set
[normal] up care homes
[normal] which 
[normal]only just 
[normal]pass as acceptable,
[normal] but which the
[normal]ir
[normal] local authority
[normal] and other agencies
[normal] may tolerate
[normal] 
[normal]due to a lack of suitable plac
[normal]es
[normal],
[normal] since really good care homes 
[normal]can be
[normal] scarce, and very often full.  They fell that as a result
[normal] those
[normal] less good homes may be all that is available
[normal] to them,
[normal] ev
[normal]en though they are paying a lot of money and using all their assets.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We are also concerned that
[normal], if people refuse to pay
[normal] for care
[normal], essential 
[normal]services 
[normal]could be
[normal] lost, and the NHS 
[normal]would be 
[normal]stretched as a consequence.  If too many
[normal] older people
[normal] 
[normal]refuse to pay for care, will this 
[normal]have the potential to 
[normal]drive down
[normal] their overall health, function and wellbeing
[normal] - and
[normal] 
[normal]perhaps 
[normal]average 
[normal]life spans?  
[normal]This would 
[normal]possibly 
[normal]have a detrimental effect on the NHS
[normal] ability to deal with the increasing numbers of older people,
[normal] and drive up its costs.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Younger relatives, particularly women, may be forced to give up work to look after elderly parents 
[normal]or relatives 
[normal]who refuse care, which would be a backward step for women in employment, and for the economic health of the country.  O
[normal]ther elderly frail and v
[normal]ulnerable
[normal] people
[normal] may not have r
[normal]elatives nearby
[normal],
[normal] or 
[normal]their
[normal] relatives 
[normal]may not be
[normal] in a position to help with care
[normal].  If they refuse formal care it seems likely they would 
[normal]be at increasing risk
[normal], and end up costing the NHS and other services more. 
[normal]From the commen
[normal]ts of our members it seems that o
[normal]lder people may avoid all services
[normal], not just care,
[normal] as they fear being 
[normal]brought to the attention of the social care service, being 
[normal]forced to accept care or a care home place by officials, and los
[normal]ing
[normal] their homes and valuables.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]We would very much welcome a clarification around these points to submit to our members.
