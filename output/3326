defaultWith nearly 60,000 members and 100 local groups in England and Wales and branches in Malta, Northern Ireland and Scotland, we are a powerful voice for 
defaultpensioners.
default&#xa0;
defaultA number of concerns have been brought to our attention by our members 
defaultover the current proposals for older people in the care system
default in England
default.  There does not seem to be a lot of clarification around these points in the public domain at pre
defaultsent, but 
defaultwe have noticed 
defaultthere is a great deal of anger.  The following is a summary of what people are saying
default.  
defaultIf people’s perceptions are accurate, and they act as stated, 
defaultthe
defaultre is 
defaulta potential
default 
defaultimpact
default on public expenditure 
defaultfor
default both care and health
default:
default&#xa0;
default1)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf 
defaultsomebody has a house to sell are they going to be able to use that to get extra choice and a better care home?  Does that mean people like me will be put in one of those homes that are cheaper for the local authority, but are really badly run?  I have hear
defaultd about places like Orchard 
defaultV
defaultiew and I am scared.
default

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIf I am being cared for at home and can’t afford to pay, will I be left with minimum hours, or nothing at all, as nobody can make a profit from me? 
default(They had heard of a case in which an 84 year old had bee
defaultn refused help from a private provider for being unprofitable).
default3)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWe feel that care homes are 
defaultsometimes 
defaultbeing set up by people with no background in care, 
defaultand the press has shown that
default 
defaultstaff in some homes 
defaultare badly trained and bullied
default by 
defaultmanagement
default. Older peo
defaultple, even if they are paying a great deal of money, can end up abused and neglected.  
defaultNot all homes are like this, but too many are, and there is not always a choice as the good homes are filled up. 
default4)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThey seem to want us to give up everything we have worke
defaultd for all our lives.  Well I am not paying a penny, I would rather die first. This
default reply
default, now becoming increasingly common,
default was often added as a further response to the other comments we have 
defaultsummarised
default.  
default(
defaultWe feel that this
default 
defaultruns the risk 
defaultof leading
default to more
default A&amp;E and hospital visits 
defaultand admissions,
default thus
default putting a greater strain on the NHS. If people refuse to pay, care services may be lost, too.
default)
default5)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThey are talking about taking our houses and valuables.  When will they do this?  Even if they don’t throw my husba
defaultnd out of our house
default straight after I die
default, will they be coming for my personal possessions?  If I am the last survivor, will they be after even the rings I want to be buried in.  Will this override my will?  I want to give family stuff to my children…this 
defaultis like something out of Dickens.
default6)
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhy should we pay all this money to live in cramped conditions, share a bathroom, and be fed overcooked bland food, followed by sitting in a circle around a TV?
default&#xa0;
defaultOur 
defaultorganization is
default concerned that 
defaultcurrent
default proposals have th
defaulte potential to lead to a two tier system, 
defaultwhere
default 
defaultfrail 
defaultvulnerable 
defaultolder 
defaultpeople, without the means to pay, 
defaultwill be increasingly 
defaultdenied funding
default on the grounds they are not eligible
default (even if they are very frail and vulnerable)
default, by cash strapped Local Authoriti
defaultes. 
defaultThe
defaultre is
default also
default the fear of
default being sent to “second class” care homes
default, since
default they are relying on a Local Authority that may not have the money available to pay extra for a better placement. 
default&#xa0;
defaultP
defaulteople
default 
defaultare 
defaultalso 
defaultworried that,
default seeing a potential for profit
default fro
defaultm self funders
default,
default 
defaultbut lacking the appropriate background and ethos, entrepreneurs and businesses 
defaultwill look to set
default up care homes
default which 
defaultonly just 
defaultpass as acceptable,
default but which the
defaultir
default local authority
default and other agencies
default may tolerate
default 
defaultdue to a lack of suitable plac
defaultes
default,
default since really good care homes 
defaultcan be
default scarce, and very often full.  They fell that as a result
default those
default less good homes may be all that is available
default to them,
default ev
defaulten though they are paying a lot of money and using all their assets.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe are also concerned that
default, if people refuse to pay
default for care
default, essential 
defaultservices 
defaultcould be
default lost, and the NHS 
defaultwould be 
defaultstretched as a consequence.  If too many
default older people
default 
defaultrefuse to pay for care, will this 
defaulthave the potential to 
defaultdrive down
default their overall health, function and wellbeing
default - and
default 
defaultperhaps 
defaultaverage 
defaultlife spans?  
defaultThis would 
defaultpossibly 
defaulthave a detrimental effect on the NHS
default ability to deal with the increasing numbers of older people,
default and drive up its costs.
default&#xa0;
defaultYounger relatives, particularly women, may be forced to give up work to look after elderly parents 
defaultor relatives 
defaultwho refuse care, which would be a backward step for women in employment, and for the economic health of the country.  O
defaultther elderly frail and v
defaultulnerable
default people
default may not have r
defaultelatives nearby
default,
default or 
defaulttheir
default relatives 
defaultmay not be
default in a position to help with care
default.  If they refuse formal care it seems likely they would 
defaultbe at increasing risk
default, and end up costing the NHS and other services more. 
defaultFrom the commen
defaultts of our members it seems that o
defaultlder people may avoid all services
default, not just care,
default as they fear being 
defaultbrought to the attention of the social care service, being 
defaultforced to accept care or a care home place by officials, and los
defaulting
default their homes and valuables.
default&#xa0;
defaultWe would very much welcome a clarification around these points to submit to our members.
