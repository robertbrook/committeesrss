default&#xa0;defaultIntroductiondefault&#xa0;default1.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur reforms are 
defaultworking
default.  We have put policing back in the hands of the public through directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners.  We have empowered local communities through our detailed crime maps and the success of Police.UK.  We have given Chief Constables greater operational independence by scrapping national targets.  We have improved productivity by scrapping
default centrally 
defaultimposed 
defaultpaperwork
default.  We are shining a stronger light on police performance by making the Inspectorate of Constabulary more independent.  We are improving policing skills and the evidence base for what works through the new College of Policing.  We have made sure we reward skills
default,
default not just time served
default,
default through the Winsor reforms to pay and conditions.   We have established the National Crime Agency to lead the fight against serious and organised crime. We have delivered all of this whilst reducing budgets and cutting crime to the lowest levels since 
defaultthe Crime Survey
default 
defaultwas launched in 1981
default.
default 
defaultPCCs represent one
default important
default aspect of 
defaultthese
default ambitious reforms. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in reducing crime and delivering an effective police service within their police force area;default&#xa0;
default2.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is 
defaultimperative under the new model that
default 
defaultthe performance of 
defaulteach force is independent
defaultly assessed
default and the public have the information they need to hold their PCC and force to account
default.
default 
defaultT
defaulthat is why 
defaultthis Government
default ha
defaults
default strengthened the independence of HMIC, 
defaultwh
defaultich
default 
defaultnow report
defaults
default directly to Parliament
default and
default,
default 
defaultfor the first time
default,
default is run by a Chief Inspector who has not served as a police officer. It is also 
defaultwhy the Inspectorate will be 
defaultdeveloping proposals that will allow members of the public to see – from a small number of easy-to-understand categories – whether their local force is performing well or badly when it comes to cutting crime and providing value for money.
default&#xa0;
default3.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultGreater transparency in policing for the public 
defaultwill continue to be 
defaultaided by 
defaultpolice.uk
default. 
default 
defaultSince its launch nearly three years ago, it has attracted 634 million hits from 58 million visits. And that demand has continued – the latest figures show an average of more than 8.8 million hits from 471,000 visits per month.
default 
defaultCrime maps let people see what crime takes place where they live, how much of it is detected, what happens when the perpetrator is identified – and they let people compare how crime is dealt with locally compared to nearby communities.
default 
default 
defaultIt has recently been re-launched to 
defaultsimplify the design, making it easier for the public to find the information they want. 
default 
defaultUsers can also now set up their own personalised crime maps which they can share with others, and register for email alerts informing them when crime data for their area is updated. 
default&#xa0;
default4.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs t
defaulthe Home Secretary made clear during her “
defaultPCCs One Year On – Warts and All
default” speech at Policy Exchange on 7 November
default,
default the success of PCCs should be assessed against three criteria: 
default&#xa0;
default5.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe issue of holding Chief Constables to account is considered under the second specific item of your review, but it is important to note the success of PCCs in the first two tests that are set out above, namely on 
defaultvisibilitydefault and on 
defaultdriving innovationdefault.
default&#xa0;
defaultVisibilitydefault&#xa0;default6.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPCCs have brought openness and transparency to their scrutiny role, in contrast to the invisible and unaccountable police authorities.  In Avon and Somerset, the PCC and the C
defaulthief 
defaultC
defaultonstable
default have hosted joint community meetings, broadcasting the event live, and taking questions by email and Twitter
default,
default 
defaultand in 
default Sussex and Surrey
default PCCs
default webcast their monthly performance meetings with the Chief Constable.
default&#xa0;
default7.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIt is clear that this approach is bearing fruit.  Only seven per cent of people knew that they could go to their police authorities with concerns about policing and crime in their area.  
defaultIn contrast, 7 in 10 people know about police and crime commissioner
defaults
default.
default&#xa0;
default8.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPublic correspondence 
defaultto
default 
defaultPCCs has also increased markedly compared to that received by Police Authorities
default, with some PCCs’ offices reporting a 50 fold increase. 
default 
defaultSuch an increase is significant, showing that having strong local lead
defaulter
defaults is bringing the public into the debates on how their local force is run. 
default&#xa0;
default9.
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultPCCs are also taking a local and active approach to ensuring the police are accessible to the public they serve.  In London, 
defaultthe Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPA
defaultC
default)
default has set out a plan for increasing officer numbers while selling underused parts of the policing estate and replacing 65 front counters with 115 new contact points in libraries, supermarkets, hospitals and a post office.
default&#xa0;
default10.
default 
defaultIn Kent, the PCC has rolled out a fleet of ‘Mobile Police Contact Points’ that will make 360 visits to 180 locations in the county each month.
default&#xa0;
default This allows members of the public in rural areas to report a crime or anti-social behaviour
default;
default meet their local PCSOs
default,
default 
defaultand discuss any local policing issues or concerns they have.
default&#xa0;
default11.
default 
defaultIn Dyfed-Powys, the PCC has worked with the Chief Constable to ensure all D
defaultyfed-

defaultowys 
defaultP
defaultolice
default 
defaultstations now operate on a “
defaultwhen we’re in, we’re open
default” principle, reopening front desks. 
default&#xa0;
defaultInnovationdefault&#xa0;default12.
default 
defaultP
defaultCCs
default have spearheaded local innovation,
default they are
default harness
defaulting
default technology
default and
default increas
defaulting
default local capability and capacity
default to tackle crime
default.
default&#xa0;
default13.
default 
defaultIn Cambridgeshire, the P
defaultCC
default launched a system to enable Neighbourhood Watch to become even more active in making communities safer.
default&#xa0;
default Neighbourhood Alert is 
defaulta 
defaultlive 
defaultsystem that
default allows messages to be targeted at street level to 
defaultemail 
defaultsubscribers.
default&#xa0;
default Neighbourhood Alert allows Neighbourhood Watch and the police to talk directly to the people th
defaultey need to, when they need to.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default14.
default 
defaultPCCs have 
defaultalso 
defaultmade use of the opportunities afforded by new technologies to tackle crime.  In Cheshire, the PCC has launched a mobile app that allows users to report drink drivers or incidents of domestic abuse straight to the Constabulary.  
default&#xa0;
default15.
default 
defaultThe Gloucestershire PCC has helped to fund an innovative new mobile phone app that can be used to safely provide information on gang activity in Gloucester, allowing young people to talk directly to a multi-agency project team, who will provide support.
default&#xa0;
defaultPrioritising the front linedefault&#xa0;default16.
default 
defaultAcross the country, PCCs are working to 
defaultensure policing on the front line is 
defaultprioritised
default. 
default&#xa0;
default17.
default 
defaultIn London, the Metropolitan Police is 
defaultcurrently undertaking a comprehensive recruitment programme, aimed at recruiting 5000 new officers by 2015. 
default&#xa0;
default18.
default 
defaultIn Bedfordshire, in addition to plans for 80 new officers, the PCC has been working to deliver more policing volunteers and greater diversity in the force.  Volunteer applications from people from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds have gone up by a third since last November
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default19.
default 
defaultIn Sussex, the PCC opened recruitment for 80 new police constables and 30 PCSOs. 
default 
defaultIn addition, 32 civilian response investigator roles have been created in order to release warranted officers onto the front line.  The PCC has also set out her plans to recruit 120 new Specials in 2014, 
defaultwhile in Devon and Cornwall there are plans for 200 extra Specials.
default&#xa0;
default20.
default 
defaultPCCs are visible and are engaging with the public, they are driving innovation and they are prioritising front line policing to ensure effective policing in each force area.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe role of commissioners in holding their chief constables to account;default&#xa0;
default21.
default 
defaultSection 17 of the 
defaultPolicing 
defaultProtoc
defaulto
defaultl
default Order 2011
default sets out the powers and duties held by PCCs to hold their Chief Constable to account.
default T
defaulthe relationship between the PCC and their Chief Constable should be constructive, but that does not mean they should always agree. Indeed, in holding Chiefs to account PCCs
default 
defaultmust
default challenge, question and probe.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Protocol sets out
default that public accountability for the delivery and performance of policing is passed to the PCC 
defaulton behalf of the electorate
default. The PCC is accountable to the electorate, the Chief Constable to the PCC.
default&#xa0;
default22.
default 
defaultThere are many examples of PCCs 
defaultpublically and robustly holding their Chief Constables to account
default. For instance
default,
default 
defaultin February 2013
default, Kent PCC 
defaultAnn Barnes, 
defaultc
defaultall
defaulted
default in HMIC 
defaultover her
default 
defaultconcern
defaults
default 
defaultabout
default 
defaultpolice crime recording. 
defaultThe 
defaultresulting 
defaultreport, published in June
default,
default showed that “
defaultappreciably more
default” needed to be done to ensure the people of Kent could have confidence in their recorded crime figures. The PCC 
defaultwas outspoken following the findings of the report and challenged her force to improve, 
defaultand 
defaultMs Barnes has invited HMIC back to Kent to follow up their June report and indicate what progress has been made.
default 
defaultThis demonstrates the power 
defaultand level of scrutiny 
defaulta PCC can bring to bear on matters of absolutely central importance to issues such as confidence in the local police force.
default&#xa0;
default23.
default 
defaultThis Committee has previously looked at the powers of PCCs to remove their Chief Constables
default and the
default Government ha
defaults
default recently responded to that report.
default We have made clear that
default there are appropriate safeguards in place regarding the removal of Chief Constables, and that the Police and Crime Panels who scrutinise these decisions have the appropriate powers.
default&#xa0;
default24.
default 
defaultU
defaultltimately
default,
default 
defaultPCCs
default are public bodies
default.  I
defaultn exercising all their powers they must act reasonably and proportionately
default,
default and 
defaultthey 
defaultbenefit from statutory monitoring officers to advise them on these legal issues. As Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector recently stated in a speech on this issue: 
defaultThe statutory scheme of local accountability established in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 is, on its face and, I believe, in its substance, a coherent and rational one.
default&#xa0;
default25.
default 
defaultIt is for Police and Crime Panels, 
defaultthe public and
default,
default if needed
default,
default the Courts
default,
default to decide 
defaultwhether the
default powers of dismissal 
defaulthave been used appropriately
default. 
default 
defaultIt is right that t
defaulthe 
defaultability 
defaultto appoint and to fire Chief Constables
default 
defaultis defined
default in statute and exercised by the individual elected by the public to hold the Chief Constable to account
default. Th
defaulte
default power
default,
default and the willingness of PCCs to consider its use, forms a crucial element of how PCCs can hold their Chiefs to account
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default26.
default 
defaultThere are many examples
default, un
defaultreported in the national media
default,
default of 
defaulthow 
defaultPCCs

default, Simon
default Hayes holds

default(Commissioner’s Performance, Accountability, Scrutiny and Strategy meeting)
default. These

defaultbi-monthly meetings

defaulted
default a wide range of topics, 
defaultwith 
defaultm
defaultembers of the public invited to submit questions
default.
default 
defaultF
defaultrom December
default,
default these will be public events held at various locations throughout the area to allow as many people as possible to attend
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default27.
default 
defaultAlong similar line
defaults,
default 
defaultthe
default 
defaultSussex PCC ha
defaults started to
default 
defaultstream
default meetings, such as 
defaulther monthly 
defaultPerformance and Accountability meetings
default with the Chief Constable
default, live over the web, making the process of scrut
defaultiny transparent and accessible. 
default&#xa0;
default28.
default 
defaultIn London
default,
default the
default MOPAC Challenge is the principal mechanism through which 
defaultMOPAC 
defaultholds the Commissioner and his top team to account. 
default Each month, t
defaulthe Mayor and the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime
default 
defaultare joined by a board of representatives to help hold the Met Police commissioner to account and review issues across the criminal justice system. 
defaultE
defaultxperts in the field are invited to explore different themes from across the spectrum of crime prevention, policing, and the re-entry of offenders into society.
default T
defaulthese meetings are held in public and broadcast live from City Hall. 
default 
defaultAll reports that go to the MOPAC Challenge and a transcript of proceedings are made available. 
default 
defaultThe meetings are also streamed on the web.
default&#xa0;
default29.
default 
defaultPCCs have a clearly defined role in holding their Chief Constable to account, and there is strong evidence that they are taking this role seriously.
default&#xa0;defaultThe role of police and crime panels in holding their commissioners to account;default&#xa0;default30.
default 
defaultPolice and crime panels (PCPs) perform a scrutiny function for PCCs, providing both support and challenge to PCCs on the exercise of their functions, and acting as a critical friend.
default 
defaultAs set out in the Policing Protocol Order 2011, the role of the Panel as underpinned in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act is to 
defaultprovide: 
defaultchecks and balances in relation to the performance of the PCC. The Panel does not scrutinise the Chief Constable – it scrutinises the PCC‘s exercise of their statutory functions
default. 
default&#xa0;
default31.
default 
defaultThe roles and responsibilities of th
defaulto
defaultse 
defaultin the new policing landscape are not only set out clearly in the Act
default and
default in the Protocol but also 
defaultin the Accountability System Statement for Policing and Crime Reduction.
default This document also sets out other key responsibilities within the system, such as the role of the Home Office.
default&#xa0;
default32.
default 
defaultPanels focus their attention on key strategic actions and decisions taken by the Commissioner including whether they have achieved the objectives set out in their Police and Crime Plan and Annual Report, and consulted appropriately with the public.
default&#xa0;
default33.
default 
defaultTransparency 
defaultis 
defaultkey. Panels meet in public to ensur
defaulte
default information is available to the electorate so that they can hold their respective PCCs to account for their decisions. 
default&#xa0;
default34.
default 
defaultThe Home Office is confident that PCPs have the powers they need to hold Commissioners to account. 
defaultThe powers and responsibilities of PCPs are set out in sections 28 to 30 and 32 to 33 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, and there is further relevant provision in Schedules 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8 to the Act.
default 
default&#xa0;
default35.
default 
defaultPCPs also have the power to veto (with a two-thirds majority) the PCC’s proposed policing precept and the appointment of a chief constable.
default&#xa0;
default36.
default 
defaultT
defaulthe Home Office produced guidance setting out all of the 
defaults
defaultecondary 
defaultl
defaultegislation 
defaultthat applies to PCPs and has issued guidance to sit alongside that legislation.
default The Local Government Association, in Association with the Centre for Public Scrutiny, have also produced guidance on the role and composition of PCPs.
default&#xa0;
default37.
default 
defaultThe Panels have an important role to play in this process, and their powers are
default well defined and
default significant. 
default&#xa0;
defaultThe division of functions and staff between commissioners and chief constables following the Stage 2 transfers under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011;default&#xa0;default38.
default 
defaultGovernment’s 
defaultintention has always been to give as much flexibility locally as possible. We have not wanted to unnecessarily influence or undermine local discussions and
default,
default as such
default,
default&#xa0;
defaultthe Government has been consistent in our view that initial plans for staff transfers under Stage 2 were decisions for PCCs and Chiefs to take locally. 
defaultTo assist PCCs and Chiefs in drawing up these plans we 
defaultset
default out three key principles 
defaultand reiterated the policy intention behind stage 2.
default 
defaultThe 
defaultthree principles 
defaultwe set out were
default:
default&#xa0;
default39.
default 
defaultWe also specified that 
defaultStage 2 
defaultplans should not jeopardise the implementation of the policing plan, or the strategic duties of the force. We were clear that the intention of the Government and of Parliament in making the Chief Constable an employer – which was that operational staff, as a minimum, should transfer to 
defaultthe Chief Constable – is a key consideration and one which Stage 2 plans needed to take into account. 
default&#xa0;
default40.
default 
defaultWe are clear that, within the parameters set out by the above principles, it is right to offer PCCs and Chiefs the local flexibility to organise their staffing arrangements to best meet their local needs. Stage 2 plans have now been submitted and considered by the trade union organisations. As of 9 December 2013, the Home Secretary has approved the 
defaultmajority of 
defaultplans from PCCs and 
defaultthe Department is
default in the process of reviewing the remainder. There is sufficient time to ensure that all transition plans will be in place in time for a smooth transfer of staff in time for the next financial year. 
default&#xa0;
default41.
default 
defaultWe have set out that an integrated Scheme of Governance should be prepared by the PCC, in consultation with the Chief Constable. The revised Financial Management Code of Practice provides clarity around the financial governance arrangements within the police in England and Wales. It sets out specifically the key elements of what should be included in an integrated Scheme. 
default&#xa0;
default42.
default 
defaultThe Stage 2 staff transfer scheme acknowledges the important divide between operat
defaultional policing and the role of
default&#xa0;
defaultthe PCC, whilst also allowing for variation to meet local needs. 
default&#xa0;defaultThe role of commissioners in budget and precept setting;default&#xa0;default43.
default 
defaultThe Home Secretary has protected the police from further Departmental budget reductions during the 2010 Spending Review period. In addition to excluding the police from any reductions relating to the 2011 announcement on pay restraint the Government decided to also protect the police from reductions announced to the Home Office budget in the Autumn Statement 2012. The Home Office is currently considering the implications of the latest Autumn Statement for the police alongside all Home Office budgets in the round. However, there is no question that the police will still have the resources to do their important work.
default&#xa0;
default44.
default 
defaultThese are, undoubtedly, tough economic times, but over the past three years we have seen forces rising to the challenge and meeting local community needs and cutting crime whilst managing these difficult budgetary issues. 
default&#xa0;
default45.
default 
defaultPCCs have a vital role to play in this area but, again, it is not for 
defaultGovernment 
defaultto assess their relative success. HMIC review the success of forces and it is their 
defaultPolicing in Austerity 
defaultreport (July 2013)
default 
defaultthat provides the evidence that forces are 
defaultrising to the challenge
default 
defaultand have plans in place to meet the financial challenge. The Report found that police forces are delivering savings whilst maintaining and improving services for the public: crime is falling; the proportion of officers on the 
defaultfrontline is increasing 
default(from 88.9% in March 2010 to 90.6% in March 2013) 
defaultand victim satisfaction is up
default (84.6% of victims were satisfied with their overall experience in March 2013, compared to 82.2% in March 2010)
default.  
default&#xa0;
default46.
default 
defaultPCCs are driving efficiencies across their forces. We have seen PCCs exploring partnerships with private companies, and focusing on better use of technology. In some instances we have seen old and costly 
defaultbuildings
default being 
defaultvacated
default 
defaultin favour of co-locati
defaulton between
default local fire services,
default police forces and/ or L
defaultocal Government,
default leading to a more effective, joined up, and efficient service.
default The HMIC Report shows there are opportunities to go even further through greater collaboration and improved digital working. The Government is supporting the police to do this, including by creating a £50 million
default a year
default 
defaultinnovation fund 
defaultfrom 2014/15 as well as a precursor fund of 
default£20 million this year to
default enable them to press ahead with transformation in their forces.
default 
default&#xa0;
default47.
default 
defaultPCCs are driving efficiencies locally to 
defaultmaintain effective policing.
default&#xa0;
defaultThe effectiveness of commissioners in promoting local policing priorities;default&#xa0;default48.
default 
defaultPromoting local policing needs is a central function of a PCC
default. PCCs are locally accountable, they have a duty to consult when drafting the Police and Crime Plan for their local area, including consulting victims of crime. 
defaultReviewing the Police and Crime Plans highlights many common issues that affect communities throughout England and Wales, but many of these issues present differently in different locations
default, from sparsely populated 
defaultrural communities to demographically diverse urban areas
default. 
defaultThe role of PCCs is to ensure that the needs of their local communities are met
default.
default 
defaultPCCs are engag
defaulting
default 
defaultin innovative ways 
defaultwith their communities
default to identify and promote
default local priorities. 
default&#xa0;
default49.
default 
defaultA number of PCCs have driven forward initiatives to tackle rural crime.  North Wales PCC 
defaultWinston 
defaultRoddick
default has 
defaultestablished a plan that
default includes a Rural Crime Team of officers, police community support officers (PCSOs) and special constables
default. The teams
default provide a vital link between rural communit
defaulties and North 
defaultWales Police, focu
defaultsing
default on issues such as theft of farming equipment and livestock. 
default&#xa0;
default50.
default 
defaultIn Suffolk, the PCC has introduced a dedicated team of Special Constables to work with Safer Neighbourhoods teams to tackle offenders who target farms and rural communities, as well as rural crime police officers who will focus on hare coursing.
default&#xa0;
default51.
default 
defaultThames Valley PCC
default,
default Anthony Stansfeld
default,
default has also prioritised rural crime, with the introduction of the ‘Country Watch’ messaging system.  So far over 7,500 people have signed up to the system to receive crime alerts, witness appeals, galleries of wanted criminals or suspects, information on community groups, events or meetings and details of operational or proactive work going on in their area by email, text or telephone. 
default&#xa0;
default52.
default 
defaultIn Staffordshire, the PCC has 
defaultintroduced
default 
default‘Cars Behind Bars’ to address the problem of uninsured motorists across Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent.  The 
defaultscheme uses automatic number plate recognition to identify uninsured vehicles, with over 700 vehicles seized in four months.
default&#xa0;
default53.
default 
defaultPCCs are also addressing some of the challenges of policing in urban areas, including addressing the challenges posed by a vibrant night-time economy.  
defaultIn Northumbria, following the rape of a teenage girl, the PCC worked with partners to introduce vulnerability awareness training for all door staff working in the night time economy.  This 
defaulthas been 
defaultincorporated into the current mandatory Security Industry Authority developed training modules for door supervisors
default and is being delivered nationwide
default.
default&#xa0;
default54.
default 
defaultIn Merseyside, Jane Kennedy has worked to increase the diversity of Merseyside Police, with a positive action Leadership Programme aimed at increasing recruitment of under-represented groups to the special constabulary and regular police force
default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default55.
default 
defaultEnsuring forces concentrate on local priorities is a 
defaultkey
default challenge for PCCs
default 
defaultan
defaultd those who do not sufficiently tackle local issues 
defaultwill
default 
defaultbe held to account at the ballot box.
default&#xa0;
defaultProgress on establishing collaboration agreements with other commissioners, policing organisations and partners; default&#xa0;
default56.
default 
defaultSection 10 of t
defaulthe Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 placed a new duty on Police and Crime Commissioners and Chief Constables to collaborate where it is in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.
default 
default&#xa0;
default57.
default 
defaultC
defaulthief Constables are also under a duty to have regard to the Strategic Policing Requirement, which 
defaultsets out in statute the need for collective capabilities to meet national threats. 
default&#xa0;
default58.
default 
defaultPCCs are taking this task seriously and 
defaultin their July 2013 publication 
defaultPolicing in Austerity: Rising to the Challenge
default, HMIC said that “
defaultFollowing their election in November 2012, many PCCs have galvanised the agenda in their area or region, providing fresh impetus to collaboration
default.”
default&#xa0;
default59.
default 
defaultWarwickshire and 
defaultWest Mercia represent a good example
default of 
defaultwhere the PCCs are playing an important part in leading 
defaultcollaboration
default and ensuring momentum is maintained, all with the aim of ensuring savings are made and more resources are focused on the frontline
default.
default This 
defaultimportant
default initiative, through which
default functions below Deputy Chief Constable in
default 
defaultWarwickshire and West Mercia are now joint ones for the two forces
default,
default has achieved significant savings. According to 
defaultHMIC
default, this alliance will allow 
defaultWarwickshire and West Mercia
default 
defaultto achieve 75 per cent and 94 per cent of their respective Spending Review savings by 2014/15.
default&#xa0;
default60.
default 
defaultPCCs in the East Midlands (Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire) commissioned HMIC to conduct a review of their collaboration arrangements, which reported in October 2013. This commission demonstrates the willingness of PCCs to apply a high level of scrutiny and challenge ensuring value for money is achieved.
default&#xa0;
default61.
default 
defaultIn stark contrast to 
defaultpolice authorities
default,
default 
defaultPCCs are 
defaultalready 
defaultlooking 
defaultbeyond the traditional options for reform 
defaultand 
defaultexploring what more ambitious, innovative and transformational options exist to make savings and improve services. Many are turning their attention to those outside the immediate policing family including
default other emergency services.  There is already innovative work taking place between PCCs, fire authorities and ambulance trusts and it’s clear that where the emergency services collaborate they can deliver efficiencies.
default&#xa0;
default62.
default 
defaultIn Hampshire, the fire service, police force and the county council are joining up corporate services and expect to save around £4 million a year.  In Merseyside, the PCC, Jane Kennedy, signed the contract for the building work to begin on a joint police and fire command and control centre.  Matthew Grove, the PCC in Humberside, has made clear that he wants to see long term savings delivered from emergency services collaboration and is now working with the fire authority to achieve significant savings by developing a joint vehicle and equipment workshop.
default&#xa0;
default63.
default 
defaultIn Surr
defaultey, the PCC and Chief Constable
default are leading the way with a full programme of collaboration between the police, fire and south east coast ambulance.  The collaboration will see the three services join forces to find ways of streamlining operations, sharing more premises and delivering joint safety campaigns, as well as looking to link up with Sussex’s emergency services.
default&#xa0;
default64.
default 
defaultI
defaultn Northamptonshire, the Police and Crime Commissioner, with the support of the County Council, is 
defaultleading work for
default 
defaultmuch closer collaborative working between fire and police.
default&#xa0;

defaultGovernment supports this collaboration. As previously set out at Spending Round 2013, the Home Secretary agreed to establish a Police Innovation Fund from 2014/15 worth £50m per annum. The Police Innovation Fund has as one of its core objectives to incentivise collaboration and transformation and enable forces and PCCs to invest in innovative approaches with the potential to improve policing and deliver further efficiencies in the future. To enable PCCs to press ahead now with this transformational work, an additional £20m has been made available in this financial year as a Precursor Innovation Fund.

default 
defaultPCCs have been in place a little over 12 months. In that short time they have become increasingly visible, actively seeking to engage with the public. They have set budgets and established Police and Crime Plans. They have introduced innovative policies to tackle local problems, and have publically held their Chief Constables to account.
default They have sought to introduce collaboration with other forces and with other providers, and they have driven efficiencies.
