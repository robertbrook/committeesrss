defaultWritten evidence from defaultPaul defaultCotterilldefault (CYS0001)default&#xa0;
defaultMy father was killed in 1979 by a lorry turning left into his path at traffic lights.  I was young at the time, but I understand now that the inquest suggested my father had arrived at the lights before the lorry, intending to go straight on, and that the lorry driver had “lost” my father in the blind spot to the left of his vehicle.
defaultI will not, I think, have to record for the committee the grief suffered by my mother for the past 34 years for this split second lapse by the lorry driver, nor the burden that he, a good man whom we knew, had to endure for the rest of his days.
default I have, for obvious reasons, kept a track on cycling safety issues since that time, and I am of course pained by the six very recent deaths on London roads.    I no longer live in London, but I have always, as my father, been a keen cyclist, and know London’s roads very well, and feel I may have something to contribute to your ongoing inquiry from the point of view of the law-abiding but observant cyclist.  I make my points as briefly as possible:
default1) I do not have figures  for the percentage of cycling fatalities which are caused by lorries turning to the left, with cyclists caught in the blind spot, and cyclists then left with “nowhere to go” other than under the lorry’s wheels.  You may wish to ascertain the percentage of all fatalities who die in this way from experts appearing  to give evidence, if indeed there are such figures available.  However, my own review of newspaper accounts of fatalities over the last few years, along with observation of many near misses on London and other roads, would suggest to me that the percentage is very high.  In turn, this would suggest that priority should be given to this specific problem.
default2) One such solution comes in the form of draft legislation already laid before parliament, albeit via a private members’ bill.  This is the Road Safety Traffic Bill 2011, which recommends that the law be changed to:
defaulta) require the fitting of equipment to heavy goods vehicles to eliminate driver 
defaultblindspots
default and aid driver awareness of cyclists, pedestrians and other road users in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle;
default(b) make other regulations to ensure drivers are trained in using safety equipment as fitted to their vehicles, to improve the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and other road users.
defaultI would ask that the Committee inquire as to why this draft bill got so much support from a wide range of MPs, and then consider whether it is worth taking forward its provisions by another legislative route.  This would of 
defaultof
default course require investment, but  as I noted at the time Alan Leith MP brought the bill before the House, 
default2,500 cyclists are killed or badly injured every year.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultIt’s always seemed odd to me that there is relatively massive investment in rail safety, for example, when a much smaller number are killed or injured on this transport (not that I begrudge this), while cycle deaths and injuries just seem to remain regarded as the collateral
default&#xa0;
defaultdamage of our transport system.
default&#xa0;
default This
default&#xa0;
defaultBill won’t stop cyclists being killed, but it is an important step in the right direction.
default3) While the inves
defaulttment proposed by Alan Leith makes sense, the actions of the Metropolitan Police in the wake of the six fatalities do not.  Far from bringing about safer cycling conditions, the police’s decision to clamp down on the jumping of red lights brings with it the risk of even more fatalities.
defaultLet me take this back to my father’s last experience, and quote from a piece that I wrote yesterday:
defaultHad my dad jumped a red light on his way home from work on December 11th 1979,
default&#xa0;
defaulthe’d probably have lived quite a lot longer. 
default&#xa0;
defaultAs it was, he was a very law abiding man, and 
default&#xa0;
default- as far 
defaultas we know from the 
defaultinquesed
default– he positioned himself precisely at the white stop line, planning then to proceed straightforward towards his tea. 
default&#xa0;
defaultA few seconds later, the lorry came up on his right and, when the lights turned to green, said lorry turned left, my dad had nowhere to go, and that was that – other than the 34 years of grief my mother has lived through, and the pain and guilt that the lorry driver 
default&#xa0;
default(a good man, everyone new everyone in Eccles in those days) took to his own grave.
defaultIt’s not bicycling rocket science. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI’ve ridden the streets of London a lot (though not so much since I moved back up north), and THE key reason cyclists position themselves is advance of red lights, or “jump” them where, at tight corners or where there are pedestrian crossings (there’s something about positioning the other side of these which is just
default&#xa0;
defaulttoo
default&#xa0;
defaultobviously naughty to you average polite cyclist) is that it’s much safer to do that than risk being turned into, with nowhere to go other than under the wheels. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf you’ve noticed London’s roads at all, the pavements tend to be pretty high from the roadside, and are not jumpable on a bike, especially if you’re in clips – it’s the kind of thing experienced cyclists pick up, sometimes subconsciously).
default&#xa0;
defaultPerhaps the problem – to be charitable to the police – is that safety first approach to cycling has developed its own
default&#xa0;
defaulthabitus
default, whereby not even cyclists recognise the legitimacy of their positioning – it’s just what cyclists do in London, and if you’re all kitted out in 
defaultlycra
default and you’re bike is bright and shiny, I understand
default&#xa0;
defaultthat non-cycling police officers and others might interpret red-light passing as cyclist arrogance. 
default&#xa0;
defaultEven some cyclists think that.
default&#xa0;
defaultBut I’ll tell you one thing, as someone who has, perforce, thought this stuff through quite a lot over the years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultIf the police succeed in their attempts to break the cycling safety 
defaulth
defaultabitus
default&#xa0;
defaultin advance of a safer cycling infrastructure, there’ll be a more cyclists crushed by the left turners than they bargained for – helmet or no helmet.
default&#xa0;
defaultThank you for considering my brief submission.  I am happy to provide oral evidence should you think it useful.
