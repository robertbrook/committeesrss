"&#xa0;\nBNI0027&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by HM Government&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nSummary:&#xa0;The Government welcomes the Committee’s examination of this important issue. We recognise the significant challenges that the banking sector in \nNorthern Ireland\n faces, and we are determined to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to help to boost bank lending to businesses. \n&#xa0;\nThe framework the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive set out in our \nBuilding a Prosperous and United Community\n document, announced on 14 June, sets out initiatives in this area and outlines an ongoing mechanism for addressing banking and access to finance issues in \nNorthern Ireland\n. The Government’s evidence below covers each of the seven topics highlighted by the Committee. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(i)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe structure and governance of banks in Northern Ireland&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThere are clearly significant differences in the banking structure in \nNorthern Ireland\n compared to Great Britain (GB). Of the four main banks – \nUlster\n, First Trust, Bank of Ireland and \nDanske\n – three are not UK-owned. First Trust (as part of Allied Irish Banks) and Bank of Ireland are headquartered in \nDublin\n, whilst \nDanske\n is Danish-owned. Some large GB banks such as HSBC and Barclays only have a comparatively small presence in \nNorthern Ireland\n. The strong link between the banking system in \nNorthern Ireland\n and the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n presents particular challenges, given the difficulties faced by the Irish economy in recent years. \n&#xa0;\nThe Chancellor has made clear that the link between our financial systems, which is most pronounced in \nNorthern Ireland\n, was a strong factor in the Government’s decision to provide a bilateral loan to the \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n.  \n&#xa0;\nThe \nUK\n signed an agreement for a bilateral loan of £3.2 billion in December 2010, as part of an €67.5 billion international financial assistance package for \nIreland\n. The \nGovernment expects the loan to be repaid in full and with interest.  \nSweden\n and \nDenmark\n have also provided bilateral loans to \nIreland\n. \n&#xa0;\nThe loan is disbursed in eight tranches of £4\n03 \nmillion, subject to the completion of quarterly programme reviews. The first seven tranches have been disbursed to date.\n&#xa0;\nThe conditions of the bilateral loan also made clear that the funding was subject to the Iri\nsh Government not amending its r\nestr\nucturing p\nlan in a way that would have a material adverse financial impact on the \nUK\n operations of Anglo Irish bank, Allied Irish Banks or the Bank of Ireland. \n \nAs the Chancellor \nsaid when the Loans to Ireland Act was debated in the House of Commons\n, providing the bilateral loan has enabled \nthe Government\n to be part of discussions about the restructuring plan and its impact on the UK subsidiaries of banks which have significant presence in Northern Ireland.\nThe National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) \nis one of \na number of initiatives taken by the Irish Government to address the crisis in Irish banking. \nNAMA was formally established on 21 December 2009. Five institutions (and their subsidiaries) applied to join the NAMA scheme and were designated as participating institutions in February 2010: Allied Irish Banks; Bank of Ireland; Anglo Irish Bank; Irish Nationwide Building Society; and EBS Building Society.\nThe first phase of NAMA’s operation involved the acquisition and transfer of over €71 billion in loan assets involving 850 debtors and more than 11,000 individual loans collateralised by 16,000 individual properties. Approximately two-thirds of the assets backing those loans are located in \nIreland\n and most of the remainder is located in the \nUK\n with smaller concentrations in the \nUS\n and throughout continental \nEurope\n.\nOn the proposal of the Irish Minister for Finance, NAMA set up a Northern Ireland Advisory Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Board in relation to strategy for \nNorthern Ireland\n assets. \nApproximately 3\n per cent \nof NAMAs property profile is \nlocated in Northern Ireland; 36 per cent\n Dublin; 18\n per cent\n Rest of Ireland; 21\n per cent London; 12 per cent\n Rest of GB; and 10\n per cent\n Rest of World.\nIts portfolio i\nn NI is worth €1.3 billion or 4 per cent \nof its total acquisition value of\n €31.8billion. Approximately 70 per cent\n of its NI portfolio is completed property and income producing. By \nthe end of \nMarch 2013, asset sales approved stood at £86.6 million. By the same time, it had approved £123 million in new advances to NI debtors.\n NAMAs stated approach has been to encourage a phased and orderly realisation of its assets in \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;(ii)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \n              \nThe possible break-up of RBS/Ulster Bank \n&#xa0;\nThe Government recognises that RBS, including Ulster Bank, remains weighed down by too many poor assets. The Chancellor announced in his Mansion House speech on 19 June that the Treasury would be examining the case for breaking RBS up and establishing a Bad Bank.\n&#xa0;\nThe Government welcomed the input of the Northern Ireland Executive on the future of RBS, conveyed through its former and current finance ministers, Sammy Wilson and Simon Hamilton. The views of the \nNorthern Ireland\n business community were also considered following on from representations by the Secretary of State for \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\nOn 1 November 2013, RBS announced that it was committing to a new direction for the bank, in order for it to restructure and boost the British and Irish economies. RBS \nwill \ncreate an internal \nbad bank \nand £9 billion of Ulster Bank assets will be transferred into this new structure.\n&#xa0;\nThe Chancellor recently stated that the Government, RBS and the Bank of England are all in agreement on the direction that RBS is heading. \nRBS will focus on its core \nUK\n business\n. \nIt will sell off more of its overseas operations and \ncontinue to reduce \nits investment bank, so it has more capital to support lending to the \nUK\n economy. RBS \nhas also committed\n to becoming the best small business bank in \nthe \nUK\n. \n&#xa0;\nRBS’s operations in \nNorthern Ireland\n \nthrough Ulster Bank, which also operates in \nIreland\n,\n remain an important part of RBS’s core operations and the new direction the \nbank has announced. However, a sustainable operating model needs to be found for it so that it can play its full part in delivering \nsupport to both economies\n. To achieve this, RBS has announced that Ulster Bank will be part of \nits full business review, reporting\n in February 2014, with the aim of identifying a long term viable and sustainable business model\n.\n&#xa0;\nIt is in the \nUK\n’s interest that \nIreland\n has a successful economy and a stable banking system. \nIt is therefore important that Ulster Bank is in a position to support the economy in both \nNorthern Ireland\n \nand \nthe \nRepublic\n of \nIreland\n, through new lending and generating new business.\n&#xa0;\nRBS's 1st November announcement is a positive step in this direction since it will see Ulster Bank remain as an important part of the RBS group, with its balance sheet strengthened by the transfer of problem assets to the internal bad bank. Developing a sustainable business model for Ulster Bank which is capable of\n&#xa0;\nsupporting its cost base may involve some difficult decisions following the forthcoming review, but should ultimately leave Ulster \nBank \nas a stronger bank better able to support lending to business.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(iii)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nThe position of the staff of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation \n&#xa0;\nThe Government has received a number of representations on the question of employees of the former Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which was liquidated by the Irish Government on 7 February 2013.\n&#xa0;\nWe fully acknowledge the concerns of those \nUK\n based employees who face redundancy as a result of this process. As a result of the representations received, \nthe Foreign \nand Commonwealth \nOffice has discussed this issue \nwith the Irish Government.\n \nHowever, whilst the Government is able to pursue requests for clarification, it is important to note that the decision to liquidate the IBRC and the effect this had on employment contracts is a matter for the Irish Government. The Government does not have any jurisdiction in relation to the role currently being played by the Special Liquidators. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(iv)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n              \nAccess to finance, particularly for Small and Medium Enterprises &#xa0;\nThe Government recognises that access to finance remains a significant challenge for SMEs in \nNorthern Ireland\n, as it does across the \nUK\n. The Northern Ireland Department for \nEnterprise\n, Trade and Investment’s Economic Advisory Group (EAG) produced a detailed report on access to finance in \nNorthern Ireland\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe report included the following conclusions:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe measures set out in our \nBuilding a Prosperous and United Community\n package provide a comprehensive framework within which the Government intends to co-ordinate its efforts to boost lending to businesses in \nNorthern Ireland\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(v)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n       Lack of effectiveness of national initiatives to help aid economic recovery&#xa0;\nUK\n wide lending schemes set-up by the Government play an important role in providing credit to businesses and individuals in \nNorthern Ireland\n. Ulster Bank \nhas \nannounced that it ha\ns\n approved \nnearly £8\n0 million of loans through the Funding for Lending Scheme\n (FLS)\n, helping \nover 5\n00 businesses in \nNorthern Ireland\n. FLS has \nenabled Ulster Bank to establish a new Funding for Lending deal, under which customers will not be charged an arrangement fee for any new loans drawn under the scheme.  \n&#xa0;\nThe Enterprise Finance Guarantee\n Scheme (EFG) has provided 195\n loans\n amounting to £27.66 million\n \nin \nNorthern Ireland\n since May 2010\n. \nIn addition to these national schemes, the Northern Ireland Executive has its own £100 million ‘Access to Finance Strategy’, which incorporates a number of smaller schemes designed to boost lending. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, the Government accepts that \nUK\n wide schemes to boost lending have not always been as effective in \nNorthern Ireland\n as they have been elsewhere in the \nUK\n. The take-up of EFG is lower in \nNorthern Ireland\n than anywhere else in the \nUK\n. The framework we set out in \nBuilding a Prosperous and United Community\n is intended to provide a mechanism to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring and evaluation of national schemes to ensure that they work more effectively in \nNorthern Ireland\n in future.\n&#xa0;\nThe package also makes specific proposals on improving existing schemes to increase their impact in \nNorthern Ireland\n. We have fulfilled our commitment in the package to extend the Start-up Loans scheme to \nNorthern Ireland\n. Delivery partners for this scheme have been agreed and the first Start-up Loans have already been made to young entrepreneurs with seven loans approved to the value of £30,000 by the end of October 2013. The package includes a commitment to work to ensure that \nNorthern Ireland\n benefits from a pilot extension to the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme, aimed at addressing loan affordability. We have also committed to continuing to work with the remaining banks to encourage their participation in the Funding for Lending Scheme. \n&#xa0;\nIt is important to note that improving the effectiveness of these schemes cannot be achieved by the Government alone. We would welcome the Committee’s analysis of how banks in \nNorthern Ireland\n are promoting, marketing and championing schemes such as \nEFG,\n and the extent to which the remaining banks are proactively seeking to address any issues holding them back from joining the Funding for Lending Scheme. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(vi)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n           \nLack of availability of detailed regional lending data&#xa0;\nThe lack of availability of lending data in \nNorthern Ireland\n presents significant challenges for policy makers. The current position is that the Northern Ireland Executive’s Department for Finance and Personnel (\nDfP\n) and the Economic Advisory Group (EAG) receive aggregate lending data privately from the British Bankers Association (BBA). This information is provided on a confidential basis and is not published. \n&#xa0;\nThe Government welcomes the Committee’s examination of this issue and intends to work closely with the BBA, banks, and the Northern Ireland Executive to address it. Our objective as far as possible would be to ensure parity in the availability of lending data across the \nUK\n, including in \nNorthern Ireland\n. The Government recently announced that, from next year, businesses in GB will be able to see where banks are lending in the country, down to postcode level. The data will be published by the BBA and Council for Mortgage Lenders on a quarterly basis. The first dataset will cover seven major lenders in GB but we have already made clear that we expect more lenders to sign up to publishing their data in future.\n&#xa0;\nThe Secretary of State for \nNorthern Ireland\n has been working with the Northern Ireland Executive to seek to persuade banks to provide better data on lending in \nNorthern Ireland\n. On 11 September 2013 \nshe and Finance Minister, Simon Hamilton, met represent\nat\nives of the British Bankers' Association to explain their concerns on this issue.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n(vii)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n \n          \nAccess to banking in rural communities&#xa0;\nIt is essential that local communities have access to suitable and affordable banking services. The Government wants to see greater competition in the banking sector, with more banks challenging the large incumbents. If communities or entrepreneurs want to set up a bank, either to serve their local community or to compete nationally, and can do this responsibly, Government or regulators should not be an obstacle to this.\n&#xa0;\nThat is why the Government asked the \nprevious\n financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to review the process for authorising new banks, as well the regulatory requirements placed on new and smaller banks. The FSA published the report on this work in March 2013, and brought forward significant improvements to make it easier for new banks to enter the market and compete. These changes have been put into effect by the new financial services regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and should have a real impact on competition.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe Government also believes that Post Offices also have a crucial role to play in ensuring rural communities can access banking services.  In 2010, the Government published its Post Office policy statement ‘Securing the Post Office network in the digital age’, which sets out our commitment to maintain a geographically comprehensive Post Office network with at least 11,500 branches.  Of these, 484 are in \nNorthern Ireland\n.  The Government is providing £1.34 billion to maintain and modernise the post office network across the \nUK\n and to ensure that it continues to meet the Government access-criteria that see, for example, 93 per cent of the population within one mile of a post office branch.\n&#xa0;\nSome 95 per cent of \nUK\n current account customers can access their cash at post office counters.  This includes the accounts of Bank of Ireland, First Trust, \nUlster\n, and \nDanske\n.  The Post Office network is larger than that of all the high street banks combined, and this service provides vital access to cash for many communities that no longer have a high street bank branch. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\nPage \n1\n of \n8\n"
