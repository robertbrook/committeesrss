[normal]&#xa0;[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Memorandum to the Public Administration Select Committee by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman  [bold]November 2013[bold]&#xa0;[bold]The [bold]ambition[bold] that [bold]sits at the heart of [bold]the[bold] five-year strategy[bold] [bold]we began to deliver in April 2013 [bold]is to have more impact for more people[bold].  Further to our memorandum of August 2013, we would like to update the Committee on the progress we have made in the last five months to make our vision real.[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Helping more people by investigating more complaints[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Feedback from our customers, 
[normal]our staff 
[normal]and from 
[normal]P
[normal]arliament
[normal] has shown us that there is a real appetite for change. 
[normal] 
[normal]In particular, our research tells us that an investigation - with its thorough explanation of what happened and the certainty of a final adj
[normal]udication - is what people
[normal] want. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Last year we listened to 
[normal]a wid
[normal]e range of our 
[normal]customers
[normal], including those who
[normal] 
[normal]were frustrated and distressed by our decision not to investigate their complaint. 
[normal]They profoundly affected our thinking and informed our ambition to improve our service.  
[normal]Responding to 
[normal]their f
[normal]eedback
[normal] we ha
[normal]v
[normal]e worked hard to increase the
[normal] number of 
[normal]complaints we take forward for investigation
[normal]. 
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]This time last year we had completed 219
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]investigations; 
[normal]so far 
[normal]this year we have 
[normal]already 
[normal]concluded 869. This means th
[normal]at four times as many people are
[normal] now receiving a formal, final adjudication on their 
[normal]complaint. We
[normal] have achieved this by removing 
[normal]a lengthy assessment process to determine whether or not to take a complaint on for investigation
[normal], and by redeploying some of the staff involved in those assessments to carry out investigations.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]An investigation provides both the complainant and service provider with a rigorous account of what happened. It formally engages the service provider (allowing them to respond to, and learn from, the complaint), and gives the complainant sight of the findings (and an opportunity to provide feedback on them) before they are finalised. 
[normal]The impact is that we are now providing more people with an independent, impar
[normal]tial and formal decision
[normal] on their complaint and achieving a definitive closure for all parties.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal] We believe this is 
[normal]what Parliament intended when it established the Ombudsman service as the final stage of the complaints process.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Given 
[normal]that we are now taking on a much greater number o
[normal]f investigations, it is 
[normal]unsurprising that the proportion of investigations where we up
[normal]hold the complaint has reduced (from 86% in 2012/13 to 44% for the year so far).  This brings us more
[normal] into line with other Ombudsmen, e.g. 
[normal]the uphold rate for the Local Government Ombudsman
[normal] in 2012/13 was 41
[normal]%
[normal].   
[normal]I
[normal]n total 
[normal]t
[normal]he number of complaints we uphold 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]has significantly increased: 
[normal] 
[normal]we have upheld 
[normal]343
[normal] 
[normal]so far 
[normal]this year, compared to 
[normal]187
[normal] in the 
[normal]over the same time period last 
[normal]year.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Customer satisfaction has remained at the same levels: 98% 
[normal]amongst those whose complaint
[normal]s
[normal] w
[normal]ere
[normal] investigated and upheld 
[normal]and 57%
[normal] amongst those whose complaint
[normal]s
[normal] w
[normal]ere
[normal] investigat
[normal]ed
[normal] and not upheld.
[normal] Both figures compare favourably with satisfaction ratings achieved by 
[normal]other Ombudsman 
[normal]services
[normal] 
[normal]whose data is publicly available
[normal], such as the Financial Ombudsman Service
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In
[normal] 2013/14 we expect to have the capacity to investigate and resolve 4,000 cases, with a view to resolving even more in the longer term.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Further information about our performance so far this year is contained in the dashboard at the end of this memorandum.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Working with others and using what we learn to help them make public services better[bold]              [bold]&#xa0;[bold]When things go wrong people 
[normal]often 
[normal]tell us they do not want the same thing to happen to someone else. Yet two thirds of people who make complaints say their complaint does not make a difference. We want to honour people’s ambition for their complaint to lead to service improvements. For us, h
[normal]aving
[normal] more impact for more people includes sharing the rich intellige
[normal]nce and systemic learning from our casework 
[normal]to drive improvement across public and health services. 
[normal]  
[normal]Since August we have shown how the 
[normal]learning from the 
[normal]investigation of 
[normal]one or 
[normal]a relatively small number of com
[normal]plaints 
[normal]can 
[normal]have an impact for many.   
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]The ‘multiplier effect’ of our work can most clearly be seen in 
[normal]Time to Act. Severe sepsis: rapid diagnosis and treatment saves lives
[normal].  [bold]Published
[normal] [bold]in September, our report highlighted
[normal] the need to improve awareness of sepsis - a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body’s immune system overreacts to infection. 
[normal]  
[normal]The UK Sepsis Trust estimate 12
[normal],
[normal]500 lives a year could be saved through 
[normal]earli
[normal]er diagnosis and treatment.  W
[normal]e 
[normal]have worked closely
[normal] with the Trust, NHS England and
[normal] NICE (National Institute for Health and 
[normal]Care
[normal] 
[normal]Excellence)
[normal] to come up with recommendations that 
[normal]stick, and
[normal] which 
[normal]NHS England, 
[normal]t
[normal]he Royal Colleges and 
[normal]NICE and 
[normal]have
[normal] already agreed to take forward
[normal]. 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]A joint investigation
[normal], published in November 
[normal]by ourselves and the Local Government Ombudsman
[normal],
[normal] into 
[normal]Warrington Metropolitan Borough Council and the then NHS Warrington
[normal], led to speech and language therapy being restored to young people in the area. 
[normal] 
[normal]The issue was brought to light by the parents of one of the teenagers whose son had stopped receiving the specialist therapy he was entitled to as part of his statement of special educational needs
[normal].  
[normal]We 
[normal]uncovered a further 14 other teenagers similarly affected by the cuts.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]In December we will be publishing a report 
[normal]Midwifery supervision and regulation: recommendations for change.  
[normal]This is based on 
[normal]our investigations 
[normal]following the deaths of three babies and a mother at Morecambe Bay NHS Hospital Trust.
[normal] 
[normal]Current midwifery supervision arrangements at the local level are at risk of not operating in the interests of the safety of mothers and babies. We argue this must change
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Leading the way to make the complaints system better[bold]W
[normal]e have started a significant programme of
[normal] work to use our experience, 
[normal]expertise
[normal] and insight
[normal] to help make the complaints system better.  
[normal] 
[normal]F
[normal]ollowing the publication of the report of the 
[normal]Francis inquiry
[normal] 
[normal]our focus
[normal] has been on the 
[normal]new 
[normal]health landscape
[normal] as
[normal] this provides us with a real 
[normal]opportunity to have a long term impact.
[normal]Between April and August 2013 we published three major pieces of research into NHS complaints - 
[normal]The NHS hospital complaints system – a case for urgent treatment?,
[normal] 
[normal]NHS Governance of Complaints Handling
[normal] 
[normal]and 
[normal]Designing Good Together: transforming hospital complaint handling
[normal].  Together these offered our perspective on what is wrong with the hospital complaints system, but more importantly what can be done to improve it.
[normal]  We spoke of the 
[normal]“toxic cocktail” of patients’ and carers’ reluctance to complain, coupled with a culture of defensiveness by NHS organisations. 
[normal]  And we worked with 
[normal]patients, complainants, carers and NHS staff to address the issues behind the “toxic cocktail” head on.
[normal]Since then we have seen the publication by Ann Clwyd MP and Professor Tricia Hart  of their review of the NHS hospital complaints system, 
[normal]Putting Patients Back in the Picture
[normal] 
[normal] and the Government’s response to the Francis inquiry, 
[normal]Hard Truths
[normal].
[normal]  Change in the NHS cannot happen from the centre.  
[normal]We welcome
[normal] the Secretary of State echoing our call for Boards to report quarterly on complaints.  
[normal]If Boards
[normal] can learn more from complaints, then we would see real progress.  
[normal]We also welcome
[normal] the 
[normal]Government’s 
[normal]recognition of our ambition to increase signi
[normal]ficantly the number of cases we take
[normal] on
[normal] for investigation
[normal], and our valuable role helping the health system to interrogate and learn lessons from complaints.
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Looking ahead, 
[normal]t
[normal]ogether with Healthwatch England and the Department of Health, we are developing a patient-led vision and expectations for
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]complaints handling in the NHS
[normal]. 
[normal]  W
[normal]e will 
[normal]also actively support the
[normal] Cabinet Office
[normal] 
[normal]review
[normal] of the use of complaints to im
[normal]prove public services which was
[normal] 
[normal]announced by Oliver Letwin MP at his appearance before the Committee
[normal] in October
[normal].   We are pleased that this is now being seriously considered and that a programme of work, championed by the Minister, has been initiated to deliver it.
