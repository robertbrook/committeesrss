"&#xa0;\nNorth Craven Heritage Trust – Written evidence&#xa0;I am writing as Chairman of the North Craven Heritage Trust, a charity in North Yorkshire concerned with the conservation of our heritage in the district of North Craven.\n&#xa0;\nWe have campaigned, successfully, for restriction  of the use of bridleways and Green lanes in our area of the Yorkshire Dales National Park to walkers, horse riders and cyclists – and specifically for the exclusion of motorbikes, 4 x 4 vehicles and other motorised vehicles (except those requiring access, such as farmers).\n&#xa0;\nMany, but not all, of these Byways have become closed to motorised vehicles to the great benefit of the environment and those seeking peace and quiet in an area of outstanding natural beauty. \n&#xa0;\nTo ensure that this situation is maintained and extended to all of these Byways we would like the Deregulation Bill to include the following two clauses:\n&#xa0;\n1.   All unsealed Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATs), and all unsealed Unclassified County Roads (UCRs)\n should be recognised as not being part of the ordinary roads network, and should be re-classified as Restricted Byways.\n&#xa0;\n2.  When a local authority declines to impose a traffic regulation order that is widely-supported by the public, there should be a right of appeal, either to an independent inspector, or a magistrate.\n&#xa0;\nIn conclusion we would like to say that we expressly support the formal submissions made by The Green Lanes Environmental Action Group (GLEAM), by the Green Lanes Protection Group (GLPG), by the Peak District Green Lanes Alliance (PDGLA), and the Yorkshire Dales Green Lanes Alliance (YDGLA).  \n&#xa0;\nJ.
