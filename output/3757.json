"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from the LGA (CYS0025)\n&#xa0;About the Local Government Association&#xa0;\nThe \nLocal Government Association (LGA)\n is the national voice of local government.  We work with councils to support, promote and improve local government.\n&#xa0;\nWe are a politically-led, cross party organisation which works on behalf of councils to\n ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government.  We aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems. The LGA\n covers every p\nart of England and Wales\n, supporting local government as the most efficient and accountable part of the public sector.\n&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nQ: Is cycling safe, particularly in towns and cities?&#xa0;\nThe risks of cycling need to be carefully considered. For instance, \nany consideration should involve a detailed\n analysis of the causes of recent cycling deaths. Any risk involved in cycling needs to be weighed against the health implications of not \nengaging in exercise\n. Consideration also needs to be given of the impact of journeys being taken by car or public transport, if they are not taken by bicycle. For example, this could have a knock on effect \nin terms of air quality and road safety\n. \n&#xa0;\nEncoura\nging cycling and walking is vital if we are to encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce the strain \no\nn the NHS. It is also vital if we are to avoid \nthe \ngridlock in our towns and cities that could arise if current traffic projections \n(\n41 per cent increase i\nn traffic on local roads by 2040\n)\n \ncome to \nfruition\n&#xa0;\nThe appropriate question is can cycling be made safer, and if so, can that be funded\n?\n&#xa0;\nQ: What could central and local government do to improve cycling safety?&#xa0;\nPart 6Traffic Management Act 2004: Civil enforcement of traffic contraventions&#xa0;One of the quickest and simplest measures the \nG\novernment could take to improve cycling safety would be to implement \nP\nart 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004\n. This would \nallow councils outside London to enforce cycle lanes and to enforce \nagainst \nvarious \nother \ntraffic offences (for example banned turns)\n, which can \ncause\n particular danger to cyclists\n.\n&#xa0;The chief issue for councils in requesting these powers is traffic manage\nment, which would be enhanced by enforcing banned turns and box junctions. There will be no obligation on councils to adopt these powers and there will be a cost in doing so at any particular location. This will encourage councils to adopt the powers only \nwhere they think they will make a difference to congestion and safety, including that of cyclists. \n&#xa0;\nThe enforcement of cycle lanes would help promote cycling and increase safety. In 2011 accidents caused by banned turns or wrong direction driving (one per\n cent of all accidents) cost an estimated £83.7m\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe LGA has consistently called for the implementation of \nP\nart 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 since that \nlegislation\n \nachieved Royal Assent\n \nwas passed. \nThe 2011 report on congestion by the House of \nCommons Transport Select Committee argued that ‘Making the most of the road capacity for all road users requires active management of the road network by the highway authorities and they need the appropriate tools to do that…\n&#xa0;\nWe can see no reason why Part \n6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 should not be fully commenced to enable local authorities to deal more effectively with moving traffic contraventions and we recommend that the Government bring this part of the Act into force, by 2013’\n.\n&#xa0;\nThe Welsh Gov\nernment has taken action to implement Part 6 this year and the DfT has been considering submission\ns\n from the LGA\n,\n and from Nottingham and Sheffield councils\n,\n demonstrating the benefits of the legislation\n, since \nlast December\n. \n \n&#xa0;\nRoad Maintenance &#xa0;\nRoad maintenance is also an issue of concern when it comes to safety. Decades of underfunding, severe winters and widespread flooding has left large swathes of our roads in disrepair, with many councils struggling to move beyond simply patching up a deteri\norating network. \n&#xa0;\nCurrent funding for road maintenance is £829m a year short of the level needed to prevent the 98 per cent of roads maintained \nby councils \nfrom\n deteriorating further and even if funding was adequate it would take more than a decade to cle\nar the backlog of repairs.\n Increased highways maintenance funding from 2015 will still leave a shortfall of over half a billion pounds a year. \n&#xa0;\nL\nocal government does not have the money \nto maintain its highways \ndue to the funding cuts it has endured – 43%\n across this current Parliament. We need a radical new solution to ensure a sustainable and reliable model of local government for the future (see funding section at the end of this submission).\n&#xa0;\nTransport Devolution&#xa0;\nCycling is a great example of the need\n for effective transport devolution\n – being both an example of the need to see transport as a whole and of the interaction between transport and other policies.\n&#xa0;\nCycling can play a key role in solving transport problems. \nAt its most dramatic, this can mean\n that when\n motorway congestion is caused by short distance commuter traffic, encouraging cycling and public transport use by commuters may prove cheaper and more effective means of reducing that congestion than widening the motorway.\n But cycling can also b\ne part of a \ntransport\n strategy on a smaller scale, opening up access to jobs and services in areas where demand is too \ndiffuse\n or sporadic to justi\nfy a subsidis\ned bus service. \n&#xa0;\nCycling is also a vital part of encouraging healthy \ncommunities.\n Local\n governm\nent needs to be able to plan local transport facilities whilst considering other interrelated issues such as health and wellbeing, environment and planning. For example, councils may want to encourage cycling to school and this could influence such diverse\n activities as:\n&#xa0;\nTo be effective, the promotion of cycling needs to go hand in hand with effective traffic management and public transport provision to minimi\ns\ne other traffic and ensure it does not deter cyclists. \n&#xa0;\nAt the same time we need to recognize that places are different, the local geography will have some influence on the popularity of cycling and the needs of rural and urban areas will be different. \nCycling needs to be promoted in a way that is locally relevant.&#xa0;\nIn the absence of effective devolution, the DfT’s National Traffic Model predicts that while cycle use will rise from 2.9\n \nb\nillio\nn miles in 2010 to 3.4\n \nb\nillion\n miles in 2015, it will fall back to almost the 2010 level by 2025 with subsequent growth at such a low level it represents a decline relative to population, assuming that current policy remains unchanged. This suggests that the \nG\novernment will fail to mee\nt its existing cycling targets. While this is only a projection based on the continuation of existing policy\n,\n there is a danger that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy with projected low use justifying a decline in funding. Experience in London (where c\nar traffic reduced five times as much between 2003 and 2010 as DfT had predicted) shows that where local government has the power and funding to manage traffic effectively and provide alternatives, projected traffic growth does not have to be a self-fulfil\nling prophecy.\n&#xa0;Councils need to be given greater local control over how money is spent, based on place and need\n. This will allow them to take a holistic approach to transport in their area, including all the different elements such as rail, roads, buses\n, cycling etc. This would also help address the problems with transport funding. \n&#xa0;\nLeadership, commitment and capacity in local government &#xa0;\nUp and down the country councils have embarked on a huge range of initiatives to support cyclists, such as:\n&#xa0;\nThe LGA would be willing to source specific examples should that be of interest to the Committee. \n&#xa0;\nHowever, councils have been maintaining a chronically underfunded road system for many years which, coupled with severe funding cuts from central government\n, means resources for new cycling initiatives or overhauls of road layout and signage are extremely stretched in many areas at the moment.\n&#xa0;\nCouncils work with schools and other groups to provide cycling proficiency schemes. However, some councils find the \nrequirements of the top down government init\niatives like Bikeability too pre\nscriptive and bureaucratic for their needs, opting instead for local alternatives which better suit their communities.\n&#xa0;\nThe Local Sustainable Transport Fund has funded a number of \ncycling initiatives. This is being subsumed into the Local Growth Fund from 2015 and it remains to be seen whether \ncycling will continue to receive funding under the new arrangements.\n \n&#xa0;\nThe financial reality&#xa0;\nIn the period of the current Parliament, local \ngovernment’s core funding will fall by 43 per cent.  At the same time funding pressures are increasing due to our ageing population pushing up demand for adult social care services such as home care for the elderly and infirm, the number of children in car\ne doubling and waste \nmanagement costs rising. LGA analysis shows that these three areas of spending will soak up an ever-larger share of council budgets. Other services – transport, leisure, culture, planning and economic development – will need to accommo\ndate the further cuts meaning that spending in these areas will fall by 2019-20\n. There will be a funding gap of £15.6 billion by 2020. LGA analysis modelling the future of local government finance revealed that the financial black hole facing local government is widening by £2.1 billion per year.   To give local authorities greater financial stability, the LGA issued a submission to HM Treasury ahead of the Autumn Statement calling for the Government:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWhitehall \nmust consider radical new approaches\n to the way local government is funded and give greater control to councils so that spend can be based on local need.\n&#xa0;\nQ: Would it be desirable and feasible to segregate cyclists from other road users, including, for example, by prohibiting HGVs from entering city centres at peak hours?&#xa0;\nThis is a decision that councils should be free to take at a local level. Every area is different, with individual characteristics and circumstances that need to be considered. Central\n government is not in a position to make such local-based decisions. \n&#xa0;\nNovember 2013\n&#xa0;\n1\n&#xa0;\n \nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploa\nds/attachment_data/file/212474/road-transport-forecasts-2013.pdf\n, Table 1.
