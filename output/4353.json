"&#xa0;\nDIS 7&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence submitted by Omara Khan Muneeb, Organization Development And Ability Organization Dao&#xa0;\nWe would welcome DFID work for the social reintegration, physical rehabilitation and livelihoods of  persons with disabilities in Afghanistan.   I have worked in the field of disability for the last 23 years in Afghanistan but I have never heard about DFID assistance for persons with disabilities.  I have heard that they work in other areas and support the Afghan government but I have never seen them to be involved in disability related work.\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
