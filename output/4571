defaultThe Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) 
defaultrepresents 
default18
default,000 heads, principals, deputies, vice-principals, assistant heads, business managers and other senior staff of 
defaultmaintained
default and independent schools and colleges throughout the UK. ASCL has members in more than 90 per cent of secondary schools and colleges o
defaultf all types, responsible for the education of more than four million young people. This places the association in a unique position to consider this issue from the viewpoint of the leaders of secondary schools and of colleges.

default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultASCL welcomes this inquiry as
default a timely opportunity for much needed reflection on these policies.
default3
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultASCL has never opposed the idea of academy schools
default, and the majority of ASCL members now lead academies. 
defaultASCL members also lead
default the majority of colleges (FE and sixth f
defaultorm) and independents schools affiliated with HMC, GSA and the Society of Heads, the situations of which are in many ways similar t
defaulto
default that of academies.
default4
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultASCL has always argued in favour of subsidiarity: decisions being made at the ‘lowest’ level possible co
defaultnsistent with efficient use of resources. This implies a greater degree of autonomy than schools have traditionally enjoyed, even after the introduction of local management of schools in the 1990s.
default5
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultMost ASCL members value extra freedom for them and their g
defaultovernors to make decisions in the interests of their students
default. In the view of ASCL they are better placed 
defaultthan either local or central government 
defaultto make such decisions. When policies are made remotely, and by officials however intelligent and well-meaning
default who do not have to operate them on a daily basis with real children, they often result in waste and poor outcomes.
default6
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe academy project has on the whole been successful in the sense that the majority of schools in the secondary sector ar
defaulte now academies. An
defaultd b
defaultecoming an academy has helped some schools to 
defaultmake 
defaultsignificant improvement
defaults
default. But by no means
default all academies have been successful, nor have all the successful maintained schools 
defaultchosen to become academies. The picture is very complex, and 
defaultvery different 
defaulti
defaultn different parts of the country
default.
default&#xa0;
default7
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile ASCL is generally positive about 
defaultacademies t
defaulthere are
default 
defaulta number of contrary 
defaultor complicating 
defaultfactors which should be taken into account when considering the academy project in detail: 
default8
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile many 
defaultschool 
defaultleaders
default have been content for their schools to leave local authority ownership, a significant minority, whose local authorities are more effective and supportive, have resisted this.
default Many, supported by their governors and local communities, continue to do 
defaultso.
default9
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultNote the caveat
default in paragraph 
default4
default above
default; there are some issues that do require regulation
default,
default or decisions 
defaultthat are binding over a wider area
default, if there is not to be w
defaultasteful duplication, gaps in provision, bad practice driving out good, and a lack of coherence in the public service.
default10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a danger of atomisation, with 
defaultthe most vulnerable young people being lost, along with 
defaultthe concept of a public education service
default,
default 
defaultin a welter of competing schools. The great majority of school leaders do not want that and continue exercise system leadership, both individually by working outside their own institution more or less formally, and via the policies they steer their 
defaultschool 
defaultor 
defaultacademy towards.
default11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultASCL has long encouraged partnership between schools and colleges of all kinds, and continues to do so. 
defaultThis can help to recreate a sense of wider community and commitment to the best education for all. 
defaultIn our experience this is most 
defaulteffective when entered into freely as a ‘bottom up’ initiative
default, which of course is more likely when schools have greater autonomy
default. There is no reason why 
defaultpartnership working 
defaultshould 
defaultnot continue in the academy era, but if it is to be as effective and widesp
defaultread as it can be 
defaultneither 
defaultregulation
default nor 
defaultaccountability systems
default should 
defaultdiscourage it
default, as they often do now
default.
default12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLeaders in schools of all kinds see themselves as primarily accountable to the children that attend the school and their parents. That is right, but
default there is also a need to account for the use of public funds, and to 
defaulttake responsibility for the loc
defaultal education system as a whole.
default13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are also many open questions about who should decide if intervention is needed in a failing academy, how such decision
defaults can be made, and what support can then be made available. See the discussion of a possible ‘middle tier’ in paragraphs 
default18
defaultand 
default19
default below.
default&#xa0;
default14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultWhile the concept of academy schools has been welcomed by a majority of school leaders, there has been concern about 
defaulthow 
defaultthe change to academy status takes place. Those sc
defaulthools that freely chose to become academies, ‘converter academies’, 
defaultare generally content, many of those 
defaultschools 
defaultthat had, or felt they had, no choice are less so. 
default15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultASCL would strongly urge that decisions 
defaultabout change of school status 
defaultsho
defaultuld be taken by sc
defaulthool governing bodies
default, and not under duress. The drive to move schools to academy status has become a policy imperative, and there have been cases of the DfE effectively forcing schools to become academies. This has especially applied to schools in more challenging areas (‘con
defaultstrained schools’) that have failed to reach arbitrary floor targets. Other routes to improving schools in such situations have worked 
defaultwell 
defaultin some instances and 
defaultwhen favoured locally 
defaultshould be given more consideration.
default&#xa0;
default16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome sponsors, especia
defaultlly when schools have had little or no choice of sponsor, have added no value while taking funds from the school budget, and in a few cases have imposed eccentric ideas of their own with little regard to educational thinking or educational values. There is
default a need to impose stricter conditions on what organisations can become sponsors. On the whole, the system has worked best when sponsors have been other educational institutions (other schools, colleges, universities).
default17
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultASCL would urge that school governing 
defaultbodies should decide whether on becoming an academy their school should have a sponsor, and choose the sponsor if there is to be one.
default18
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs the majority of secondary schools are now academies, and more are following suit
default,
default there is a question about the capacit
defaulty of the DfE and the EFA to support and fund them. It is generally accepted that it is not good practice to run significant numbers of local organisations directly from Whitehall. That raises a question of what types of organisation should be put in place 
default(either by government or by the schools themselves) to be a ‘middle tier’ between national government and individual academies.
default19
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a danger that these ch
defaultanges will effectively remove local authoritie
defaults from education
default, not replace them,
default and 
defaultso 
defaultactually
default centralise the system. The Secretary of State for 
defaultEducation 
defaultneeds to adopt a self-denying ordinance to prevent himself (and so far as possible his successors) from interference in decisions that should be better taken at lower levels.
default20
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere are still some
default uncertainties about the regulations under which academies work. For example, the question of who is the employer of staff in a school should be clear, it should be the governing body, but some trades unions are continuing to take national action in such s
defaultchools in dispute with the Secretary of State.
default21
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe regulation
default, accountability and funding
default of academies and schools of other kinds (and so
default far as possible colleges) need
default to be brought into better alignment. There remain a number of anomalies.
default&#xa0;
default22
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAgain 
defaultASCL does not oppose 
defaultchains 
defaultper se
default, and some are working well. However, some have imposed great restriction on local decision-making, making the governing body, head teacher and other leaders follow a ‘formula’
default,
default or imposing policies decided by the chain. T
defaulthis works against the principle of subsidiarity, leaves local leadership in some cases with less freedom than when 
defaultmaintain
defaulted by a local authority, and raises questions about the accountability of chains.
default23
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome chains have blocked local partnership working 
defaultby requiring their schools to partner only with other members of the chain, often at a distance. In some cases this has prevented potentially valuable local partnerships from forming at all.
default24
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOn the whole it is the smaller chains, and those with a more loca
defaultl focus, that are seen as of value by local school leaders of the academies that make them up. Those that are larger and have schools in widely separated locations are seen as more controlling, less supportive and less accountable.
default25
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a place for cha
defaultins of academies, but ASCL would not see them as the norm, or the answer to the ‘middle tier’ question.
default&#xa0;
default26
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAgain ASCL does not oppose the idea of free schools as such. At present
default,
default once a free school is established it becomes an academy like any 
defaultother. 
defaultThere are many issues, however, about the way that the free schools policy has been promoted, the way free schools have come into being, and the lack of planning or sufficiently effective regulation.
default27
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe key issue is how free schools are agreed. The
defaultre has been little attempt so far to consider the effect of setting up a free school in a locality on the schools that already serve it, and on the local education system as a whole. Where there is a shortage of places setting up a free school might well b
defaulte a sensible move, but where there is a surplus of places consideration should be given to diseconomies of scale. 
defaultI
defaultf the establishment of a free school leads to other schools closing there will be expensive public buildings surplus to requirement. And
default,
default 
defaultmos
defaultt importantly
default,
default 
defaultyoung people will certainly suffer while such a shaking out is taking place.
default28
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe free school policy has undermined attempts to plan school places. 
defaultIt is accepted that f
defaultor there to be parental choice there must be some surplus
default places, but these surplus places are expensive, and a charge upon the public purse. They therefore need to be as few as compatible with reasonable choice, but in some cases free schools have been agreed in areas that already have a 
defaultlarge 
defaultsurplus of places
default.
default29
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is a great deal of resentment amongst school leaders of existing schools of all kinds about the favourable funding that free schools have received. Significant capital sums have been devoted to setting up new schools, when in some cases those nearb
defaulty have a longstanding unmet need for capital spending to make their buildings fit for purpose.
default30
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultLikewise, revenue funding of free schools to planned numbers
default when their places have often not been filled has meant their pupils being funded at higher rates than in nearby schools struggling with very tight budgets. A period of austerity is not a good time for such an experiment.
default There is a need to quickly bring f
defaultree school funding into alignment with a fair funding formula that we hope to see for all publicly funded schools.
default31
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultEven more than for academy sponsors, much greater ‘vetting’ of free school sponsors is required. There have already been instances of free sc
defaulthools being set up for reasons that have little to do with education by groups that not only lack educational expertise but make no effort to acquire any. Such schools will fail, and will damage children’s education and life chances while doing so.
default32
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSome fr
defaultee schools will no doubt succeed, and join the family of schools in their area. Their leaders are also mostly ASCL members. Such schools will in a few years be little different
default from the academies around them.
default&#xa0;
default33
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultI hope that this is of value to your inquiry, 
defaultASCL is willing to be further consulted and to assist in any way that it can.
