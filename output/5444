defaultOur response focuses on your request for evidence on the Government’s new approach to Tax Policy Making, and in particular 
defaultI would like to draw your attention to the Tax Impact Assessment process. The FSB published a report in 2012 which considered the wor
defaultk of the Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC) and
default regulatory reform
default. The FSB supports the work of the RPC as we believe that it ensures that there is transparency and independent scrutiny within regulatory development. 
default&#xa0;
default4. 
defaultThere is an argument that tax compl
defaultiance is very different to regulation and therefore tax needs to be kept outside of the RPC process. This is an argument that the FSB disagrees with. For business, tax administration is a compliance 
defaultburde
defaultn in the same way as regulation
default and our surveys show that in fact tax compliance ranks above regulation in terms of compliance burdens
default. While tax decisions themselves should be kept outside of the RPC process – the level and type of tax – we believe that any decision relating to tax adm
defaultinistration and the process of collecting tax should be subject to external scrutiny. 
defaultWe also understand that there will be instances where exemptions to this rule might be necessary. 
default&#xa0;
default5. 
defaultWhile the FSB recognises the important role that the Administrative
default Burden Advisory Board plays in investigating specific issues, and undertaking inquiries it does not undertake an independent, external scrutiny process of all tax impact assessments, in the way the RPC could. This is a specific process which requires a sy
defaultstematic approach to all impact assessments and results in a formal opinion o
defaultn
default the quality of the impact assessment which is accessible to all.
default&#xa0;
default6
default. 
defaultThere are two key changes that could be made. Firstly, all tax impact assessments should be subjected to ind
defaultependent scrutiny at both consultation and final stage by a body external to HMRC – as is the case for all other Government departments. We believe that this should be done by the RPC. They would have the expertise to be able to fully scrutinise the impact
default 
defaultassessment and understand how businesses will implement the change. The opinion of this body should be made public at the end of the process. 
default&#xa0;
default7
default. 
defaultSecondly 
defaultwe suggest that 
defaultthere are aspects of a regulatory impact assessment that could be included in a
defaultll
default t
defaultax impact assessment in a more significant way. These sections are: 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8
default. 
defaultMany of these aspects will be included in the consultation document but not in the tax impact assessment. We believe that this infor
defaultmation could ensure that all tax policy changes are fully thought through and scrutinised. In the long-term these suggested changes could mean that reviews such as that which the 
defaultOffice of Tax simplification (
defaultOTS
default)
default has undertaken would not be necessary. Get
defaultting tax policy right fr
defaultom the outset is the next step.
default&#xa0;
default9
default. 
defaultFinally the FSB would like Government to consider bringing tax administration into scope of the Regulatory budget system ‘One-in Two-out’. Businesses regard tax administration as an area of ‘red t
defaultape’.  To deliver tangible reductions to the compliance burdens that businesses face, 
defaultand to encourage simplification of the tax system that we all desire, 
defaultGovernment should introduce discipline to the development of tax systems by subjecting changes to a 
defaulttight budget. 
default&#xa0;
defaultI hope that these comments are helpful.
