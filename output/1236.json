"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Ian Melville Davies&#xa0;\nThis submission is from Ian Melville Davies in a personal capacity on the effects of welfare reform in particular on myself and how I fear it affects others, I consider my health a disability because every attempt to work aggravates it &amp; makes me ill for \nseveral days.\n&#xa0;\n•\nHousing Benefits have altered meaning claimants have greater pressure on themselves to comply with unreasonable requests from the DWP.\n•\nBedroom Tax &amp; it’s effects on those in the poorest income brackets.\n•\nCouncil Tax &amp; it’s effects on those in\n the poorest income brackets.\n•\nDirect payments to claimants and the risks it creates.\n&#xa0;\nBACKGROUND\n&#xa0;\nBecause of injury &amp; a failure to treat it properly I suffer from a chronic injury to the sacroilliac joint which my specialist says won’t get better, this inj\nury disturbs my sleep &amp; causes pain most of my day &amp; in turn triggers a condition called Fibromyalgia which makes touch extremely painful. This is in addition to having been diagnosed with cancer &amp; worried  about my future.\n&#xa0;\nWhilst ill I have attended all \nsupport offered to me by the NHS and accessed some courses thanks to interventions from a local councillor, my hope is to find or create work I can cope with because I don’t want to be a burden on either the state or my family.\n&#xa0;\nI have used my illness to i\nnspire products to help others and one in particular has been given to 1000’s of elderly &amp; disabled in the UK, the product is also made in the UK and distributed by some UK Lions International Clubs.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nThe changes to housing \nbenefits &amp; in particular the Bedroom Tax has put pressure on 1000’s of poor families &amp; I believe many are suffering financially, in my case these changes happened when I had no income. So I either faced getting into greater debt or moving house whilst I ha\nd no income, there was no where that offered any help so I had to sell belongings &amp; borrow from illegal moneylenders because no income meant even payday loan companies wouldn’t consider helping me. These changes had a devastating effect on my health &amp; bein\ng without money mean my medicines are causing me problems. Please understand that the Bedroom Tax does not in any way consider the persons income or ability to pay it is in many cases a reduction in help for those that need it.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nAlthough peopl\ne claim this is not a tax the legal definition is any charge that has to be paid about which the individual has no choice is legally a tax, According to Black’s Law Dictionary, a tax is a \"pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property owners to suppor\nt the government, a payment exacted by legislative authority.\" It \"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority\" and is \"any contribution imposed by government, whether under the name of to\nll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name. What I found shocking about this tax is it has to be paid by people who have no income at all, my Council assessed my earned income as zero a week but they asse\nssed I had 1p a week from other sources, when I queried where they found this 1p they told me that they are not allowed to say a person has no income even when the evidence says they have none. \n&#xa0;\n3. LOCALISED COUNCIL TAX SUPPORT.\n&#xa0;\nThe changes to localised \ncouncil tax support like the Bedroom Tax do not consider the persons ability to pay, in my case the Council say my income is 52p a year yet they expect me to pay £125.58p a year, that’s £125.06p more than my income. No one can tell me how I’m supposed to p\nay these taxes whilst I have no income. This puts me in jeopardy with both my local Council &amp; my Housing Association as they are threatening legal action which will only make matters worse as I can’t pay their bills how will I pay any Court costs? If I am \nevicted then I will become a greater burden to the local council &amp; the state, any savings nationally or locally will be lost.\n&#xa0;\nIn my opinion these changes have been made by people with no experience of the welfare system and no consideration of the effects\n on the most vulnerable people in society, how can people in deprivation be expected to pay taxes.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n24 July 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
