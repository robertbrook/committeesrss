defaultPublic Transport Users
default’
default Committee
default for Wales
default (TIC 110)
default&#xa0;
default1.1
default              
defaultThe Public Transport Users’ Committee for Wales (PTUC) welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this inquiry.  
default1.2
default              
defaultThe PTUC is a committee which offers advice to Welsh Ministers about strategic issues relating to public transport services in Wales from the perspective of users’ experiences and needs.
default1.3
default              
defaultThe present arrangements relating to Wales are that although much of the control over rural transport has been devolved to Wales there remains a degree of overall regulation and statutory frameworks that 
defaultare
default the remit of Westminster. We felt it was thus 
defaultappropriate 
defaultfor PTUC (Wales) to make a submission on this issue.
default1.4
default              
defaultIn terms of rural transport, especially in terms of the bus and community transport sectors, the detailed specifications and funding streams are within the remit of Welsh Government, and it is mainly at this level that service frequencies, connections and much in the way of quality of provision is specified. 
default1.5
default              
defaultRural transport is of critical importance because of its impact on health and well-being, and the positive impact improved connectivity can play in promoting economic renewal and 
defaulthelping reduce
default poverty. Rural public transport 
defaultpromotes 
defaultsocial inclusion, while having a role to play in reducing the environmental cost of transport.
default It is our view that at present users are not at the heart of service delivery and this can lead to services that are optimised around provider needs rather than around the needs of the user.
default1.6
default              
defaultWales is a predominantly rural nation, and a major concern is that the provision of rural public transport 
defaultrelies heavily on
default community transport, which is patchy and generally not developed strategically.
default1.7
default              
defaultThe regulation of bus services in rural areas and anti-competitive laws act in a way to reduce co-ordination of low frequency services. Regulations which may well have a place in an urban setting
default,
default where competition occurs between commercial service providers, is wholly unsuited to rural and deeply rural regions with a mix of low frequency commercial and 
defaultsupported 
defaultservices. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default2.1
default              
defaultThe focus is
default on existing users who may have a voice for example 
defaultthrough
default 
defaultBus Users UK 
defaultand 
defaulttheir bus surgeries. Non-users tend not to be considered, and public transport planning, especially in rural areas
default,
default is likely to be reactive rather than proactive when new developments occur
default. P
defaultublic transport is usually considered after the location of a new development has been 
defaultfinalised,
default rather than 
defaultseeking the optimum location on the basis of
default public transport access.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default3.1
default              
defaultIn
default rural Wales
default,
default for example
default,
default there are some bus services that run once per week on a market day in the nearest town. These are designed around access for shopping and medical appointments. Outside of school and college transport
default,
default little consideration 
defaultis given to 
default the needs of young people. Similarly, little consideration is given to running late evening buses to allow visits to cinemas, concerts etc. There are instances where service timetables are based around operator convenience rather than users, so there may not be a late bus on a Friday or Saturday or to meet an evening train 
defaultdue to
default a lack of flexibility in drivers hours etc. There remains a concern that some vehicles remain inaccessible for disabled passengers. Or that space on vehicles is taken up by others, such 
defaultas passengers with 
default child buggies, which can lead to conflict.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4.1
default              
defaultIntegration between modes and between different operators is critical. Rural public transport timetables will generally be low frequency
default;
default possibly two hourly or worse. The robustness of connections is then far more important than journey time. Regulation and anti-competitive requirements prevent many operators from co-ordinating services so that an appropriate service can be provided at an economic cost.
default4.2
default              
defaultUncertainties about longer-term revenue support also 
defaultraise
default issue
defaults
default. People will make employment, educational or home location decisions based upon public transport timetables and routes
default. A
default change to these could seriously affect the continued viability of such decisions. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1
default              
defaultCommunity transport 
defaultis usually locally based and 
defaultcan be very patchy, with some excellent examples. Publicity tends to be focused on local, regular users. A big issue in the sector remains how to get non-users to 
defaultrealise 
defaultwhat is available, and that the service is 
defaultavailable 
defaultfor 
defaulttheir use
default. The variable and local nature of community transport makes it difficult for 
defaultpotential 
defaultusers from outside the area to make use of the 
defaultservices
default. Spreading good practice to areas with less community transport needs to be considered
default.
default  
defaultWorkshops, 
defaultwhere practitioners and potential users could develop and understand what is available
default,
default 
defaultare a useful tool
default to release the potential in this sector.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default6.1
default              
defaultDevelopment of demand
default-
defaultled services such as bwc-a-bus in Carmarthenshire is one possible solution. Consideration needs to be 
defaultgiven 
defaultto existing users of timetabled services
default, if these are to
default be replaced by a demand
default-responsive 
defaultsystem. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default7.1
default              
defaultUnit costs of traditional public transport are high, and policies that act against integration of public transport services have pushed many rural inhabitants towards the private car. This has reduced the viability and thus the service frequency of many bus routes, 
defaultand removed 
defaultmany rural railway stations from the network.  Increasing usage will make services more financially viable and this requires a concerted effort to target
default current
default non-users. For this group
default,
default information on service timetables, access, how to purchase tickets, inter-availability of tickets and accurate, updated information 
defaultin case
default of delay
defaults
default are critically important.  
default7.2
default              
defaultC
defaultoncerns about road congestion, which are a major driver of increased public transport use in urban areas, are less of a driver in rural areas.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default8.1
default              
defaultAt present
default,
default with devolved Governments in Wales and Scotland having differing levels of responsibility over transport, there is an uncertainty over transport planning. For instance rail infrastructure in Wales remains the responsibility of 
defaultthe UK Government, 
defaultwhile 
defaultthere is some Welsh Government input into 
defaultservice levels 
defaultfor the
default Arriva Wales franchise l. Bus services 
defaultin Wales 
defaultare funded via 
defaultfour 
defaultregional transport consortia in alliance with local Authorities for funded services
default,
default while the market determines service timetables on commercial routes. The lack of an overarching view is thus a major issue when integration is considered. 
default8.2
default              
defaultWales has seen the development of a demand
default-
defaultled rural bus service, called bwc-a-bus, which has replaced previously very infrequent timetabled services in some areas. The scheme has been designed to be more responsive to passengers
default’
default needs. The introduction of bwc-a-bus has seen some inertia by users of the previous timetabled services, and the move from a sparse timetabled service to a bwc-a-bus type demand
default-
defaultled service needs to win the hearts and minds of 
defaultboth existing 
defaultusers (and potential ones. 
default8.3
default              
defaultA number of recent
default 
defaultreport
defaults
default 
defaulthave highlighted the issue of the rising 
defaultpercentage of 
defaultthe 
defaultpopulation 
defaultfacing transport poverty
default,
default meaning 
defaultthat the rising cost of transport leaves people excluded and isolated, unable to access opportunities, from jobs to healthcare, that many take for granted. 
default8.4
default              
defaultConsideration also needs to be given to younger people. As motoring costs rise
default,
default many young people are now delaying driving tests for cost reasons, particularly the high cost of insurance for younger drivers. In rural areas this results in youngsters having to rely on sparse public transport, which seriously restricts 
defaultaccess to 
defaultemployment 
defaultopportunities
default. A recurring theme is the lack of evening bus services in rural areas 
defaultreducing opportunities for evening activities such as visits to the cinema or friends
default, while also removing the chance of working in sectors involving 
defaultevening or 
defaultshift work. 
default8.5
default              
defaultConsideration should be given to the wider impact of rural passenger transport. Community transport is a lifeline for many users. It enables some users to remain living in their own homes for longer, reducing costs for health and social services. Similarly, for people with disabilities, removal of rural public or community transport could well result in increased healthcare or social services costs.
default8.6
default              
defaultAs health services become ever more 
defaultcentralised 
defaultin specialist units
default,
defaultaccessibility to these services needs to be 
defaultcarefully 
defaultconsidered. We already see in Wales that 
defaultone hour public transport 
defaultjourneys to the local general hospital
default,
default by can 
defaultbe replaced by the need for very lengthy journeys involving multiple c
defaulthanges and unfamiliar locations.
