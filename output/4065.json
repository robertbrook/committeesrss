"&#xa0;\nWritten submission from the Federation of Master Builders (BRC 55)&#xa0;The \nFederation of Master Builders (FMB) \nis the largest trade association in the UK construction industry, and with \nmore than \n9,\n000 members\n, it\n is the recognised voice of \nsmall and medium-sized (SME) \nconstruction \nfirms\n. \nEstablished in 1941 to protect the intere\nsts of SME building firms, the\n \nFMB is independent and non-profit-making, lobbying continuously for\n \nmembers’ interests at both national and local levels. \nT\nhe FMB is a source of knowledge, professional advice and support \nfor its members \nacross the UK.\n&#xa0;\nInclu\nded in this is the\n FMB\n’s\n \nroute to certification and registrations\n \nservices as part of its ‘complete solution’ service \nto\n member\n firms\n \nthat\n are committed to delivering the highest standards of customer service and workmanship in the building industry.\n \nThe F\nMB \nroute to certification \nis \noffer\ned\n \nthrough\n a service agreement with NAPIT and provides FMB members with\n a route to \nCompetent Person Scheme Registration\n, \nElectrical Installer Certification, \nGreen Deal Installer Certification and Microgeneration (MCS) Installer Certification \n&#xa0;\nTHE FMB’S VIEWS ON BUILDING REGULATIONS CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRICAL INSLATTAION AND REPAIRS IN DWELLINGS&#xa0;The FMB \nargues\n that:\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe majority of the\n consumers\n \nlack \nawareness\n \nof competent persons scheme\ns\n \nin general \nand \ndo not know \nthat certain domestic electrical works need to be reviewed and certified to meet the requirements of Building Regulations\n;\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe \n‘\nElectrotech\nnical Assessment Specification f\nor \nuse by \nCertification a\nnd Registration Bodies\n’ is sufficiently robust in setting out the technical competence requirements for a business to be certified/registered as competent to undertake electrical work. However, \nthe FMB does have a concern that in some scheme\ns\n,\n the number of electrical operatives that a ‘qualified supervisor’ is responsible for may be excessive. \nWe have been reliably informed that a ratio of one qualified supervisor to 25 operatives \nis\n permitted in some schemes. If this is \nthe case\n,\n we consi\nde\nr that the ratio to be far too high;\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nW\nithin the electrical competent persons scheme\n, the vast majority of\n \nthose carrying out electrical works\n do \nreview \ntheir work sufficiently\n to ensure that it meets the requirements of the \nBuilding \nRegulations;\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nC\nompetit\nion between certification/registration bodies is both healthy and necessary. Many electrical installers have an established and long-term relationship with their certification/registration body and \nany move to force installers to \nuse a single certification\n/registration body would not be well received by the e\nlectrical contracting industry;\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe creation of t\nwo separate registers of electricians i.e. ‘ElectricSafe Register’ and \n‘Electrical Safety Register’ was a negative \nand inappropriate \nstep\n. H\nowever, given the general lack of \nconsumer \nawareness of the two registers, at this stage the impact of the creation of two registers on \npublic confusion\n is limited\n. \nThere is still a great opportunity to establish a single register that, if \ncorrectly market\ned and supported, could play a significant \nrole\n in raising public awareness, improving electrical safety and increasing compliance with the Building R\negulations;\n&#xa0;\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe relationship between the \nG\novernment endorsed TrustMark scheme\n,\n and registration of electr\nical contractors\n,\n \nneeds to be considered\n. The TrustMark scheme include\ns\n registration for electrical work\n. The fact that TrustMark is so consumer focussed has the potential to confuse the general public if they are faced with what in effect is an\nother regis\nter of electricians;\n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe adequacy of the supervision by \nthe \nD\nepartment for \nC\nommunities and \nL\nocal \nG\novernment (DCLG)\n of the \nelectrical competent person scheme operators has\n, to \ndate\n,\n not been as robust as it \nperhaps should \nhave \nbeen\n. \nHowever, given that the\n revised\n competent person\ns\n scheme\n \n‘\nConditions of Authorisation\n’\n include\ns\n a requirement for UKAS accreditation to standard BS EN 45011: 1998 (or latest equivalent) \nwe consider that going forward the supervision via UKAS will be \nquite\n adequate.\n&#xa0;RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CLG SELECT COMMITTEE&#xa0;\nThe FMB urges the Committee to make the followin\ng recommendations to government, ensuring that:\n&#xa0;\n1)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nA\n single register of \ndomestic \nelectricians\n exists\n;\n&#xa0;\n2)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt supports the promotion of the register;\n&#xa0;\n3)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nThe register \noffer\ns\n a single \npoint of contact for consumers;\n&#xa0;\n4)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe register \nis\n inclusive and \nopen to all \nexisting and \nany \nfuture \nUKAS accredited \nelectrical competent persons scheme operators\n;\n&#xa0;\n5)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nT\nhe register \nis\n \noperated as a separate business entity to any existing \ncompetent person\ns\n sche\nme\n but for the \ncompetent person\ns\n scheme\n operator\ns\n to be \nable\n,\n to and be required \nto\n,\n participate in t\nhe governance of the register;\n&#xa0;\n6)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nE\nlectrical \ncompetent person\ns\n scheme\n operators \nare\n able to continue\n to\n \noperate \nwith commercial independence, \nwhils\nt \nfulfilling the requirements\n for their members\n to be included on the register;\n&#xa0;\n7)\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; \nIt reviews\n the relationship between the TrustMark scheme\n and\n \nthe\n \ndomestic electrician \nregister\n,\n and put\ns\n in place arrangement\ns\n that pre\nvent or remove \nconsumer confusion\n \nregarding t\nhe register and TrustMark.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nDecember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
