defaultPerformance Managementdefault&#xa0;
default3.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn April 2010 Wiltshire Police introduced a balanced scorecard as a performance management tool.  The intention of this system was to ‘take the numbers’ away from senior managers.  The reason for 
defaultthis was to encourage a culture of looking forward and ‘making things better than they otherwise would have been.’
default&#xa0;
default3.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultThis replaced a system where force performance was measured thorough a small number of 
defaultyear to date 
defaultKey Performance Indicators (KPI).  The
defaultse KPI’s were set against targets which were, in general, binary comparison with previous years data.  In addition 
defaultiQuanta
default data with comparison to Wiltshire’s family of forces was used mostly to give context to areas where KPI’s had worsened.
default&#xa0;
default3.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt
default is critic
defaultal to understand how senior managers 
defaultincorrectly 
defaultuse recorded crime statistics to measure and improve performance.
default  Below 
defaultis an 
defaultexample I witnessed in Wiltshire Police.
default&#xa0;
default3.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring
default 2011Violent crime, both volume and detection rates, were identified at an issue
default in our County division.  Pressure was brought to bear on the performance team to identify ‘how much of a 
defaultnumerical 
defaultreduction’ would be required for this to no longer be an issue.  The hierarchical nature of the police made it impossible to resist
default providin
defaultg 
defaultthis 
defaultinformation 
defaulteven though we felt it 
defaultc
defaultould 
defaultrisk
default dysfunctional behaviour.
default&#xa0;
default3.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultRather than focus on activities that would have a positive impact on future performance (e.g. improving the quality of investigations or focussed activity to target Night Time E
defaultconomy (NTE) violence) resource w
defaultas put into reviewing all Year t
defaulto Date undetected violent crime.  
default&#xa0;
default3.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe purpose was to identify administrative oversights, including incorrect crime classification, crimes not being recorded as detected or crimes that had b
defaulteen identified as being ‘no crime’ not having been recorded as such .  In my opinion this had little or no impact in reducing crime or improving service delivery to victims of crime.  This activity, I believe, was undertaken full-time by two members of sta
defaultff for at least a month.
default&#xa0;
default3.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultReviewing previously completed crimes was a tactic often employed by managers in Wiltshire Police during my tenure within the force performance team.
default  I suspect Wiltshire Police are not unique in utilising this tactic.

defaultMisuedefault odefaultf defaultiQuantadefault Ddefaultata.default&#xa0;default4.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe guidance for 
defaultiQuanta
default states that forces should use the data to compare themselves against the average of most similar forces (MSF). 
default&#xa0;
default4.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultSenior managers up to Chief Officer level 
defaultblatantly ignored this guidance despite representations from within the performance team.  They 
defaultdemand
defaulted to
default be told ‘what number they were in their family of forces’.
default  If they were
default second they wanted to be first.
default&#xa0;
default4.3
default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThrough adopting this approach managers would again bring pressure to bear on improving the numbers rather than improving the level of performance.  
default&#xa0;
default4.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultA lack of understanding of twelve month
default/three month
default rolling data also lead to insufficient time being giv
defaulten to initiatives to reduce crime to achieve results.  Instant results were expected/demanded from operational colleagues.

defaultHMIC Inspectiondefault – The Crime Scenedefault&#xa0;default5.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the visit to Wiltshire Police by HMIC in 2011 
defaultin support of their thematic inspection ‘Cr
defaultime Scene’ 
defaultaround 120 incidents
default were assessed to see if they had been correctly recorded as a crime.
default&#xa0;default5.2
default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultIt was clear that the only issues raised were where an incident that they felt should have been recording as a crime hadn’t been.
default&#xa0;default5.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultI raised directly with
default the inspectors why they had not identified incidents that had been recorded crime where there was credible evidence to the contrary.
default&#xa0;
default5.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe view from the lead Inspector (Superintendent Steve Wallace – Hants Police) was that if a victim thought it was a crim
defaulte then it should be recorded as such.  Proportionality would come in the investigative stage following an incident being recorded as a crime.  
default&#xa0;
default5.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultSuperintendent Wallace cited his previous experience as a crime registrar in Hampshire Police.
default&#xa0;default5.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe ACPO report
default – Understanding Crime Recording also raises the issue that HMIC and crime registrars interpret the question of ‘when to record’ in this way.
default&#xa0;
default5.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe
default view was also shar
defaulted by our force crime registrar.
default 
default&#xa0;default&#xa0;default6default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOver recording of crimes.default&#xa0;default6.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultOn becoming Chief Constable 
defaultof Wiltshire Brian Moore set out to make Wiltshire the “Safest in the Country”.  This became interpreted internally to a more measurable ‘lowest rates of violent crime in the country’.
default&#xa0;
default6.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultDuring the summer of 2010, in my role as Performance Manager, I identi
defaultfied that Wiltshire Police had significantly higher rates of 
default‘
defaultno crime
default’
default for less serious assaults than the other ‘top ten forces’ with the lowest violent crime rates.
default&#xa0;
default6.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultAnalysis showed that in
default 
defaultexcess
default of 2
default0
default% of these had been recorded as ‘no crimes’ within f
defaultive days of the initial report.  At the time force procedures were such that the additional verifiable information (AVI) required to achieve a ‘no crime’ decision often needed to be in documentary form e.g. statement. 
default&#xa0;
default6.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultIt became clear to me that for 
defaultthese
default crimes the AVI would have been available following basic and straightforward enquiries.  I further hypothesised there was a high level of probability that AVI 
defaulteither had been or 
defaultcould have been established within the 3x24 hour period allowed by NCRS to ma
defaultke a decision as to whether to record as a crime.  
default&#xa0;
default6.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultI further hypothesised there was a high probability that there were other crimes 
defaultwith information 
defaultwhich, whilst 
defaultit
default would not satisfy the requirement of AVI, would have ‘credible evidence to the contrary’
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the key differences with reported common assaults
default, as compared to other crime types, is
default that in the 
defaultoverwhelming
default majority of cases the ‘offender’ is known
default, and named,
default by the victim.  This provides an opportunity to quickly identify an alternati
defaultve version of events (as there invariably is) and ethically apply the NCRS threshold test
defaults
default e.g.
default do the circumstances amount to a crime in law AND that there 
defaultis 
defaultno
default credible evidence to the contrary.
default&#xa0;
default6.7
default&#xa0; 
defaultAnalysis of a significant sample of common assaults was c
defaultarried out by myself and a temporary Inspector on our team who had extensive experience as a detective
default.
default&#xa0;
default6.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultWe took a deliberately literal inte
defaultrpretation of the words of NCRS specifically around the balance of probabilities that it was more likely than not th
defaultat the incident was as the result of a criminal act and whether there was any other credible evidence.  
default&#xa0;
default6.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultThere does however seem to be a contradiction with NCRS which states it is for the police to determine whether a crime has been committed but states t
defaulthat in most cases the belief by the victim that a crime has occurred is sufficient to justify its recording.
default&#xa0;
default6.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOur analysis showed that in around 40% of the cases we examined there was other evidence that gave an alternative version of events that could be 
defaultdeemed credible.  
default&#xa0;
default6.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThis is not to suggest that 40% had been incorrectly recorded.  What we concluded however was that there was a significant risk that crimes were being re
defaultcorded that shouldn’t have been due to a lack of recognition of credible evidence 
defaultto the contrary.
default  
default&#xa0;
default6.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn many cases the incidents occur when only the victim and offender are present and there is an absence of forensic evidence.  This presents the police with a significant dilemma. 
default&#xa0;
default6.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultTo verify our findings we sought an independent operat
defaultional Detective Sergeant to also make an independent assessment of the same incidents.  The findings of t
defaulthis DS supported our findings.
default&#xa0;
default6.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultSimilar issues are also raised in the NPIA – Understanding Crime Recording
default 
defaultwhich is available on the College of Policin
defaultg Website.
default&#xa0;
default6.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe Understanding Crime Recording report encourages ‘greater use of professional judgement in relation to all aspects of the crime recording process and in particular around what constitutes ‘credible evidence to the contrary’ and ‘additional v
defaulterifiable information’.
default&#xa0;
default7default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultImpacts of the over recording of crime.default&#xa0;default7.1
default&#xa0; 
defaultThe 
defaultover 
defaultrecording of 
defaultcrime 
defaultcan have significant impacts on individuals 
defaultand police resources.  It can risk public confidence in the police.
default&#xa0;
default7.2
default&#xa0; 
defaultQuite rightly there is an expectation that police will deal with identified suspects expeditiously.  Often the method of ‘dealing with’ suspects of violent crime is to invoke the power of arrest.  
default&#xa0;
default7.3
default&#xa0; 
defaultWithin Wiltshire Police once a violent crime ha
defaultd
default been rec
defaultorded as such and a suspect named and linked to that crime there 
defaultwas
default a performance culture linked to ‘customer satisfaction’ and  ‘detection rates’ which place
defaultd
default insurmountable pressure on officers to make arrests.
default&#xa0;
default7.4
default&#xa0; 
defaultAs a local Joint Branch Board we are 
defaultcurrently supporting an ex-officer who has suffered significant psychological damage as a result of an unnecessary arrest related to a dubious decision making process in relation to an allegation of fraud.  This has had a significant on her life.  Often as
default police officers we forget the impact that an arrest can have
default on individuals
default.  
default&#xa0;
default7.5
default&#xa0; 
defaultWhen incidents are not recorded as crimes there is less pressure
default to make arrests
default.  As a result investigating officers have more scope to use professional judgement
default in the inve
defaultstigation.
default&#xa0;
default7.6
default&#xa0; 
defaultConversely with increased opportunities for use of professional judgement comes an increased risk that crimes that should have been recorded as crimes haven’t
default been
default.
default  Clear strategies need to be in place to mitigate these risks.
default&#xa0;

defaultWiltshire police

defaultfocus 
defaultto be 
defaulton the outcomes of

default.
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.8
default&#xa0; 
defaultIn respect of recorded crime this
default 
defaultimproved in late 2011 w
defaultith an understanding that victim satisfaction survey results had identified low levels of satisfaction with the quality of the investigations.  
default&#xa0;
default7.9
default&#xa0; 
defaultA plan to improve quality of investigations was implemented and showed positive results.  
defaultThe same focus was n
defaultot given to the investigation of incidents
default. 
default 
default 
default&#xa0;
default7.10
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThere is
default constant pressure at all levels of management to improve detection rates
default.
default  
default&#xa0;
default7.11
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultAs Wiltshire’s single point of contact for the National Crime mapping system when it went live I received numerous ‘complaints’ from people about the level of crime in their neighbourhoods.  It became evident that people had concerns that high crime levels
default may affect property prices.  
default&#xa0;
default7.12
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultOne of the other concerns that I have is around enhanced vetting.  Where people are named as suspects against recorded crimes there can be a requirement to disclose.
default&#xa0;
default7.13
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn one example I was made aware of related to
default a decision 
defaultfor disclosure that had been referred to the Assistant Chief Constable for a determination.
default&#xa0;
default7.14
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultDuring an enhanced CRB check on an individual it became apparent that he was the ‘suspect’ in an allegation of child abuse (physical).  The circumstances were that
default the allegation had been made by his ex-wife some time after they had separated.  The reporting person wished no further action.  The 
defaultreport however 
defaultwas recorded as a crime and the ‘suspect’
default was never approached or advised of the allegation. 
default&#xa0;
default7.15
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultThe absence of an investigation and the failure to identify any potential evidence to the contrary could have had a significant impact on the job prospects of the accused.  
default&#xa0;
default7.16
default&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
defaultIn my view this risks undermining one of the foundations of our criminal justice 
defaultsystem of being ‘innocent until proven guilty.’
