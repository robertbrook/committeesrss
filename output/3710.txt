&#xa0;Written evidence from Roger Leary (CYS0009)&#xa0;Make motorists have a duty of care and change the law so that a motorist involved in an accident is assumed to be at fault and will be prosecuted unless he can reasonably demonstrate the cyclist was behaving badly/unsafely.eg witness confirms cyclist cycled throught red light.Law stating motorists must give cyclist minimum 1 metre clearance when passing - otherwise an offence is committed.Prosecute cyclists more frequently for transgressions.Make it advantageous that a cyclist on the Public Highway is insured. If you are injured and you are not insured then any legal damages you are entitled to will be significantly reduced - by perhaps 50%. I don't think compulsory insurance would work/ be enforceable but this might help.coi - cyclist - recently knocked off my bicycle by blithering idiot. I was behaving 'perfectly'. 2nd serious accident in 4 years, neither avoidable.I am insured and member of CTC.&#xa0;November 2013&#xa0;
