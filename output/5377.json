"&#xa0;Written evidence from Lord Goldsmith QC&#xa0;\nINTRODUCTION\nGENESIS AND PURPOSE OF THE CHARTER AND THE UK GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO IT\nNOT NEW RIGHTS\n“\nIn so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.” \nThe effect of this is that where rights are based on the European Convention Rights they are, notwithstanding distances of language (to the extent that those exist which is in fact minimal), the same. The provisions have to be interpreted in exactly the same way.  This includes necessarily by reference to\n the \njurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nTHE DECISION IN AB V SECRETARY OF STATE\n“The j\nudge said, however, that the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has since given a judgment which means that the Charter, which contains a ‘host of new rights’ is now valid in British courts.”\n“\nThe constitutional significance of this decision [in reference to an ECJ decision I discuss below] can hardly be overstated.  The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated into our domestic law large parts, but by no means all, of the European Convention o\nn\n Human Rights.  Some parts were deliberately missed out by Parliament.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union contains, I believe\n,\n all of those missing parts and a great deal more.  Notwithstanding the endeavours of our political representatives \nat\n Lisbon it would seem that the much wider \nC\nharter of \nR\nights is now part of our domestic law.  Moreover, that much wider \nC\nharter of \nR\nights would remain part of our \ndomestic law even if the Human Rights Act were repealed.”\nTHE PROTOCOL\n&#xa0;\nJanuary 2014\n7\n&#xa0;\nError! No property name supplied. \n              \nAs the papers \nreferred to at Annexes 1, 2 and 3 \nare published elsewhere, they are not reproduced here \nand do not\n form part of the \nformal \nwritten evidence to the Committee.\n"
