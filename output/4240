[normal]&#xa0;[bold]FUTURE OF THE BBC INQUIRY[bold]&#xa0;[bold]Executive Summary:[bold]Shed 
[normal]M
[normal]edia believes that the BBC holds a key and essenti
[normal]al role within the TV landscape, 
[normal]for viewers in the domestic and international marketplace 
[normal]and
[normal] within the 
[normal]creative industry.
[normal] Many of the most successful television exports were init
[normal]iated on the BBC 
[normal]and m
[normal]any successful UK production companies hold the BBC key to their
[normal] achievements
[normal].  As such we are 
[normal]supporter
[normal]s
[normal] of the BBC and the license fee
[normal], removing or reducing the licensee fee could have negative impacts for the broadcasting secto
[normal]r
[normal] in
[normal] the UK
[normal] - 
[normal]and 
[normal]for 
[normal]UK creative industries globally. 
[normal]After a difficult few years for the BBC’s TV division, the new senior management and business leaders are showing signs of essential modernisation which should lead to greater efficiency both operationall
[normal]y and in communications, decision making and commissioning.
[normal]  
[normal]Shed Media 
[normal]recognises that the BBC needs an 
[normal]appropriate and effective mechanism for accountability and governance
[normal] and we 
[normal]believe that progress has been signalled by new management who we 
[normal]consider 
[normal]have the commitment to introduce and follow-through on change. 
[normal]T
[normal]he 
[normal]BBC
[normal] 
[normal]should 
[normal]broadcast 
[normal]the 
[normal]very 
[normal]best programmes it can regardless of whether they are produced ‘in house’ or from 
[normal]external producers.  A
[normal]s such 
[normal]Shed Media believes that the 
[normal]‘
[normal]W
[normal]indow 
[normal]O
[normal]f Creative 
[normal]C
[normal]ompetition’
[normal] should not act as a cap on external commissions
[normal] (
[normal]bar news and current affairs) and that ‘open competition’ will benefit the BBC
[normal] and its viewers
[normal].  
[normal]As part of any reform of the commissioning system, Shed Media believes that the defini
[normal]tion of 
[normal]an ‘
[normal]Independent Producer
[normal]’
[normal] should be amended
[normal].
[normal]The BBC’s achievements with regards to ‘Nations and Regions’ have been encouraging and we support and encourage further commitments from the BBC to represent its 
[normal]diverse 
[normal]audience 
[normal]by commissioning
[normal] new and 
[normal]re-commissioning 
[normal]established pr
[normal]ogramming
[normal] from 
[normal]all
[normal] areas of the UK. 
[normal]Shed Media believes that the commercial revenue the Independent Production sector could contribute the BBC could be increased if the BBC’s Fair Trading and Commercial Guidelines a
[normal]re updated to fit the nature of current of business practice  and rig
[normal]hts ownership and exploitation.  Where the BBC operates its own commercial activities via BBC Worldwide , we believe these activities should be based on 
[normal]the
[normal] current remit, be commercially
[normal] transparent and 
[normal]operate on 
[normal]an equal footing with the independent sector. 
[normal]Shed Media believes that if the BBC do
[normal]es
[normal] invest in new technologies, such devices (such as the iPlayer) 
[normal]then these technologies should be 
[normal]comm
[normal]ercialised as fully as possible and tha
[normal]t the BBC should work in partnership with external technology companies.
