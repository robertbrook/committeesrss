default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
defaultI would be happy to expand on any of the points made.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default1. defaultWas there a cover up?default Withholding of evidencedefault&#xa0;
default1.1 
defaultThroughout, Network Rail and others have gone out of their way to deny there was any cover up.  But there has never been any investigation or internal inquiry to determine one way or another.  In some ways, the events suggest more of a conspiracy of silenc
defaulte.  This revolves round two main documents – Part B 
default(which suggested in 2002 that locking the gates at 
defaultElsenham
default should be considered) 
defaultand the 
defaultHudd
default memo
default written in 2001
default (which

default.
default 
default Neither of these docu
defaultment
defaults appeared until 2011. 
default If 
defaultit was 
defaultnot a
default cover-up or co
defaultnspiracy of silence, the facts suggest massive 
defaultincompetence
default and failure by officials to 
defaultdiscover the background to
default what happened
default.
default&#xa0;
default1.2 
defaultClearly given the culpability of Network Rail, the successful prosecution by ORR and subsequent sentence, some officials failed in their responsibilities but none have 
defaultbeen held accountable or suffered any consequences of that failure.
default  None have been publicly questioned about their role or knowledge, except as it related to the ORR investigation which led to the prosecution of Network Rail as an entity, but not any indi
defaultviduals.
default&#xa0;
default1.3 
defaultThe existence of 
defaultPart B and the 
defaultHudd
default memo
default was revealed by Mo 
defaultRos
defaultse
default in 2010
default who said 
defaultit had been her responsibility to send all relevant documents 
defaultto
default 
defaultNetwork Rail’s Legal Department
default, shortly after the accident.  
defaultShe has been adamant
default 
defaultthat
default Part B and the 
defaultHudd
default memo
default, were included
default. 
default 
defaultHowever, her computer was 
defaultlater 
defaultwiped and no evidence exists.  
defaultWhat makes her evidence so important is that without it, the families would not have known or followed up their inquiries
default, and the information would h
defaultave never become public.
default&#xa0;
default1.4 
defaultOther officials who were involved include J
defaulto Green, then Route Production Manager when she received the 
defaultHudd
default memo.  She told ORR that she could not remember receiving the memo.
default&#xa0;
default1.5 
defaultAnother was Philip Heath, at the time of the
default accident General Manager for West Anglia.  He prepared a witness statement for the civil case brought by the parents against Network Rail.  This statement was never used as Network Rail conceded the case.  However, it was placed on the Network Rail websit
defaulte in February as a press statement just as 
defaultThe Times
default revealed the existence of Part B.  It disappeared days later.  In it Philip Heath stated that 
defaulthe was not aware of any other serious incidents or problems at 
defaultElsenham
default until the accident on 3 December 2005
default.  In July 2010 at the time of the civil case he asked Mo 
defaultRosse
default, who was suspended at the time, whether she had any documents relating to 
defaultElsenham
default: she didn’t.
default&#xa0;
default1.6 
defaultAmong other officials who have never been questioned
default publicly
default about their role in the matte
defaultr are Robin 
defaultGisby
default, Managing Director Network Operations, and Richard Smith, Solicitor for Network Rail though whom all documents would have passed
default, and Jon Wiseman, then Route Director for East Anglia
default 
default 
default(
defaultwho later reported directly to Robin 
defaultGisby
default)
default, and
default sinc
defaulte retired
default (he was questioned at the 
defaultIn
defaultquest but did not reveal the existence of part B and the 
defaultHudd
default memo).
default  It is clear that Richard Smith knew about the 
defaultdocuments before they appeared in 
defaultThe Times
default: 
defaultwe know this
default 
defaultas a result of evidence provided through a F
defaultreedom of Information disclosure by ORR.  Yet the 
defaultHudd
default document was 
defaultstill 
defaultwithheld until ORR announced it was going to visit Network Rail to look through files in May 2011.  It was handed to them the same afternoon and issued to the families by Chief Execu
defaulttive David Higgins 
defaultthat day
default.  No action has been taken about this withholding of information.  
default&#xa0;
default1.7  
defaultThe first inquiry was carried out by the industry’s Rail Safety Standards Board (RSSB) which in 2011 admitted it had seen Part B (though not the 
defaultHudd
default memo
default).  However, the RSSB’s report never mentioned Part B.
default&#xa0;
default1.8  
defaultNeither Part B nor the 
defaultHudd
default memo were among the 
defaultevidence presented among the documents issued 
defaultin connection with
default the Inquest.
default&#xa0;
default2. defaultThe Inquestdefault&#xa0;
default2.1 
defaultAt a pre Inquest hearing and subsequently, 
defaultNetwork Rail and the train companies made representations that risk assessment evidence should not be given.  During the Inquest one of their b
defaultarristers raised the issue and persuaded the Coroner to ensure
default that this evidence was not considered.
default&#xa0;
default2.2 
defaultAmong 
defaultthe documents
default which were excluded was one by Iain Ferguson of the Health and Safety Executive.  He concluded that a risk assessment held in 2005 was inadequate in that it did not adequately address the consequences of someone stepping in front of a train, 
defaultand that the crossing was not compliant with a section of the Requirements for Level Crossings.  He concluded:  “
defaultI would not consider Network Rail’s assessment methodologies… to be suitable and sufficient
default”.
default&#xa0;
default2.3 
defaultInquests are not supposed to be confrontatio
defaultnal, but the way in which Network 
defaultR
defaultail in particular used legal devices to exclude such evidence left us as families deeply unhappy that we had been
default cheated and
default treated 
defaultunfairly.  That feeling rankles even more now that we know that vital and relevant d
defaultocu
defaultment
defaults were withheld by Network Rail.
default&#xa0;
default3. defaultFailures in risk assessmentdefault&#xa0;
default3.1  
defaultI have made a few comments about the failures of Network Rail’s risk assessment but 
defaultthis issue has
default been covered
default at length 
default by the RAIB
default,
default HSE and others.  Suffice it to say, 
defaultit was 
defaultrevealed that the assess
defaultments carried out at 
defaultElsenham
default were seriously flawed but it took until 2011 before any real action was taken. 
default&#xa0;
default3.2  
defaultSafety assessments have improved but there has been too much reliance on rigid statistical methods, as witnessed by 
defaultfaulty assessments at 
defaultElsensham
default on a number of oc
defaultc
defaultasions.  I believe greater relianc
defaulte on commonsense and human judg
defaultment would improve matters – in both cases where the true dangers were revealed (by 
defaultHudd
default and Hill) it was down to basic observation, not math
defaultematical formulae. 
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default4. defaultJohnson’s Crossingdefault&#xa0;
default4.1 
defaultThe lack of proper investigation and  accountability has also been the case following the death of Katie 
defaultLittlewood
default at Johnsons Crossing which ironically happened days before Network Rail pleaded guilty o
defaultver the 
defaultElsenham
default deaths.
default&#xa0;
default4.2 
defaultThe RAIB investigation into this case revealed 
defaultimportant failings by Network Rail.  
defaultIt
default revealed: “
defaultBetween 1996 and 2007, there had been a series of suggestions and proposals to divert pedestrians away from Johnson’s footpath c
defaultrossing or to replace the crossing with a bridge.
default 
defaultThe RAIB has been una
defaultble to establish fully why none 
defaultof
default these proposals 
defaultfrom were progressed
default” and “
defaultNetwork Rail did not follow-up a proposal in 2007 to install a footbridge
default 
defaultto replace Johnson’s footpath 
defaultcrossing, after analysis had shown that the
default 
defaultbenefits of so doing would exceed the costs
default”.
default&#xa0;
default4.3  
defaultThe report also revealed: 
default“
defaultA tracking
default 
defaultsheet used by the Anglia operational risk team recorded that a submission had
default 
defaultbeen made for funding by November 2008. A ke
defaulty witness has reported that this
default 
defaultsubmission 
default [for funding] 
defaultwas rejected, although the RAIB has not seen any documentary
default 
defaultevidence of this. Neither the former Route Operations Manager nor the former
default 
defaultRoute Enhancements Manager (who would normally have applied
default for funding,
default..
default) could recall a proposal for a bridge or find any
default 
defaultrecord that a funding submission had in fact been made
default”
default.
default&#xa0;
default4.4 It is clear that had Network R
defaultail acted as it should have done, Katie 
defaultLittlewood
default would not have died at the crossing.
default&#xa0;
default4.5  
defaultAgai
defaultn no internal investigation has taken place to determine what went wrong and who was responsible.  The 
defaultORR 
defaulthas
default,
default 
defaultunfortunately, 
defaulttaken no action to prosecute Network Rail in this case.
default&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5. defaultImproving safety at level crossingsdefault: reducing riskdefault&#xa0;
default&#xa0;
default5.1 
defaultEvidence shows that for a variety of reasons, pedestrians and drivers take risks at level crossings.  Ways need to be found to make it near impossible to encroach on rail lines, and 
defaultthere should be 
defaultgreater use of modern technology for distance control of c
defaultrossing at more remote locations.
default  The default position should be that all gates at all crossings are locked when trains are passing through.  All crossings should be gated with half barriers replaced by full barriers in all cases to deter drivers and pede
defaultstrians from circumventing gates.
default&#xa0;
default5.2 
defaultThere appears to be a long held policy within Network Rail that pedestrian gates cannot be locked on some crossings. While there are other problems that can arise unless gates are locked there will continue to be fata
defaultl accidents.  The point has often been made that locking gates can result in pedestrian being trapped.  One solution to that is to incorporate ‘safe’ areas between locked gates and the track itself.  At 
defaultElsenham
default before the accident such ‘safe’ areas – more
default than one 
defaultmetre
default square, sufficient to take two pedestrians and a pram or buggy – existed.  Yet officials at the time refused to accept 
defaultthat this was the purpose of these areas, arguing instead for unlocked gates so that pedestrians pass through if caught 
defaulti
defaultn the track area 
defaultbetween the gates.
default&#xa0;
default5.3  
defaultAnother argument is that gates can only be locked if there are gate keepers in attendance.  (At 
defaultElsenham
default, the gatekeepers had only limited responsibility for observing the crossing).  However, advances in modern 
defaulttechnology (both in what it can achieve and price) are such that it should be p
defaultossible to lock p
defaultedestrian 
defaultgates 
defaultfrom central locations
default, and
default us
defaulte
default CCTV and interactive audio
default and video
default to allow officials
default, train drivers
default and pedestrians to communicate.  
defaultUse of s
defaultuch devices could mean gates at little used crossings could be locked until opening is requested by pedestrians.
default&#xa0;
default5.4  
defaultIt would also be beneficial to include 
defaultLDC/LED displays to inform pedestrians of when the next train is due, where the approaching train 
defaultis and how long it will be before the gates are released.  Such displays are now ubiquitous at stations to inform passengers of train arrivals – this is partly a result of the huge reduction in cost of such systems.  These displays could also be included c
defaultould also be a service to 
defaultvehicle drivers at
default crossings and thus help reduce frustration: informed drivers and pedestrians are less likely to take any precipitate or potentially risky actions such as attempting to cross the line.
