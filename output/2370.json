"&#xa0;\nPennine Way Association – Written evidence&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nOn behalf\n of the Pennine Way Association\n,\n which has approximately \n500 members, we are writing is support of the Yorkshire  Dales Green Lane Alliance (YDGLA) and the Peak District Green Lane Alliance(PDGLA)  in their proposal to strengthen the current draft Deregulation Bill by the addition of more binding clauses in order to protect vulnerable green lanes from mis-use by illegal and unauthorised  off road vehicles.\n&#xa0;\nThe situation regarding many of these green lanes is critical. Not only are many of these lanes  virtually destroyed, added to this their restoration is placing a heavy burden on highway authorities throughout much of the country. Indeed some routes have been  rendered impassable to cyclists, horse riders  and walkers. In some the\n current situation has been \nimproved by Traffic Regulation Orders but this has to be counter balanced by deterioration elsewhere.\n&#xa0;\nWe are aware that the need to regulate the use of unsealed unclassified  country roads (UCCRs) and Byways Open to all Traffic  (BOATS) by unauthorised vehicular traffic has long been recognised and that the Deregulation Bill designed to address this problem. The PWA fully supports the YDGLA and PDGLA in their request that the Deregulation Bill includes the downgrading of all UCCRs and BOATs to restricted byway status and also awards.The right of appeal against any highway authority which refuses to impose a TRO when asked to do so.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nBill Gallon\nSecretary of the PWA\n&#xa0;\n9 September 2013\n2\n of \n1\n&#xa0;\n"
