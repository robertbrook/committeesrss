[normal]To effectively engage young women we run t
[normal]he Us Girls programme
[normal] (
[normal]which was originally lottery funded with a £2.3m award towards a project value of £3.9m
[normal]). The Us Girls programme is the product of a successful bidding cons
[normal]ortium that was made up of 60 organisations: together we secured the largest ever investment in disadvantaged young women.

[normal]Our evidence focuses on 
[normal]the Us Girls’ target group: disadvantaged young women.  
[normal]We are keen to ensure that this Inquiry considers how vitally important it is to 
[normal]provide
[normal] these
[normal] young women with sport 
[normal]and fitness opportunities in their local communities in a style that is attractive to them. 
[normal]Our Submission to the Inquiry includes learning and information from examples of work in the Us Girls programme that have been successful in engaging

[normal]The 
[normal]most recent data from Sport England’s Active People Survey 7 data shows that 
[normal]49% of females aged 16-25 years from the 
[normal]20% 
[normal]highest socio-economic groups take part in sport at least once a
[normal] week while only 
[normal]36% do so from the 20% l
[normal]owest socio-ec
[normal]onomic groups.

[normal]Us Girls 
[normal]promotes ‘doorstep sport’ as a means of engaging disadvantaged young
[normal] women 
[normal]– 
[normal]doorstep sport
[normal] is sport delivered 
[normal]in deprived areas 
[normal]at ‘the right time, right place, right price and in the right style’
[normal] to attract 
[normal]females. 
[normal]Over the last 
[normal]two
[normal] years 
[normal]Us Girls has engaged more than 34,481 young women (aged 16-25) in sport and an additional 8,800 under 16s/over 25s
[normal].

[normal]Young 
[normal]women
[normal] who have limited or 
[normal]no previous sporting 
[normal]experience 
[normal]are
[normal] unlikely to visit traditional sport
[normal] 
[normal]settings/venues. Therefore, 
[normal]providing activity in non-traditional sports [bold]venues[bold] in the loca
[normal]l
[normal] 
[normal]community is likely to be more attractive to them
[normal].

[normal]The
[normal] 
[normal]environment must be inviting and safe
[normal] and
[normal] young
[normal] 
[normal]women 
[normal]should
[normal] able to exercise in comfort and at ease. 
[normal]Some w
[normal]omen
[normal], often
[normal] 
[normal]those from 
[normal]BME 
[normal]backgrounds prefer/must 
[normal]exercise in a
[normal] 
[normal]female exclusive [bold]environment[bold]. This means an area with no
[normal] 
[normal]male access or viewing, where windows and doors are
[normal] 
[normal]closed off to the general public, participants and 
[normal]staff
[normal] 
[normal]are
[normal] all female
[normal].
[normal] 
[normal]This is sometimes a challenge.

[normal]Having 
[normal]clear, obvious signage[bold] in the facilities
[normal] so that
[normal] 
[normal]wom
[normal]en know exactly where to go when they 
[normal]arrive
[normal] and ensuring that staff are welcoming and are
[normal] 
[normal]informed of the session that is taking place are 
[normal]key
[normal] to ensuring a positive
[normal] 
[normal]participant experience.
[normal] 
[normal]1.10
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Us Girls sessions are delivered in a variety of local community 
[normal]venues including both traditional and non-traditional sports facilities. The emphasis is on using 
[normal]local 
[normal]and familiar 
[normal]provision
[normal] which
[normal] is important to enable access and 
[normal]engage local people. The most popular types of facility used for se
[normal]ssions are indoor faci
[normal]lities
[normal]. Only 14% of 
[normal]Us Girls 
[normal]sessions 
[normal]that 
[normal]took 
[normal]place 
[normal]over the last two years 
[normal]were at
[normal] outdoor venues. Research and feedback
[normal] from participants suggests that females from this age group and demographic prefer to be active indoors
[normal] (whatever the weather). 
[normal]1.11
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Us
[normal] 
[normal]Girls projects have encountered some 
[normal]challenges in 
[normal]gaining 
[normal]access to school sites 
[normal]and/
[normal]or 
[normal]with facilities being 
[normal]too costly
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Finance, including sponsorship and prize money[bold]1.12
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]For many young women, cost is one of the main barriers to participating in sport and 
[normal]ph
[normal]ysical activity. A lack of cash
[normal] can have a significant influence on whether or not a young woman is active. For young women from disadvantaged 
[normal]communities, cost i
[normal]s a 
[normal]real 
[normal]barrier to participation in sport and physical activity.
[normal] 
[normal]There is therefore a need 
[normal]for subsidised female targeted sports programmes to address the barrier of cost
[normal].
[normal]By making sport and physical activity cheaper to do 
[normal](with the help of subsidised female targeted programmes) 
[normal]and flexible payment options (pay and play activities are importan
[normal]t), young women are more likely to take part.
[normal]1.13
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Us Girls programme has uncovered 
[normal]many entrepreneurial 
[normal]female
[normal]s who have set up their own community interest companies/charities/businesses to deliver women and girls sports activities. More support for these
[normal] types of women in the form of financial help, expert advice, grants and mentoring schemes would go a long way to strengthen the female workforce providing, facilitating and advocating women’s sport.
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]Media coverage[bold] [bold]1.14
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It has long been acknowledged that there is significantly less media coverage of female sport. There are only a handful of sports journalists who are truly championing women in sport and the need to raise their profile, most notably Ashling O’Connor (The T
[normal]imes), Tanya Aldred (Telegraph / Guardian) and 
[normal]Shelley Alexander and 
[normal]Jessica Creighton (BBC).
[normal] Our experience has shown that we have had to work hard to get national media coverage for Us Girls related work
[normal] but the appointment of positions such as Shelley Alexander’s at the BBC is welcomed.
[normal]1.15
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst
[normal] national media interest has increased in last 12 months, in our experience the opportunities available to Us Girls in the m
[normal]edia are restricted to women’s 
[normal]sections 
[normal]of the 
[normal]nationals
[normal], women’s lifestyle media and sports trade, in particular 
[normal]Sport
[normal]Sister
[normal]. The appetite for Us Girls related work within the mainstream
[normal] nati
[normal]onal sports pages has been
[normal] limited.  
[normal]1.16
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The media interest in the programme is significantly higher when a high profile ambassador is involved. When Nicola Adams attended our 2 year Anniversary 
[normal]Celebration Event
[normal] at the House of Commons in July, we were able to secure the attendance of national journalists and coverage in 
[normal]The Telegraph Women
[normal]. Media were also interested in hearing our story and 
[normal]achievements,
[normal] when Victoria Pendleton presented us with the 
[normal]Us Girls National Lottery Award win
[normal] in August.  
[normal]1.17
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Us
[normal] Girls projects generally have had good media coverage locally but this varies by area. Local project managers often do not have the skills/know how to
[normal] publicise the great work 
[normal]they are doing, therefore any additional support to help raise the profile of women and girls sporting activity locally would be welcomed.
[normal]Reasons why participation in sport by women decreases[bold]1.18
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]S
[normal]treet
[normal]G
[normal]ames
[normal] has recently commissio
[normal]ned research work related to the concept of sporting capital, which is analogous to the theory o
[normal]f human capital and defined as the stock of physical, social an
[normal]d psychological attributes and competencies that support and motivate an individual to participate in sport and to sustain that participation over time'. The study investigated the relationship between an 
[normal]individual’s
[normal] sporting capital (made up of 3 domains
[normal] - social, physical and psychological) and the likelihood of participating in sport using data from Sport England APS6 survey. 
[normal]1.19
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The research indicated a clear relationship between sporting capital and the probability of participating in sport - so individu
[normal]als with a high SC score were much likely to be participating than those with a low score. The research also highlighted structural inequalities - for example on average males had much higher scores than females as did those from higher socio- economic gro
[normal]ups. In particular - women scored much lower than men in the psychological domain and questions relating to body confidence. Therefore, interventions aimed at engaging females are much more likely to succeed if they include elements aimed at raising confid
[normal]ence, self-esteem and body image as well as tacking physical barriers.
[normal]1.20
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]As well as psychological barriers relating to participation in sport, traditional structures have made it hard for even the interested and motivated young woman living in a disadvantage
[normal]d area to make 
[normal]their
[normal] own way in sport. This is because the traditional 
[normal]sporting structures are 
[normal]often 
[normal]‘out of reach’:
[normal] 
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.21
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The Us Girls programme has shown that (non sporty) young wom
[normal]en want sport that is less forma
[normal]l
[normal], relaxed and 
[normal]is based on
[normal] friendship group
[normal]s
[normal] and fun. 
[normal]1.22
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The evidence and experience from the Us Girls programme suggest
[normal]s
[normal] that increases in participation are possible through focused resources and efforts. Young women from disadvantaged communities generally need subsidised sporting activities that are delivered on their doorstep in a style that is:

[normal]&#xa0;[bold]1.23
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Often sports sessions are not delivered in the style described
[normal] above and therefore aren’t always attractive to the (non sporty/semi sporty) female market.
[normal]1.24
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Some quotes from 
[normal]Us Girls Participant
[normal]s showing why they like the sessions
[normal] include
[normal]:
[normal] 
[normal]“I like the sessions because 
[normal]they are
[normal] fun - we can play our own music and the workout is just girls” 
[normal]“There are a wide range of sporting activities that I enjoy taking part in and it opens my mind about
[normal] different sports
[normal]…. 
[normal]It’s comfortable, friendly and 
[normal]cheap, and it’s in
[normal] a no

[normal]-intimidating”

[normal]The variety of spo[bold]rts on offer to girls at school[bold]1.25
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Surv
[normal]ey results from a recent 
[normal]StreetGames 
[normal]study
[normal] with a sample of 14-16 year old girls
[normal] from areas 
[normal]of high deprivation highlighted a 
[normal]number of key frustrations relating to taking part in sport at school
[normal]. The girls 
[normal]in the study 
[normal]felt that:
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]1.26
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The sports that the girls took part in most at school were team sports and individual sports, however 
[normal]when asked to select their favourite sports, and sports they would like to do in the future, sports such as swimming, gym, dance, classes and trampolining were ranked highest.
[normal] For many, 
[normal]these 
[normal]sports are
[normal] not on offer at school.
[normal]1.27
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Engaging in sport outside of 
[normal]school was preferred as it was felt they had freedom to choose what they wanted to do, could take exercise more ‘seriously’, and would be more likely to have a coach wh
[normal]o could ‘guide’ and ‘push’ them
[normal].
[normal]1.28
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Previous experiences of sexism or not being taken 
[normal]seriously when taking part in sport inside and outside of school impacts upon the female samples’ perception of sport.
[normal]1.29
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]In addition to ‘to
[normal]o much school work’ 
[normal]being a
[normal] key barrier for 
[normal]girls to participate in sport, girls 
[normal]also selected barriers such as ‘not co
[normal]nfident enough to take part’, ‘I don’t think I’m sp
[normal]orty’, and ‘no one to go with’. There is also a desire for single sex sessions. 
[normal]Key motivators to taking part in sport are being fit and healthy, having fun
[normal] 
[normal]experiences, and improving performance.
[normal]1.30
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]It is important that 
[normal]in order to engage girls, sport
[normal] sessions 
[normal]at school 
[normal]are developed and promoted in a way
[normal] 
[normal]that offers the
[normal]m
[normal] choice in what they can do, but is within the
[normal] 
[normal]selections of sports they would be interested in doing.
[normal] It
[normal] is important to allow for 
[normal]an environment where 
[normal]girls
[normal] feel supported and motivated to learn new skills and challenge
[normal] 
[normal]themselves
[normal] – so that they feel the sessions are focused, and that they will have
[normal] 
[normal]the opportunity to improve in a fun, secure environment.

[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]During the Olympic Games we launched our #GirlsTimeToMakeItHappenCampaign which is a campaign to develop more opportunities for young women to take part in sport. This hel
[normal]ped to grow the number of organisations delivering good sport for young women as part of Us Girls and helped us to sign up a number of ‘Us Girls Champions’ from Team GB to support this effort. This includes Nicola Adams - Us Girls President, Sophie Cox (GB
[normal] Judo), 
[normal]Sarah Stevenson (GB Taekwondo) and Kate Grey (Paralympic swimmer and
[normal] commentator
[normal]), plus several others (see 
[normal]Us
[normal] Girls website
[normal] for more details).
[normal]1.34
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Whilst we have seen an 
[normal]increase in interest and activity since the Games, t
[normal]here is still a need for direct action and support in local areas to garner the enthusiasm of major sporting events in order to develop participation legacies
[normal].
[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]How StreetGames increase[bold]s[bold] female sports participation by providing activities that are delivered in an appropriate and effective way[bold]1.35
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]Our successful track record helped StreetGames to secure a £3.38 million National Lottery
[normal] award from Sport England in 2013 to set up over 300 Doorst
[normal]ep Sport Clubs (DSCs) in disadvantaged communities by March 2014.  
[normal]1.36
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]The initiative, which forms part of a wider DCMS/Sport England youth sport strategy aims to reduce the drop out in sport and help disadvantaged young people to develop a sporting habit for
[normal] life. Our 
[normal]target
[normal] is for 30% of the young people participating in the DSC programme to be female. We will use the Us Girls branding, the insight gained and the lessons learned from the Us Girls 
[normal]programme 
[normal]to help us achieve this target.
[normal]1.37
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We will do this by p
[normal]roviding a fun, exciting and vibrant place where teenage girls and young women play sports, at a low cost, right on their doorstep in a style that is attractive to them. Young women will be able to take part in a range of sports, which will include dance a
[normal]nd fitness, non-traditional sports and adapted versions of games as well as more traditional sports. They will also be given the opportunity to take part in local sports festivals, get involved in volunteering, leadership or training should they wish to do
[normal] so.  
[normal]1.38
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]StreetGames will also support DSCs to create a vibrant and varied sporting offer all year round to encourage attendance and retention, e.g. via incentives, competitions, group trips, events and links to health and wellbeing activities.  
[normal]1.39
[normal]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; 
[normal]We are conf
[normal]ident that DSCs will attract thousands of young women to participate in sport – but are realistic: alone, this initiative cannot re-dress the current gender disparities that exist.  We
[normal] are therefore, working with other partners in the women’s sport network
[normal] to do this. This includes Women’s Sport Trust, Women’s Sport Net, WSFF, Sportsister and other influential females that champion women’s sport including journalists, presenters, business women and athletes.

[normal]Many NGB programmes are not particularly geared t
[normal]owards the 
[normal]female
[normal] market. We are working with NGBs to share the learning from the Us Girls programme
[normal] 
[normal]but much more needs to be done. England Netball is a fantastic example of an NGB that has used research and insight to develop a 
[normal]participant
[normal] 
[normal]centred
[normal] approa
[normal]ch to provide products and programmes that women want.
[normal] 
[normal]There is a lot to be learnt from the success of netball in engaging a large number of females in sport.

[normal]equipment and 
[normal]clothing to young women and girls from disadvantage communities, people who want to get active but don’t
