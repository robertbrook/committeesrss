[normal]n though abuses of power may and often do invade private rights; it is about wrongs – that is to say misuses of public power; and the courts have always been alive to the fact that a person or organisation with no particular stake in the issue or the outco
[normal]me may, without in any sense being a mere meddler, wish and be well placed to call the attention of the court to an apparent misuse of public power. If an arguable case of such misuse can be made out on an application for [permission to bring judicial revi

[normal]&#xa0;
[normal]‘If a person with a potential claim cannot get legal aid, there are two possible consequences. The first is 
[normal]that the claim is dropped: that is a rank denial of justice and a blot on the rule of law. The second is that the claim is pursued, in which case it will be pursued inefficiently, and will take up much more of the court staffs’ time and of the judge’s time
[normal] in and out of court. So that it means greater costs for the court system and in delay for other litigants’.
