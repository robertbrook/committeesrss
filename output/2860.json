"&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;Written evidence from Sebastian Payne, University of Kent (PCD 02)&#xa0;\n1.\nAfter ten years of widespread discussion on the reform of war powers, several select committee inquiries, a Government consultation and White Paper in 2007-2008, and the present Foreign Secretary’s commitment to enshrine in law the duty to consult Parliament, progress towards that reform appears to have stalled.\n&#xa0;\n2. \nThe House of Lords Constitution Committee\n,\n having produced an outstanding in depth report in \nJuly 2006 proposing regulating the war powers by way of a detailed convention, now opposes ‘formalisation’. The Brown \nadministration produced\n a detailed resolution \nbut failed to implement it\n. William Hague’s commitment to enshrine in law Parliament’s role has come to nothing presumably due to the opposition or indifference of his cabinet colleagues. \n&#xa0;\n3. The\n Constitution Committee’s recent \nreport\n \nConstitutional arrangements for the use of armed force\n \n(July\n 2013)\n states\n that, “Neither primary legislation nor a resolution should be introduced as a means of formalising the role of Parliament in approving deployment decisions” (paragraph 61). The Committee goes on to say, “It seems that much of the impetus for formalising Parliament’s role is to make a political statement about where decisions should be taken, rather than to correct deficiencies i\nn the legal or military process.\n” (paragraph 63). They conclude that the existing convention\n is the best solution.\n&#xa0;\n4. \nThe Constitution Committee was persuaded by its witnesses that the nature of modern warfare had fundamentally changed and that had created a scenario inimical to detailed regulation. T\nhe Committee also assumed\n that there exists a convention of sufficient clarity to satisfy the conditions of a modern democracy and to enable the House \nof Commons\n “to exercise political control over, and confer legitimacy upon, \nsuch (\ndeployment\n) decisions\n” (paragraph 64).\n&#xa0;\n5. \nI disagree with both the underlying premises and the conclusions\n of the recent Const\nit\nution Committee report\n. Changes to modern warfare make it more necessary not less that Parliament’s role should be clear. The ability to kill people in new ways or destroy enemy infrastructure by use of cyber warfare does not negate the fundamental constitutional question of the legitimacy of deployment decisions. \nMission\n creep has always existed \nas have civil wars with broader geo-political consequences. \nI do not believe that there exists a convention of sufficient detail. Indeed, the complexity of modern warfare must have increased the uncertainty of whatever germ of a convention that does exist.\n&#xa0;\n6. \nMy preferred solution would be a detailed resolution regulating Parliament’s ‘role and responsibility’. This needs to be underpinned by a Standing Order of the House. My understanding is that a resolution is technically not binding on the Government therefore a Standing Order would help embed the\n \nobligations. \nA good starting point for the detailed resolution\n is the one proposed by the Government of the day\n in the \nGovernance of \nBritain\n \nWhite Paper. The resolution was not perfect. It gave \nvery \nwide discretion to the Prime Minister\n as to when to consult P\narliament and there were exclusions relating \nto Special Forces,\n emergencies\n and security related factors\n. Clearly a Prime Minister will need discretio\nnary powers so\n the exact wording of a re\nsolution is a matter for further discussion\n. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n7. \nSome, perhaps all, members of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee favour statutory regulation of the war powers. The attractions are clear, namely, that the government of the day would be affixed with an absolute \nset of \nlegal obligation enforceable as a last resort in the courts. My reservation with regard to this is the question of dragging the courts in to this field. It should be possible to draft an Act in a way that grants legal immunity to individual soldiers even if the deployment order turned out to be legally invalid. What I think is unavoidable is that courts would be obliged to consider the lawfulness of deployment \ndecisions where a claim is made\n for an injunction or \na \ndeclaration. Given that the judiciary face persistent, and in my view ill informed attacks from some politicians and newspapers, with regard to applying the Human Rights Act, it would merely add to the rhetoric that the judiciary are usurping their role. If it were necessary for the judiciary to exercise such a supervisory role, then of course, such disobliging rhetoric about the judiciary could and should be ignored. In my view, the appropriate institutional parties, at least for the time being, are Parliament and the Executive.\n \nWere there to be a written constitution in the future different considerations would apply\n to the role of the courts\n.\n&#xa0;\n11 October 2013\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n"
