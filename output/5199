defaultThe British Transplantation Society
defaultThe British Transplantation Society (the BTS) is the professional voice of transplantation in the UK, representing all the varied disciplines in transplantation including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, scientists involved both in basic research and in histocompatibility laboratories, ethicists and other professions allied to medicine.
default  
defaultThe BTS was formed in 1972 and its membership is open to all professionals working i
defaultn the field of transplantation.  The BTS works closely with key agencies involved in the delivery of the transplant service, in particular, NHS Blood and Transplant.  BTS members have contributed significantly to the 
defaultThe Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (
defaultSaBTO
default)
default which issued guidelines on minimisation of risk of transmission of vCJD through solid organ transplantation in March 2012.

defaultClinical and financial benefits of transplantation
defaultTransplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage failure of a number of organs.  The procedure is life-saving for recipients of cardiothoracic, liver and intestinal transplants and improves quality of life for most renal transplant recipients and improves life-expectancy for many.  Transplantation of whole pancreata or pancreatic islets has a major impact on the lives of diabetics.  Renal transplantation is a highly cost-effective treatment for end-stage renal failure with costs less than half of those for dialysis
default.  Access to transplantation is limited by the availability of donor organs.  Insufficient availability results in 20% of patients on the waiting list for liver or cardiothoracic organs dying or becoming too ill to transplant and kidney transplant recipients waiting for an average of just over three years. 
default&#xa0;
defaultRisk of disease transmission by solid organ transplantation
defaultThe potential for inadvertent transmission of cancer or infection in a transplanted organ is a key driver to the approach to assessing the suitability of a potential deceased organ donor.
defaultCurrently, there is no specific screening test available for vCJD.  
defaultIndividuals with 
defaultprobable or possible 
defaultCJD and vCJD and

defaultPotential risk of transmission of vCJD and likely clinical impact
defaultThe incidence of vCJD in the UK over the last five years has amounted to only 1-2 diagnoses/deaths per year (data from UK Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit,

defaulth an organ or tissue transplant.  The theoretical unlikely risk of transmission of vCJD to solid organ transplant recipients must be balanced against the risks of restricting access to life saving transplants for individuals with end-stage organ failure.  These patients usually have multiple comorbidities and  
defaultmost recipients of organs retrieved from donors who might be harbouring vCJD will die from competing causes long before vCJD becomes clinically manifest. 
default 
default&#xa0;
defaultConclusion
defaultWe believe that current measures adopted by the UK transplant system are sufficient to render an acceptably low risk of inadvertent transmission of vCJD.  We would oppose more 
defaultrestrictive measures that would reduce the number of suitable donor organs available for transplantation.
