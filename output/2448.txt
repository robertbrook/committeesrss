[[[Summary Position]]]

[[[ for the three providers ]]]1.1 Anchor, Hanover and Housing 21are the largest national specialist providers of older people’s housing. Together we provide a majority of specialist accommodation and services for this client group, and lead in the building of extra care housing. We have decided to offer a joint response to the Committee in order to demonstrate the level of our shared concerns regarding the way in which support for housing costs is changing as a result of welfare reforms; in the hope that this will add weight to our comments.&#xa0;1.2 

[[[Anchor ]]]is a not-for-profit organisation with more than 40 years’ experience of helping older people. We are England’s largest not-for-profit provider of sheltered housing for rent as well as England’s largest not-for-profit care home provider. We provide great places to buy or rent as well as care and support services, including:&#xa0;•              Almost 700 retirement housing schemes•              Property management services for leaseholders at 230 estates•              97 care homes, including two specialist dementia homes•              Almost 1,000 integrated care and housing properties&#xa0;1.3 

[[[Hanover Housing Association]]] is a major national provider of retirement housing and one of the largest providers of Extra Care accommodation. Hanover manages approximately 19,000 properties (including over 3000 properties for Extra Care) in some 600 locations across England. We work in over 216 local authority areas. Approximately 10% of our stock is occupied by those under minimum state pension credit age, and potentially affected by the present and future changes to support for housing costs.&#xa0;1.4 

[[[Housing 21]]] is a major specialist provider of older people's housing and services - a leading national social enterprise which promotes choice and independence for older people through quality care, health and housing services. With nearly 50 years of experience we provide a complete service to meet the diverse needs of older people supporting them to have a good later life.We operate in 242 local authority areas, providing individually tailored solutions spanning housing, care, support, dementia and other services. We have 470 retirement/sheltered housing schemes. All told we manage over 20,000 sheltered and extra care properties for older people. 1.5 Our joint response concentrates upon implications of changes in respect of Registered Providers, and vulnerable claimants – particularly those with disabilities and within supported accommodation, not all of which will come within the current definition of exempt accommodation. We have also responded on the treatment of housing costs within Universal Credit; and made additional observations on future implications for older people.&#xa0;

[[[2. Direct payment of housing costs to claimants]]]2.1 We appreciate the principle of replicating the world of work and encouraging those in receipt of benefits to manage their finances in similar fashion to those who are working. 

[[[&#xa0;]]]2.2 However we are aware that the direct payment demonstration projects are already showing an increase in rent arrears, despite organisations increasing their staff resources to manage the process. The fear is therefore that landlords will not be able to replicate this level of intensive management across their entire stock, with a real concern that arrears levels will increase further. The risks are potentially greater within a supported housing environment as the incidence of vulnerable tenants will be greater and such tenants may be the least likely to be able to maintain rent payments to their landlord. The Local Support Services Framework sets out extensive measures to assist those most vulnerable and needing support to cope, but introduces new bureaucracy and processes.&#xa0;2.3 We believe that landlords, in consultation with their tenants, should be able to agree how rent is paid to them. Most supported housing providers will work to promote the independence of their tenants and will recognise when it is appropriate to have rent paid direct to them, bypassing the tenant, and when it makes sense for the tenant to take personal responsibility. &#xa0;2.4 Should the current commitment to direct payments remain then the ability for direct payments to revert back to the landlord at a two month trigger point is welcome and necessary; as is the intention to allow potential reversion to be discussed after one month. But for many vulnerable tenants the uncertainty and anxiety caused during these initial weeks could be avoided entirely if the landlord and the tenant could agree at the outset how best rent was to be paid.&#xa0;

[[[3. Household benefit cap]]]3.1 Allowing those living within supported accommodation to come within the total benefit cap, whilst ignoring actual help with housing costs when calculating the cap for anyone in exempt accommodation, is extremely complicated.  In practice, those living in exempt accommodation are often disabled and by ignoring both their housing costs and disability benefits, the majority fall well below the cap. However the current definition of exempt accommodation remains far from clear. This means that those living in supported accommodation which is not considered exempt face having their total benefits capped; even though their circumstances may differ very little from those in exempt accommodation.&#xa0;3.2 We feel strongly that it is time for the definition of exempt accommodation to be clarified for providers, local authorities and tenants. We also feel that whatever the final definition, the cap would be greatly simplified by omitting all supported housing as this would ensure that those of working age living in supported housing can receive the full support of the welfare system which they need. &#xa0;

[[[Social]]]

[[[ sector size criteria]]]4.1 Evidence of application of the social sector size criteria so far indicates that this is counter productive and cannot achieve the stated aim of better use of housing stock. 4.2 We are particularly concerned that the criteria penalise both disabled couples and single claimants who require an additional bedroom for health reasons – whether this be a medical need to sleep separately, or to accommodate essential medical equipment. This is often likely to be the case in supported housing as those with such medical needs also have wider support needs; and as much supported housing is not currently considered to be exempt from the size criteria, vulnerable disabled people are disadvantaged. Indeed, many may not need high levels of other support, but do actually need the extra bedroom as a form of support to maintain their independence and well being.&#xa0;4.3 Since 2006 Department of Health funding for new extra care developments has specified that properties should have 3 habitable rooms. This is still the case for Home and Communities Agency funding. New schemes are funded and developed on this basis. The Department for Work and Pension will now potentially say that this is too large for the household's needs and the resident will see a reduction in their housing benefit entitlement due to the size criteria restrictions.&#xa0;4.4 For many disabled people in the social sector, downsizing therefore will not be an option. However those who cannot afford to retain the spare bedroom may be forced to look to alternative accommodation in the private sector which may not ultimately be cheaper, and which will not reduce the benefits bill. The lack of suitable alternative accommodation is a major concern. The availability of one bedroom properties puts severe restrictions and limitation on the ability for people to downsize. People are often stuck in a situation where there housing benefit entitlement is restricted as the property is deemed too large for their needs but there is no smaller accommodation available.&#xa0;4.5 We are concerned about adults with disabilities and are unsure as to why disabled children are not expected to have to share a bedroom whereas a recent High Court judgement has said that disabled adults are expected to share a bedroom. Often with older people, even if they wanted to share a bedroom, this is not always practical as a result of health problems. We realise that this recent judicial review does not support our contention that those with a proven disability and medical need for an extra bedroom should be able to receive help with the cost of this. However we remain convinced that it is still appropriate that the implications and impact upon vulnerable disabled claimants should be reconsidered as part of this review. &#xa0;

[[[5. ]]]

[[[Localised]]]

[[[ council tax support]]]5.1 We all work across a large number of local authorities, and are unaware of any which have not adhered to the guidance that vulnerable claimants should not receive less council tax support than they did previously under Council Tax Benefit. This is welcome; however we fear that as local authority budgets become more restricted, the lack of a national system will increasingly lead to local variation and the ‘postcode lottery’ principle.&#xa0;5.2 Without a national demand led system, local circumstances and budgetary pressures will inevitably mean that disabled people and those in supported accommodation will eventually find that the level of help they can expect with council tax varies between areas, irrespective of their personal circumstances. This will undermine the support that they receive elsewhere, and the safety net will become increasingly disjointed and fragmented.

[[[6. T]]]

[[[reatment of housing costs within Universal Credit]]]6.1 Our major concerns concentrate on the following areas – service charge provisions; benefit overlaps when moving home; temporary absence provisions; waiting periods; and notification of housing cost awards.&#xa0;6.2

[[[ ]]]

[[[Service charge provisions are restricted in comparison to Housing Benefit.]]] The principles appear to assume that the majority of working age claimants occupy straightforward property with very little in the way of services apart from fairly standard items such as refuse collection, car parking, gardening. The new service charge provisions do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of supported housing and the additional facilities this may provide.We hope that the provisions for window cleaning costs are not replicated in any service charge provision for older people, as we consider that it is unhelpful for anyone living in sheltered housing to be expected to clean windows at any level.&#xa0;6.3

[[[ ]]]

[[[Lack of any provision for overlap of benefit when moving home.]]]

[[[ ]]]It is extremely difficult for those on the lowest incomes to pay for a notice period as well as the rent for a new property when moving home. The majority of disabled people and those needing supported housing do not move on a whim, but because they need more suitable accommodation. Without help with housing costs, many will be unable to accept the accommodation they badly need and local strategies to meet specific housing need will not be met.&#xa0;This lack of provision to meet housing costs for a notice period is also likely to affect those wishing to downsize to avoid social sector size criteria penalties. We do not believe that discretionary housing payment funding will remain sufficient to cover this, and that these provisions act as a deterrent to the aim of achieving better use of housing stock nationally.

[[[&#xa0;]]]6.4 

[[[A standard six month provision for absence from home.]]]

[[[ ]]]A blanket provision for absence from home for any reason provides administrative simplicity, but lacks fairness. Replacing the present 13 week absence rule within Housing Benefit with six months for Universal Credit, provides an over generous opportunity for those who are not genuinely occupying the property as their home; whilst simultaneously penalising the sick and disabled who may need to spend an extended time in hospital or nursing care. Such claimants will be forced into a choice between rent arrears or not receiving the nursing care and support they need. Ultimately for some this will lead to increased dependence upon state resources at a far higher cost.6.5

[[[ T]]]

[[[he decision to apply the waiting period to the whole Universal Credit award.   ]]]We understand that this will only apply to claimants who are expected to work and have full work-related requirements; but it is unclear how this might affect vulnerable and disabled claimants. There are many with disabilities that are expected and able to work, and who wish to do so; however they may find themselves placed in the full work requirement group. Many will already find that they receive less help through premiums within Universal Credit, and having to wait an extra 7 days before receiving any housing costs will place an additional obstacle in their way.&#xa0;Overall we consider that a total waiting period of up to 38 days before a first payment is made will penalise those on the lowest incomes who are most in need of help at the start of their claim. This does not accurately reflect the world of work for many low paid workers who are not usually expected to work their first week without getting paid at all; and who are often paid weekly rather than salaried monthly. No one on a salary is expected to wait that long for their first payment. &#xa0;An increase in those on very low incomes who are desperately short of money at the start of their claim, will lead to an increase in requests for help via local welfare provision – at a time when local schemes are already providing less assistance due to restricted funding. Scarce resources will therefore be further pressured by the poorest having nowhere else to turn for assistance during the extended waiting period. &#xa0;We strongly feel that the precise detail of how this provision will apply to vulnerable and disabled people therefore needs further careful consideration. &#xa0;6.6&#xa0; 

[[[Notification of amount of housing costs. ]]]Although Universal Credit is meant to replicate a wage by being paid as a single payment, we see no purpose in not clearly identifying actual amounts towards housing costs within the award. We hope that everyone will receive notification of awards which clearly show how much help is being provided towards housing costs, as this will assist in supporting claimants towards managing their own payments.&#xa0;

[[[7. Implications of future changes for older people]]]7.1 All three providers appreciate that how support for housing costs is delivered for older people is outside the scope of this inquiry; but we do not want to miss the opportunity to comment on this. We urge that very careful consideration is given to how help towards housing costs within Pension Credit is determined, and how this aligns with Universal Credit provisions.7.2 We consider that the issues of eligible service charges, overlap of benefit for two homes, and period of absence from home for hospital or respite care, would pose significant problems for older people should these provisions be replicated within Pension Credit. There would be consequences for older people being able to downsize from family homes, as well as the inability to move to smaller suitable supported accommodation. This would lead to many being unable to remain living independently for longer, with consequent increased social care costs. We remain convinced that such consequences would be unintended and counter productive.&#xa0;7.3 In conclusion, we are aware that the DWP are currently reviewing the definition of 'exempt accommodation' status for housing benefit purposes. The current definition states that the landlord or a person acting on their behalf also provides the claimant with care, support or supervision. The government is pushing the personalisation agenda, whereby people are encouraged to receive direct payments rather than care packages organised by Social Services. With personalisation, the landlord is less like to be involved in the provision of care as individuals will take responsibility for organising their own care.&#xa0;It is very important for the new definition of exempt accommodation that this is factored in, particularly in relation to extra care properties. &#xa0;26 September 2013&#xa0;7&#xa0;
