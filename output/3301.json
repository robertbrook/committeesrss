"PUB0010\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nWritten evidence from Centre for Enterprise and Economic Development Research, Middlesex University Business School\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Question 12: What progress has been made in setting up mutuals as an effective way of delivering public services?&#xa0;And Question 7: What examples are there of innovative ways to deliver better public services in local government, from other countries or from other public service providers?&#xa0;\nSummary&#xa0;\nThis submission draws on the research conducted by Middlesex University as part of the Innovation Research Initiative funded by ESRC, BIS and NESTA, running from 2011-2013. The key findings for this inquiry are:\n&#xa0;\nProgress in setting up mutuals as effective ways of delivering servicesInnovative ways to deliver better public services – examples 1. Introduction1.1 \nWe respond to the inquiry by drawing on early findings from a 2-year research project that has examined the innovative activity of 30 mutual spin-outs. In this submission we review initial data on the scope of mutual \nspin-outs\n, and present initial findings related to the extent of \ninnovation.\n \nWe give the voices of some of the leaders, staff and others using or supporting these mutual \nspin-outs\n.\n&#xa0;\n1.2 \nOur research focuses on health and social care provision which has seen increasing numbers of public sector \nspin-outs\n and mutual forms in recent years through the facilitating action of the Department of Health’s Right to Request Policy (\nDoH\n, 2008) and other more recent policy actions to encourage \nmutuals\n. While there were mutual spin-outs in the years prior to this policy starting in 2008, recent policy seeks to significantly increase the number and scale of spin-outs. \n&#xa0;\n1.3 \nInterviews were conducted with people at all levels of each case study organisation, including directors/leaders, managers, staff, trustees and users with an emphasis on those who had been particularly involved in change and innovation processes.\n \nExternal stakeholders linked to each case study were also interviewed and included commissioners of public services, partner organisations and other providers of support. The qualitative interviews were recorded and fully transcribed.\n \n&#xa0;2. What is the changing landscape of mutual spin-outs?&#xa0;2.1 \nAs part of our research we have compiled a comprehensive database of mutual spin-outs providing health and social care services in England, comprising 52 organisations (a further 19 organisations provide other types of services, including leisure, social work, education and housing). The vast majority of these \nmutuals\n (41 of 52) were established in 2011 as part of the Right to Request process and availability of Social Enterprise Investment Fund grants. Some earlier social enterprises were also part of the Right to Request. Since 2011 there has been reduced activity in health and social care with an estimated 12 further \nspin-outs\n, although our data only covers two of these.\n&#xa0;\n2.2 \nThere is a relatively even distribution of mutual organisations across the regions of England, with a slightly higher concentration in the East of England (12 of 52) and only one organisation in the North East. Many of the organisations (35%) are small, with fewer than 50 employees, although 19% of the organisations have over 1,000 employees. Annual turnover information is not readily available for all organisations, but ranges from the smallest organisations with turnover of less than £500,000 to the largest at over £43 million.\n&#xa0;\n2.3 \nAmongst the health and social care providing \nmutuals\n, the types of services provided are highly diverse, with 15% providing general practice or primary care services, 23% providing mental health services, and 23% providing various specialist services (e.g. audiology, \nlymphedema\n, drug addiction services). 38% of mutual spin-outs provide multiple community health services, many of which represent the large organisations (over 1,000 employees) with multimillion pound turnovers.\n&#xa0;2.4 \nA small number of further \nmutuals\n have been started since then in a diverse range of sectors beyond health, although at a much slower pace.\n \nThis is partly as a result of\n: \n&#xa0;\n2.5 \nFurthermore, the policy rhetoric around a looser idea of '\nmutuals\n' has created less trust and local support than the previous approach of supporting social enterprise models with asset locks.\n&#xa0;\n3. Are mutual spin-outs more innovative than the public sector?&#xa0;3.1 \nThe results show that innovation can be faster and easier in spin-out social enterprises compared to the public sector, although many of the most innovative elements identified had been initiated and sometimes developed by social entrepreneurial leaders and key staff while within the public sector. The CEOs of the case study social enterprises were reported to be acting entrepreneurially, with reference to these leaders as disruptors, mavericks and ‘pushing the boundaries’\n. \n&#xa0;“[Our pre-spin-out innovative service] \nexisted because we didn't ask permission.\n \nAll the best things I've ever done in the health service, we've done under the radar \n[…].\n \nWe haven't explicitly looked for permission.” \n(CEO case 6)\n&#xa0;\n3.2 \nMost cases demonstrated strengths in change management led by entrepreneurial and inspirational leaders, staff engagement and building a more ‘open climate’ for new ideas and innovation.\n \nIn many cases, successful innovation was found to be part of a wider learning culture, with staff and users involved in key meetings, and with senior management being open and receptive to new ideas and alternative approaches. Greater engagement is also supported by staff having a stake in the organisation.\n&#xa0;\n“…as shareholders, we’ve actually got a say in what happens.”\n (Exec PA case 4)\n&#xa0;\n3.3 \nRather than providing evidence of a radical cultural change in staff orientations and motivations, the evidence points to a process of evolutionary change and adaptation.\n \nAdvantages of becoming a social enterprise were presented as:\n \n&#xa0;\n“being able to use your initiative, to actually develop things that people want and need without the red tape” (\nNurse in Case 4).\n&#xa0;\n“…as an NHS trust it was very, very set in stone that these are our boundaries and this is how we’ll behave and this is where we’re going.\n \nBut, as a social enterprise, staff are […] really empowered to have a massive part in the decision making” \n(Projects manager, Case 5)\n&#xa0;\n3.4 \nHowever, the process of engaging staff as shareholders often took some time to evolve, with some organisations having limited staff involvement on boards. While most organisations had a majority of staff shareholders, others had more limited staff shareholdings and were still trying to encourage staff to opt in. In one large organisation they had found that only half of staff had decided to be shareholders. :\n&#xa0;\n“there are particular staff groupings who are very conservative and don't particularly like change. They tend to be the ones who haven't opted in. …. it tends to be more community nursing staff who tend to be a different generation. Whereas physical therapists and people like that are very open mind\ned and they join quite quickly. \nThere's an awful lot of them on the governing body, for example. They're much more adaptable to change”\n (CEO of case 3).\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;4. What are the types of innovation in mutual spin-outs?&#xa0;\n4.1 \nDrawing on case study evidence from organisations in health and social care, innovations in four main areas are examined: \n&#xa0;\n(4.1.1) \nOrganisational – new forms to facilitate democratic governance and decision making\n \nThe new social enterprise/mutual forms have involved specific mechanisms that give greater power and voice to staff and user communities, such as staff councils, user forums, and community asset locks.\n \nSuch mechanisms have also been important in enabling specific innovations in services and processes (as will be discussed further below), as well as related organisational innovation.\n \nFor example, a large provider of community services had developed its own charitable arm that was used to disperse a surplus that had been generated through delivering service contracts. These organisational innovations contribute to the process of cultural change which in turn can lead to further innovations in services.\n \n&#xa0;\n(4.1.2) \nNew treat\nments and services\nInnovations in this category involved more effective treatments and therapies, often inspired by a more holistic understanding of the relationship between individuals’ physical and mental health and well-being, including with respect to social interaction and work\n \nintegration/\n \nemployment needs. In one case a new eating disorder service and residential facility had been specifically designed to help address the needs of a particularly vulnerable target group\n. \nOther services focused on rehabilitation have involved activities and support to help young people with disabilities in transitioning from special needs schools and support for independent living and employment\n&#xa0;\n(4.1.3) \nNew forms of outreach for\n particular demographic groups\nInnovations in services have been focused on meeting under-addressed health and well-being needs and related preventive activity.\n \nThis has involved new forms of outreach and engagement within a variety of local community settings including homes and community-based buildings and for particular demographic groups (i.e. in terms of age, race, gender etc\n.\n).\n \nIn one particularly striking example, frontline health workers had developed a novel approach to promoting sexual health, safe drinking and personal safety messages to young people in the bars and nightclubs of the local area.\n \nAnother community health provider had introduced a mobile health unit used for alcohol awareness raising, diabetes awareness in the town centre and an event at a local mosque.\n \n(4.1.4) \nIncremental improvements to organis\national systems and processes\nFinally, most cases reported more incremental improvements to pre-existing services, organisational systems and processes, often driven by efficiency and cost-effectiveness considerations and the more competitive context and ability of organisations/employees to respond more flexibly. Examples include systems of procurement, staff working conditions, and recruitment approaches. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5. How can innovation in public services be supported?&#xa0;\n5.1 \nCreating the space for innovation in the public sector and in alternative providers\nInnovation involves experimentation and risk, with a need for a climate of tolerance and readiness to learn from failure.\n \nAnalysis of case studies show that spaces for learning and experimentation can involve mechanisms such as innovation awards, an ideas box, or the provision of time/space and support to those with innovative ideas to develop a business case.\n \nThe organisational culture can also allow spaces for experimentation and risk taking. This may have occurred in the public sector, with a majority of the case studies referring to actively creating spaces to take risk while in the public sector. However, when having more independence they are able to explore and experiment\n \nwith more freedom. \n&#xa0;\n“We’d always being trying to exploit our opportunities… playing the system a bit. I can be more open and free about it now… so sometimes it feels that there is lot less personal risk … I used monies in my budget in ways that was stretching the boundaries.\n \nIf someone wanted to \narsey\n about it, I could have probably had my wrist slapped”.\n \n(CEO of case 1).\n&#xa0;\n5.1.1 \nThe concept of risk was shown to be different for those leaving the public sector. An innovation that involved novel therapies by providing service users with portable computers shows how this has changed, and opened up new spaces for social innovation: \n&#xa0;\n“The NHS tends to be overly secure for all sorts of right reasons\n…\n The initial response from our IT provider which is the NHS said, ‘You can't do that.’… And we were like, ‘Let's just do it and see what happens’. There is something in-built in these people, and you'd have to say, if you're green, hide in the grass... People worked in the NHS not because they were risk takers. So it was a cultural change that you need to do to change them to say, ‘I can take a risk and do something differently.’ ”\n (CEO of case 3)\n&#xa0;\n5.1.2 \nSpaces for experimentation and risk were therefore found to be both opening up with the move to social enterprise, but at the same time the new commercial pressures of a social enterprise brought other risks for senior managers. \n&#xa0;\n5.1.3 \nWhere there is resistance to innovation, there is need for leaders with entrepreneurial approaches and determination. This was found to be particularly important when pursuing ideas even when others are opposed. For example one CEO of an organisation offering counselling services stated: \n&#xa0;\n“I told them I wanted a consultant psychologist, they said no.\n \nSo I set the charity up to raise the money to pay for him, and then persuaded them to employ him, so he kept his benefits.\n \nAnd everybody told me it would not be possible, and it took nearly five years to pull it all together, but we did”\n (CEO of case 2).\n&#xa0;\n5.1.4 \nA number of organisations identified the importance of bringing in ‘new blood’ in order to fill competency gaps and to drive innovation:\n \n&#xa0;\n“So we rely very much on people, clinicians in particular, coming up with ideas. We brought in\n \nnew blood to the organisation. I brought in a director of nursing who’s come from a different background. I brought in a commercial director who never worked for the NHS before in his life. Worked for \nthe pharmaceutical industries… \nSo we created a commercial team which was about being much more outward looking”\n (CEO of case 3)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.2 \nEncouraging involvement of users and other stakeholders in service design\nInnovation can be driven by being responsive to user needs and an ‘open’ approach to learning from new knowledge from various sources, as well as the need for partnership working (with public, third/social and private sector organisations).\n \nThe most striking example of user involvement was that of\n \na provider of mental health care services (Case 5) where the board of directors was entirely composed of people with disabilities (\n“experts by experience… \nputting the users in the driving seat”\n) supported by an oversight committee involving sympathetic local people.\n \n&#xa0;\n5.2.1 \nThe new, more autonomous/independent situation was also found by some to be more enabling of relationships with other organisations such as private sector businesses (e.g. offering employment opportunities\n \nand relationships with pharmaceutical companies), as well as with NHS partners\n \nin the public sector and voluntary sector agencies.\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.3 \nFunding and commissioning innovation\nInnovation is not without costs and risks and there is a need to fund the learning and piloting of new activities.\n \nSocial innovations were found to be funded from four sources: \n5.3.1 \nThe social enterprise cases were found to have a degree of freedom with their budgets that they did not have while in the public sector. Where they had been able to generate a surplus, this was used for new services and experimentation, allowing risk taking without jeopardising the financial position of the organisation\n \nor damaging relationships with the public sector commissioners. In some cases\n \nstaff were involved in voting on where the surplus was being spent. This was focused on those service areas that\n \nthe public sector contracts were not covering. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.2 \nPhilanthropic sources can be accessed through a fundraising team or by setting\n \nup a charity in order to channel its surplus and be able to apply for charitable funds.\n \nOne case study referred to the benefits of\n \ncharitable funding as \n“It just frees your head up”\n (CEO Case 2), and allows new ideas to be developed. Collaborations with other organisations can also allow smaller social enterprises to access resources, particularly those that have skills in accessing research and development funding and bidding for larger contracts or grants.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.3 \nCommissioners were found to play a key role in each of the case studies. The process of social innovation was therefore driven by their interest in new ideas or their willingness to fund developing innovations. While commissioners are often cautious and can be risk-averse, in some case commissioners were willing to fund pilots and also fund the research that was need to provide evidence of the impact.\n \nIn one case, they were benefitting from a national programme of Commissioning for Quality and Innovation that aims to reward innovation. \n&#xa0;\n5.3.4 \nWhere there was greater involvement of commissioners, interviewees noted the continuity\n \nof the commissioning team, and the extent to which the commissioner is under financial pressure. The importance of personal relationships with commissioners was noted by one case:\n&#xa0;\n“Commissioners like the things like this that help keep their paymasters off their back, and look good. If you do that and provide the service, they see you as an ally. I suppose you call it a collaborative approach.”\n \n(CEO of case 1).\n&#xa0;\n5.3.5 \nThere was a perception found amongst both commissioners and social enterprises that with austerity measures, short-term financial savings are being prioritised over experimentation and innovation that may have potential long-term benefits. One commissioner stated: \n&#xa0;\n“Our ability to fund things outside of a competitive process in the future are going to be severely restricted by the government’s proposals.\n \n[…]\n \nsometimes when you go out to tender, it’s the bigger organisations who’ve got the capacity to actually do those huge tender processes.”\n(Commissioner)\n&#xa0;\n5.3.6 \nIn a public service commissioning context that is increasingly competitive, there are tensions around the need for co-operation and sharing of innovative ideas. The balance between being open to sharing learning and innovation with other organisations and a \nperceived need to protect Intellectual Property in a competitive environment poses a growing challenge for many social enterprises.\n&#xa0;\n5.3.7 \nContributions to social value are difficult to quantify and represent within existing commissioning frameworks.\n \nUnder conditions of public sector austerity, there is a danger that short-term financial savings are prioritised over longer term learning, experimentation and innovation with potential durable benefits. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;AcknowledgementsThis work is part of an ESRC funded project on The role of \nmutuals\n in public service innovation, at Middlesex University with Fergus Lyon, Leandro Sepulveda, Ian Vickers, Caitlin \nMcMullin\n and Dan Gregory.
