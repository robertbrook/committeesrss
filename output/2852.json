It was therefore necessary, in some instances, to estimate the number of recalls to arrive at the total number of prisoners who would be enfranchised and able to vote under each option, as many recalled prisoners would be serving sentences below the thresholds set by the options. The process for doing this is as follows.\nThe recall population was estimated for each sentence length band based on the size of each sentence length band relative to the prison population liable to be recalled. The number of those recalled to sentences of less than 4 years is estimated to be 1,800 prisoners. – This number was not added to the population figures for the sentence length as it is an estimate only, but should be considered as part of this population. \nNo recalls were estimated for the total population of prisoners serving sentences of 6 months and less in England and Wales. These prisoners are eligible for release on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) licence before their automatic release date (and could be recalled from that) but they are not currently subject to any licence or recall during the second half of their sentence. Therefore, recalls from HDC represent only a very small proportion in the total population of recalls.\n In Scotland, prisoners serving sentences of less than 4 years are in most cases not eligible for release on license – no recalls were therefore apportioned.\nF.              Potential financial cost of implementing option 1 (ban for those sentenced to 4 years or more) and option 2 (ban for those sentenced to more than 6 months) in the draft Bill&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;Summary&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRegistration costs (funded by local authorities)\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 6: Registration costs to EROs in UK (£; 2013/14 price terms)\n&#xa0;\nInitial registrations  Following years Registration cost – prisoners in custody for less than 4 years (Option 1) \n£39,000\n       £134,000\nRegistration cost – prisoners in custody for 6 months and less (Option 2)\n£6,000\n        £56,000\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nElections costs\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nTable 7: Estimated election costs (postal voting, 2013/14 prices) – European Parliamentary and General \nelections\n, 100% turnout\n&#xa0;\nEuropean Parliamentary elections General elections onlyElections cost – prisoners in custody for less than 4 years (Option 1)\n£79,000\n£76,000\nElection cost – prisoners in custody for 6 months and less (Option 2)\n£13,000\n£12,000\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nANNEX A&#xa0;\nList of judgments most recently discussed by the CoM (DH) at their latest meeting of 4 June 2013. &#xa0;&#xa0;\nNo.PageCases StateJudgment final onViolationAction requiredLink to the last decision1\n12\nMANUSHAQE PUTO AND OTHERS \nDRIZA GROUP\nALBANIA\n02/06/2008\n17/12/2012\nThese cases concern the non-enforcement of final domestic court and administrative decisions relating to the applicants’ right to restitution or compensation (whether pecuniary or in kind) for property nationalised under the communist regime (violation of articles 6§1, 1, Protocol No.1 and 13). \nThe European Court in the pilot judgement \nManushaqe\n \nPuto\n and others fixed a deadline of 18 months for the authorities to set up an effective compensation mechanism.\nAssessment of the status of execution of this group of cases and of the appropriate response to be given in the absence of significant progress, despite repeated calls from the Committee (on the basis of a draft interim resolution).\n1164th meeting\nMarch 2013\n2\n17\nMINASYAN AND SEMERJYAN GROUP\nARMENIA\n23/09/2009\nViolations of the applicants' right to peaceful enjoyment of their possessions due to the expropriation of their flats or the deprivation of their right to use of flats under conditions that are not prescribed by law (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1).\nTake note of the action report provided by the Armenian authorities for the execution of this group of cases and instruct the Secretariat to present a detailed assessment of the said action report at the latest at the December 2013 DH meeting.\n1100th meeting\n(p. 19)\nDecember 2010\n&#xa0;\n3\n19\nMURADOVA GROUP\nAZERBAIJAN\n02/07/2009\nExcessive use of force by the police against the applicants (two of them \njournalists) during demonstrations and lack of an effective investigation in this respect (violations of Article 3 on substantive and procedural limb).

The main existing duty for staff at election time - the witnessing of declarations of identity completed in the course of a postal ballot - will continue.\n&#xa0;\n              \n4.2  It\n has not been possible to assess the impact of the new Act on the resources of prisons. This will be determined by the level of interest that prisoners will have in voting and it is not yet known if this will increase. The relevant parts of the new Act deal with removing obstacles to eligible prisoners’ registering to vote, particularly those encountered after 6 months or longer spent in custody. It does not include measures to directly encourage more interest in voting by prisoners, so significant changes to voting in prisons might not occur.\n&#xa0;\nImplementation&#xa0;5.\n              \nThis PSO comes into effect on 16 February 2001, the date upon which Section 5 of the Representation of the People Act 2000 on voting by prisoners comes into effect.\n&#xa0;Mandatory Action&#xa0;&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;&#xa0;\nYoung prisoners&#xa0;\n7.\n              \nYoung prisoners aged 18 and over, who fit into the categories of prisoner listed in paragraph 1.3 of Chapter 1 of the PSO, also have the right to vote. 16 and 17 year olds held in custody, who fit the categories in paragraph 1.3, may apply to register to vote in anticipation of being able to vote when they reach the age of 18.\n&#xa0;\nFurther information&#xa0;\n8.\n              \nEnquiries about the contents of this PSO, or the issues it covers, should be directed to Gabrielle \nKann\n (020 7217 6331) or Bob Daw (020 7217 6682) in Prisoner Administration Group.

This disqualification covers prisoners released on temporary licence (ROTL) and those unlawfully at large.\n&#xa0;\n1.2.2\n              \nThe Working Party on Electoral Procedures, which examined and reviewed all electoral arrangements after the last general election held in 1997, published its findings on 19 October 1999.  They could find no reason to change the existing situation in which convicted prisoners found guilty of a crime serious enough to warrant imprisonment were denied the right to vote for the duration of their imprisonment. Parliament is satisfied that the Representation of the People Act 2000 complies with the Human Rights Act 1998. Long-standing precedent set by the European Court of Human Rights upholds that certain sections of society can be excluded from voting.\n&#xa0;\nThe categories of prisoner who have the right to vote&#xa0;1.3              The right to vote is restricted to the following categories of prisoner:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nRegistering as an elector and rolling registration&#xa0;1.4&#xa0;1.4.1\n              \nEligible prisoners may already be registered to vote at the home address where they would be living, were they not in custody: the routine annual canvass of electors held by Electoral \nRegistration Officers (EROs\n),\n requires by law that the names of all people eligible to vote within every household and resident each year on 15 October, are disclosed. \n&#xa0;\n1.4.2\n              \nAn eligible prisoner already registered and wishing to vote, who is or expects to be in prison for six months or more, is advised to contact the relevant ERO to check that their registration is still valid. Other eligible prisoners already registered and wishing to \nvote,\n generally need take no action until an election is announced and then apply promptly for an absent vote (see Chapter 2 for absent voting instructions).\n&#xa0;\n1.4.3\n              \nEligible prisoners, if they have not already done so, may register to vote at the home address where they would be living, were they not in custody, during the annual voting canvass, on the form sent to households by EROs.\n&#xa0;\n1.4.4\n              \nWith effect from 16 February 2001, under section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 2000, a system of “rolling registration” will be in place. This means that eligible prisoners can apply to an Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) to register to vote at any time of the year, if they were not registered during the routine annual canvass (see Annex A for the application format). Alternatively, registration forms are available from EROs, as listed at Annex E.\nEligible prisoners should be aware that under the rules on all elections, the general cutoff date for registration applications being received by EROs is mid-month, two months before the month in which an election will be held. \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nNew  ways to register to vote&#xa0;1.5              \n&#xa0;\n1.5.1\n              \nIf they are not able to register at their home address, eligible prisoners may now register in one of two ways introduced by the Representation of the People Act 2000 (except for convicted \nunsentenced\n prisoners - see section 1.7 below): \n&#xa0;\n1.5.2\n              \nA “declaration of local connection” \n              \nEligible prisoners can register in a constituency where they have lived previously, following a “declaration of local connection”. This declaration can be made on the basis of a significant link to a particular locality, which can be demonstrated in various ways, by, for example: relatives or friends stayed with, regular use of a bed and breakfast guesthouse or hostel, or contact with agencies working with the homeless. See Annex A for further information.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.3\n              \nThe address of the prison establishment \n              \nAlternatively, eligible prisoners may give the address of the prison establishment in which they are held, and therefore apply to vote in the constituency where it is situated. Subject to the discretion of Electoral Registration Officers, it will usually be appropriate to use this option if an eligible prisoner has been, or is likely to be, in custody for six months or more, or if an eligible prisoner is unable to make a declaration of local connection. \n&#xa0;\n1.5.4\n              \nFurther advice  \n              \nIf a prisoner is not sure about which option to use when wanting to register to vote, they should contact an Electoral Registration Officer, as listed at Annex E, for further guidance.\n&#xa0;\n1.5.5\n              \nApplications to register to vote \n              \nForms for registering in the ways described are available from Electoral Registration Officers. Alternatively, eligible prisoners can write to Electoral Registration Officers, using the letter format to be found at Annex A.\n&#xa0;Expiry of Registration&#xa0;\n1.6              Where an eligible prisoner registers via a declaration of local connection, or by using the prison address, the registration will remain in effect for twelve months maximum from the date of registration. At the end of this period the person must make a further application for registration, otherwise their name will be deleted from the register. \n&#xa0;Registration by convicted unsentenced prisoners&#xa0;\n1.7              \nConvicted \nunsentenced\n prisoners are disqualified both from registering via a declaration of local connection, and from registering using the address of the place of detention. Neither option is appropriate for this class of prisoners, since they are either about to be sentenced, thereby losing their voting eligibility, or released and therefore able to register at their home address. \n&#xa0;\nMandatory action for Governors on voting by prisoners&#xa0;\n1.8              \nGovernors must ensure that signs, to be obtained from HMP \nColdingley\n, are displayed to advise eligible prisoners of their right to vote. They must have copies of Annex A on registering to vote available, to hand to prisoners who express an interest.\n&#xa0;\nCHAPTER 2 - EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO VOTE&#xa0;Absent voting by post or proxy&#xa0;\n2.1&#xa0;2.1.1\n              \nAn eligible prisoner will be unable to attend a polling station to vote in person, and must therefore, once registered, apply to be an absent voter in order to vote either by post or by an appointed proxy. If an application for a postal vote is then accepted, postal ballot papers will be sent, in the event of a poll, to the address specified in the application. If an application for a proxy vote is accepted, a proxy voter’s poll card will be sent to the appointed proxy.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.2\n              \nThe deadline for postal or proxy votes \n              \nAn application for absent voting by an eligible prisoner will be made only in respect of a particular election. Such applications should be made as soon as possible after the announcement of an election, to allow time for postal ballot papers to be sent out. In parliamentary and local government elections, applications must be received by Electoral Registration Officers by \n5pm, on the \nsixth working day before the date on which the election will be held.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.3\n              \nThe absent voting application form \n              \nForms for absent voting are available from Electoral Registration Officers. Alternatively, eligible prisoners can write to Electoral Registration Officers, using the letter format to be found at Annex B.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.4\n              \nPrisoners already registered for absent voting \n              \nIf prisoners have been registered for a postal vote prior to their detention, they can change the address to which the postal ballot papers are sent to that of the place of detention, using a form available from Electoral Registration Officers, or by writing a brief letter. These applications must be received by Electoral Registration Officers by \n5pm, on the \neleventh working day before the date on which the election will be held.\n&#xa0;\n2.1.5\n              \nMandatory action for Governors on absent voting by prisoners \n              \nG\novernors must have copies of Annex B on absent voting available, to hand to prisoners who express an interest.\n&#xa0;\nCompleting a postal ballot&#xa0;\n2.2&#xa0;2.2.1\n              \nAction when the postal ballot is received at the prison \n              \nShortly before polling day, an envelope containing ballot papers, and marked in such a way as to be recognisable as a postal ballot, will be sent to each prisoner whose application to vote by post has been accepted. The envelope must be handed unopened to the prisoner to whom it is addressed. If a ballot paper is received for a prisoner who had in the meantime been discharged, it must be forwarded, unopened, to the address given on discharge.\n&#xa0;\nThe envelope contains:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2.2\n              \nAction to complete a valid vote\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.2.3\n              \nThe principle of the secret ballot \n              \nThe principle of the secret ballot does not, in practice, conflict with the requirement to open prisoners’ correspondence: the discretion to open and examine the contents of the incoming envelope containing the ballot paper can be exercised before the secret ballot is completed by the prisoners. The outgoing envelope is addressed to the returning officer, so is unlikely to contain anything apart from the completed ballot. \n&#xa0;\nAvailability of political literature&#xa0;\n2.3              An eligible prisoner who has made an apparently genuine application for a postal or proxy \nvote,\n should be allowed to have election literature and may, on application to the governor, write to candidates’ agents in the relevant constituency, requesting such literature.\n&#xa0;\nNorthern Ireland&#xa0;2.4              Potential voters in Northern Ireland must fulfil an additional requirement of having been resident in Northern Ireland during the whole of the three months up to the date of an application to register. Eligible prisoners held in England and Wales, even if they have lived previously in Northern Ireland, are therefore unlikely to be able to register in Northern Irish constituencies but can apply to vote in a British constituency instead.\n&#xa0;ANNEX A&#xa0;FORMAT FOR APPLICATIONS FOR ELECTORAL REGISTRATION&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nIf registering their \nhome address, in addition to the information in paragraph 1 above, the applicant should also provide: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nIf making a \ndeclaration of local connection, in addition to the information in paragraph 1 above, the applicant should also provide:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nAn eligible prisoner who wishes to register the \nprison address, in addition to the information in paragraph 1, should also provide: \n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nFor further information on registering to vote, contact an Electoral Registration Officer. The rules on registration are in the Representation of the People Act 2000 and Regulations. \n&#xa0;ANNEX B&#xa0;\nFORMAT FOR APPLICATIONS FOR ABSENT VOTING&#xa0;1.\n              \nThe eligible prisoner should write to the Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) who accepted their application to register to vote (see Annex A). The absent voting application should be sent as soon as possible after the date of an election has been announced and must be received by EROs no later than \n5pm on the \nsixth working day before the day of the election.\n&#xa0;\n2.\n              \nAll applicants for absent voting should include the following in their letter:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n3.\n              \nIf voting by \npost, in addition to the information in paragraph 2 above, the applicant should also provide:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n4.\n              \nIf voting by \nproxy, in addition to the information in paragraph 2 above, the applicant should also provide:\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n5.\n              \nFor further information on absent voting, contact an Electoral Registration Officer.
