"EIS 21\nWritten evidence submitted by David HighleyExecutive Summary:Adequate supplies of miner\nals are essential for economic \ndevelopment. \nFor its small size Britain is \nrelatively\n well endowed with mineral resources and their e\nxtraction and use have played an important part in the historic development of the UK economy. The UK continues to have an economically \nsignificant\n minerals industry, with oil and gas, and construction and in\ndustrial minerals being important sectors. Although much diminished, coal still makes an important contribution to our energy mix. The contribution that these minerals make \nto\n the national economy \nmay\n be considered \nin two\n ways. First there is the primary c\nontribution they make in terms of added value and employment associated with \ntheir\n extraction and processing; and then there is the secondary \ncontribution they\n make to the competitiveness of the\n downstream\n industries they support. Nevertheless, the UK \nalso \nhas \nsubstantial\n and increasing \nforeign\n dependence for minera\nl supplies. This not only places\n \nincreasing \ndemands\n on the environments of ou\nr trading partners\n but potentially makes us more vulnerable to supply disruptions \nas global demand for minerals gr\nowths driven by expanding populations and rising incomes. There will be a continuing demand for the products of the UK’s extractive industries for the foreseeable future.\n \nThis submission principally responds to the following question in the BIS Committee\n’s \nCall for Evidence on 2\nnd\n July 2013:\nTable 1.

In addition, t\nhe value, in constant prices, of the principal mineral sectors from 1970 to 2011 is shown in\n Figure 1\n, and clearly portrays\n the\nir relative\n fortunes\n.\nTable 1.

The \nvalue of coal production \nhas declined in line with \nsteadily \nfalling output since the mid-1980\ns\n. \n \nThe \nrapidly \nrising value of oil production up to 1984 was reversed by t\nhe slump in world \noil \nprices at the end of 1985, and\n again in 1988, and also the loss of production through the Piper Alpha tragedy\n.\n Following rising oil prices since 2000, however, the value of UK oil productions has risen and was still £25.5 billion in 2011\n.\n Despite falling oil and gas production since 2000, the value of both have held up well because of high prices.  Ultimately, however, as reserves are depleted their value will decline.\n11.\n    \nThe value of construction and industrial minerals has also falle\nn, reflecting the decline in the production of \nsome \nindustrial minerals such as kaolin, b\nut mainly because of the recently\n significantly depressed state of the UK construction industry and its impact on aggregates production in particular. Although too sma\nll to show on Figure 1, the decline in the value of metalliferous minerals production is principally because of the demise of tin mining in Cornwall in the 1990s. \n1\n2\n.\n              \nT\nhe value to the UK economy of minerals produced from indigenous sources is, however, de\nrived not only from the minerals themselves but also the downstream \nindustries and employment these support. Low cost construction and industrial minerals, in particular, serve as essential raw materials for the construction, cement, \nasphalt, \nconcrete prod\nucts, \ninorganic chemicals, glass, ceramics, lime,\n plaster products, \nand castings\n industries were the value added may be several fold.   The economic benefits derived from the domestic extractive industries goes much further than the values indicated sugges\nt\n.\nFigure 1.

This report, together with a wealth of other information on the UK minerals industry, can be found on the British Geological Survey’s dedicated minerals website – \nwww.mineralsUK.com\n .  In particular I would refer\n you to the series of \nMineral Planning Factsheets\n, which provide succinct overviews of \neach of the \neconomically important minerals extracted onshore in Britain, and also to the \nUnited Kingdom Minerals Yearbook\n referred to above. \n14.\n              \nConclusions. Adequate \nsupplies of minerals are ess\nential for economic development. Whilst there has been a decoupling of economic growth with minerals consumption \nin recent years \nthis may indicate that the economy is under investing\n \nin infrastructure and housing and also forego\ning the value  added  by working and processing domestic (and imported) minerals in favour of importing higher value manufactured products containing embedded minerals. Moves to try and rebalance the economy and increased investment in \nhousing and \ninfrastr\nucture as economic growth improves and \nthe population expands could reverse the declining trend in minerals consumption. \nBritain’s resource security and its longer term access to mineral supplies, both from domestic and overseas sources, will remain a key \nissue for the national economy for many years to come.\n There will be a continuing demand for the products of the UK’s extractive industries for the foreseeable future and we should\n make the best use of\n our domestic mineral resources (and waste streams), where economically and environmentally feasible to do so.\n&#xa0;\n The Mineral\n Products Association estimate\ns\n that the annual turnover of th\neir industry is about £9 billion and supports over £400 billion turnover in the industries they supply. \nThe mineral products industry’s contri\nbu\ntion to the UK. \nMineral\n Products Association, 2012.\n The economic importance of minerals to the UK.
