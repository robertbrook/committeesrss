"&#xa0;\nWritten evidence submitted by Russell Pillar [OLS0075]&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\n&#xa0;\nI write in relation to your enquiry \ninto\n On-line Safety.\n&#xa0;\nThis is an issue that has always concerned me and I would like to strongly urge the committee to make a definitive stand \nfor\n the need to implement \ngreater \non-line safety \nas a matter of urgency. \n&#xa0;\nIt\n is clear that this is a subject that government has been casual about in the past and as a result we now live in a society of young people whose minds are evidently polluted by the despicable material they are able to access on-line.  \n&#xa0;\nIt \nis distressing \nthe number of\n times we read in the news\npapers of young persons who have committed suicide after discovering something on\n-\nline they didn’t know about before, or when they have been bullied on social media.  Many times, violent activity is attributed to some\nthing a young person has been able to access on the internet.\n&#xa0;\nIt is before they reach adulthood that a child’s mind is at its most fertile and very easily influenced, therefore perhaps giving us a clue as to why we live in\n a\n world where the next generation is becoming more and more extremist in its views due to the vast amount of literature they can access on-line.\n&#xa0;\nI believe this is a trend \nthat we can change \nif measures\n are implemented quickly to prevent a\nccess of adult mat\nerial by children under 16 years of age and I would encourage members of the Committee to be bold in their stand \nand grasp\n this opportunity to make the world a better and safer place to live in\n.\n&#xa0;\nSeptember 2013\n&#xa0;\n"
