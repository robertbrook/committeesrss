[[[How does Scotland compare to other countries in terms of the pattern of land ownership?]]]Scotland has an extremely concentrated pattern of land ownership.&#xa0;

[[[What are the benefits and disadvantages of the current pattern of land ownership, and to what extent is this pattern sustained and reinforced by subsidy and taxation arrangements?]]]I can think of no national benefits arising from the current pattern of land ownership.The disadvantages include the occupation of land being restricted and controlled by few. This in turn limits opportunity to occupy land and consequently inflates value of land.&#xa0;While token measures are proposed, subsidy is not restricted to the individual occupying land, residing on the land or the area or number of holdings in occupation. This again reduces opportunity and inflates land values.&#xa0;The ability to sell land for development and reinvest into further, often considerably greater in area land holding, without payment of asset taxation on the inflated price gained on the development land, again inflates land values.

[[[Is the current system of land tenure in Scotland the most efficient model for food security?]]]Far from being an efficient model for food security, the current system of land tenure is a threat to food security. Food production, in both decision making and physical production terms, confined within fewer and fewer minds and hands, is a serious threat to food production.&#xa0;It is the land which produces the food, the more people engaged in producing it, the more likely we are to sustain production. The topography and climate of Scotland do not lend themselves favourably to ranching of our uplands and prairie farming of our lowlands. Care of our land, and food production from it, thrive on intimate knowledge of those farming it. The cooperation among many rather that monopolisation by a few will secure food production.

[[[&#xa0;]]]

[[[In particular, is the current land ownership pattern contributing to, or inhibiting, economic and community development? Is it socially just?]]]In many localities, the current land ownership pattern seriously inhibits economic and community development. It is reasonable and fair that all individuals have control over development within their own reasonable private domain, however it is unjust that the will of the individual rather than of the collective community should prevail over matters beyond which influence economic and community development.&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Given mounting political interest in, or commitment to, a programme of land reform in Scotland, what form should this programme take?]]]A strategy toward the radical curtailment of the freedoms and privileges of landed estate owners.&#xa0;

[[[What sort of subsidies and grants are available to landed estate owners in Scotland? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the subsidy regime? In particular, are support payments being capitalized into land values and making these higher than they otherwise would be?]]]Conservation grants, Scottish Rural Development Programme grants, farming single farm payments, housing improvement grants and renewable energy grants are all available to landed estate owners.The availability of these grants and subsidies is capitalized into increased land values and encourages further influence on local development by such landowners.&#xa0;At this time when the most vulnerable in society have housing benefits restricted when they have as much as one spare room in their house, it is both extraordinary and scandalous that support is provided to land-holders according to the area of land they occupy, irrespective of the number of holdings this land covers. With farming opportunities at a premium, subsidies should only be payable on that holding on which an applicant lives and works. Such a mechanism would bring justice to society, immediately create farming opportunities, safeguard rural communities and secure food production.&#xa0;

[[[How does the tax regime affect the way in which land is owned in Scotland? For instance, does it offer landed estate owners the opportunity to minimize the tax they pay, thereby increasing the value of land, adding to speculative interest (on the part of those looking for ways to minimize or avoid tax) and making it less likely that it will be made available to others?]]]I suspect our tax regime greatly benefits those who wish to avoid tax. The use of charity and trust mechanisms suggest such tax avoidance is commonplace, and, individually, on a grand scale.&#xa0;

[[[How easy is it for communities in Scotland to take ownership of land and other assets? Should it be made easier in the light of the substantial achievements of existing community ownership groups?]]]Currently, not easy enough I suspect. Apart from legalities, the fear of a new order implying the upsetting of the local landowner and the fear of local empowerment as never experienced, are time-consuming hurdles in establishing unified community will toward community ownership.&#xa0;

[[[How easy is it for tenant farmers in Scotland to buy their farms? Should they be granted an absolute right to buy? Would such a right be compatible with human rights conventions and declarations?]]]Currently, without a willing seller it is not easy for a tenant farmer in Scotland to but their farm. Whether they should be granted an absolute right raises a chicken and egg situation. The landlord/tenant system exists because a landed estate owner already owns the farm. As I firmly believe we should be rid of such estates, would granting the absolute right to buy (ARTB) be a deliberate part of that process or would granting ARTB be justified in its own right? I think it is both a necessary part of the breakup of these estates and a necessary step toward the fulfilment of the potential of the tenanted farm.&#xa0;Owner occupation of a farm is clearly in the best interests of the efficiency of the farm, the farming family concerned and the community of which they are part.&#xa0;Without doubt, it is more efficient in the running of the farm where all investment decisions are made by the occupier of the farm. As a tenant this is not always possible as landlord permission is often necessary. This is not always forthcoming and yet the tenant may wish to proceed. Investment of borrowed money is often required, however without owning the land on which the investment will be made, or without the owner’s approval for the development, funding may not be available. This is clearly evidenced by the disproportionate sums of SRDP funding allocated to tenanted farms as opposed to owner occupied farms.&#xa0;Particular concerns are commonplace among tenants throughout Scotland. Perhaps the most alarming is the prevalence of poor housing with many farmhouses existing beyond tolerable wind and watertight standard. Often landlord willingness to improve, or cooperate in improving property is not forthcoming. Financing such commitment as a tenant is again often unattainable.&#xa0;Poor and inadequate steadings, poor fencing, roads and very often water supplies are also common factors in calls for ARTB. Perhaps the greatest justification in the need for ARTB is that in many cases the tenant’s family has devoted several generations of blood sweat and tears into the fabric of their farm, scratching a living and surviving despite the thankless hardship endured against discouragement and unwelcome feeling from a reluctant landlord. Foot-dragging by landlords and inevitable legal expense over succession issues, again generates further discomfort and uncertainty, often at emotionally charged times.&#xa0;None of these circumstances should ever have persisted and it is to the credit of those families who have survived and maintained rent payments into the twenty first century that granting the ARTB to such tenants would be fitting acknowledgement of their farming worth on what has amounted to only half an opportunity. As, invariably, they are already more familiar with their farm than whoever who owns it today, it is surely in the public interest that such tenants be given opportunity to fully develop their farm as they would like and know best. &#xa0;When the issue of human rights comes to mind, I cannot help thinking that if granting the right to sell off maintained public housing stock to sitting tenants of often relatively short tenancy met human rights standards, then ARTB to tenants of several generations standing, despite lack of landowner maintenance, must surely meet such standards. There is a distinct public interest in having much needed renovation and further development of such farms, only likely by conversion of sitting tenants into owner-occupation status.&#xa0;

[[[Is there a case for establishing a Land Agency to facilitate both the expansion of community ownership and the creation of new, especially “starter”, tenancies on land acquired for this purpose?]]]Immediately post WW2 I am told there was an agency known to farmers as The Executive. With a national drive at that time to improve food production, this body had the power to assess tenanted farm holdings to establish if their maintenance was adequate. In cases which failed to meet required standard, they were compulsorily sold to the sitting tenant. Many farm steadings and lands around them have lain derelict and under-used for many years, yet still have public support allocated to them. An agency established to identify and promote such property and land as appropriate for community ownership or starter tenancies would be a useful mechanism to meet a distinct demand. &#xa0;

[[[How easy is it for land in public ownership to be transferred to communities and other private individuals, where that would be in the public interest? Should steps be taken to make it easier? For instance, should the UK and Scottish Governments compile a register showing land and assets for disposal? Should there be changes in the way in which such land and assets are valued? What UK Treasury rules are relevant to this area?]]]No comment.&#xa0;

[[[Should a Land Value Tax of some sort be introduced in Scotland, as a replacement or addition to council tax and business rates?]]]Such a tax is an absolute must. Land is our greatest finite asset and its value impacts on us all in all aspects of housing, food and well-being. In all realms of taxation there is a tolerable allowance. Beyond this allowance of land in area or value or both, those who wish to occupy and use it must pay tax appropriately in lieu of the financial burden the value of that land imposes on others.&#xa0;October 2013
