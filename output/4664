defaultQ98 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultThe Chairman:default My Lords and guests, we are two minutes in advance. It is the very 
defaultfirst time it has ever happened, 
defaultso I am feeling very smug
default. D
defaultoubtless I am going to have a big fall in a minute. You were not here for the last session, I do not think. Were you here the whole time?
defaultDr Kyledefault: Not the whole time, no.
defaultThe Chairman:default I just make the general housekeeping points. First of all, welcome to you and thank you for giving up the time to come before us and give us the benefit of your knowledge. The session will last approximately 50 to 60 minutes and I have to outline the following
default. m
defaultembers of the Committee with relevant interests will declare these now. 
defaultThere are n
defaultone. The session is on the record and is being webcast live and will be subsequently accessible by the 
defaultp
defaultarliamentary website. The witnesses will receive a transcript of the session to check and correct. This will be put on the public record in printed form and on the 
defaultparliamentary
default website. I have asked, for the record, if you could begin by stating
default,
default each one of you in turn
default,
default your names and official titles.
defaultDr Kyledefault: I am Peter Kyle. I am 
defaultc
defaulthief 
defaulte
defaultxecutive of WORKing for YOUth.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: Adam Swash. I 
defaultam head of strategy and research 
defaultat Experian
default,
default but I founded and ran WORKing for YOUth, which is the reason I was called here.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Mike Thompson. I am head of 
defaultearly careers 
defaultfor Barclays.
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much for coming. I am sure it will be quite different evidence from the evidence we have just had from the previous witnesses. I would like to invite you to make an opening statement. Dr Kyle.
defaultDr Kyledefault: Thank you. I will say 
defaulttalk 
defaultabout the purpose of WORKing for YOUth. I have been 
defaultchief executive 
defaultof WORKing for YOUth for less than two months. I am new in post
default,
default but WORKing for YOUth was created two years ago, driven by Sir John Peace, who is 
defaultc
defaulthairman of Standard Chartered
default,
default Experian, and the Burberry Group. It was created to be a force within the private sector to create opportunities for young people under the age of 24 who lacked qualifications. They want to create, and WORKing for YOUth seeks to create, a movement within the private sector that will create employment opportunities for young people with no qualifications. It has extremely ambitious targets creating 200,000 new posts within the private sector for young people and to create ultimately a fund of £100 million to try to tackle this issue.
default 
defaultEven though the project, which is now a registered charity, has been running for almost two years, I have been brought on board to give focus to the work because we now have 56 corporate partners within the FTSE 100 and beyond, right down to the small and medium
default-sized
default enterprise market. Barclays is one of the key members of the programme as well. Now we are entering the stage where we are giving it real drive and focus, and we are going to seek to embed ourselves even further in the private sector and escalate the delivery function of what we are here to do. We are not here to duplicate the work that is being done out there by different delivery partners and different partners within the private sector and the voluntary sector and statutory sectors. What we see ourselves to do is to foster collaboration to harness and spread the best practice throughout the private sector, and make sure all of the partners and people in the private sector, who are tackling this issue, can create that to add up to more than the sum of its parts, so that we can show that there is a movement within the private sector, which is gaining traction and making a real impact here.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: I think Peter has covered a lot of what I am here to do. I sit within Experian, which is one of Sir John’s organisations. I spend most of my life building strategies and policies for public sector and private sector organisations. I think Sir John was absolutely astounded when some of the figures around youth unemployment came in and wanted to know what business could do about it. 
defaultM
defaulty team 
defaultand I 
defaultlooked into a lot of the issues and helped him build the germ of an idea, which turned into WORKing for YOUth. I have been responsible for building a lot of that and bringing the partnerships together now 
defaultto 
defaulthand over to Peter to run successfully. 
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Hopefully what I will bring to the session today is some practical experience of working with young people. I have been in my current role at Barclays for the last 18 months, and that has predominantly been working with recruiting and training young people who are not in education
default,
default training or employment. We have learnt a lot over the past 18 months about some of the issues young people face
default,
default and hopefully I can bring some insight to the Committee regarding some of the challenges 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have come across as an employer.
defaultQ99 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Thank you very much. I want to advise the witnesses that some questions will be more relevant than others. Each witness is not expected to provide an answer for every question, if you do not want to. That is not to try to keep the session short
default,
default but I do w
defaultant to keep it trundling along.
defaultCould you describe for us your involvement with young people as employees or trainees and how recruitment for this group has changed during the course of the economic downturn in about five years? Was WORKing for YOUth set up two years ago?
defaultAdam Swashdefault: Two years ago.
defaultThe Chairman:default This was on the back of Occupy, was it, or was it coincidental with Occupy?
defaultAdam Swashdefault: It was coincidental with Occupy. I think it was after the disturbances we had seen the previous year.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, Croydon and Tottenham.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: Sir John is Lord Lieutenant in 
defaultNottingham
default where there was particular trouble.
defaultThe Chairman:default What is your involvement with young people as employees or trainees? Do you get involved with young people themselves
default,
default or do you sit there and say this is what should happen?
defaultDr Kyledefault: We do not spend that much time sitting
default,
default but my role is to co-ordinate, facilitate and spread best practice and try to inspire other employers to take the route that Barclays has, which is a phenomenal case study in this area. I should say that my role therefore is slightly a helicopter view of what is happening with youth unemployment. Previously my role here 
defaultw
defaultas 
defaultdeputy chief executive 
defaultof ACEVO, the umbrella body for the voluntary sector, and in that time in 2011 we reported 
defaultin 
defaultthe Youth Unemployment Commission, which I helped establish
default and 
defaultwhich David Miliband chaired
default. We 
defaultran the 
defaultc
defaultommission on youth unemployment for six to eight months, looking into the policy area
default,
default the policy underpinnings of the provider market and the social problems associated with youth unemployment, and that is what led me to here. My background is mostly in the policy areas and the policy implications and representing the providers. The voluntary sector is now obviously within the private sector
default, so I should hand over to Mike, 
defaultwho can give you the front
default-
defaultline view on this.
defaultThe Chairman:default I was going to ask him
default. A
default case study. What a build up.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: You can look at it from two aspects. I think 
defaultthat 
defaultpart of the question is 
defaultabout 
defaultwhat has happened in the labour market and what has been the trend over the last decade, probably not just the last five years, 
defaultand it 
defaultis this increasing focus on the graduate market as a source of talent for businesses as more and more young people are going down the graduate and higher education pathway. I think 
defaultthat 
defaultwe as a business, like many other businesses, have followed that trend
default,
default and increasingly we are starting to see even entry level jobs being filled by graduates who are in our contact centres and our branches,
default and
default our cashiering jobs are being filled by people with degrees. We took a step back about 18 months ago and looked at what implications that was having for our business. One was quite a high level of dissatisfaction among the young people because they were getting great qualifications and were filling roles that perhaps were not what they had aspired to and were not seeing the progression that they had hoped for. 
defaultEqually for us we were seeing 
defaulta 
defaultvery high turnover of young people because they were coming in, they were not progressing 
defaultin 
defaultthe way they had hoped to progress, and therefore they were leaving, and that was a revolving door for us and therefore quite a high cost to the business of training, which was leading to no progression or development.
default 
defaultSo we took a step back and looked at the other implications of hiring purely from a graduate market, which was 
defaultthat 
defaultwe were not hiring anyone between the age of 16 or 18. In fact
default,
default we have very few people under the age of 21 in our workforce
default. A
default bank that wants to develop innovative digital products and find new ways of planking and providing services
default,
default both in the 
defaultUK
default and globally
default,
default need
defaults
default to have young 
defaultpeople of 
defaulttalent coming into 
defaulttheir 
defaultbusiness who are digital natives
default 
defaultfamiliar with digital technology.
default 
defaultSo we took a step back and looked at our own policy—purely looking at the graduate market—and realised that was not taking us any further forward. 
defaultAt the same time we were having conversations with WORKing for YOUth, and our 
defaultchief executive was looking at some of youth employment 
defaultissues, 
defaultand a num
defaultber of factors came together
default. We said
default, 
default“Look, one, we need to tackle an issue we have 
defaultabout 
defaultthe type of talent we are bringing into the business, but we 
defaultalso 
defaultneed to do something more substantial about youth unemployment”
default,
default and that is where my role came into existence, which is essentially when we set up our own apprenticeship programme targeting young people who had been out of employment for over six months or who have limited or no qualifications.
default 
defaultWhat we saw was 
defaultthat 
defaulthistorically the success of banking has been built on people coming in at 16 and working their way up to the top.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultTo 66
default.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Yes, and working their way through and having great careers
default. A
default lot of our senior leaders in our business now started that way. When we took a step back a couple of years ago we worked out that 
defaultthat 
defaultpathway was not there any
default 
defaultmore. You could not come in at 16 and work your way up. You had to have a degree
default,
default and therefore we were closing the door to a huge number of young people. So we took a very different standpoint and opened our doors through the apprenticeship model to young people who were struggling to get into employment with qualifications or who had very limited qualifications or no qualifications. 
defaultT
defaulthe breadth of talent 
defaultthat 
defaultwe have now brought in versus perhaps quite a narrow segment of the youth market when we looked at just graduates
default has been a real revelation for our business
default.
default 
defaultThe programme has been running for 18 months now and we are starting to see those young people already progressing very rapidly into more senior roles and bringing the ideas
default,
default enthusiasm and talent that perhaps we were not seeing previously.
defaultThe Chairman:default How many apprentices do you take on each year?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Last year we took on 1,000 young people.
defaultQ100 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Does anybody have any idea of how many 
defaultapprentices are taken on by all 
defaultcompanies in the 
defaultUK
default every year, because I did not realise it was anything like as big as our last series of witnesses suggested? For example, McDonald
default’
defaults takes on 1,000 a year. Does anybody know?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I think there are roughly 500,000 apprenticeships in the 
defaultUK
default. Having said that, how many of those are new jobs and new employees
default? They are 
defaultprobably
default a much smaller number, 
defaultbecause a lot of those are existing staff who are moving upwards.
defaultThe Chairman:default Would you say that we are beginning to go the German way and believe that apprenticeships 
defaultare 
defaultone way?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Yes. Over the last two years we have seen a huge uplift among many employees for that vocational pathway versus the traditional higher education recruitment drive.
defaultThe Chairman:default Apprenticeships used to be very popular 50 years ago and then something happened
default. W
defaulthat happened?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I would say that more recently higher education happened.
defaultThe Chairman:default Going for the 50%?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: If you look 
defaultat 
default15 years ago
default,
default 25% of young people went to higher education
default. I
defaultt is now 60%.
defaultThe Chairman:default Now we are aiming for 50%.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I think it is already higher, so that means 
defaultthat 
defaultthe population that you are drawin
defaultg upon is typically a graduate.
defaultDr Kyledefault: It might be worth stress
defaulting
default that 
defaultthe extraordinary thing about 
defaultthe 1,000 apprentices you are taking on at Barclays is 
defaultthat 
defaulta high degree of them have no qualifications at all.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is the best thing.
defaultDr Kyledefault: Yes. So these are getting to young people who—
defaultThe Chairman:default That is good.
defaultDr Kyledefault: Exactly.
defaultQ101 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default You have probably partly answered this
default,
default but to what extent do you see 
defaultthe 
defaultproblems with young people finding and keeping jobs being to do with the lack of suitable opportunities for them in the labour market, and to what extent is this due to their own skills or employability?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I think it is probably both. If you look at the opportunities for young people to gain work experience
default,
default it is much harder than it was a decade ago. If you look at the research that is being done, 10 years ago over 50% of young people were doing some form of Saturday job or some sort of work experience. I think that is now about 25%
default,
default simply because a lot of employers are not offering those sorts of opportunities any longer, so for somebody building up their employability skills it is much harder these days to find ways of doing that. 
defaultThere is a
defaultlso the shape of the labour market
default. 
defaultI think the previous panel members touched upon 
defaultthe fact that 
defaultour economy is 
defaultdriven 
defaultmuch more by small business
default growth than it is by corporate, 
defaultso the number of opportunities in corporate is probably shrinking as technology and other factors come into the labour market. We are seeing a rapid growth in the SME market. The SMEs market
default,
default I think
default,
default find
defaults
default it very difficult to connect with this group of young people
default; t
defaulthe mechanisms simply are not there. So for us it is relatively easy as big organisations to go out
default, find, 
defaultattract and train, because we have the resources to do that. For a small business it is very difficult to go and find the right young talent, so they do not tend to. They tend to go to people who already have experience or who are recommended by friends and family.
defaultI think 
defaultthe problem 
defaultis a little bit on both sides. The young people struggle to get employability skills because they cannot get work experience
default,
default and the smaller employers struggle to connect with the youth labour market.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default If you are taking people in at 16 with no qualifications, there must be some sort of pre-employability training. 
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Yes.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default Could you give one of the youngsters coming in typically a task to do, which you would be confident they would finish if you gave them an instruction?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Yes.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default When they arrive?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I 
defaultwill 
defaultdescribe how the programme works. We effectively work with a partner organisation to identify the young people and then assess where their skills are
default. S
defaultome we found are already ready and do not need any pre-employment training
default,
default and they go straight for interview because our view is 
defaultthat 
defaultyou want to get somebody into work as quickly as possible. That is what the young person wants
default and 
defaultwhat the employer wants
default,
default and you want somebody to come off whatever benefit system they might be on and into paid employment.
default 
defaultFor those 
defaultwho 
defaultare not ready
default,
default we run a four-week employability programme
default that 
defaultcovers basic skills around workplace presentation, communication, team working
default—
defaultall kind of basic ingredients for an employee to be able to make a transition into a workplace. Also, come January next year, we are adding a two-week work experience placement, which will give them some real live work experience before they then go for an interview with one of our managers.
defaultOur goal is to try to give them the best opportunity possible, recognising that coming out of the education system
default,
default or in our case coming out of that population of people who ar
defaulte not in employment, education or
default training, they are going to need some extra support to get them ready for that job interview. We try to set them up for success and generally that is the case.
defaultQ102 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultBaroness Hooper:default It is often said that one of the problems is that young people are now coming on the job market unable to read and do simple arithmetic. Given that some young people do not have any qualifications
default,
default do you also find many examples of complete failure of the education system?
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThe Division Bell is ringing, and 
defaultI think, Lady Hooper, 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are going to have to stop here. We will be 10 minutes, maximum. I am sorry about this. I should have warned you
default,
default but I did not think we were going to have it.
default&#xa0;
defaultSitting suspended for a Division in the House
default&#xa0;
defaultThe Chairman:default Are we quorate
default,
default because I am told there is going to be another Division in short order
default on 
defaultthe next amendment, so we have to try to get through this now.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default I had just asked my question about the reading and writing, the basic skills.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultWe
default could not hear you up here because of the horrible bell.
defaultBaroness Hooper:default I am very sorry you could not hear
default,
default but the gist of my question was simply whether in the absence of qualifications this also meant that many 
defaultwere coming 
defaultforward who did not have the basic reading, writing and arithmetic that we hear so much about. 
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I would say 
defaultthat 
defaultabout 50% of young people 
defaultwho 
defaultwe see do not have an English or Maths A to C qualification. That said, we take the view that part of the reason why we take funding through an apprenticeship model is to help support those young people 
defaultto attain
default that education through a vocational pathway. So during the 12 months of our apprenticeship programme
default,
default 
defaultwe work with the 
defaultpeople who do not have A to C in Maths and English to get them to where they need to be. 
defaultI think it is fair to say 
defaultthat 
defaultin the early days of the programme we do have some young people who struggle with the numeracy required to work in a bank, but we believe that with the right education through the apprenticeship route we can get them to where they need to be. The vast majority end up with an equivalent Maths and English qualification by the end of the 12 months.
defaultThe Chairman:default Dr Kyle, you wanted to add to that.
defaultDr Kyledefault: It is worth just saying 
defaultfirst 
defaultthat the Government have just released an updated apprenticeship policy document in which they say 
defaultthat 
defaultthey intend to require anyone graduating with an apprentice to qualify with Maths and English by the end of it, so if you do not have the qualifications at the beginning, when you finish an apprenticeship 
defaultyou 
defaulthave to have qualified with Maths and English. But it is worth saying that employers tell us in no uncertain terms that it is the soft skills
default—the communicative skills, the social skills—
defaultthat they find most lacking by the time people leave school and come to them. 
defaultB
defaulteing able to operate 
defaulton a social level within a work
defaultplace 
defaultis one of 
defaultthe skills that they feel people are not prepared for to a large degree.
default 
defaultT
defaulthere is usually a basis 
defaultof academic skills 
defaultto work upon
default,
default and then it is fairly straightforward
default 
defaultto do quite straightforward training
default,
default but the lack of social skills and soft skills 
defaultthat should be learnt in 
defaulteducation is a real problem. Some people do not know how to answer the phone when they come into a work place
default. It 
defaultis not just restricted to people from deprived backgrounds. That is remarkably common and is spoken about with great passion by employers.
defaultThe Chairman:default The real problem is 
defaultthat 
defaultthey do not communicate any longer because they communicate only with a screen playing games and things like this. It is a shame 
defaultthat 
defaultpeople do not have any social skills 
defaultor 
defaultsay, “Good morning”
default,
default or they do not look you in the eye because they are used to looking at screens.
defaultDr Kyledefault: There are different norms of communication within a workplace
default,
default and for any young person 
defaultwho 
defaulth
defaultas not had experience of a work
defaultplace it is normal to have a period of adjustment, but 
defaultsome 
defaulthave no grounding wh
defaultat
defaultever
default,
default and the fact 
defaultis that 
defaultin different institutions and different places there are different social norms that you have to be familiar with. It is a difficult transition for young people to make
default,
default but there is very little preparation for it.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: One of 
defaultmy 
defaultconcerns is 
defaultthat 
defaultthere is a very poor perception of young people and their skills at the moment
default. W
defaulthile I agree that there are issues regarding their readiness for work, our experience has been that it does not take an awful lot to get them ready. I think there is a big stigma hanging over young people at the moment regarding their readiness.
defaultThe Chairman:default Mr Swash, you wanted to come in.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: I was going to answer the question 
defaultabout 
defaultthe suitable opportunities
default. O
defaultne of the things here is that there are quite a number of opportunities that young people could go to and 
defaultthat 
defaultwould be suitable employment for them. One of the things that we are seeing with perhaps the change in the labour market towards smaller companies is that companies are less willing to take a risk
default,
default and if they have the choice of a young person with no experience versus someone who has one or two years’ experience they are automatically defaulting to the person with the experience. I think they have two main worries here. One is that they have been told by the media that all young people are terrible louts and will run their business into the ground. The other is that they just do not believe they have the time to make them work. I think it is less about money
default and 
defaultmore about their feeling 
defaultthat they need to give 
defaultthose young people 
defaulttime to get them 
defaultinto work.
defaultDr Kyledefault: There are a multiplicity of reasons why. It would be great if we could narrow it down to one or two reasons
default,
default 
defaultsuch as it being 
defaulteither a lack of opportunities o
defaultr a lack of skills. The 
defaulttruth is 
defaultthat 
defaultit is right across the board. I think broadly, at its highest level, we as a society have a very clear vision for young people’s pathway that includes university education. We do not have a strong vision for young people who have alternative routes into successful and gainful employment and a career, and I think that is something we have to get right.
defaultThe Chairman:default This came out of the last session of witnesses
default,
default too.
defaultQ103 default&#xa0; 
defaultBaroness Valentine:default 
defaultI want 
defaultto come back on this
default,
default because I am always confused about inner 
defaultLondon
default, which is one of the target areas
default and has 
defaultover 25% in unemployed presumably, yet there are so many jobs in inner 
defaultLondon
default. 
defaultPrêt à Manger
default is the one we use
default,
default but next door to it
default, the Japanese restaurant has advertised for 
defaulta waitress and a waiter for 
defaultthe last six months. What is all that about?
defaultDr Kyledefault: Again, the evidence is that there 
defaultare
default a lot of barriers that are not being tackled. 
defaultA
default straightforward 
defaultexample
default is transport
default, and j
defaultust travelling quite a small distance for interviews, for example. When I 
defaultwas involved in 
defaultthe Commission 
defaulton
default Youth Unemployment, we interviewed a great number of young people directly
default,
default and some of these were applying for more than a dozen jobs a week
default and 
defaultgetting called for several interviews. The sheer expense of travelling for the interviews
default and 
defaultto get the work was prohibitive.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default Does that mean if you live in 
defaultSomers
default 
defaultTown
default out the back of Kings Cross, 
defaultby which 
defaultI mean presumably walking distance
default,
default there wi
defaultll be quite a lot of jobs there?
default Do those 
defaulttwo things not connect up? W
defaulthat is going on?
defaultDr Kyledefault: As I say, there are a lot of barriers
default. We found that 
defaulttransport was one of them, particularly for rural areas. It was a huge barrier for people living in small to medium-size
defaultd
default communities 
defaultwho
default would have to travel.
default 
defaultFor other young people, it is purely about having an established pathway into work
default,
default having entry level work explained and 
defaultit 
defaultbeing an understood pathway to a career. Many young people do not understand the pathway 
defaultthat 
defaultyou have to take, whether it is an apprenticeship, taking a job in 
defaultPrêt
default or one of the other entry level
default,
default more retail
default,
default jobs and seeing them into a pathway to a better job. Careers pathways are simply not understood by young people in the way they would have been in the past for very understandable reasons, because we live in a much more complex landscape.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default One follow-
defaultup 
defaultquestion 
defaultfrom that
default. 
defaultBarclays, I know you are in 
defaultCanary
default 
defaultWharf
default, but obviously you have literally on your doorstep lots of unemployed people. Has some inroad been made to those pathways?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: In our own programme we have targeted those areas
default,
default and I think one of the challenges is salary and pay. If you look at the apprenticeship minimum wage in 
defaultLondon
default it is very difficult to live, to feed yourself and become economically independent
default on it
default.
defaultBaroness Valentine:default Versus benefits?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Versus benefits, yes. When you look at some of the jobs that you refer to
default, the question is whether they are 
defaulta viable step to independence
default. That is v
defaultery unlikely. I think 
defaultthat 
defaultone of the issues is 
defaultthe 
defaultgrey economy
default, very low-
defaultpaid, transient jobs for young people
default that 
defaultare not offering the career pathways. 
defaultIn o
defaultur own programme we pay the living wage in 
defaultLondon
default, but I would imagine 
defaultthat 
defaultwe are one of the few organisations that probably does
default,
default because we have the resources to be able to do that. That is a challenge in 
defaultLondon
default in particular, and 
defaultin 
defaultinner cities, where the cost of living, 
defaultthe 
defaultcost of accommodation—
defaultThe Chairman:default Of course you cannot say 
defaultthat 
defaultin 10 years’ time you can be manager of this, that and the other
default,
default because they do not believe it. They do not think they are capable because they do not have a lot of confidence. It is very difficult.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: It is challenging
default, a
defaultlthough I would say 
defaultthat 
defaultMcDonald
default’
defaults 
defaulthas 
defaultdone a very good job. 
defaultIt has 
defaultshown 
defaultthat 
defaultyou can do it
default: that y
defaultou can move into interim jobs and progress.
defaultQ104 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default If we may return to Europe, 
defaultI am 
defaultlooking across at both companies 
defaultthat 
defaulthave experience
default that is not just in the 
defaultUK
default, 
defaultso maybe you can help us with 
defaultthis question
default. What do you believe should be the main ways in which employers across 
defaultEurope
default should be responding to the youth employment difficulties?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: 
defaultT
defaulthe theme for me is collaboration. I think 
defaultthat 
defaultcompanies need to recognise that they can do more than just their own programmes and their own employment. For instance, Barclays obviously 
defaulthas 
defaulta very large supply chain and a very large customer base, so we have been looking and working very closely with those organisations to help 
defaultthem to 
defaultunderstand how they can benefit from the programmes that are available to them. For instance, if you look at small businesses, there is a very low level of understanding of what an apprenticeship is
default and 
defaultwhat support is out there. They do not have the time to go and research it
default. C
defaultollaboration and working together, either at the corporate supply chain 
defaultor with 
defaultcustomers, is something the bigger corporates can do and is exemplified by the work that Adam and Peter have done, where they have brought together organisations to do that. 
defaultAdam Swashdefault: WORKing for YOUth has been focused 
defaultprimarily 
defaulton the 
defaultUK
default to start with. We have ambitions to go wider than that
default,
default but at the moment we are concentrating on the 
defaultUK
default. 
defaultO
defaultne of the things that strikes us is that each country has different sets of issues. Whereas in the 
defaultUK
default we have seen 
defaultthat 
defaulta reasonable number of jobs 
defaultare 
defaultbeing created and 
defaultthat 
defaultit is a case of working out how to join 
defaultup 
defaultthe jobs and the young people, there are certainly countries within 
defaultEurope
default 
defaultthat 
defaultdo not even have the luxury of those jobs in the first place
default. With 
defaulta lot of these issues
default,
default national and international schemes can be put together
default,
default but a lot of the time you almost have to trickle them down and boil them down to local issues. But there will be things like companies’ engagement with education
default and 
defaultthe public sector and joining 
defaultup 
defaultthose loops that will be practical and reasonable for all areas and countries to look at.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default Do you think employers should be doing more? I hear you talking 
defaultparticularly 
defaultabout the changed relationship now that we have fewer big companies in the way we had 30 or 40 years ago, and we have more asset means and there is a difficulty there, which perhaps no one has an easy answer to. Do you think you can assist there and 
defaultthat 
defaultmore assistance 
defaultshould be 
defaultgiven
default,
default and can 
defaultG
defaultovernment do anything more? Is it left to employers rather than 
defaultG
defaultovernment?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I think it is a collaboration between public and private sector, to be honest. Government has a lot of financial resources 
defaultavailable to it, 
defaultand obviously the education system. I do think 
defaultthat 
defaultemployers need to find a way of rebuilding 
defaultthe 
defaultvery strong 
defaultbridge that used to exist, which is much more fragile for a young person 
defaultwho 
defaultis not going into higher education. I think this is about where employers can work with the education system directly. In our case, just to 
defaultgive 
defaultyou an example, we finished a programme earlier this year called Barclays Life Skills
default,
default 
defaultthrough which 
defaultwe have made an offer to every school in the 
defaultUK
default that we will help 
defaultto 
defaultdevelop the employability skills of their pupils from the age of 14 to 17 and provide them with work experience.
defaultThe Chairman:default Did I hear correctly: every school in the 
defaultUK
default?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Yes. It is a very huge ambition that we have taken on
default.
defaultThe Chairman:default Indeed.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: We have so far signed up 3,000 schools to the programme, which shows the demand that is coming from the education sector to plug a gap in the pupils’ skills that they do not believe they can plug. I think that is an example of where we are working with schools to help the young person over that bridge
default: g
defaultive them the skills they need so 
defaultthat 
defaultwhen they leave the education system they are not going to fall into that neat trap.
defaultDr Kyledefault: I spent most of my career in the voluntary sector campaigning for different areas of change and sometimes bashing the private sector for not living up to its responsibilities, but since doing this job and speaking to many different very large organisations and small ones, I have been absolutely struck by the scale of ambition within the private sector to tackle this
default,
default and the sincerity with which people such as Mike in Barclays and beyond are tackling this. 
defaultThere is also, I think it is fair to say, some real surprise that 
defaultG
defaultovernment 
defaulthas 
defaultnot been more accepting of the scale of ambition within the private sector
default. C
defaultertainly there is some surprise that the Government 
defaulthave 
defaultnot challenged the private sector more on some of these issues, and they feel that there has been very little engagement in the past with the private sector to a large degree about tackling about this issue.
defaultGovernment has a role to facilitate and 
defaultto 
defaultdeliver training and some of the supply side challenges to youth unemployment
default,
default but you cannot create jobs sustainably into the long term without the private sector. I do see a scale of ambition
default, which we have just heard and 
defaultwhich is quite remarkable in the private sector. Sometimes I wonder whether 
defaultG
defaultovernment realises the scale of ambition and 
defaultthat 
defaultsome of these organisations are just getting on with it at the moment.
defaultThe Chairman:default 
defaultThey d
defaulto not want to be bothered with the red tape and all the other bureaucracy. Lord Liverpool, I was told you were looking for another question.
defaultEarl of defaultLiverpooldefault:default That was the previous question.
defaultQ105 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default The European Union has provided a programme called 
defaultthe y
defaultouth 
defaultg
defaultuarantee. The idea of that, as I understand it, is that young people who are devoid of work
default,
default training or studying can occupy a position within four months to enable them to enter the world of work. Do you think from the point of view of business 
defaultthat 
defaultthis is a good or bad idea?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Personally, I think it is a very good idea. We would love to see somebody guarantee a place or an opportunity from day one of leaving education
default,
default but clearly that is not practical. I think 
defaultthat 
defaulthelping somebody
default 
defaultas soon as possible
default into a meaningful pathway to work, whether that be a training course that will ready them for work
default,
default an apprenticeship or a job, has to be the ambition for young people. We cannot have people 
defaultsitting there and 
defaultlet all the talent go to waste. I think there are some barriers and challenges to achieving that. Certainly in the 
defaultUK
default,
default if you do not have Maths and English qualifications
default,
default 
defaultaccess to vocational training
default is a significant issue. I think 
defaultthat 
default40% of young people do not attain A to C Maths and English.
default T
defaulthe majority of intermediate or entry level apprenticeship that are advertised on a national apprenticeship website require Maths and English, so there is a huge group of young people 
defaultto 
defaultwhom one whole pathway of education is not available. To deliver on that promise, I think we need to address some of those underlying structural issues in the labour market, but as a principle, yes, 
defaultI am 
defaultvery supportive.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: I think it is a good idea from a business perspective
default. T
defaulthey would love to see more young people with more experience. It is a way of making sure 
defaultthat 
defaultthey are ready for work and getting them into work. One of my cautions would be that imposing mandatory things for small businesses to take on young people would be an issue.
defaultThe Chairman:default Too much cost.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: I think we have to make it almost socially unacceptable for them not to and make them want to do it rather than imposing things on small and medium businesses.
defaultThe Chairman:default Of course you do know that 
defaultit has been
default said that if every SME in the 28 
defaultM
defaultember 
defaultS
defaulttates employed one more person there would be no unemployment throughout the Union.
defaultAdam Swashdefault: Can I just come back on that one? It is something that I hear quite often. At Experian we hold a lot of data on businesses and the size of businesses and how business grow and change. 
defaultO
defaultver 50% of small businesses have no desire to grow. They employ one or two people. They are lifestyle businesses. 
defaultOnly s
defaultomewhere between 5% and 10% of small businesses grow anything like rapidly, 
defaultso 
defaulttrying to say that all small businesses should take one new person is not going to happen
default,
default and I do not think it is helpful to the debate.
defaultThe Chairman:default I am always bandying that one around because I have heard it from the Commissioner for Employment and so many times too in 
defaultBrussels
default. If you have a definitive few paragraphs on that
default,
default could you send them to me?
defaultAdam Swashdefault: Of course.
defaultThe Chairman:default I think we have to be myth busting as well as making statements, and that one is definitely gaining legs.
defaultLord Clinton-Davis:default What do you think is happening 
defaulton 
defaultthis issue 
defaultin 
defaultthe UK Government and others?
defaultDr Kyledefault: To come back to your original point about whether a mandatory job guarantee is good
default, 
defaultI would concur with the other two witnesses here 
defaultthat it 
defaultis a very good idea. What needs debating is whether it is four months, six months, a year. 
defaultW
defaulthether or not it is a good idea is moot because there is evidence that the scarring impact that 
defaulta period of being unemployed
default has on a young person, particularly a young person under 24, is acute. A young person who is out of work and on benefits for more than a year will earn £2,000 or £3,000 less for the rest of their career than somebody who is of a similar socioeconomic background. They will have, by all likelihood, mental health challenges later on to a greater extent than their peers. They will experience relationship breakdowns to an extent that others do not. The question of whether there is a book end to which no young person should go beyond is unequivocal
default i
defaultn my mind
default. There 
defaultneeds to be a cut-off point that triggers some intervention, and whatever the cost of that intervention it is value for money from an economic perspective but also from a social perspective.
defaultQ106 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default Lord Clinton-Davis was asking about the EU 
defaulty
defaultouth 
defaultg
defaultuarantee. What is your reaction to the 
defaultUK
default programme that you contract? In addition to things you all mentioned already, 
defaultdo 
defaultyou think there are new things that should be done, different things that should be done, and 
defaultdo 
defaultyou have anything more to say about the idea of apprenticeships or work experience?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I am not sufficiently well
default 
defaultversed on the youth contract. What I would say from a business perspective is 
defaultthat
default the landscape is quite confusing in terms of the number of schemes
default and 
defaultinitiatives, 
defaultwhich are 
defaultall very well
default meaning and 
defaultall with the same intentions. 
defaultI
defaultn reality
default,
default whether you are a large business or a small business
default,
default the world is a confusing place if you are trying to help a young person. 
defaultOne of the things 
defaultthat 
defaultshould be done differently is to radically simplify the offering, both to the young person and to the business. I think the current 
defaultA
defaultdministration 
defaultare 
defaultdoing a very good job with the recent introduction of traineeships, pre-employment training programmes and apprenticeships, and starting to build out some very simple, solid pathways. I would clear the decks of the different schemes and focus the effort on something that is very marketable to businesses and to young people
default,
default and more importantly to their parents
default,
default because a lot of advice for young people is given to parents. If parents do not understand the different schemes that are out there, and the benefits of them, they are not going to encourage their young people to go through them.
defaultIf I could just touch on something else 
defaultthat 
defaultI would love to see, 
defaultit 
defaultis 
defaultthat 
defaultwe should be bringing 
defaultback some sort of mandatory 
defaultwork experience to the school curriculum. 
defaultT
defaulthe
default bridge that used to exist locally where
defaultby
default young people would get work experience and then build those connections, which would then allow them to get employment two or three years later, 
defaultis 
defaultvery broken at the moment. 
defaultI
defaultf you were to reintroduce some sort of mandatory work experience at the age of 15
default or 16, 
defaultyou 
defaultwould begin to rebuild some of th
defaulte connections that have been lost.
defaultDr Kyledefault: Just briefly, I believe 
defaultthat 
defaultthe youth contract has under
defaultperformed. C
defaultertainly in the privat
defaulte sector they know it has under
defaultperformed. It was not a scheme that they felt would make a significant impact at the outset
default,
default and this was articulated back in the very beginning of the scheme in 2011
default. The 
defaultlatest evaluations 
defaultare
default 
defaultthat 
defaultonly 27% of young people 
defaultwho 
defaultgo through it
default go
default to full-time work afterwards.
default It is a scheme that has under
defaultperformed
default,
default and I believe 
defaultthat 
defaultthe problem was that it was underinvested in at the beginning. It only aimed to get 50,000 young people into work after its first year
default,
default when 250,000 young people were out of work at the time. 
defaultR
defaultecommendations 
defaultwere 
defaultfirmly put to 
defaultG
defaultovernment that 
defaultit 
defaultfrontload the scheme and find the money to upscale and make a big impact at the beginning. That would have got employers excited. It would have created a momentum that could have been carried forward into the proceeding years.
default 
defaultIt is a scheme that has not captured 
defaultthe 
defaultimagination. It certainly has not delivered
default,
default and when you are communicating with the private sector, lack of delivery is something 
defaultthat it is 
defaultacutely aware of in 
defaultits 
defaultday
default 
defaultto
default 
defaultday world
default. It 
defaultcertainly do
defaultes
default not tend to gravitate towards schemes that underdeliver from the outset.
defaultThe Chairman:default What would you do with it? Would you just grab it and start something afresh?
defaultDr Kyledefault: Personally, I would use the money for a job guarantee. But the scheme is coming to an end now. 
defaultI do not think that t
defaulthe youth contract will last into the long term. A job guarantee is what is needed at the moment
default, to
default my mind.
defaultQ107 default&#xa0; 
default 
defaultLord Wilson of Tillyorn:default May I ask a terribly 
defaultsimple
default question
default?
default Mike Thompson
default,
default when you say 
default“a 
defaultmultiplicity of schemes
default”
default, w
defaulthat would your advice 
defaultbe 
defaultto a young person just leaving school or to a young person’s parents 
defaulton 
defaultwhere to look for what sort of schemes there might be?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: There is a multiplicity of schemes. There is also 
defaulta 
defaultmultiplicity of sources of advice. In fact there 
defaultare
default probably even more sources of advice, which is terribly confusing for parents and terribly confusing for young people. Personally I would love to see some sort of UCAS clearing system, which works exceptionally well for higher education
default,
default for apprenticeships and traineeships. That would be my ideal if I had a magic wand and I could make a difference tomorrow
default: o
defaultne place where you could get good quality advice
default,
default where businesses or young people could go and could connect easily. At the minute that is not there. There is the National Career
defaults
default Service, which is relatively young
default and 
defaultwhich could morph and develop into that type of service, but I am not sure the 
defaultG
defaultovernment resources are there to fund that. I am with Peter in that I would probably redirect some of the resources that have been spent on 
defaultthe 
defaultyouth contract into giving a good solid advice service for young people and small businesses.
defaultLord Brooke of Alverthorpe:default But 
defaultin 
defaultsome of the successful countries in 
defaultEurope
default one finds that the employers put more cash into it and it is not simply left to the public.
defaultThe Chairman:default That was a question 
defaultthat 
defaultwe were going to ask
default: 
defaultdo you think 
defaultthat 
defaultemployers in the 
defaultUK
default can learn from the models in other countries? I am very conscious of the fact that we are going to have 
defaulta 
defaultjangling bell in our ears very shortly, so I was just wondering if you had ideas on the answer to that question
default. C
defaultould you give some thought to it and write to us?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: Yes, of course.
defaultThe Chairman:default That would be very u
defaultseful. I am sorry but 
defaultwe are up against
default,
default and you have been very unfortunate because we have not 
defaultbeen disturbed by the Division B
defaultell for several months now. Your UCAS idea
default: 
defaultdoes such a thing exist in other countries?
defaultDr Kyledefault: Not that I know of.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I think 
defaultthat 
defaultthe system starts a lot earlier in connecting the young person/employer in 
defaultSwitzerland
default and 
defaultGermany
default from the age of 14. The UCAS system is probably a bit redundant
default, because locally, 
defaultregionally and nationally there is much more integration of education and employment, and the vocational path is much stronger. I think we a
defaultre starting to see it in the 
defaultUK
default, 
defaultbut I do not think 
defaultan 
defaultequivalent exists that I am aware of.
defaultQ108 default&#xa0; 
defaultThe Chairman:default Also, 
defaultas 
defaultan observation, we have not discussed this as a Committee before, but I was just talking
default 
defaultto 
defaultmy
default friends about issues 
defaultsuch as 
defaultthis and unemployment
default, as one does, 
defaultand particularly about mess-ups and IT projects and 
defaultwhether 
defaultanybody 
defaultis 
defaultcomputer literate. We all know how to switch them on, we know how to do Microsoft Word, we know a few more things, but somebody
default who employs
default 
defaulta group of about 50
default very high-
defaultlevel people in the City 
defaultand who 
defaulthas done the appraisal system
default, asked
default them
default, “
defaultHave you any idea of where you would like your competencies enhanced? In other words, is there any
default course or whatever that
default you would like us to send you
default on
default?”
default.
default Of the 50 people, 45 of them suggested an increase in the knowledge of IT skills. These are people who are so IT aware
default,
default one would have thought, but the problem is 
defaultthat 
defaulttechnology is going ahead of everybody. 
defaultMy question comes
default back to this
default. These young people 
defaultare so computer literate and can program everything for you, 
defaultso 
defaultwhy is somebody somewhere—nobody ever brings this up
default—not 
defaultcoming up with a fantastic idea to get some of these people
default,
default who know all about playing games and things, on courses
default?
default W
defaultould it not be some great philanthropy for these large organisations to say, “We will produce IT experts or teachers or make courses in a local area for IT”
default?
default Any ideas?
defaultMike Thompsondefault: I would suggest it is not philanthropy
default; i
defaultt is a business necessity.
defaultThe Chairman:default It is.
defaultMike Thompsondefault: If you want to compete in the modern global economy you have people in your business who can work with digital technologies. I think 
defaultthat 
defaultmore and more
default of our apprenticeships
default—100 of our 1,000
default—
defaultare 
defaultin 
defaultIT. 
defaultThe Chairman:default What are your views?
defaultDr Kyledefault: I think I would alter some of the characterisation of the problem. It is very difficult to find young people who sit around playing computer games as opposed to quite actively trying to find work. We spend a lot of time trying to understand this view of youth unemployment. We ran focus groups and consultations 
defaultin the past 
defaultand 
defaultfound 
defaultenormous
default amounts 
defaultof very idealistic, energetic and frustrated energy among young people with lots of talent that they feel is being ignored and underused, which causes frustration.
defaultOn 
defaultthe IT side of things
default,
default obviously young people have inherited skills that previous generations would not have but they are not being harnessed in the right way and focused, which 
defaultgoes 
defaultto my final point about this pathway. We are not intervening early enough. We are not joining up the different agencies
default enough
default. One of the key problems with youth unemployment is that it is not the domain of one departmental o
defaultversight; it is E
defaultducation, it is DWP, it is 
defaultH
defaultealth.
defaultThe Chairman:default Yes, we heard that before.
defaultDr Kyledefault: It crosses
default departments
default, and there is a lot of local government, so you will find some areas of the country that have 15, 18
default separate agencies
default—we found one that had 24 separate agencies in one geographical area
default—
defaultall of whom receiving some degree of statutory funding to tackle different aspects of youth unemployment. If I had my way I would pool the budget of youth unemployment and force every agency to come together and work together to tackle the problem. They would identify individual young people who are unemployed
default,
default and then different agencies would have to come together 
defaultto 
defaultco-ordinate the response and have ownership of those individuals. We have a very disjointed response because it ha
defaults just crept across departments
default. If youth unemployment was a different issue—we have 1 million young people who are unemployed
default—and 
defaultthe young 
defaultunemployed
default 
defaultwere visible
default,
default I think there would be a very co-ordinated, very public response to the problem. Youth unemployment is hidden because it is buried deep within neighbourhoods
default,
default families and homes. I think that makes it quite difficult for people to imagine the solutions for it.
defaultThe Chairman:default We have had that comment before too, which is very scary because you do not know where to find them. Thank you very much. You 
defaulthad 
defaultone minute to go. Are there big gaps in the questions that we asked you that you wish that we had asked you, and if so could you write to us about them and tell us? I will not say 
defaultthat we are 
defaultoperating in the dark, not at all
default, but 
defaultit has been a very steep learning curve
default,
default 
defaultand 
defaultwe want to make this a good report, and we want to make a difference 
defaultto 
defaultyouth unemployment. So 
defaultwe would be delighted to have further evidence from you on 
defaultanything that you can think 
defaultof
default. 
defaultI
defaultn the meantime, thank you very much indeed.
defaultDr Kyledefault: Thank you.
default&#xa0;
default
