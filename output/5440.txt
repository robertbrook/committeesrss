[[[Written evidence submitted by the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) ]]]&#xa0;

[[[Executive summary ]]]&#xa0;NDCS is concerned that Ofsted inspections and its annual report do not sufficiently emphasise the importance of local authority specialist SEN support services for deaf children. &#xa0;A failure to inspect or scrutinise or even comment on these services sends a signal that these services are not important, when many deaf children and their families rely on these services to achieve good outcomes. &#xa0;

[[[Introduction ]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;

[[[Ensuring specialist SEN support services for children are fit for purpose]]]&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“There was limited strategic overview and no systematic approach across all services to evaluate the quality of services and their impact on improving the lives of deaf children.”&#xa0;&#xa0;
